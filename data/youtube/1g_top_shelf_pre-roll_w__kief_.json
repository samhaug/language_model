{"zZ1-HZXeaVY": "what's going on guys my name is Jeff also known as popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe I got a lot of lip videos on the way like today I'm gonna be smoking this pre-roll from Lux rolls now Lux rolls is a company that sells cones that you can stuff yourself to make these epic ass parade rolls I really like these some people can't roll as well as others so if you want a nice big fat joint for a special occasion sometimes it's hard to do so this company literally allows you to make a cone like the raw cones but these ones are way more bougie they come in these nice little tubes so they have one that looks like a hundred dollar bill they have even fatter ones then they have the classic cannon which is the one that we're gonna be smoking today personally this is my favorite size out of all the ones they make I really like that it comes with a wood tip I really like just the amount of wheat that fits in it it's about 3 grams maybe 4 I didn't actually scale it out but without further ado I said you spark this up [Music] I put live breath and keep on the outside of it oh yeah that keep his burden I really love the size of these joints bed they are [ __ ] huge so on the video where I cut open a $50 pre-roll I said that I could make one myself for less money and a couple of you guys told me to do it so that's what I'm doing in this video I stuffed Durbin poison flour in this joint there's sour tangi live resin coated on the outside and then I rolled that Keef we keep this bird away faster than the actual bug but I'm not too concerned as of now the Durbin poison flower that I put in here was gifted to me by my buddy he grew it himself and like I'm really picky about weed but I gotta say this dude's Durbin poison was like out of this world I truly appreciate it you know who you are bro thank you very much free weed is always the best weed especially when it's good [Music] I got a radio this very second guys like I said in the pre-roll video I think it concentrates and Keith belong on the inside of the joint but I wanted to actually recreate that $50 role so that's why I put it on the outside it's definitely wasteful like there's way more smoke coming out of this and a normal joint and that smoke that could be going in your lungs let me show you a little close to finish you can see the oil actually melting down I put it decent amount of live resin on the outside of this whoo it's just got me shaking dude this is the first day of smoke today I'm lit oh my god guys this thing is ripping so hard for those of you guys who don't follow me on snapchat you probably don't know I just had surgery on my nose I had a deviated septum so basically I couldn't breathe well through it so for the last week I've just been recovering and man holy [ __ ] like my collar ins went down so much good I didn't smoke normally I don't take tolerance breaks but in the situation I was like bucket let me just not really smoke a like one edible one day but ultimately my collar ins went down with a block time dude the flavor oh this is so good the sour tangi library is mixed with the Durbin poison it's just a super [ __ ] fruity medley of deliciousness when the key that's a nice touch to my Keef is like all PA dispensary medical weed Keef so it's like some delicious fire beautiful Keef this is definitely better than the pre-roll in the $50.00 pre-roll video just because I know the weed was fresher the oil was live resin not co2 oil and the kief was definitely like better keep a lot of the dispensary chief I just know it's just shitty Keef that's why it's so cheap versus like when you actually get Keef from your weed and your grinder like there's no Keef better than homemade Keef [ __ ] yo oh okay you hit guys your turn ritual toks I'm so glad to be boomer the surgery and pretty much recovered with a deviated septum I couldn't really breathe well through my nose it was like breathing through a coffee straw instead of like a McDonald's straw if I was congested at all I just like naturally could not breathe so I got the procedure it's a septoplasty and annoyed ectomy I honestly don't even really know what the procedure is like I just was like cooled up do what you got to do but now that that process is over I'm back to smoking and I not gonna lie guys I missed it like there's no withdrawal really from not smoking for me like the worst thing is like I can't sleep well that's like really the biggest issue with me when I don't smoke I am totally not too profitable and able to sleep like I smoke so much I should date myself basically by the end of the night I remember my entire childhood growing up I would never be able to fall asleep when it was bedtime like I would always land that for an hour - just trying to fall asleep I think that's why I started to like weed when I started smoking it so I was like oh my first time smoking weed I got so [ __ ] stoned you guys like mids and heads was like the two options back then and like people around me all smoked mids but for whatever reason this day that I decided to agree with these guys they had heads and before we didn't get back to the skatepark I am so [ __ ] stoned like I remember getting out of the car and walking back to the skate park and being like holy [ __ ] I've never experienced anything like this like I was just giggling colors were more vibrant and I just like everything was just funny and I was like in love with the feeling but what my mom picked me up and I got back home I remember I literally fell asleep in our living room like half on the Ottoman half on the couch and like my stomach was just like in like the open air between it like it literally was just like based out of sleep for some reason they just thought it had like a long day at the skate park and didn't say anything about it but how the stones [ __ ] once I got past the keep you guys and the oil it has just had a really nice slow even burn you see that notice bro can do French inhales all day now no problem buy one of these for yourself and just stuffing it with weed is so much cheaper than buying pre-rolls from the dispensary and then you know it's actually inside it even if the pre-roll is out the dispensaries were recently priced usually there's just [ __ ] mids in there so it's nice being able to stuff your own fire weed in there and there's only being like thirty bucks instead of fifty dollars to 100 bucks but seriously if you think about it this cone was like two bucks say an eight the weed is like $25 I maybe put like ten dollars worth of live resin on it which is really really stretching it so we're at like 35 bucks and then like keep this free but let's say five bucks forty dollars for something that is literally twice the size and twice the experience of what that $50 pre-roll was not in California not trying to be a hater on pre-rolls I just like I always would smoke them and I'd be like these are kind of shitty and now that I've like broken a couple it open did the science I'm just like yeah welcome I'd rather stuff my own getting rough I love the wood tip though you can just rip the [ __ ] out of it and it has that black and milds okay green and spicy vibe to it and I just like it so much more I forgot to actually have this one though this is probably their coolest kit they got they put you down for a second it comes with two in one two he comes with this giant cannon I think I felt like five grams and the last one I put in this and then it comes with another one tip cone pretty much like the one I'm smoking right now let me know if you want to see another mini of me doing something like this with these also I'm going to Colorado so you guys so expect a couple more Colorado videos coming up let me know if there's any products you want me to check out while I'm out there or if there's any strain specifically you want me to pick up or any companies you want me to try one thing I do definitely want to find is some like sauce cartridges or just some sort of cartridges with some crazy consistencies because I know there's a lot out there okay I'm so done I definitely just [ __ ] my day up especially now that I just don't really have a good tolerance getting towards the end here you guys hope you guys enjoyed this video click

smell good I'm just kidding we're gonna cut it open come on I'm gonna bring the camera closer let's see what's really in here and that top-shelf pre-roll let's slice it open here see what we got inside looking like a nice light green color like some good-looking bud so so far so good so the sight test it's looking decent smell test I'm not smelling a whole lot right now a little bit here so sites looking pretty good smell let's double check that decent I mean it might be sitting for a while let me see if I can change the angle here actually giving you a little something better to look at this might not be the best angle so I'm gonna get my phone here and see if we can make it look a little better cell phone looking a lot better we can see that nice green color and see some of that shatter and there little dots I wonder how much exactly was in there looks good smells decent so past those two tests now let's do the most important the taste test tastes pretty good it doesn't taste some of the best flour I've had like that fresh flavor this might have been sitting for a little while doesn't taste that amazing I figured with the infusion it would taste a little better so the taste let me down a little bit here so that's that I'm still gonna smoke this [ __ ] also dropping some really cool merch if you want to show true buds TV a little love grab a tank top hoodie shirt

another product review video before we get started popping so let's do our little thing that we call SML we need you to subscribe and while you're there I need you to hit that notification bell and also just like me because I'm pop mom and you guys already love me anyway so make sure you're going in that love but Ananya to guys today I know have been one like a total hiatus but maybe about a week or two now just because of the holiday break so I appreciate you guys hanging in there making sure you go to my videos as soon as they drop on leave Wednesdays I appreciate it I came back with something bigger this week guys I have Peck woods not to be confused with back woods this is tactless this is packwood's dot la is out of Los Angeles and I am so excited so be the proud owner of three of them I have all three pack words from LA they're now at planted 13 so you can get packwood's in nevada now at planted 13 so shout out to shot planted 13 that always hook me up with the latest that comes out I got all of these and Nevada from them they have an exclusive one called alien og so I'm excited I have all three so what I want to do today is just do a simple product review with you guys I will include all the links to Packwood's la comm so you guys can go in a site find out with new strands that they're coming up with but I'm just excited about the company so what they have done is infused rolling papers that look like blood papers and they're not they're a handmade hemp wrap paper that they put a vein into it to make it look like it was like an actual plant wrapper this guy's is special because they did three different infuse menteur this they have a concentrate in it they have a premium flower and then on outside they dust it with Keith so I don't even know how strong this is gonna be I don't I don't know how many puffs I'm gonna be able to get all I know is I'm gonna be a little out so I don't want you to judge me but we're gonna get into this I have three brands here this one is the alien OG hopefully you can see that this one is exclusive to Planet 13 once again shout out to them they are sold out maybe out of this one you guys have to call them and see this one is called GABA and this is a hybrid so is the alien og so both of these are hyper some remember hybrids want to keep you nice in the middle that way you can feel the head body high but not too high now this one the purple one is called purple punch and this one is an indica so today I'm not going to smoke Invicta I'm also not gonna smoke this particular hybrid Agathe I'm gonna go for the alien og because I am an alien and I want to get a shot off the plane 213 because this one was exclusive you might not see this one on the market I'm not sure so I wanted to kind of give my review to them as well what I thought of the one they made just for planting 13 customers so we're gonna get into this I'm gonna remove these two to the side so first of all I'm going to just talk about the packaging because you my peeps know when I do a product review I go there I go all the way there first of all I love that this can't break I do know they're going for $60 at the shop so they have $60 here in Nevada we can look up and see what they're going for Vegas but this is $60 so for $60 to Graham would concentrate premium flower and they keep one outside that does an amazing deal and I love that you can't break anything so you don't have to silver fragile because I mean your product is fragile but I love the date took the time to kind of like really design it where it's eye-catching as well and even if you see it inside of this place like it's playing 13 they have done the displays so beautifully so shout out to the pack was marketing team in LA y'all did that it also kind of reminds me in a weird way of a Kylie lipstick if y'all agree with me pop peeps just tell me that in the comment it really does it has that whole trippin thing on the side so this is really a good packaging I I'm impressed with packaging didn't even think that so you just roll it off it's a roll and I hope my camera can get to this so let me come up I want you guys to really see that when you first pull it out and you can really smell it the scent on this is I just love the smell okay so if you can see them holding my hand up you can see the key fits nicely dusted on it outside this part of it is a glass tip so it's gonna allow you to like kind of burn it evenly so you get a nice draw every time you pull that's what the glass tip is supposed to doing this is a nice sized glass citize I would say that's a couple of inches I don't know if you can see that real close up but that's like a two inch glass that's really nice to me it feels like if you had a mini cigar in a way so I kind of I love the feel of it it's nothing to it but to do it we're gonna get into it anything I like that's a blunt or the palm rolls or anything like that I like to light mines with the hemp I know this is a little piece of this is hemp rope I like to light it with that that way it gives me some type of control instead of letting my lighter control everything so that's how I'm gonna do it so choose the you pot peeps shot the Packwood's LA and let's get this alien og from shot planted 13 let's I like to inhale just to make sure I'm pulling everything I must say lighting getting I thought the pool would be happy they go be a lot heavier and it's not it's really smooth and I guess it has something to do with the glass tip now I can tell if you can tell I lit it wrong in here but it should have a nice even lip and because that keep us on the outside it shouldn't burn through fast that's what it shouldn't do if you find yourself in you lit it the wrong way just let it take its time and let they kind of like let it breathe and it'll evenly start to burn around so what I like is that you don't have to put the whole piece in your mouth it burns real light you can just put your mouth right on a tip just like my shirt be on the lookout for shop pop mom for 20 years oh I got that weed weird I like this a little dude not sure what premium flower I do know that the concentrate is nice and to keep this not even coming off on my hand I love that so let's talk a little more in depth about this back once I got my smoking hat on you know I've seen Rick Ross smoked this I've seen you waka flocka the baby little baby what's that other baby skittles baby I don't know one of them other babies they've all had this and now I'm hot moms at it I gotta do this I need a friend shout out to any of my papi friends that want to come share cuz I don't know if I'm gonna finish this this is this is a lot I might have this for the next couple days it's two grounds one person should have to finish this off seriously what did you say when you hi you just don't know what to say I guess you say that [ __ ] was good huh no I hate that y'all see me like this cuz I'm gonna be rolling I don't even know me get anything else doing this is too much this is probably not the best product reveiw to have done I'm super afraid of my life right now but this is nice you know what this would be great for like people that are having bachelor parties or bachelorette parties New Year's Christmas you can get them the people if you live in a legal state oh I can't move to this come to the East Coast Jesus [Music] Oh also Packwood's shout-out to y'all have made a collaboration with cocoanuts which some of the celebrities have teamed up to make these into like chocolate edibles kind of thing so check out backwoods la calm because they got a lot of interesting collaborations like they did a collaboration with planted 13 they're doing it with celebrities so shout out to them definitely gonna go to pack once when I go to LA cuz this is pretty cool in the light so stoned and how many puffs that I take I don't even know if somebody keep it count I wish somebody was here to play this is what they do to me pop beats they just leave me in a room with filming and just tell me to go for my own okay I'm really high seriously you don't think it too high he's just like alright I'm over it I'm like hi okay I think I hit this at least maybe 10 times which is extreme okay this is my review of a Little J first of all I'm high I'm really high and I just don't even know this hormone right now seriously I don't even I don't even know what to say I mean for once I am truly I think it's strong I for what a high grade us I feel like my body is just like somebody else came and took off really nice somebody named Adele a no Gina so somebody can come take over your body if you did a little G because I don't feel I don't know oh I probably wish I had a friend this year went that way I can have somebody to give me feedback and I know Papeete y'all wish to do that but you're not here right right here matter of fact you try it exactly it's like a calming effect but you just feel like hmm maybe I should take it slow like I feel like I can do things but I should probably take it slow I feel like if you were sharing with this this was someone you don't have to worry about them soggy enough to tip its glass so it's really like one stay sturdy you're not sometimes you you roll a blunt and then they get all saggy at the tip of it and you gotta pull it back together they've already solved that issue so this is a great cheerful I would suggest you buy it this holiday season share it with your friends you can put it out as you see I'm probably one hit just another day so this is definitely a two day if you buy yourself this is a two day situation it's no way this is no way it's just no way like I'm cool put old day I feel great about this situation would I buy it hell yeah yeah I like the

bit of controversy on the field of lyrics from my song top down off the lg bomb let me break it down for y'all cookie fan provided the genetics for biscotti and gushers alright not only that I hand selected smoke through many bags to find those to fee knows the group gave me the fee knows I went through them all I found him and when I found him I named him and biscotti and I named gushers not only did I select them and name them I went on a worldwide campaign with the [ __ ] and popped it off I rapped about it in my songs I brought it to the artists to athletes to the elite smokers and you know influences in the world I was repping biscotti so hard I almost named and Scott Storch is my witness the big pescado biscotti like literally almost named to my album biscotti and I rapped about it in so many songs and trust me I really campaigned hard Frodo's and on transe is this without getting into too much detail this doesn't even matter I'm in a good point in my life if I put in all that work and all that effort to hand select to name to blow this [ __ ] up globally everybody knows about biscotti because of me and I'm not no longer participating in that and I can't grow myself and I have it and I can't use the names for anything then why would I [ __ ] with it why would I smoke it and it's nothing personal to the group hey man do you guys do your thing it's just what I mow and people have to respect it because I'm not putting in work to that I don't benefit off I've been I've been grinding for too long in a Wii game is the Wii game and business is business and like I said no disrespect to them boys do your thing mate flex on them as much as you can but I ain't [ __ ] with it now with that being said Gary Payton serial mo yeah chopped liver the floor London cello

some powers up from cookies big menus coming new flavor profiles coming all work is all worked a new work that's the new work so the same way we ran it up you don't run it up again cookies now one more thing purple punch look no disrespect to the breeders a purple punch to the growers of purple punch what's going on in California right now is a bunch of people are growing it they're packaging it on the REC market and then renaming it a hundred different things and after buying 15 different styles of weed named all kind of names and all being a purple punch it was played out to me I said but punches so Blanc you can have it now some of my friends go purple punch some of my friends actually bred purple punch no disrespect to you but do we get got somebody I see Packers up 30 different ways mm-hmm keep it", "whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're

now don't get me wrong these are the pre rolls that I have don't get me wrong I have something pretty well before but I personally have never owned one like I've never hey let me go get a pre-roll let me go cough a pre-roll you got rules no I'm not doing that I've always had trust issues with pre rules but I don't know what's really inside of it and I don't know who ruled it yeah so I got my two free pre-rolls last night at I aim weed pop-up shop if anybody doesn't know or if anybody lives in New York hit me up cuz homegirl got connections they're always underground we'd pop-up events that happen and it's basically a party where you could just go shop for [ __ ] weed you know you get all the exotic things that you've never heard for and never like really get around your neighborhood things of that nature you get to get that you get to get edibles food good music like accessories things of that nature like I got this rolling train oh it's all dirty I had this rolling train from one of the events that I did go to so yeah so I have to here I got this from the entry as you can see it's a little loose they were kind of being whatever and then I got this with the purchase of the bud that I've got from a table so I've already smoked the bud that it's already enrolled in this one and this is a mystery weed so hopefully all those will lighten refocus let's party let's party let's party my god I'm so yellow okay there we go a spark joy oh this is cute they even did a little a perfect em can we get that and focus I can't I can't get it in focus there's a perfect um there's a little piece of weed at the bottom but I like who did this voltar [Music] okay this is smoking good this is tasting good so far is good but um last night I'm at a good time going to the event kind of sad that I should go by myself actually a couple my friends my friends like mean I don't want to go me I'm me I'm like [ __ ] I'm going so I went I got me a couple Apes as I told you or we got me two free pre rolls and I got edibles so I'm going to edible first these are there you like these are the thickest edibles I've seen like and I got three for 25 I ate half of one last night yeah quick story so when I went to go buy the edibles last night at the table the couple that was there was nice enough to let me try their THC infused food so they had rice and like a car you chicken I'm not going to pass up free food so I thank you very much so that [ __ ] was my hit spot I'm gonna just say that it is by tasting wise it didn't taste that great but it sure enough got me smacked I give him that so moving on to the fuzz they don't die I got three different bugs as you can see I got two from the same table present both wicked green and then one from a different table boom so I got sugar cookie purple pie and apple fritters I'm gonna insert a video clip of it Oh sugar cookie was definitely a fan favorite of the ladies last night so that's why the vendor recommended it to me and that's what's in the second panel oh yeah it's really sweet smelling like it smells legit like sugar like candy and then we have purple piper if I definitely cooked my I personally pissed I like her I don't know why it's just so pretty so you got the purple part yeah then we got the apple fritter the apple fritter smells the best the best so sugar cookie was definitely a fan favorite profile looks the best and Apple Twitter smells all of them so also the positive thing that happened to me last night at this event was when I went to get the sugar cookie and purple I was only gonna get one I was only gonna get the purple pie but then the guy told me about shooting you something since you mentioned before I deal at your table was like two for something why they bother he's like I can't do two 460 I'm like okay cool so I got an eighth for $10 less just to get another one with a free I feel like a good deal because rather than spend 80 for two days I got anymore and a free pre-roll whoa sounds have you with that kind of made up for the fact that I went by myself but I did the most novice mood ever I didn't have any problem when I waited I don't know what happened like I swear to fall I had papers in my bag or whatever but I had nothing I didn't have papers I had fun so I didn't have a rep I didn't have nothing so as soon as your girl got there you already know I went scavenger mole I would like so where is the photo they pointed me to a table phantom blow me some paan so I kept it push it I found somebody I was rolling up I'm like I gotta look for somebody smoking not finishing

sure know tells me and homegirl huh huh and then we'll make up [Music] yes I did all in all I could have a good time and I wasn't upset about going by myself after the fact that I walked in the door I

here if you guys can't see it I'd be sitting my bed still go a bit [ __ ] so I was chilling on my bed I went to the kitchen I went to go get some [ __ ] like somebody drink or something eat I was checking on something so anyways I had got up off my bed to go to the kitchen so I went to the kitchen came back had my lady in the couch on my bed and I went to take my slipper off so I have put like raised up my right foot and then I tried to kick my slipper off and as I kicked down bra it was all bad as I kicked down my foot caught my email cord bra oh and as you can imagine the worst happen the [ __ ] email came tumbling down the [ __ ] drop down came off the [ __ ] red was on the ground water spilled the after bath of that [ __ ] Oh bad that bucket after bath of that [ __ ] oh the custom girl rig into pieces guys it's in pieces it's in [ __ ] pieces and you know what didn't [ __ ] break this wasn't the downstem that wasn't biscuit that was the drop down that was on it this was the drop down that was on it and it didn't [ __ ] break so this [ __ ] [ __ ] was damn near set up like this in like this right oh [ __ ] me oh it cut me [Music] look that [ __ ] really cut me anyways so this [ __ ] was dammed out here like this like this and [ __ ] he came crashing down off the table boom boom bap this [ __ ] broke this didn't break I wish it did this was only ten dollars this rig came in a daily high club box that was like $35 so in any rate I [ __ ] broke a rig again check this out this this right here is my first ever piece of glass I bought it was if you could see [ __ ] if you can see that [ __ ] just diamond glass this was the first rig I bought I bought this [ __ ] off 420 in San Francisco on Haight Street just because by huh be cool ja needed add a brick to take a dab out of so I was like [ __ ] I mean let me cops up so we can take some dabs she was taking dabs on 420 with my homie cool John that was reason why I bought this piece but then it ended up breaking I didn't break this piece but it ended up breaking and it's just what happens when you have glass man [ __ ] breaks so yeah I'm a little salty that this shit's broken because it was like my best setup that I have for an email and my mom gave me just peace so it was like you know didn't cost me nothing but [ __ ] it lost me everything do you feel me because this it was tight so that's his god broke-ass it sucks this is still going it's burning just fine it's burning like pretty slow for being just one person token on it it's hella nice is burning evenly now that I finally got it going it's [ __ ] blue brah that's just my favorite I wish this was blue but my older brother got it for me his favorite color is red so that's the only reason why we're cuz my brother got it for me for Christmas so shoutouts to my brother you guys think about this area should get along whoo so yeah guys that's what I've been up to just working on the [ __ ] grind making sure my finger don't bleed out just been working you feel me putting these videos out let me know if you guys like this style here or if you like it over there where I sit on a couch I'm on the other side of the couch and this

the disc of dankness and there's this item left it's hawaii heartbreak free roll by riff so let's shuffle this up and give it a spin and collect this pre-roll oh my god what a surprise it's riff white heartbreak pre-roll [Applause] so here's riff hawaii heartbreak pre-roll um at uh what what percent is this 17 oh yeah 17.87 percent or 178.77 milligrams thc and what size is this one by one g so this is a one gram um pre-roll apparently i guess uh what's the package date here is there one oh yeah there's one january 28 2020. so there we go yep one times one gram dried cannabis pre-roll yeah i've never tried one of these before i don't smoke cannabis anymore i use vaporizers now i get a couple vaporizers but um yeah i thought it'd be interesting just to check this out because i used to love rolling dubs used to roll tons of dubs but now anyways um i was just curious i was always wondering a friend gave this to me so i thought you know what i'm just gonna save for uh opening up with you guys and we'll check it out together here so yeah and we can weigh it too we can check all kinds of things out all right so it comes in a little tube here which is then also wrapped in plastic so even more garbage let's see what do we got inside here uh open up oh you gotta press what squeeze below cap oh my goodness look at that hey look in there there it is it's hiding there we go you know that seems like an all right roll this is a fucking huge filter though oh shit that's a massive filter uh when i used to roll like when where i'm from we roll joints like your filter you built like that that amount of space maybe even like that don't go like that or like this but anyways oh that smells real nice wow mmm that smells really nice that does smell nice my my let's check the scale this is supposed to be one gram and i'm assuming they're not counting the paper and the filter that would suck if they were cuz someone you want here's a 50.00 gram weight we're checking nice and accurate there so see how much does the whole thing weigh hey 1.34 that's uh good one point that's good good okay well there we go now i'm not gonna smoke this but you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna bust it open we're gonna take a look at what the hell they put inside of here because i was always wondering what does the quality of the stuff in here look like i know it smells nice so i have my uh my little bowl here it's all calibrated it's zeroed out so i think maybe we'll just tear the paper and i'll dump it into here and we can check the uh the weight right yes here it goes come on riff hey hey slightly over that's all right that's a good sign that's what you want now let's see look how it's broken up there looks like a nice grind looks decent let's check it out with the microscope i guess i don't know there's the pre-roll the inside of the pre-roll it seemed like a good roll you actually did so it's cool okay we've got to zoom in here with um a microscope check it in oh hey right there that so here we are checking it out up close with the microscope everything's all ground up here oh a little bit of purple looks like got a purple section um yeah lots of trichomes they're the kind of chunky ones there where there's a bunch of like little clusters of cloudy trichomes that's for um quality the stuff inside you know you can't really tell all that much from stuff that's ground up right because it's it's hard to tell i can definitely see chunks of trichomes though they got the big chunky kind there it reminds me a bit of the stuff you see on like a lot of the ultra sour they got the same sort of colors usually whoa oh oh oh oh what did we find we found something what is this looks like a string some kind of thread i'm not talking about the pink thing there i'm talking about the blue thing right in the center do you see that a little microfiber there a little microfiber see look at that we zoomed right in on it you can see it there it is little piece of some shit there some sort of thing a string maybe thread i don't know anyways though i suppose it's not so bad if you find just one anyways you know what best way to tell with this because it's all busted up i gotta go try this in the vaporizer so i'll be back so i just got in from this uh riff hawaii heartbreak pre-roll that i busted up and vaped some of it's a one gram pre-roll um yeah it's good stuff i like it i don't think i liked it this much the last time i got hawaii heartbreak i actually do like it it's um it's a nice kind of let's see where would i put this maybe somewhere maybe a step up from medium but not not at the top you know what i mean so it's pretty good the taste is um i i don't know how to describe this taste there is nice flavor here though i don't know how to describe it i guess you could say the taste is kind of like well it reminds me a bit of like dirt but like the cleanest dirt i've ever tasted so clean if i can taste remnants of the cleaning products that was used to clean it i don't know if that makes sense but that's kind of a feeling i get from the taste i like it though it's not a bad thing it's a good way though it's like the good version of that taste and uh i like it it's very nice so obviously i didn't go out for the entire thing right because if you buy this this comes as a whole gram right so i could probably go for let's see here i could probably do two and at least two more bowls in the packs on this so if you were to buy this this would definitely get you pretty cooked i would say because you probably even smoked the whole thing right um but you know when i go out i always fill up every single time just so i have like a standard i always use one bowl in the packs i fill it right up or whatever so that way each time i'm always testing the exact same amount and that way it's kind of like a standard so i can sort of compare things so yeah this is good stuff i like it very nice um i was better than i was expecting which is cool so yeah so is it worth the price though i don't know that's kind of that's kind of where i don't know because you can buy one gram of this on its own for ten dollars and this is like just under 13. sorry it's just over 12 12 28 so 12 28 versus 10 10 and so that's like two dollars and eighteen cents for them to roll it so that's like you're standing there you buy weed then you give someone two dollars and eighteen cents to roll and then they give it to you and take it so that's really what you're paying for i guess but this is um this is good stuff this makes me like hawaii heartbreak more so i might i might try another of those sometime i don't know who knows anyways that's it for the uh disc of dankness so i have no idea what's coming up next i guess we'll see anyways if you also want to see hit the subscribe button and um click on the bell and then it'll tell you when the next video comes up because there is more coming i just don't know what to do yet but i do have some more stuff so anyways have a good one you guys we'll see you later", "4d9TgN341Gw": "hey guys it's Florida MJ 4:20 here and today I'm going to show you how to roll your own cone joints at home so what you will need is some paper pair of scissors some cardboard tip material 1.25 papers you could use other size papers I guess but I use 1.25 s you need a pen and some masking tape so the first thing you're gonna need to do is make the mold for the that you're gonna need to make your cones so take the tip of the pen and get this so that it starts curling like that and then take your finger and roll it this part can be kind of difficult to get going stick with it so what you want to do is keep this end right here small and keep the whole thing in general not getting too fat unless you want really really fat cones of course you know however whatever shape this is in at the end is how your cone is gonna be shaped so really I guess you could make it all kinds of shapes if you want to that would be kind of cool to make a really big fat cone huh so and I'm sure everybody's done this in kindergarten rolling up some paper like this and I probably should have done this beforehand but you take your masking tape a little piece off yay I can do this all righty that's pretty cool now if I can find the end of this thing there it is right there just tape this right here and there you have the mold for your cone joints pretty cool huh all right imagine if we had paper is that big huh now we can set the tape aside and for the next part you got to get out your paper this part is pretty darn simple just kind of want to line this up at the bottom here so it lines up at the bottom of this form and just roll that sucker up and make sure you wet it before you let go so you get the paper to stick there you have the paper part of your cone take off one of your little deals here and get the pen part out of the middle right the ink part and you take this you can use other stuff too like a small screwdriver you just want to get this part started so it doesn't crease you know if you use the cardboard out of these they're a lot more likely to crease so using a tool like this really helps get this whole thing bent like that and now you want to take a look at your paper it's only about that big so you're not gonna need the whole thing down there what is it we all right now you take the filter cardboard and notice how this isn't even that's good that's okay because this isn't even either this is on a perfect cylinder you slide that down there stuff it down with the pin and you're almost good to go now this part this part right here there's a little bit easier if you have something like that has a screwdriver like and so you basically you just want to tighten that up down there and all you have to do is stick this down there and turn it like a screwdriver against the edges and it's this one's actually counterclockwise but you'll get the point so and you just want to turn it sideways like a screw until it's tight up against the edges so now we have our cone paper voila very cool huh and so you can change the size of your cone by where you roll it on here too you don't have to roll a completely different sized one but you can you can roll them fatter than this you know your form you can roll them skinnier you know however you want to really let's get some wheat ground up since I'm not really reviewing a strain today I'll just use my grinder get out some of the 27.4 7% evany and ivory I got in $125 an ounce sale stuff is pretty good it's got a little seeds on it but what are you gonna do right it's a good deal get this all ground up all right you might have gotten enough in there might need a little bit more and I forgot one thing that'll make it easier so I'll be right back all right now I'm back I think we will need more than this for a little bit more in the grinder oh it's all gunked up in there dang it is a sticky string got lots of trichomes on it those have a lot of seeds though a medical this is just powdered now all right I'll show you the seeds I got so here's I'm not done with those ounces yet but these are probably about three-quarters of the seeds I've gotten a lot of them were chopped up while I was cutting up the weed another thing you can use is a funnel you can stick it in the end of the cone paper and it'll make it packing a little easier I usually don't use it but you know there's the option if you want it so they'll get this thing packed up you just want to make sure that when you're packing the cone joint that you pack it as you go don't pack a whole bunch in there and then pack it down that is gonna cause your joint to run like crazy believe me or another thing that that causes is for your joint just to completely go out get that thing fully packed keep tamping it down as you go and actually one thing I'll show you the best way to do this it's a little bit more difficult is to actually put the paper on backwards I'll show you about that well yeah so that's a nice little personal conjoint here not a big ol fatty but if you want to you just roll your paper higher up on here and it's a fatter cone automatically I'll demonstrate it for you after I get this one packed this is going to be a nice postpone for me 27.4 7% and it shows to lots of trichomes covering this bad boy let's see when you get to the end just kind of cup your fingers around it like this and then you can just punch down on it real easy nothing difficult here that's for sure hands are just covered in this stuff all right so here we have it conjoint not sure how much this weighs that is about point nine grams so let's assume that the paper and the cardboard weigh about what point two or something because I only used a very little bit of it so it's like a point seven gram Joey that's pretty good it's packed in there nice and tight draws really well I can feel that now let me just demonstrate for you real quick before I get this choked up let me demonstrate how if you you lit up higher you get a bigger cone out of it so before I match the bottom here this time I'm not gonna do that I'm gonna roll it further up here you just lick it again same as before here we got the cone and you see how much fatter this one is so there you go if you roll it up even higher you're gonna get an even fatter one and I think it would be funny to make a really fat mold where it's just like boom you can pack yourself some really crazy ones and on these if you just if it has a bigger tip right here you'll just cut off a little bit more of one of these filter papers there we go pretty cool way to save yourself some money this will work well if there's any of those shake deals out there in your area or whatever there you go alright now before I light that join up let me show you how to back roll back roll look hold let me show you how to back roll a cone joint so you take the paper and you see oh here's the sticky side you put it on backwards so we're gonna be doing the sticky side is gonna be outwards so you see this I don't know if you can see that here's the sticky side okay so you take it and roll it like normal except that you get it into place like this and then you moisten it before you roll it up and now you just roll it and continue to moisten it as you go okay and so you're rolling rolling rolling rolling now it's rolled on there and it's stuck together right and you have all this extra paper hanging off what do you do what do you do indeed you find my lighter and I'll show you what to do you take it and you light it I went ahead and looked it one more time just to make sure that it's sealed before I do this let's say you take the lighter you just catch it on fire and let it burn hold it up so it doesn't really burn there you go and now you have a back rolled cone here right now what is the advantage of this well it's not a well okay first of all there's a lot less paper on this on a back roll but the other advantage is specifically for cone joints if you look in here you see how there's that paper right here this is a pain in the butt if you're packing a cone joint if you look in the middle sorry these are really delicate until you get that cardboard in and if you look down the middle of these they don't have anything in the middle so they're really easy to pack so that's why you would do a back roll cone joint very cool huh they're a little bit more delicate they're gonna have a way better flavor though because you're just cutting out that much more paper so well I'm about way better but you know they're gonna have a better flavor alright so let's get this lit and toked up no I'm definitely ready for it it's raining cats and dogs out there right now I'm pretty gloomy Saturday so no I could use the medication that's for sure so this is how you light the cone joint I guess I should have said that you just want to roll it around the end until the whole thing is lit you don't want to inhale the cone joint while the flame is on it because it will make it run like crazy this won't prevent it from running but it discourages running by lighting it even leaf alright there we have a nice DIY cone joy at home see if we can toke it without it running all over the place get all this jakey stuff out of the way those always come in handy huh sure plenty of people have used those at a pinch or two yes that ashtray is not all that interesting really it's burning pretty nicely um flavors pretty darn good as far as today this morning I probably had the most flavorful joint I've ever had it was of citrus farmer and that grapefruit flavor just came right through I mean I got all excited because key relief is I'm gonna sail and then I saw that all their flowers in store only that was a bummer vitae kids have it a sale it doesn't include flower hey these guys need to get with the times there's like half of the patients went straight to flower smokeable flower as soon as it was available I should tell you something so you know we're gonna bind and you don't have that's what I normally use like packs of these papers or I'll show you these cones pre-rolled cones like this it's just convenient but you know if you need to you can make them yourself at home save you a little money or if you're just did a pitcher you go have around party bays there you go never be without your cones woods you also roll my hand I'll have to show you a hand roll come join those aren't as good at least mine are a lot better with that mold there before my guess I don't know what you call it coffee stuff all over the place really feeling the effects of this ebony and ivory Sookie fee you can really tell it's a 20/20 7.47 presented man so uh anybody else out there roll your own cone joints been doing it for a while I actually started out not with doing cones but just for the longest time I would just put filters on my joints man that would be interesting actually if I did an evolution video of my evolution of joint rolling because I have a very distinct evolution of what I've been through you know really crappy crappy hand roll joints you know with no filter anything you could barely talk out of that clog up on end to I would put for a long time I put really small filter tips in for a long time after that I would put in bigger filter tips that I started trying to do cones never really did get big in two blunts but there have been times when I did you know rolling once man oh man as you can see is burning really nicely that's another thing you can make sure that you know there's a lot of complaints of pre-roll of cones running really badly we'll get good and then you don't have to have them roll all right I'll be running good you get good they won't run a lot of it also has to do with the grinder you want a nice even grind people say that it's bad to have a fine grind but it's really not is that bad nope you just gotta pack it correctly I like this a lot this is just a metal dab tool you can probably get it for five or ten bucks at any head shop all right but let me tell you what makes a good packing tool for these things so what makes a good packing tool is it for it to have some diameter to it like this you know it'd be a little bit heavy so that you can let the weight of it do the work so when I'm packing I'm not really pushing too much as much as letting it drop maybe having a little bit of pressure add to it with the fact that this is heavy and metal really helps that the other thing I like is for there to be a smaller tip I'm still a flat end you know I want it to be flat on the end still but a little bit smaller on the tip than it is in the main part because this helps it this packs it down and then if there's gaps in the edges you could turn it around the edges like this and it'll pack around the edges you could also just make another one of these if you're out of everything but paper just make another one of this but roll it so tight that there's not really a hole in the end you can just pinch the end I guess and use that to pack it I think I'm gonna make a video next couple days where I show all the different ways I can roll a joint gonna be cool and there's a lot of people out there just come in to cannabis now that it's legal I think that's really cool I think it's an awesome thing you know there's so many people have been missing out for years and welcome right so I think it's really cool who would people discover something like cannabis it really helps improve their life and can really you know help with problems that otherwise might require harsh drugs or you know have really bad side effects from those drugs and that kind of thing as cannabis you know we've been using that for longest time as a medicine we know pretty much the side effects and stuff nothing too crazy with it I know that cannabis has helped me with my PTSD so much and I only wish that it had been legal earlier because that stigma really really hurt for years I mean if you already have PTSD and you wake up with nightmares and many a paranoia it's just made so much worse when you think that your medicine is gonna make you go to prison you know I mean man I did the mixed messages you know it works you don't makes you feel so much better but everyone in the society tells you how evil it is and you're breaking the law and man that's why I'm just so glad that we have a medical system here in Florida no don't have to feel like a criminal for doing something that's totally fine it's solely wholesome there's nothing wrong with cannabis you know it's like saying there's you know milk is terrible no looks not terrible it's just you just got to use it in moderation not not drink milk at every freakin meal and for snacks and you know same kind of deal oh man sorry you're pretty harsh at the end here see I wonder how much THC that is 192 milligrams it looks like THC very interesting so well guys I think I'm done until there we go roll your own pre-roll conjoint at home well just you rolled it it's not pretty rolled using a few simple things you probably got around your house anyway and there you go so hopefully you can save yourself a little bit money make your own pretty rolls own thank you very much for watching y'all have a good", "ZE78XtwbN1A": "[Music]

my closest friends um and what we have here to start the tools that we have are all sitting on the table we're using another smasher touch for our our rosin extraction we're going to extract 14 grams here of rosin we're going to coat the uh can of gar and a blank de brasil and put a snake on it and we're going to wrap in our thca isolate here and then we're going to drop in rosin droplets throughout the layers of our canagar we're going to start we're going to pack it with four different strains to give it a variety of layers we're going to layer in some diamonds along the way wrap the entire canigar with a hemp wrap at the end and we're gonna put a wood tip on it okay so we can enjoy it it takes about two ounces of flour to make this canagar i guess it'll last for about three uh three and a half hours get 25 to 40 people about as high as you ever want to get and a great conversation piece so stay tuned and follow along all right guys so to make this canogar what we have here is we have a parchment paper uh nug smasher dab tool we're gonna extract uh seven grams at a time in a 37 micron gram bag and that's what we're gonna do first to get this started then we're gonna grind uh each of these up uh with our grinder here and start to pack our kindergarten [Applause] all right very good that's that good make sure that was set right while i packed the bags i'm going to pack the bags bottle text style inverting the bottom corners you can see here as they're overlapping here and i'll get a little smaller yield with the uh using a 37 micron not much but i'll get a super clean product and that's what i'm hopefully after so hopefully the flour is pretty nice pretty fresh [Music] so basically when i pack a bag bottle tech style i want to just pack it even i don't want to be real forceful with the flower i'm not trying to smash the trikes into the into the plant material at all i'm just trying to fill all the voids so that i get a real even extraction and that it maintains that even surface area that i've initially intended for which is a bag that collapses directly down on itself with an accordion-like effect i want to make sure it folds up like that so it's a nice little present you can see how how the bag looks that's one bag again what we're using is 7 gram 37 micron bags for the extraction here that's what i'm packing up [Music] i like to use something like that just so i hook the corners in nice that gives you again your even surface area that is predetermined [Music] [Applause] all right so now we got both our bags packed just gave it a trim there and we slide that in like so once you get one in you can stick the magnet on it holds it up nice you get the other one in you can tuck it down like a little present here and most people don't realize this but you know common sense thing you want to make the last fold the one that's on top that wants to slide in like this [Music] again it's all about holding that surface area and now at this time we're gonna check we're gonna go 700 material psi we got two seven gram bags and 205 degrees [Music] looks like a real nice color real buttery like i'm after oh god it's gorgeous looking though [Music] okay beautiful material [Music] nice smashing touch all right so we got our rosin let's see what it weighs 2.7 grams okay we're starting with the first strain here we're gonna go ahead and grind up the first eighth here [Applause] so this is the base for this canagar it's um it fits in seven grams fits real good in this and that usually if you layer it right and do it right it usually makes for um like i said somewhere two and a half plus to three and a quarter hours of uh good smoke and they'll stay stay going the whole time get everybody high as hell all right so basically what i got is i make a piece of parchment take a piece of parchment and i like to use kirkland parchment from costco and i cut it to about that shape you can see about the size of it and then i i curl it roll it like this and i roll it around the tube that i have this little stainless tube also a straw from a drink straw or a you know one of the yeti cup straws work great but anyway i roll it around that and um stick it in the nug packer and then i make sure that the when it's rolled at the bottom of the parchment's all the way at the bottom the material will stick to the inside of the nut packer so you need this parchment to remain intact all along the way so you got to be careful of that and if it takes you one or two times so it does it takes me one or two times often you know too so just is what it is it's the nature of the beast so i stick the uh the uh hole in there make sure it goes all the way to the bottom and i start packing flour in there i'll go on one side and i'll go back to the next and i like this little card that the nug packer comes with the instruction card for the nug packer to scoop my flower it's real good so it gets it all back you know gathers it back up now you have to be careful in the beginning you can see how that the rod slight slid right through once i start packing it in it won't do that then i like to take a straw once i got a little in there i'll start working it down real gently like i said you want to watch your uh your uh parchment and make sure that your rod's right in the center as you're packing it down and also if you have if your flower's a bit dry you want to make sure that you have a steel water and this will help the flower stick and it'll help it compact all the way through and take your time with it you know work it all the way around and this straw has a little serrated side on one side and then it has a straight flat side on the other but you want to pack the hell out of it you want to be a tight good pack and like i said sometimes it takes two or three times you can take your time with it right so let me see what i got working so far okay so what started to happen here and this is great that's what i want to show you guys what started to happen and often will and people give up on it is the bottom of the parchment started to pack in see it there and it started to compact at the top but the bottom it was all loose so what happened was i put too much flour in in the beginning and i didn't pack it enough in the beginning so we're going to redo this one this is a do-over [Music] all right so it takes a few times to get it right sometimes but what you do it's usually pretty good [Music] [Music] i suggest doing this if you're going to do it with the very best quality flower you can find or grow [Music] okay so we got three more flavors to put in all right flavor too [Music] it's a little morsel here i'm gonna give it a little juice on it [Music] it's thick enough here that we can get that down there won't stick to the stem and cause that some turbulence when we're pulling that out [Music] also i like doing that i wasn't in there too around a little isolate there but it also glues everything together nice once you get your base formed you can be a little you know a little more or less fragile with it as you can tell and things start to go a little faster still don't get too cocky just take your time with it a little at a time pack it in thin layers are good [Music] okay now we're almost at the halfway point you know this is the talked about point at this point once you're down this far everybody that's involved has already got a pretty [ __ ] good buzz going so i'd like to put a little zingers in here and there and throw a little diamond here and in there and just drop it right in keep packing away [Music] like i said you'll fit right at seven grams compact a little more eight nine you can get [Music] we're gonna go to start we're starting to go to some of our fruity flavors because that's how i like to engineer my candy go [Music] okay so at this point i'm gonna add a little more of the rosin droplet in there with a bath and thca [Music] fish it down layered up it's like baking a layered cake you know [Music] exciting isn't it [Music] okay now we're headed to strain number [Music] four labor four baby [Music] it's right between that one i like to drop a couple diamonds [Music] all right that's our last flavor going in the top here [Music] [Music] so yeah this might take you 20 minutes or so but it's well worth it [Music] we're close i think we've got about eight and a half minutes so far [Music] all right so let's see what we got here [Music] guys okay [Music] it's going to be a long snake and then the other is going to be a wrap you can see how brittle it is [Music] you gotta go relatively quick with this because of the consistency of the material being so shattering yeah it's nice to and then once i get it kind of funnel shaped like that that'll wrap nice i'll stick it up where it's kind of warm up here just so it's plow palatable if you will because of the the consistency of the material so you gotta get it warm to work with it so now what we're gonna do is we need long snakes you just gotta kind of work it everybody's got their own secret to this [ __ ] but [Music] [Music] so [Music] okay so i gotta heat it up cool it down heat it up so i like to stick it onto the edge here and then start to roll it [Music] and then when you get it about half rolled like so you a lot of times can take the if you could see that how that that's separated there so a lot of times you can do that and then you like to just you know keep it warm as you're doing it and then kind of roll it up so it's kinking the paper if you will like this again see how it's kinking the paper there and then you can kind of hold this here [Music] pull your rosin off [Music] so now you got your can of gar completely covered in just beautiful top shelf solventless rosin okay now this we're gonna get the rest of this because at this point we're gonna have to put a hemp wrap on this thing to wrap it up and put the tip on it i do like hemp wraps um i don't like to taste the tobacco in this at all the blunt wrap at all but everybody has their own preference now these wraps are kind of um they're fairly dry and to really cure right and hold everything together you need to get them kind of wet so don't be afraid to get these things wet and work the distilled water you have and you know don't soak them in water but get them nice and wet with the sprayer work them in with your fingers you want to make sure your tips on there nice and straight let's start it here you want to work it in take your time with it if anything's not quite wet enough stop and get it wet again that's our first initial seal on there um now obviously i don't like the paper any thicker than this i try to keep it just one layer up here where i'm smoking it but when i get down to the tip you know these these are often handed around to many people so i like to take some straps as you'll see and i'll strengthen the tip up where we're not going to smoke [Music] yeah it smells great i like that little fruity flavors on all these things you know it's just that's a lot i like it that's why i put the fruit at the end so you taste it first off so it gets you warms you up like oh that tastes nice so people that may be otherwise turned off from it or turned on to it so it was like that okay so now what's left is to strengthen this tip here [Music] i might need to use one more like i said i usually use two and a half or so [Music] sometimes [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so that should make it for a real nice smoke so now we're gonna let that that uh the water evaporate and dry let it set up okay now we need to make a snake and we're gonna make a snake uh wrap the snake all the way around it once it's dry and then roll the snake in isolate and then we're going to line the tip with diamonds all right no really easy way to roll a snake with [ __ ] shatter so you gotta use warmth and a lot of parchment [Music] just upright temperature and i'll start moving you like my snakes so far it's more like a worm there we go there we go there we go oh there we go don't stop me now it's still a worm slightly bigger one but i finally got my count okay so let's zero this [Music] 1.2 that's close right about a gram okay [Music] [Applause] so now i got some thca some isolate just gonna get it warm between the plates here so then i'm gonna wrap this in isolate [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] so guys here you go that's the uh that's the kind of guard it's going to last you two and a half to three hours um gonna get 20 to 30 of your closest friends high as hell and uh this is an absolute key to the life of the party enjoy and make sure you smoke daily", "-qZGNpaIWV8": "hey what's good everybody j ping here checking in live respectmyregion.com here with a west coast weed tour review got the homie today can of escapes how's it going everybody and we're going to be reviewing napalm cannabis company the grenade check that out man absolutely incredible um one of the most premium luxurious over the top above and beyond items in the entire cannabis industry this is the flex piece of all flex pieces in the pre-roll category can you guys can you guys zoom in on this real quick i want them i want them to see can you guys zoom in on this real quick check this out oh my gosh so today's item that we have is the blue tommies from uh the grenade xxl infused pre-roll seven grand premium indoor flower one gram live resin lift tickets rolling lift tickets infused rolling paper which is a live resin rolling paper have you ever tried that before it's incredible and then a ceramic tip it says the backpack boys times five points los angeles it's that elite [ __ ] man are you ready you put this in your hand feel the grenade in your hand feel that i've seen these for a while and i i did not think that i was going to smoke one so this is a this is a fun surprise and it's it's been quite a minute since i was actually intimidated by uh getting ready to consume intimidated is the word i do here it's intimidating i hear that from the bud tenders people are a little bit intimidated by the price point but when you talk about luxury items the best of the best the best some of the best flour exotic collaborations look at this grenade it's quite literally a grenade there's a pin there's this handle super cool i don't know if you guys can see this but they're the the uh the little fire emoji emblem that they have is right there on the glass it's it's insane so we're gonna jump right in we're going to keep it keep it consistent with the west coast we tour we're going to hit it once talk about it we're going to hit it twice we're going to give it a 4 out of 10. um you're supposed to smoke this all the way through we are going to put this out after a couple hits after we talk about it uh and then i'll dive in because no most people are gonna put this out unless they are fully prepared to smoke 200 which we might have to do it are you ready yeah all right let's let me let's let's let's get it rolling three and a half grams of flour how do i see you pull the pin you pull this out i don't i didn't pull if you have to pull yeah yeah very easily without the engineering packaging i'd be impressed oh yeah you just twisted them out that's pretty cool okay so we've got this eight gram monster here check this out you guys oh wait lift ticket paper that's it lift it we'll have to look that up wow it's gonna be dope it's gonna be dope i'm pretty excited all right you guys we got the torch i'm gonna massage it out just a little bit i do hear the general feedback is that these canoes so we will have to find out let's dry hit figure out dry head is smooth and creamy uh was there a strain oh the blue tummies all right here we go [Music] we got too much all right here we go nothing yet let's try to just try it with a little bit of a lighter all right so i can tell you right off the bat it's tough to hit the airflow is really good on it though it's not like it's too tight it's nothing to do with that i definitely rips through super nice that ceramic tip that's the nicest mouthpiece on anything i've ever smoked without a doubt it's very easy to rip the flavor is super creamy tiny little bit of gas and i'm getting a tiny little bit of berry like tiny little bits of like blueberry or maybe blackberry or whatever it is i don't know just berries so [ __ ] curious right it's pretty heavy it's large a lot of flavor to it when it comes to the flour again it's the blue tommies you got one gram of live resin the lift ticket infused rolling paper and the ceramic tip super delicious product i'm not sure as to the genetics of the blue tommies i'm not sure on the tripping profile on that i do wish that was included on here um the lift ticket information would love would love to know the stream for the live resin on that but we could probably look this up on their instagram or something um overall i think it's a delicious experience super heavy definitely like you mentioned the weight it's a solid super solid the the branding and the product appeal off the charts um this group napalm with exhibit you know they just really went above and beyond to deliver truly a premium experience kind of redefining the pre-roll category it is a pre-roll joint rolling papers infused rolling papers live resin seven grand premium indoor flower and it rips we did hear rumors of it kind of canoeing on some people at least i've heard that from multiple sources uh but this is honestly smoking pretty much perfectly yeah i'm um i'm actually impressed by how it smokes because that's how you light it though well definitely how you light it's going to control a lot of it but in terms of i thought it would be like an overpowering smoke yeah that it would really hit not harsh no not at all no like it actually i guess delicious the amount of wheat in there does a nice job of filtering the smoke as it comes down yeah absolutely um yeah i think that ceramic tip too super smooth just to just like i wonder what else could you re-roll with the ceramic tip though i think i'm definitely going to keep this running tip i'm going to see if we're able to kind of clean it and reuse it i don't know about my rolling abilities to roll another one i don't think i have it in me to roll any grammar that's for sure that's the i mean for for me with the the packaging i love this because it's that this is the child resistance resistant piece um i'd be curious as to how airtight it is i'm sure it's pretty airtight but you could put weed in here oh yeah definitely reuse it here just to show the people to reuse this as as the stash jar for your weed uh a great grenade glass and you guys can see the flame right there on the front and that's not just like a random jar that they got repurposed they had to get this jar custom-made that's dope that i i'm usually gonna look for for reasons to to dislike packaging for for waste related reasons but this is cool enough to keep so it goes into that category you can do a lot with this not just put weed in it like it's a do you have a tournament or some [ __ ] do you have a score in mind out of 10 for this review because i am extremely impressed with this the price obviously you know it's a product in its own category on the on the category i'm gonna from for my sport it's gonna be relative to other pre-rolls uh and i'm not gonna consider cost because you know when you're when you're getting a piece like that that's getting that [ __ ] piece yeah yeah um and for that reason i'm going to give that a eight eight five eight point five eight point five on it okay i'm surprised myself that i would give it that type of score with again this is without knowing much about the flower but in terms of the harshness of the smoke blue tommy's flower seven grand premium indoor from the backpack boys is that bay area hype [ __ ] right is [Music] i think i think backpack boys are la boys is is bae oh so i'm confusing the two i i might be confusing the two this is let us know we don't know this is that but like no i think i think that that's an la outfit i [ __ ] i'll [ __ ] with it man i think this is some of the best the best i've smoked the lyric hannah gars i've smoked i've smoked 10 of those zero cannagars the biggest of the biggest the ounces the small 12 grammers the small ones the the the seven grammars i believe is what uh the smallest one i think some something like that this is incredible here's here's what i'll say about this so she's probably my my highest cost on a quarterly to perhaps buy monthly occasion i would pay retail for this that's impressive that that's uh for the writing for the right occasion for the right group for the right reason to to celebrate this is a nice piece for that my score out of 10 out of 100 i'll respect my recent website i'm coming in at 9.2 and it's the same issues that i typically have would love to know more about the genetics we'd love to have a terpene profile on there it just really helps to cement the the experience you're about to have as a consumer as a customer we're paying good money for for just weed in general at this point and the consumer we want to know what we're about to experience flavor wise taste wise high wise and i know that can sometimes be a lot to ask for but there's so much going on on this product and there's a nice beautiful empty space in the back of the tag that it would have been huge maybe that's where they put like the sticker in the testing results well but there's two spots one one we could go qr code on there yeah i'm always with a qr code i'm looking at this and you could have they could put a nice insert in here yeah yeah because all that's sitting in there is the is the piece which you don't need to see anyway i mean i couldn't really tell what it looked like until i took it out anyway and i couldn't even add to the allure perhaps this is a free game for dave paul and for any packaging people or branding people creating a surprise when the product comes out that's a nice little uh endorphin rush for the consumer it's going to be memorable for that experience but also to so fill this with information about perhaps the farmer or the medium that it's grown in or the history of the company the people that are involved anything that you can associate to the story yeah yeah yeah i think that's fair too so like i said you know 9.25 for me more information on the story more information on the terpenes and the genetics and to them to me it's a perfect product regardless of the price point i think this is something that i would pay the money that for a couple times a year you know either as gifts or for myself uh i thoroughly enjoy it experience in itself the overall potency of this [ __ ] it's all fire it all tastes really good yeah i would uh i would love to find reasons to to hate on it but as it goes well we'll let you guys do the hating make sure you all type in respectmyregion.com let's go sweet tour me joey j ping here can of escapes we're

__ ] snake skin it's really [ __ ] cool and again merry christmas thank you to all my supporters wouldn't be here without you guys remember keep a smile on your face damn i'm 8 years old you think i'd be here alone i don't think so [Music] whoa oh you could definitely share this all white ash too i wasn't sure how it was gonna be with the uh with the 24 karat gold paper but so far all white ash this [ __ ] is [ __ ] killer let's get a beer open cheers everybody [Music] this is a doink right here so far the flavor is not bad at all the smoothness it's a little it hits you a little bit in the back of the throat with that uh with that live resin and everything in there and plus it is a gmo gmo strong so it does give you a pack of punch that's for sure i'm already getting lit like i said i've never tried the the jeter pre-rolls but i guess i'm gonna have to give them a try cause this bad boy right here is definitely uh worth the price of admission i'm not even a quarter away down the joint i'm already [ __ ] i'm baked i can't i'm pretty [ __ ] stoned already [Music] so definitely whoever bought this got their money's worth plus it went to a good uh it went to a good cause we'll get about halfway down the joint take a couple more hits and i'm gonna give you guys the review of what i really think about this because uh it was pricey it is only one joint but it definitely can get more than one person stone this can easily at least two heads maybe three three heads can can chill with this and get [ __ ] baked it's a nice special occasion joint it is the first joint i've ever smoked that had a gold paper on it i know that they've done it before i've seen other you could actually buy the gold papers [Music] but oh man who do we have last time whoa where'd we go abstract art and today we got who do we got today deadly dudley garbage bro kids classics okay i'm definitely gonna have to give jeters a try this [ __ ] is definitely a winner flavor or price and blue fire dispenser ever got it it was the same price everywhere because it was a limited edition like thing all the proceeds went to you know the [ __ ] i told you about so uh the price it was expensive 81 bucks but it's for a good cause the look is [ __ ] badass look at that that is a [ __ ] gold joint wearing a ring the smell when you first open the container it really does smell really good too the flavor is there but with that live resin sauce that should just makes it you know it tastes all crazy [Music] the smoothness is there but it is a little harsh because all the [ __ ] it's got in here it definitely [ __ ] hits you uh it gives you a hell of a high i'm [ __ ] baked overall for the jeter xl black mamba 2020 lakers championship edition joint i'm giving it the even nine i think it's [ __ ] badass i think it gets you hella lit i i would definitely recommend smoking one of these but you probably are not gonna be able to get one so i'm giving it a nine that's no jive this [ __ ] is solid i like that tip on it it the tip is like it's got a new tip the tip is [ __ ] badass i'm giving it the nine this [ __ ] is [ __ ] mighty fine there really ain't no knock to it it is expensive but other than that it's [ __ ] killer oh let's get this beard out i've been enjoying this joint too much oh merry christmas everybody new year's is around the corner i hope you guys enjoyed this year of my reviews i really enjoyed doing it for you guys thank you again i'm giving this special joint the nine i hope you guys enjoyed it until next time smoking with small town [Music] out", "O9kBd_cleAc": "hey what's good everybody j ping here checking in respectmyregion.com here today to do a quick taste test pre-roll review featuring the hammerhead infused pre-roll a group out of san pedro long beach california uh man we've i'm personally really excited to check this out i've been hearing a lot of great things um we're looking at a product that has quality cannabis in terms of flour there are premium diamonds sprinkled out throughout this blunt i'm sorry throughout this joint there is distillate and on the outside has been coated and then it was coated in keef as well and then they do a strain or botanical natural terpene specific uh kind of um blend i guess i would say depending on the flavor that they're going for and so this is the og uh og kush flavor og kush strain flour and then og natural terpenes and so i'm excited to check it out the packaging is something i'm a big fan of i really like the aquatic underwater vibe the hammerhead the logo is super dope they have the little view here on the box of what's inside the joint testing wise 26.89 on the thc 31.47 on the total cannabinoids so this is definitely potent distributed by sea bright farms so here we go we've got cardboard box plastic dupe tube joint smells good inside oh it is definitely covered in keefe y'all check this out that is one hell of a good looking infused joint right there all right the dry hit is delicious i'm gonna massage it out just a little bit infused joints sometimes can be packed pretty tight and it makes for a troublesome smoke so always important to make sure you come ready with these um premium products all right here we go you guys see the light make sure when you're lighting your joints yo you guys got to be twisting it you want to make sure you get an even burn all the way around the joint there you go and then you got to give it a couple rips and look at that a nice good even burn here i'll show you wow wow this tastes really good so i was telling the hammerhead team like yo you know i try the fuzzies i try the jeters i try all these different you know infused joints that are out there i remember all the infused ones back in seattle big shout out to all the infused companies you know all over doing joints but the fact remains is that keef and distillate makes this a harsher product and so if you have good tasting flour and the diamonds the dusty the terps whatever it is you're adding to it you're infusing it with is that if that can complement your flour then you've got it and from what i'm tasting so far this is complementing everything oh yeah i would smoke these all the time for sure feels like i'm smoking a blunt that i like or a fat ass joint that i rolled myself and then coated myself and then dipped myself i love it this is dope this is dope when i think of a score out of 10 in terms of flavor i think of a 98 99 out of 100 the only thing i don't want in this product is natural terpenes i want cannabis terps if this had some fire og terps from cannabis only in this this [ __ ] would be way more potent than it is but it's already good so i'm going to give it a 98 instead of a 99 just for that reason in terms of the overall score i'm going to give it a 90 a 98 as well because i still want cannabis terps cannabis only everything on this product and this makes it a perfect product this is going to be one of the best products on the entire west coast we tour taste test reviews everything this is just wow wow wow wow nice [ __ ] work hammerhead hell yeah let me know what you guys think if you guys have had the og kush if you had the og hammerhead infused pre-roll in the past please be sure to drop a comment let me know what you think let the other people know what you think uh if you haven't yet let us know when you go buy it let us know if you're in a parking lot chill and watching this considering it i recommend it 10 out of 10 on the recommendation this is dope super duper fire 100 natural paper over here i rest my taste like follow and subscribe to respect my region on all social medias y'all i'll catch you all in the next review i gotta finish smoking this and just enjoy it even the white ash on the top done love you guys peace", "a6-g0RrIYiU": "I was a hearing scholars coming to you with another product review and this time we got a diamond rose by Lyle Peck and what this company is HF raw and uncut has one ground for gelato and then has some sherbert live resin sugar and two hundred sixty nine point six nine pounds of total THC 0 milligrams so see me twenty six point ninety six percent teasing your plant CBD kind of this people and live resin sugar I talked to one of the representatives they're like oh yeah we're gonna use on mugs no trend so yep there's another pre-roll video here as the cultivation day January 4 2019 Dana both of my Istanbul manufacturer type is day six twelve twenty nineteen bears by six twelve twenty twenty so supposedly this has a year life shelf and you're [ __ ] waiting for a year to smoke for complete picture actually goes to waste well no that's skywalks talking in the corner got the scale tonight and for this video I won't be dissecting in the reason why because of a dissected so [ __ ] wax are gonna be listed some of the wax is wrapped all over the front pieces take okay these are not stingy on the Wii smells good no Justin how they look so you get that little flower tastes pretty good to me feel like just a little bit more than the run cuz there was a Grand Prix rope from my shop and yes this one has [ __ ] stems you can see closed stem white streak through the paper you can see the rule still sticking yeah [ __ ] little big [ __ ] to the shop that one and just for money for the sake of listen I'm not gonna put them on better this one brown and this is a diamond fixing its little tad bigger but then again make it a [ __ ] filter the filter is way longer but that's why I put it right tooling there's still just a little bit so they gave me like an extra point that's good that looks a little different with an umlaut pack but I said I'm not gonna dissect it because the wax is all in the paper so I'll be wasting 20 bucks yeah it's right to another phone where we purchase Taylor let's see you all to make so [Applause]", "wEEr_Kw5Elk": "what's up guys welcome back to my channel sorry guys i went ghost on you

that's my fault but trust me there's other videos coming up but uh yeah i literally just just [ __ ] been working working right now but we're doing that work is kind of it's kind of crazy i told them about it like what are you doing at work right now right now man so i work with this uh company called vertical industries right that's the company's name and like they basically do maintenance or a lot of buildings like everything if you need anything done they'll do it well i will do it for them you know but um right now guys like i guess my boss got an offer to set up some cameras and to set up cameras and some like commercial complexes or buildings it's kind of hard because like all that [ __ ] is [ __ ] like you gotta have the height and [ __ ] like all that [ __ ] and brush it's a [ __ ] like literally just trying to put up because we'll be having we have to put pipes for the wire so like they don't get messed up or anything like that but like all that piping [ __ ] like putting wires through them like you got to run four wires or like where however many cameras you got to run them that's crazy so it's like our first time doing it you know and you know we're actually getting somewhere with it and obviously my boss will try to get somebody to come like basically kind of teach us what to do from new york shout out to oh yeah like my boss ended up going to pick up dude from new york and say and like he came to help us he like helped us a lot so we kind of already know like the job he just set up the programming for the computers and all that [ __ ] like it's crazy but yeah yesterday well the day before yesterday was the first time actually putting up a camera like [Music] but yeah i've been really busy so i'll be coming home tired i don't really have time like that but when i do try to pull out the camera i do pull it out so today was like one of those days where i have to put it out because it's my birthday and i'm gonna do some machine i'm not doing so much [ __ ] but you know a lot of [ __ ] is going to happen so not a lot i don't know i'm [ __ ] high already we're gonna do a birthday vlog we're gonna do our birthday party together yeah so that's another video coming soon which is her birthday and my birthday celebrated so like because today is my birthday but i'm not going to celebrate it i wouldn't really do nothing on our birthday we're just doing

let's just wait on that you know but today is a different day so it's going to be a separate vlog chat you know a separate vlog video but yeah guys we're pretty much almost done with this you know i'm saying i'm ending right here just a quick video of us smoking this little what's it called blue moon yeah blue woods which are backwards but yeah guys shout out once again to blue moons you know i'm saying these are fire they gave me heights [ __ ] right now and when you get the chance comment below happy birthday chunky yeah comment down below tell me happy birthday but it's not good but i'll see you guys in the next video [Music] that's why i said hopefully i'm smoking with this but yeah guys thank you guys i'll see you guys in the next video", "50drNINxJr4": "[Music] what is up y'all p2 creeps here and uh we're doing something not too different but something we haven't done in a while just something impromptu off the phone um the last part just that i got which was you know made possible by vin uh we were generously given a few pre-rolls to try out so we've got this terpy's pack of pre-rolls now there's only one left in here and that's because that's all they gave me um yeah we'll try to give the best opinion we can about this herpes pre-roll pack with just one now these come with five normally and it's about 2.5 in this little uh package here so it's pretty close to uh the lucy's that we've seen before on the channel except the lucy's had four and they were in a they were bigger roles and uh it was about three or four grams so it was like four grams so that's a lot more that lucy's are giving you there but uh let's go ahead and see because the thc percentages you know we're working with about like 26 there so um you know pretty good for a pre-roll and i do like that name turpies is really nice um you know excuse me sorry you know that nice turkey flavor oh okay so these are the size of the joints these are very very small dude like um about the length of my thumb almost there not even the length of my thumb but maybe the length of my pinky oh a little bit shorter than my pinky well i do have a long pinky but uh yeah these are a lot smaller than lucy's are i think these are about point five per um yeah i think i think it says per that doesn't have the breakdown um you know for each one but i'm assuming 0.5 because it is just 2.5 grams and there's five of them so yeah without further ado let's go ahead and give this turkeys out you know we'll try this strain is um let's see what is this pacific sun and uh shining silver haze so yeah we've got that uh give me one second guys there's a bunch of noise just gonna let this noise pass through and uh yeah any minute now [Music] i don't know why so many cars just passing by right now it's like a whole little parade okay so let me let the table readjust all right without further ado let's go ahead and give this terpey's pre-roll a try these are this is really small so i'm assuming that this is definitely going to be meant for uh you know those quick those quick time uses um you know if you like like in my lucy's review you know i said you didn't have much time in the day to smoke only a little bit you know that's perfect time for lucy's maybe it's the same deal here with the turpies not not entirely sure um yeah once again give a big shout out to vin thank you for uh making the purchase possible and uh one second here i'm just gonna okay without further ado let's give this a try cheers everybody go hopefully this burns really really evenly you know there's not much in it so i'd hate for it to burn really lopsided not bad on the taste um these are elements which are my favorite papers too so there's another plus there pretty thick smoke so some decent flavor there i'm getting i'm sure this is outdoor i'm like almost positive outdoor this could be [Music] could also be some greenhouse i've had a lot of greenhouse flower from dispensaries taste like this as well but it's definitely not indoors it does it definitely doesn't have that uh the indoor taste once again this is a pacific sun and shining silver haze [Music] the brand here i believe is oh interesting hollister cannabis company never heard of them um no maybe they got a good reputation if any of you guys out there have heard of them please let me know and let me know if there's anything else from them i should try so it's really smooth smoke i'll say and a pretty slow burn so we can pick up here is a nice bit of resin i don't know if you guys can see it clearly here on the camera but there's a nice bit of resin building up there and that's always a good sign when you're getting a pre-roll or just any kind of tree from the dispenser you know you want three main things to look at when you're smoking white ash resin buildup burn time so we can see here ash here it looks it's there's whiteness to it you know it's pretty white but it's not like super white i've seen a lot whiter ash so you know ash here's a little bit darker colored that's not too bad because at least the ash is white but it could be wider i've seen a lot wider ash like i've said before like for example if you guys have seen on the channel's instagram story freddy breeze the homie his organic bro all white ash so you know this is not that bad i believe that for a five pack of these it's only uh 20 bucks 15 bucks i think 20 bucks for two and a half grams is solid i know if this is like 30 bucks i don't know about all that for 30 bucks you get two and a half grams which is less than an eighth you know whole gram less than eight you pretty much pay for uh you know the convenience of it being rolled and um you know for some people they don't like these small roles so for those of you who don't like small roles and you know you only want to buy full eighths this is this terpy stuff is definitely not for you but for the casual smoker you know someone who generally buys pre-rolls a lot you know people who don't buy too much at the club this might be for you i know plenty of people who get faded off of just a joint this size and i'm not gonna lie guys this is a pretty nice size for a solo sesh if you're trying to make it quick you know i generally like to get uh about like anywhere from two to three grams in my joints or plants that's just a preference thing but it has been some time since i've smoked flour and so that's why i think this is a really nice a little pick me up sorry a little pick-me-up for myself you know flour hits me a lot harder now that i've been warned to concentrate which is kind of funny um but yeah i do feel like i feel flower a lot more and i love the effect of flower more anyways in the first place so i will say one thing about the role there's a few pieces of tree there in the filter i don't know if y'all can see that but that's a little sad i mean it's about to happen when you have a pre-roll you know some loose leaf is going to end up dripping down towards the filter or whoever's packing and rolling it um you know might get slipped in there but still oh would prefer that all to be in the uh you know in the role yeah this is actually really good stuff i think um you know not crazy good but uh if it was at the right price i would buy another one of these i got probably finished a whole one of these in a day so um you know if i was going to get this i think it'd just be like attack on purchase you know if i had just a few extra in the spending uh the spending funds left and i was just saying you know thinking okay let's do it then i'd do that so taste i'm giving this like a like a six seven somewhere around there out of ten if i had to give it a score um you know good smoke time i think for uh 0.5 this was just about you know the right time for it to be lasting especially with me just [ __ ] top my ass off i mean if you're sitting here just [ __ ] puffing puff and puffing maybe it'll last like a minute too long later a minute less or something but not bad not bad at all that should about wrap it up for this one y'all i hope you enjoyed this quick little sesh with me and uh yeah we'll see y'all later peace out you", "mCy37KOh25o": "okay cool so here we are in my thousandth post thought I'd do something a little different today and got this packwood's shout out to what's in my pre-roll for their inspiration such a simple concept with something so desperately needed in today's day and age so yeah this is legit Packwood's that I picked up it's prop 64 compliant not exactly sure what that means it does look like it is a normal blunt but I'm sure it's kind of like hemp wrap or something like that it doesn't exactly specify here on the packaging but as you can see it's got its holographic seal there it's got this wax but it's not real wax apparently and it's sealed by actual plastic so yeah let's go ahead and crack this thing open and see what we got looks like the dotted line is right here Packaging always gets the best of me all right cool all right so that came off pretty easily strip this does this just want to come off all right let's get the sticker going really self-conscious of my nails right now I definitely should have cut them but alright let's see oh there we go popping this off I guess this would be pretty problematic if it was actual wax oh that's just a screw top all right makes perfect sense plastic in there and there's what we're seeing from the top first a little preview there let's get this thing out of here no graceful way to really do this let's see there we go cool there it is it even has packwood's right there on the glass tip so yeah I mean looking decently keeped up guess that's the whole point this little guy escaped some like a little well let's just cut it open in reserved judgment here let's see if I can smell anything not really picking up on any Jack necessarily but it's probably just because it's overwhelmed by whatever this rap is made of got my little scissors out so here we go first cut definitely is stout whatever's in there oh damn oh no I was gonna try to patch this back together after this video but we'll see how that goes all right so there we go let's open it up get the focus on that alright well not exactly what you'd expect from their post on their Instagram page so you're getting at that looks like it'd be pretty hard to pull through falling apart pretty easily let's get a smell for this I mean it is looking fairly tricht yeah I'm not really picking up on any Jackson I know it's blackjack but I mean all the blackjack that I've ever smoked has just been predominantly Jack smelling it and I'm not really getting anything off of this let me grind it up a little bit that's what you this is what you're getting look tiny here let me get in here this is what you're getting I'm not shooting on this if you want to spend you know fifty sixty dollars to get this packed into you know keep tup want do it I mean I don't have a problem with that but that is what you're getting get you know it's ground up pretty well it's all smashed in there it's got some stems in it nothing no huge ones nothing like that I mean the note looks alright it's not anything amazing I see some perp in there but I'm sure I mean I'm not getting any smell off of my fingers at all which is kind of weird if anything maybe a little bit of sweetness but nothing jack like so that's what you get right there let's see what it comes out - oh wait you know there's a lot more there I mean not a lot more but there's more in here cut down a little more I'm saving this guy now is that it isn't where I'm at the tip there all right you guys couldn't see this but I'm trying to work it out it is just smashed in here look here so I mean maybe that would have smoked awesome laying here let me focus a little bit there we go so maybe that would it yeah it's like I don't know maybe that would have smoked great I don't think so [Music] I'll try to take a picture away in it cuz it's like honestly it's so caked in here I'd have to scoop it out so but yeah that's it that's what's inside right there you're looking at it pretty much all of it except for what's jammed right in there there's some Keef on the outside I don't know you know where the what is it co2 wax I guess maybe it's with in the nug like kind of blended in or maybe it's on the outside but honestly no Jackson it whatsoever and yeah I don't know that's what you get so if you want if you're cool with that and if you want to spend the kind of money to grab that then go for it but I mean I'd rather just grab something else and roll it myself there it is backwoods blackjack", "xWXJ24qf-v4": "what's up girls Katie grass curry lounge now um I don't know this is a contrast is you know proper for this but here we go now I just wanted to talk about this real quick this wax roll that I got now I've gotten these before from different places and instances it's a sati but wax roll this for you guys who aren't aware of that and I got these um these pre rolls here these are just regular pre-rolls and basically what the pre rolls and the wax rolls are you know the wax roll will did a little bit more expensive because they they probably put their top shelf shake into the wax rolls covered in wax and then rolled it in Keef as you can see maybe you can't but it's covered in Keith so you get a pretty decent high off of this I don't know if the wax is sativa I'm assuming that it is I don't know if the key for sativa possibly but the shake that's in it one likely is Teva now this these five pre-rolls you see it is joints you see it I get these from the UH from uh from the dispensary now they have a deal at the ones that dispensary that I go through I got these items at two separate dispensaries by the way now these here they have a deal on the pre-rolls um I think is you get five for ten bucks and you spend a certain amount of bread I think you spend more than you use you donate more than five bucks and you get a free free dab or you get a a free pre roll now for you guys will know a dab is basically when you take some wax which is just you know you might want to concentrate you know there's a certain attachment that you put on your bong you know and uh you you basically scoop the wax out of whatever container is in you fill up the hole on your arm I forgot what they call the attachment put a dab and basically you know babies probably better to have a butane lighter you know something that you can use the heat the heat the way it's up and you cover it so the smoke doesn't escape so it's forced into the arm it's forced into the bong you hit it you know you hit it from from the top like you do a bomb and it concentrates the [ __ ] spectacular if you've never had one man it is definitely time to get out of wherever the [ __ ] you are and try this out because the wax is the dab has that [ __ ] all the grass you smoke you've never had a high like this before I'm telling you it is some good [ __ ] anyway so I got the free roll I like the pre-rolls you know you loosen them up a little bit because they they roll pretty tight loosen him up a little bit and they hit perfectly you know and I get I get a nice buzz off of it because they mix with bees alright because I asked them they mix a lot they mix all the shake up you know from out of their jars or whatever they mix all the things that are in display cases and stuff they mix it all up you know and then a Rollie pre-rolls you know sometimes I even roll up my grass with you know you know sprinkle in some of the pre-roll on it you know it enhances the high you know what I'm saying because you got all these different combinations of grass rolled into one and then mixing it with whatever particular strain you have at the time and you know it increases yeah for the most part I'm lit right now as you can see now not about this now and this um this wax is wax jump-off it's wax roll it's you know it's the same length as a regular pre-roll but as you probably can tell it's much thicker okay that didn't work out the way I wanted to do as much it's much thicker you know way thicker you know and it comes in its own special tube as you guys can see and I like it I I'm smoking it looks like about let's see let's try to do a a contrast and compare okay this is actually a little bit longer I will say X is a lot longer or rather the tip is longer so I would say that in okay so the wax roll is a bit longer but I smoked maybe about I would say maybe not a third of it cuz it was probably about you know so the white roads are much longer actually anyway so I smoked maybe about a quarter of this thing already right and I'm late and that was hours ago man it was hours ago and I'm lit off of this so it's definitely worth the money I paid $10 for this one you know you think about 15 out of 120 dollar ones you know in fact you know what I'm geeking that let's just show you how lit I am I actually got all of these from the same spot actually yeah that is I got all these from the same spot my back as you can tell the wax rolls are [ __ ] on point I am straight lit I it's three hours later and I'm still no I'm good man I'm good I just went in house went the red box last night watched um I got John wick - it's funny because I've never even seen him John with one sort of boss baby that was some [ __ ] and uh and I uh watched with and I watched the new King Kong movie that came out recently I finished watching that this morning you know I watched that in movies like what - I was longer something to that effect something like that it's close to it watch that eat had a coffee and a bagel and I'm still I'm still lit man it was three hours ago so I recommend I recommend the wax rolls I recommend pre pre rolls like I said um if you find out when you hit your pre row is a little bit too tight you know just loosen them up because you know these you see that they all twist it at the tip so you can kind of unravel the tips um and and start from the bottom and kind of roll them up so that it loosens it up so they're not so tightly compacted and I'm telling you it'll hit perfectly you know and depending on what your tolerance is you should get a pretty decent buzz you know but that's all I got for that I just wanted to do this video about you know with the pre rolls and these these wax rolls and that's about it how about you guys leave the peace", "O4KkM7X-euo": "[Music] [Music] what's going on fino fam let's get this show started today we're gonna go hit up in some Springfield Massachusetts and we'll get US Supreme Court which smoke sprinkles huh I don't really know what's not my thing and I'm trying to do this for you

Hawaiian like super Lemon Haze we're rockin the old GKP when I ask what kind of high it gives I have a tolerance yours may not be as great as mine imma let you know if it tastes good but I think it's worth the money the value for what you gonna spend first see what she do what it looks like on the package let's see what it tastes like I'll say when it hits the palate it's got a nice little spice when I first took my first pool reminiscent of every Gorilla Glue I've ever smoked I'm gonna keep smoking this woman to burn the old thing down here comes our first ash let's take a look at that I think it's complaining about these three rules is that they can do let me see what happens when we pass it to our boy let's get you some of this if anybody could canoe with joy it's gonna be this man right here let's see what he does with that is it possible to canoe this time it just won't happen it's just burning right really cool so it to the last drop I wouldn't call it super Lemon Haze I'd call it okie-dokie haze because it's just okey-dokey and here it is that beautiful Hawaiian spice or at least I hope this was fired I don't want to smoke the rest of that bong in the trash it's gone

called it [Music] right yep we're trying to have a different story for each block the first story was actually the first time I ever told my parents Dan catch me anything but this is like my was like 19 and I was working at a Men's Warehouse and my sleep schedule listed the year I took off school oh I'm gonna try something else this video where was my friend of mine told me that uh I'm gonna try something else video I'm not gonna like cut or headed that much I was gonna be a whole small session it's basically just what I do that was never recorded looks except all the talking I don't they talked to myself I mean there's no high [Music] I always have work from like 8:00 like one a my sleep schedule was [ __ ] like I just could never fall asleep so I would stay up to like 670 mornings I could never fall asleep like staring at my phone stare at the wall and I was always dead [ __ ] tired and I had a friend of mine he had this guy's one of the reasons why I started sleeping - he worked at a job with me and he always had buzz stuff I think you saw I'm not really sure but had some bud and I bought an eighth oven and a minute of being friends it's me enough like he rolled everything flaming so I could I roll back then bro I was mad people in that part so yeah I had like the eighth and I had seven pre-roll like point five gigs one for every day of the week so I was gonna smoke one at night before I went to sleep I bought it off him and then like on the way home I had it in the men's wearhouse bag like I was in bed his hat man and I was like thinking about how I'm gonna tell him like I have to tell him like the ads like is based like a sales pitch like I need this to fall asleep so I couldn't perform better at work or some [ __ ] like it's like never fall asleep it I was always tired [Music] so get in the house waste no time go straight to the room and I'm like yep yeah and they like tell you guys on the road I'm like struggling over here I'm like dying every morning at work I need like like and when I when I would smoke like I had AG like I would fall asleep pretty easily but I wouldn't like smoke all the time because I didn't want me to smell anything or nobody one of the room and I was like yo this is my problem I can't ever fall asleep I'm always tired when I go in the work like I'm gonna try something and they're like what I'm gonna try marijuana and there's like what is it I was hoping they know what that means so they could be like yeah and they were like what I was like weak like oh you're trying huh my dad was like so pissed I hit he was like he let me do it he was like oh you're just gonna smoke weed huh okay let's see how that goes he was so busy let me do it they didn't make sense just like you're like trying to rub it in my face but I took it anyway now at first I'm not gonna lie can't really work that well because like I would smoke at night but instead of just going straight to sleep I would just watch TV and [ __ ] and I watch movie so at first didn't work out but eventually I got was smoke and then my sleep schedule started getting back to normal because eventually I would come back home from work tired of [ __ ] and then I would smoke and then I'll just like pass the [ __ ] out it was good like that for a walk but until I went back to school I didn't have but all the time in school I didn't have money so I didn't have a job that's the first time I told them and they wanted to happy they got pissed all the time when I came back in the cribs I smell like [ __ ] but yeah it worked out [Music] eventually I got tired of [ __ ] like smoke it outside it was like like I could just coking hair blow out the window so for a little while all I had was a [ __ ] one in it now did blow that [ __ ] out the window they still smelled it though but I just didn't feel like the one outside eventually I would have to go outside walk around the block and do that just let one get pissed at me but yeah that's the first time ever told my parents that I smell shits hidden you gladder guys at Eva last night honestly before I did I had a jet fuel one and that [ __ ] put me on my [ __ ] ass bro like I had a jacket on inside the window open first five hits I was plugging my whole body was moving [ __ ] like I was overheating [Music] I already know the story I'm gonna tell another video meet him the other for the other J Brooke so I might have a little bit left so I'm gonna just tell a little backstory now I've heard like I'm not from America I wasn't from like Oh Peggy I was born there and when I came here like I wasn't like the biggest kid but I got gradually bigger as I got more and I played soccer I got moved when I was like 5 I was like a pretty small kid but as I grew older I got bigger and bigger and I like playing soccer but I got bingo where I couldn't play soccer but I could play like a line and all like the football coaches and stuff like soon as they saw me like I wasn't like this is one of the biggest regrets I had I want to say I should never play football so I wasn't really a football player I wasn't that great at football honestly like people they had me at line that was pretty like scared of concept not gonna lie but and I just do what I had to do I play left tackle have I started my senior year of high school only I ever started I played left tackle ok yeah that was a fun year this year but I will tell you I'm gonna take it back all the way for the first time we going the first time I ever played football with 7th grade first year in middle school never play football ever like never even put any equipment Brooke there was some big-ass [ __ ] duty at middle school probably like one dude named Justin I he was big as [ __ ] like there was this one girl that we had it was called bullying the ring everybody would circle around us like the whole team will circle around us we had all like passing [ __ ] on and one guy was stay in the middle and he would just like shuffle his feet and like the the coach would walk around no no no I've got this part I think the coach would like say a number and whoever's number that was would run full-speed into the guy in the middle and the guy in the middle half like be quick on his feet and see who it is and just try to take that hit bro we were in that drill and it was a dude named Donovan right before me he was like a friend of mine same grade and Hills his turn and my in a coach like he was doing he was getting hit and [ __ ] like he was like he was doing good and my coach called Justin the huge guy bro the first time I think he like ducked out of the way and then the second time he like cuz he made him do it again Brooke he hit him my boy flew back like 5 feet and I saw that oh it was my turn to go in there bro I'm not even gonna lie I saw his big ass coming towards me good the first couple hits like kind of [ __ ] me up but I was like big though so like I still got [ __ ] up but it look like it cuz I was just like hey like I just had a big-ass bucket gonna have a bigger body than Justin though so when he came through I thought about hitting him last second pulled out the way I mean the first time I even saw what like a cup was I was like I'm not putting that on me bro the thought that bra I played [ __ ] this is like seventh grade so I had like how just basically put me on both sides of the line bro I played like D like defensive tackle and a [ __ ] the guard cut me and his shoulder pad went right into my nuts oh my god I was on the floor for a little bit I didn't want anybody to know what happened so I could like get up like kind of fast but yeah I wasn't so much pain bro after that game before you play that game I got [ __ ] up that game always work up after that [Music] it's about it on this one [Music] lay down that year at 7th grade that was a play in a game if we would have won that game apparently we wonder whether the playoff well I'm a Sparta's guy up first this is already all past wanted to see what a good fight but okay so seventh grade I did not start the whole year didn't start the whole year then I forgot like they would just put me in on some plays like on defend stuff and this wasn't the one game they like it was towards the end of the game and I think we were down by a touchdown my name is replay was Frances British it was so funny I was so mad when this happened this is like embarrassing but you know you got this thing started I never tried one of these before my friends have they said it's pretty good [Music] - it was like those things are like 60 bucks this is like 40 or 50 I think I'm not sure yet either forgot that that's a back one but that's why it was like pretty harsh as soon as I hit this one he was like so much cleaner I still loved back was the ocean [Music] so it was our last play of the game and it was a kickoff return and no football like there's five people that I think four than the rest I was the guy in the front row all the way on the right so I was like close to their sideline the other team my first time ever playing specialty it was so embarrassing but it's funny as [ __ ] I was like I don't even care at this point they kick the ball off and I freeze like everybody like I'm supposed to like run back until they catch the ball and then run back and block somebody I freeze I'm just like looking back and forth and the guy that's like running towards me like to tackle my play like they got the other side runs into me like trucks take stuff [ __ ] like I still remember that hit big suck my [ __ ] up I got up and apparently I don't remember this but I remember like the guy who is running the guy who was running it back apparently he had a big-ass hole to run her and when I got up and being knocked down I blocked that hole and he ran into me and he fell Brooke it looked like I tackled him apparently that she was so [ __ ] funny bra and she was so funny everybody was pissed off but they were laugh-in finals they were pissed like the guy ran back was pissed as [ __ ] but like once we got back in school and like you let it go he was just like you really tackled me like bro I swear I didn't act will you brag I [ __ ] up and I got up and you ran into me and he felt and I think I felt too but I was like the most embarrassing thing that ever had to me a football that she was so funny she was so funny and then in high school I didn't play like my ninth grade year I'm pretty glad when I hear actually because I remember the team that my school had that year like that team was like hilarious like I knew most of the guys but that team was really bad he's never had any chemistry there was a whole bunch of like really good players that they just definitely like I don't know why they were popular in the next year the coach I had for JV this guy should have been a folk varsity coach this guy look like a like a personal trainer he was like a science teacher we go he was serious [ __ ] football I was like bees here to [ __ ] up because I knew I'd better get [ __ ] he wants every time we do film study I knew I [ __ ] up like at least once or twice in every game and I was like dreading the moment that we got some my part I [Music] already do that that crazy in JV and varsity I didn't start 11th grade I wasn't really that good the players we had 11 my living for a year like on both sides of the ball were actually really good we had some really good [ __ ] tackles and defensively like defensive as a defensive tackles my senior year though is when I started playing like the line I always wanted to play defense but that's why I wanted to I wanted to hit people but I didn't like like playing some like line cuz I was gonna get hit every single play but I didn't mind hitting other people every single play that wasn't the best Guardian I let a few sacks through one game see you here actually we were playing this team of the Falcons the linemen that was lined up against me it was weird so when I was younger I had a friend from like elementary school and he we were always ghost like the cooler game in the summer and yet another friend that he would bring with him he played football - that guy was the guy that I was playing against I didn't realize until after the game I heard him like say something I was like y'all Payton I think you look back I was like yo that's actually him but it had been awhile ago I don't think you remember who I was he got me a lot negative what wasn't the worst tackle like my pretty much my plan was to like instead of like just going head-on I would just let them try to come outside and just push them up field most the time to work because the QB are running back with just like go up the middle and get it off pretty fast it's like 3 o'clock I think like 3 o'clock oh no I'm gonna do the rest of the day right from at the head of this well minimally edit upload this [ __ ] I don't know you guys like in this video

video you", "INSqIJDiBFI": "welcome to episode 3 of mmm medical edibles my name is chef Tania Nicol chef and culinary nutritionist well no [ __ ] today we'll meet my favorite Chocolate Chunk cookies yes I'd like a chocolate chip cookie those little chocolate chips just won't do so I like to make it chunky me today's episode is sponsored by backbone and also the marijuana crime drama a sea of green check it out fully loaded on our YouTube channel you can also get it on DVD shut up and take my money now if you're like me chocolate Aulick I like to use chocolate chucks I like my chocolate today's recipe will be infused with Keith's very commonly on hand for most smokers usually collected at the bottom of your grinder you want to keep it in an airtight container I keep mine in a mason jar and keep it away from the light I like to go to the light no keep is one of the easiest ways to get THC into your edible if you're like me you probably have a lot you want to decarboxylate the Keith I am so confused right now it's just THC a and you need the heat to activate it just like you would when you're rolling your weed in the joint and you light that first hit got a big enough joint there right you need the heat to get high and we want to get high want to pre-heat your oven to 300 degrees so in order to decarboxylate the key you're going to use an oven safe Bowl we're going to use some parchment paper it's contained in the parchment paper which makes it easier and I've already pre-measured my two grams of Keith and I'm just gonna put it right in here with this piece of paper and you want to spread it as evenly as you possibly can to put it in the middle right you want to set the timer for seven minutes you want to allow your Keef to completely cool before adding it to any of your recipes a good rule of thumb is D carb your Keith before gathering your ingredients that way it'll have enough time to cool by the time you need it mmm smells delicious for this recipe we're going to use two cans of Keith two and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour a teaspoon of salt a teaspoon of baking soda three quarter cups of granulated sugar 3/4 cups of PAP dark brown sugar one teaspoon of vanilla extract two sticks of unsalted butter softened and two eight now let's get to baking in order to make the cookies you want to pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees we're gonna add the softened butter the granulated sugar the dark brown sugar and the vanilla extract along with the key in the mixing bowl carbs wise it's gonna set me back don't even give a [ __ ] we're gonna add a teaspoon of kosher salt you spilled the salt and a teaspoon of baking soda and then you just want to gently mix it we're gonna take the butter and put it right in the mixing bowl now we're gonna add 3/4 cup of granulated sugar mm-hmm that must be the sugar oh gold that's gold the dark brown sugar you'll probably need a spatula for this one since it's tightly packed yes and a teaspoon of vanilla extract [Music] hold your parchment paper and add the kief to the mix the great thing about parchment paper is that the kief doesn't stick to it now we're gonna cream the butter the sugar the vanilla extract and the keith's in our stand mixer or you want to touch the mixing bowl to the stand make sure it locks in place and you're gonna use your whisk attachment to make the cookies you want to blend the ingredients well until it forms a nice creamy mixture turn it off halfway and make sure you scrape the sides of the bowl we don't want to lose any of that swipe swipe swipe swipe swipe swish [Music] now we're gonna add the eggs one by one if you recall from the brownie episode we do it one by one in case there was a bad egg then we don't ruin the whole mix she was a bad egg [Music] you also want to make sure you scrape all of this down when you add the eggs to make sure everything gets well combined add the mixture with the flour baking soda and salt after that comes the chocolate chucks hmm you know what I need a little chocolate pick-me-up make sure you lower the bowl when you add the flour you want to start the mixer off slow so that the flour doesn't go flying everywhere [Music] scrape the sides of the bowl so you make sure you get all the flour into the mixture now it's time to add the chocolate chunks [Applause] waiting for cookies now it's time to portion the cookies make sure you clean off the whisk we don't want to lose any of this yummy goodness you can eat that you can use a small scooper or a table spoon whatever you have at home you want to use an ungreased cookie sheet or baking sheet or like I use parchment paper you want to have enough space around the edges for the cookie to spread please I'm gonna need you to spread I'm gonna try to get a good amount of the chocolate chunks along with the cookie mixture that way you ensure that all the cookies have chocolate chunks in them and the last ones aren't just sugar cookies once you've portioned out all your cookies depending on how small or how large you make them you can figure out how much THC is in each serving plugging that back in he takes the derivative and he solves the equation crowd goes wild it's also secondary Tomich THC percentages in your Keef again if you smoke high grade weed your THC should be at higher levels and if you smoke that schwag who does that then you're probably closer to the 20% mark we have a thousand milligrams of THC in this recipe we've made 43 cookies with two grams of keith's giving us a total of 23 milligrams of THC per cookie I have five numbers sitting all around me here we'll put these in that 375 degree oven for nine to eleven minutes until they're golden brown once they're golden brown will allow them to cool for two minutes on the stove and then move them over to a baking cooling rack cookies it's not that sniffing it's not for you let them cool on the stovetop for two minutes and then move them to a wire rack to completely cool now that the cookies have cooled on the stovetop for two minutes we'll move them on the cooling rack for them to completely cool once the cookies have completely cooled you can store them in an airtight container leave them on your countertop or put them in the freezer the last longer thank you for watching episode 3 of new medical edibles here you have it our chocolate chunk

right into it the first thing I noticed and you may notice about this month's box the design is a little different pride love it so let's see what's going on sorry our usual rolling tray related puns in the lid happy Pride Month but but instead of our usual brand materials we've got some food ugh but this nice black lives matter flyer with the commitment from no club to their ongoing racial justice plans donating to campaign zero critical resistance and the transgender District in SF so putting their money where their mouth is love to see it but I will not have as much fun background information on any of these brands as I normally do because dynamic hard Street that's okay let's get right into it so here it has yeah here his as a whole the Box packed as full as I've ever gotten it and part of that is some of these larger peripherals in there but happy to see it this time around not only did I get my box but they finally added add-ons you can loop back and grab things you like from previous boxes so if you're curious I got add-ons this month and they come in a little brown paper bag not in the box itself which I didn't expect but I really have much of a problem delivered same time same person and it's the things I wanted so we get to that at the end okay what is in the box well first things first their club peripherals lighter getting quite a collection of these they are nice big lighters not the cheap plastic knockoffs you sometimes get so always happy to have it on the ladies although if you know you know whitelighters is sort of a funny choice for nug club as their default lighter it is what it is we've seen these guys before rolling papers crutches magnetic attachment this month pride is the joint effort love to see it and again no crack pipe no glass blunt nothing creepy I don't know if I miss them or if I just want to keep mentioning their absence but let's get the easy stuff in not one not two but three pre-rolls this time around I love pre-rolls some people may take issue with the fact that you're pretty much stuck smoking a gram in one go unless you've got some friends which you shouldn't right now hey everybody smoked their own joint maybe that's why you got three brand wise two different brands represented first things first this guy lava sticks peak indica made from nugs not shake in shaky fonts so you know they're serious I don't know anything about this brand and I don't see a lot of information about what's actually in it so this one's sort of our mystery one off the bat these two are from a brand I haven't seen but I'm loving already called Grizzly Peak they got really really cute packaging here grateful Dave in the psychedelic color listed only as a total of 13 percent THC whereas sativa bone here coming in at fifteen point three percent so maybe that's why I got two of them the effective amount of THC I've got is about as much as one of these and I get two of those most boxes all right so three pre-rolls flower itself we've seen these guys before 1/8 of sativa from drop out drop the [ __ ] start living I won't do them the service of reading their rest of their copy but this guy's head banger 25.4 to 25.4 20% THC yeah delightful doctor that one but it looks like 1/8 it's really really really nice bright green and really frosty looking enough that'll come through well on camera but looking forward to this one and curious about this guy now first thing I noticed that I love opaque glass I think that's cool looking and I think that oxidation of your product is not much of a trade off for being able to see it before I open it especially since I'm buying these sight-unseen and then I'm gonna have to leave it somewhere the brand is Arcana and this is sour cherry more got a nice little Lotus as their logo nothing else interesting on there no copy or slogans to make fun of 25% th the product of Mendocino so throwing back to last month's box we saw there's at least some brands that are trying to locally source but the majority of stuff it seems to be flowing down here from Northern California for now alright with the flower out of the way here is first because I'm not that big into edible so I didn't preference them in my box but curious to try this guy got a canned cannabis average clocking in at two milligrams of THC and four milligrams of CBD so effectively one gummy bear but blood orange cardamom and it's it's cute it's small it's like barely larger than one of these glass jars um the brand is Kanna social tonic okay I can feel your smiling from a distance I apologize for nothing alright and last thing my favorite and what I always end up going to first are the vapes one of them really straightforward speaks for itself a ceramic cartridge i like ceramic pure one has not wowed me in the past with their product but i mean its variable so i I look forward to try it the strain is louis xiii and indica with ninety percent THC so this one should be fun not a lot to say about it it's a 510 threaded cartridge if you've got any vaporizer that's not a proprietary version you'll be able to use this so cool and then lastly and not at all least and very excited to products by cobra extracts one of these is a battery the other one is what looks like a normal 510 threaded cartridge but I assume goes with this battery now this is just a cool box to be honest I'm excited to see it I love anything that has little snappy clasps on it and the unit itself is not at all familiar I don't think I've seen another vape like this in the mass market I'm sure they exist nothing seems game-changing about the construction of it but check this out 510 thread tucks itself away like a little pocket knife and it's got a channel in there so when you screw a cartridge on you can put it away pocket it and not have to worry about getting popular in your mouth the next time you use it I don't know that happens anyone else was a perpetual problem with me got a little indicator on here talking about the voltages of the different I assume powers this battery and a USB plug built in that I think just yeah pops right out so no secondary charger piece very very portable very cute and then power button so it's not just a draw and light like some of the smaller ones but you're gonna press the button to make it do its thing I'm embarrassed how much I liked their badass looking Cobra I this should be cool I'm I'm very excited as to whether or not they're blueberry Hayes is gonna be anything out of the ordinary I don't know that I wouldn't I don't know there wouldn't since I don't have any brand materials stratum brands eighty-seven point five percent THC zero CBD so straight to the dome this time [Music] yeah that should be fun to sum up I got to vape cartridges they will both work with the battery I got three pre-rolls all of them aground two eighths one I've seen before one I haven't the only new thing being the opaque container one adorable little beverage and no Club lighter not a bad haul at all especially with the referral bonus I got last time so thank you this was an awesome deal and now they've changed the referral program so if you use my link you get $20 off your box which means $80 plus tax 100 dollars total for your version of this so take a look at the link of my buyer if you're interested okay now as to what wasn't curated and I picked my add-ons just a couple things only one thing new I wanted to try this lab pack cannabis infused peppermints I'm a sucker for peppermints and I'm also always interested in the idea of being able to dose yourself very precisely these guys are only two point five milligrams which your typical gummy is gonna be five milligrams maybe ten so potentially a chance to take the edge off without getting stoned in some situations plus I mean I love peppermints maybe maybe I'll just eat them like peppermints then the other two things are things I've got in previous boxes that I wanted to try again first one all the way back and I believe my very first box the Osito pen in its beautiful little hexagon the last one I got I really like the product and the battery died on me before I used all of it now I found out you have to contact nug Club within like two weeks if there's any issues with the products so that was my bad didn't get a refund but liked it well enough that I wanted to try it again so here is again same flavor blackberry it's just a gorgeous Hubbell device that looks like golden hexagons and this no buttons nothing confusing it hits very lightly and it smells super super like blackberries so kind of the dream when it comes to a disposable vape it tastes good it makes you feel good it's got a very high ratio of THC to CBD and by that I mean I guess low two to one you're gonna get 20% CBD in this so it's a lot mellower than some of the other vape extracts like the ones I just got better pushing 85 90 percent THC zero CBD so I like the product and I'm hoping this one the battery didn't sit too long in a hot car or something and it works for me would recommend it but pending quality control issues last but not least I grabbed another one of these sets of both pod and battery from chemistry this is the uno device this might be my favorite little vaporizer with its own cartridge device out of the several I've tried it feels nice it clicks together nicely it has a really satisfying magnet attachment instead of any sort of mechanical thing and it's very light feels like aluminum or something if it isn't just a very nice plastic so I love this guy it works really well I've got two of them now always good done spare but this they are full spectrum cannabis oil pods when we clocks in at 73 percent THC and the last one I got I don't think was much more but I'm I'm sold on the cannabinoids and terpenoids we've got a whole list of the various small chemicals that aren't THC in there and this hits nice it tastes good and it gives me a buzz that I'm looking for so I recommend it flavor-wise it's got nothing on like the besito but just the product is awesome so got both these guys got them I believe 40% off the discounts really nice better prices than you'd find just ordering from your typical dispensary of course you got to wait for your next box for them to arrive so there's your trade-off I say to my tripod hey if you enjoyed my reviews or rambling whenever you'd like to call them make sure to like and or subscribe check out my referral link if you want to get your own box and a happy pride", "ZCcJZaeeaQQ": "what is up can a famine welcome back to another product review video so check it out for this video I'm going to be trying another joint by fat Panda it's gonna be great I hope but nonetheless this is OG cam coming in at 23 percent THC with thawing 0.18 percent of CBD and then it's got two point fifty three percent on the terpenes alright I don't think it's got really anything else in it not really alright so I picked this up at green to go in Finley Washington this is a legal Washington product again this is by fat Panda this is the second joint that I've reviewed by fat Panda the first one didn't get so good of reviews now I know what some people might be post in the comment section well your last review you gave them bad reviews and I like fat Panda joints they're pretty damn joints and dadada I've had good fat Panda joints okay I'm not gonna say that all of them are [ __ ] that's not what these review videos are about okay they're not saying hey this company [ __ ] don't buy this company okay my review videos are for the individual products not the companies the products okay so if one joint didn't score to higher didn't score to well doesn't mean that this one won't okay it just all depends on the product to be honest it just did that's all it depends on so we're gonna go ahead and pop that top take the seal off show you guys it's not been opened or tampered with there we go and we're all right and there is our joint they're using the raw papers with the rock crutch they got their logo right there I'm gonna try to make this review video on this joint a little faster than the other one I know the other one was like 10 minutes I'm gonna try to speed it up on this one so what we're gonna be basing this review on is how well does it smoke does it run does it you know suck at hitting and we're also going to be reviewing the flower of course inside it does it taste good as a bottom-of-the-barrel shake you know what I mean a lot of joints are bottom of the barrel shake to be to be very you know Frank like even if a company says it snugs and buds and premium cannabis it's [ __ ] okay a lot of the times 90% of the time that's not that it's usually bottom of the jar shake whatever sweet leaf that's falling off stuff like that okay nonetheless I'm gonna give this one a try this is the og Kim I have had the flower version of this it not in the joint and I loved it I absolutely loved it it tastes amazing the Turks were great now this you can smell it it actually smells pretty good you can smell that og cabinet ya know you can smell it it smells really good it's definitely got that og Kim to it so let's light it on up guys much love thank you for watching my video you guys are all [ __ ] awesome [Music] oh that pretty good so far I mean that's just the first hit but [ __ ] damn no that tastes pretty good it's got a nice nice burn so far - it tastes really good definitely got that you know chemi OG taste to it I really enjoy that that diesel chem eNOS to it and I like that I like that I like that a lot gives nice hits this one doesn't seem like it was packed bad this one seems like it was packed fairly even nice doesn't taste bad that's a good day to do it it really does so for recreational I paid about seven dollars for this joint it's a 1 gram joint king size and of course medical will get it cheaper than that and I have to say I do recommend this og camp I have to say I do recommend this OGG episode you kids pretty good I really like it I really dig it I do it's got so far it's burning really nice it's got a nice even burn to it and I like it when joints have that that's one of the main reasons the joints are a turn-off for me that and how fast they smoke you know what a blunt does last longer I'm more of a blunt person myself but I do like joints there are also a lot healthier for you than blunts are so let's give it a good rip no bear I would definitely recommend this so if you're looking for like a pre-roll product and you don't mind paying $7 this og came by fat Panda is something I would definitely give a thumbs up to I would definitely recommend okay because because I like it tastes great it's got a nice height to it it's got a nice body high to it like a nice like I feel great you know what I mean nice and relaxed and just I mean overall it's great like I I was really I thought it was gonna be like bottom of the barrel shake nastiness but it tastes great it's got a nice height to it it's burning well nice and even they packed it good so love you know what you guys think about the og cab buy fat Panda if you guys have ever

in my pre-roll we've got this one gram cryptochronic joint from alien labs the people decided it was a slim margin but alien labs pushed it through so yeah let's go ahead and see what's going on here uh so we got alien labs of course crypto chronic indoor pre-roll and let's see one gram so that's all the info we know there let's get to this testing panel here let me put it back here all right crypto chronic coming in at twenty four point five four percent thc a and o nine t there's all sorts of numbers on here total thc at 21.97 percent though that's the one i'm used to seeing and cbd at point zero five percent so uh yeah that's that i don't see the total cannabinoids on there necessarily so uh maybe i am missing that completely so if you guys see it let me know but this is packaged back on nine nine here so we're coming up on halloween so just a little over or under two months right now so yeah about six weeks more or less yeah i'm not here to do math i'm here to see what's in this j but speaking of math this was 20 bucks out the door uh from hyperwolf and i believe i've seen it on catalyst menu at the same ticket now so pretty cool i'm glad that they're coming down a little bit i remember buying a j not too long ago for 30 bucks that was a little pricey so i'm glad to see these at uh you know just 20 bucks out the door feels a little more appropriate um all right so yeah there we go the seal is off let's crack this tube i've never smoked crypto chronic so i'm not exactly sure what to expect flavor wise get this angled down just slightly there we go um but yeah let's do a crutch check real quick oh actually a nice crutch a little just a tiny bit weak but yeah not at all typical i would say it does feel fairly tightly packed and there is a weird vein or ridge right here uh so i don't know what that is somebody else my boy dude doing things had a joint with a similar ridge that's the only time i've ever seen it so i don't know what that is if what's going on something in the packing process or the tech there but uh that's weird to see a vein basically in your joint uh but the material doesn't feel incredibly tightly packed maybe a little bit right here um but yeah the crutch is good so that's awesome let me go ahead and get a dry pool this one almost has like a caramel like uh like a caramel popcorn kind of taste that's how it hit me at first definitely like a grungy sweetness there i really like that so i probably will like how it smokes we'll see but let's check out this material i guess this stuff is just extra [ __ ] that made its way out of the tube i'll leave it on there but let's see what's inside of here so let's take my tiny scissors and make her work our way down next to this vein i don't know why it's there again that's a little weird uh we'll see if that denotes anything once we open it up but i don't know it almost looks like the joint was like vacuum sealed afterward which i know it's not a fully sealed up environment but that i don't know what would cause that little ridge there it's just kind of weird it's like the extra material got all sucked together there um all right so there we go down at the crutch let's pop this stuff out there it is you guys a little bit better of an angle here there we go perfect and i should still be worried about my phone overheating uh but you know it's colder now so i'm not so concerned but i probably shouldn't be dilly dallying when cutting these things open all right let's go ahead and see what's in here what is this purple this is a nice color to it it's just a little hint of purple and a sea of darker green here and let's smash these down i already see a tiny boy a couple tiny boys little uh tiny passengers no big deal as i say typically when i'm going through the material itself um you know i mean unless somebody's doing this exactly with this material they're not gonna they're not gonna find what i'm gonna find you know so it looks like there are just you know i mean it's not awful they're not like big stems at all but there is this stuff which is just kind of looks like just tiny tiny tiny stems so i don't know what kind of material they start with um it's looking okay i mean i'm not finding any big offenders in here just little tiny like memories of sticks i guess you can call them that here i'm gonna try to pull one out here see if we can even if you guys can even see it but this is the worst i would say a fender here it's there's a few of these it's not really significant um but they're there so i'm just noting it but yeah so you have to zoom way in so so it's like it's not lumber free exactly but as you can see kind of if i pan over there's other instances of material or you know material like this like where it's just these look i mean next to my finger it's almost insignificant i mean it's hard to see so so um yeah i mean it's not passenger free but the passengers that are in here are acceptable i would say they pay their dues they're not stowaways uh and yeah i mean it's just what's to be expected in a pre-roll um so i mean i could probably go through this fish all those out but if it was me and i was grinding this up i mean i would throw that in my joint too i'm not going to spend i'm not that meticulous when it comes to rolling my own herb it's like you know you grind it up you throw it aj this material looks decently ground it's a little finer than i'd probably like but it's looking okay let me go ahead and get a sniff on these grinds so i got distracted sound like somebody was outside my window um it's there is a mint that really came forward i would say in this smell first uh but there's kind of like this sweetness it's not exactly cream but it's like a sweetness and maybe a slight vanilla to it uh it smells really good i like it i like the dry pull better though that hit me more like i said at first like a caramel popcorn so that was interesting but yeah it's got a good smell to it so i'm definitely gonna smoke this and you know not too many offended offended offended passengers that's what i'll call them offended uh yeah nothing too offensive in this material nothing that turns me off exactly so yeah let's go ahead and get away and if it comes up to 0.9 or more just giving that leeway on my janky scale uh if it comes up to 0.9 or more we are golden um yeah my only criticism really is just those kind of kind of passengers and you know the fact that it's a little ground down but let's see here let me get you guys over to the weigh station all right can i get a good angle on it yes there we go you guys can see that so let me get a tear here tearing it out all right so we're looking for 0.9 or more let's go alien labs let's do this i have a feeling you're gonna be fine well let's see will it be generous that's the question all right we're at 1.1 so yeah a little generous a little generous not overly generous not jungle boys generous but fairly generous especially because there's stuff left on the paper so i mean yeah this is up to you if you are cool with what you've seen here you're down with the ticket i'd say go for it i smoked uh i can't remember which one oh it was the alien mints because they're taking that off the shelf i smoked alien mince j it smoked excellently so yeah i have no doubt this will smoke well so i'm going to go ahead i'm going to give it an a plus i'm not going to give it an s rank but an a plus an a plus just because i have that extra weight in there too so good job alien labs can't wait to smoke this",

be awesome a little bit different we're going to be looking at a CBB pre rope from caress so without further ado you jumps to close up alright Berzelius the Middlesboro mogees flat-band a comment section as we take a look at this CBD pre rope this is from caress that's hot Thank You say anyway um this it's 15% CBD THC right here says point 20 so it's not even like 1% THC so this is not going to get you high but the CBD and it has a bunch of other different benefits let's get this thing out the pack so we can get it close up but with this bang looks like all right so here's our CBD pre-rolled it's actually stuffed pretty tight in there says Instagram I think it might be a little bit oh we don't have to roll it it's already pre rope but since it does not have any THC on it on what I'm gonna do is won't take some of these Dabdoub put it on about half of it that way I can get a good decent idea with the flavor of it is on its own and then once D stop burning I'll get some that THC in here to twist um get this thing prepped and get it lit up all right bird club you got this caress CBD free room yes it was already rode so he basically did was be prepped it a little bit with some dabba-doo s-- as it burns those dapper dues will become more like loose and then I'll spread them all the way around it but let's go ahead and spark this up and see what the flavor profile I just see BB pre row actually is all right Burke up bout spark up this pre row this is one B actually the first help that smoked smells coming off of it now is just tudor be dead like the first in the distance see what the first side street is I'm expecting it to kinda just be rolling paper it may be a vegetative kind of scent but let's see there may be some real nice terpenes and help but I'll figure that out as you smoke you know the first size do smell is basically just rolling paper the smell of bleach paper there's a scent of burning vegetation - there's no like we smell of marijuana presence on there at all just take your first pool see what it tastes like well that that taste was actually like some very very terrible poop like some very very bad weep the burning of plant material between hemp and marijuana is very similar you can get that in the taste of it what you don't get is any other turf paint ASIS there's basically just a straight plant like them with like taste it is burning pretty good and it is really relaxing um oh yeah even even just those couple fools this it's made me make me feel a little bit relaxed see if I can spear these dad's out little fire without much don't let this thing heat up some more free smoke that is that is a very relaxing kind of portal hey I feel I feel my body going into a state of relaxation like every every time I pull this it was just deal like no turfy taste is getting right to the spot where these devs are gonna meet Bernie dam started to get some of that turf penis from your dad's coming through it's not really strong yet it's just like right at the beginning of the day of smear this is again this is a very relaxing joint the ash is a little dark though you see all that holy water aerated burn that Ash is dark I'm not like that darkness I'm thinking I would get a good Debbie taste right there but it's not it's mostly just a veget 'iv and tastes still okay there I've got some of that turvy damn they still you know with the dams burning over top of that we still taste like like some pretty bad poop um dad there's no there's no there's not like the strong thickness of wheat Burnie then aside stream that has that strong terpene taste though or that strong terpene smell it's a very very nice Terp Terp it takes the VOSA is dis if you can get chance on some of these CBD pre roads give them a try let me know how you felt smoking it like again for me very nice relaxing feeling it the taste of it is leaves a lot to be desired especially if you thinking that you're gonna get like a marijuana taste because you don't get that from the setup then when dad's are burning they still taste like pretty pretty low grade marijuana that's because there's so much help in here that it's like polluting it tastes not bad though forever like a real stressful day I'm smoke the rest additional five no Instagram it to of Mari Twitter - but Mari Facebook it to memory live I was actually thinking it when the dam started burning that it the taste of it would would resembles a pretty good marijuana but it doesn't it's like it's like some like the taste of some really low quality Reggie but with the dad's burning our young being high from before that it was just a really relaxing smoke now it's like real relaxing hi we don't take my word for it if you see them give them a try you get some depth

got them back from gonji gold it's been one of our patients favorites for a long time but ranch Allah is a infused joint it's a good top-shelf cannabis with hash and oil so it's extra kick in the joint they come in green and blue the difference between the green and blue the green our greenhouse grown and the blue are indoor brown and blue ones go for $30 at the door with taxes and the greens go for $20 at the door with all taxes we're not traveling up now besides a covered in with the keep the oil and the key smells we'll get this one is purple Queen Latifah there's also kirova number four it's a real nice hybrids got Keefe distillate Sun grown bud other than that just real glue testing out 19 percent so definitely pick one hose up this one for candy jak2 sativa 22 percent as well this is the indoor the one we're smoking right now is a greenhouse grown a greenhouse grown purple Queen the purple queen is testing out over 27 percent it is a definitely got some cake fire oh yeah get my nose tingling my toque and enjoy hey that's a good joint if you passing me your sheet is I was like tripping there's person and smoking it's very smooth you could definitely on the purple Queen you could taste the purple flavor I don't that's the first time I've had purple queen but I'm not too familiar with the strain I haven't had a lot of fun I had it before this but definitely has reminiscence of a purple strain if you if you like those like you know kind of a granddaddy or maybe a great day I think my favorite thing about it so far is how quickly it's hitting me yeah it's into it and definitely feel it so the Keef on this joint if you can really see it it's a really light which is really rare to find sometimes it's really green but this is real light Keith which is really really good quality the oil on there too is is seem to be clears that's that's real nice it's not dark or brown door or anything like that which you don't want smoking really nice as well it's burning even all the way through and it hits really great to the tarantulas are all tested by can a safe that's the company that test these products making sure that you're getting good high quality medication with no issues they do this directions here says directions light taupe and Anjali so we're on the last part we're enjoying right now and it's good very enjoyable that's a good joint we just got these back recently we had to add them for a while and now after sex like the best joint in the house right now I mean I'd like smoking our pre-rolls we have a lot of good ones but and this is the greenhouse 1/2 this isn't even the end or one he's good to I'm stoned you know there's three of us and we're not even finished if they get the whole joint itself is over a gram and its entirety with the flour the oil and the key so it looks like this is a purple Afghani Hindu Kush me ain't my favorite thing about it so far as how well it's hitting usually every time I've got that joint this guy oil and keep on it and all that it's usually it runs it's pain and they asked to to have it burn right and this is burning really nice and even all the way through so very pleased about that mm-hmm and for our patients that like the Knockouts and what was the other ones we used to get galaxies the galaxies joints maybe we'll get those back one day I don't know right now I believe they're still waiting for compliancy issues but those were a favorite this easily is as good as any one of those that were ever made and this is bombed very comparable I would say have to try the end or want to see if it's how much better it is that was an outdoor Olivia this is the greenhouse okay that's where the greenest word green is greenhouse the blue is an indoor and they come in a variety of strange they keep tit all the way down to the crush to its keep all the way I'm not much left here yeah but there's an you can see from starting to getting this thing burned all the way down right at the very beginning it seemed like wasn't a run but it didn't I mean you can see it's really even from the beginning to the end this thing taste is good and this is towards the tail end if I'm not smoking paper probably still don't taste good still weed let's check it out this paper that was it as good a nice feeling any night oh yeah definitely but a body high and a head high but I feel good and then like I don't want to go run a mile or anything but I mean I feel like I could do something though yeah I'm very mellow I was energy chill yeah but I definitely want to do something a very good feeling up very uplifting I could good they'll enjoy doing something right now I don't know that's nothing another one right now but definitely smoking another one later for sure yep that would be a heavy one for some of the new buyers by their self I think like I don't think I can smell all those to myself that'd be that'd be too much picture itself if we had no plans for this today then when would be solid yeah but first people many people that was pretty good it was a good head change oh dude check them out tarantulas", "T6Jx7kp0o_M": "we're gonna three two hi hey welcome back to

because June had blackout Tuesday also followed by just a lot of everything just like badness in the world and and and weird vibes that felt like even now we do want to address it but it doesn't feel totally great going back into like business as usual nor should it yeah um but we did want to get back on and and sesh with you guys again so I know right good yeah just to just open this cuz this is our favorite corner of the internet and like while this is like a great place where we can like come together it's also like we feel the responsibility of this platform that we have to make sure that you guys know that we are with the black lives matter like movement and then yeah if it's ever anything that you want to like open up for discussion you know let us know be there are resources that we can point you to because yeah we're just trying to be the best you know kind of allies anti-racist that we can because honestly like I mean when you look at the history of cannabis that's the big things that that's what it really like hits home for me is that cannabis has historically been used as a tool for racism so to not recognize it as cannabis ambassadors feels like pretty blind be a part of it the Allies the anti race we've been reading some books lately we've been trying to educate ourselves and then our most recent vlog you know I've been going to protest as well they've died down a little bit here in LA but um but yeah it's it's it feels important to speak up and be part of this movement yeah be on the right side of history here and yeah we appreciate every single one of you that has told us in some way shape or fashion that you like our agreement with us and you support us cuz yeah this is this is a community you know and I want to feel that you know the that we're not going to be totally like blind to the world but that we can actually come together for the things that like we're passionate about passion about weed we're also passionate about you know justice also shoutouts thank you everyone for giving me the nice hair compliments I'm seeing in the chat here I love love the new hair looks nice yeah thank you this is the result of not going to the hairdresser or the the salon since like before all of this went down I think less time I got my hair cut was before I went to Europe in March so yeah yeah we're seeing what's happening it's growing but I'm think thank you guys for for compliments that's very sweet I think a compliment should be followed by a dad for the lady 710 we're taking a DAB out of this jell-o jell-o no it's banana split banana split chevensky card I know you know you like it when like seventeen you thought that we were gonna take it dad oh so guys I'm les she's saying pretty excited for what we have coming out for our seven ten video Friday it's this Friday happy 710 week everybody yeah yeah seventeen week hey I can easily say like yeah our 710 video coming out this Friday is definitely like top three highest that we've ever been on the channel yeah it's a good one it's a very good one right oh my god this is the face of a pen is like not gonna be a thing and then whole that's just smacks face suddenly this is the like double fisting but I was ready for him just like Oh get it get it BAM oh I see Jessie asking if it tastes like a banana split that is just the strain so it definitely tastes I'm trying to think um it has a rind miss to it like to me it's like banana runts as a candy you know but not candy flavored it's not it's not a flavored vape it is it is a cannabis terpene profile it's not it doesn't have like extra candy flavor put into it and stuff sorry um it does have kind of a sweet cannabis taste a little bit of yeah like it's a kind of a rind in there sort of a fruity sort of something but it's definitely not like banana split flavored yeah yeah guys we ever get to that future which I feel like we're well on our way then just like oh man that's a just giving my banana split flavored weed string even though something that we did very recently that felt very futuristic was this drive-thru dispensary that was fun that was all the way out in the desert a little bit of a drive but like totally worth it because that was a very just like trippy experience that was like oh we're in the future what is going on yeah I I didn't even realize so I looked up and London it's California's first drive-through dispensary which is crazy to me because that implies that there will be more and that is so cool and so crazy and I know that there's already I think like a couple in NorCal and honestly saying like how how well that video is doing on the channel thank you for all of that love and likes and engagement um I would love to make that like a series for the channel or something just I would I would go through every drive-thru right reoccurring series just getting weed from the car in a legal sense sounds like oh this but this feels so new and yet so familiar I'm never getting out of cars alright um we also went on a fun adventure recently to the lavender fields out at Highland Springs Ranch of LA last year they and I guess normally every year they do a lavender festival that we went to for the first time last year that had a bunch of different vendors and booths and food and we had a tea party and it was amazing we went on like a hayride and this year because of kovat 19 everything is canceled but they still allowed you to do reservations to come in and like socially distance walk through the lavender field with a mask on and like separated and only letting a certain number of people come in at a certain time and stuff so that was actually still a lot of fun and super chill to just like go out there and walk through that and I think that will be on our patreon already there already on the patreon I love it what we a lot of the times I came even in quarantine even with everything we we do try to you know get out when we can and whenever I feel like it's at least an adventure worth remembering in the future something I like I want a document for like ourselves one tends to go up on patreon because a lot of times there's nothing to do with we but it is very personal to us so patreon calm if you actually want to get a little bit inside look into our live because we have passions outside of we'd just like ashtrays we're just so kind of it's so pretty in the pocket that was my segue my transition into take a minute and appreciate good baby joints out of like the world's most baby ashtray it's just a tiny little house and then when you put your when you put your joint in there how cute is that how cute is that yeah we actually have another one very similar to this it's a little bit bigger this one is a slightly tinier house yeah we got both of them at pygmy hippo if you type in pygmy hippo shop on Google you'll find it um and I think usually actually they have a bunch of ashtrays that you can order online but because they're vintage it's all like a kind of one-off she curates and she finds all these great vintage pieces that she then sells in her store so a lot of them like it is a one of one that exists but I have seen her have other little houses - so pygmy hippo shoutout to them pygmy hippo I love you even has like a stamp on the bottom that's just like like proof of the kind of porcelain factory in Japan so family like Oh charreteras antique chairs that yeah we're about that's also definitely featured in one of our previous live streams we go through our entire ashtray collection it was a fun one that was a fun one yeah like I like anything where I'm just like okay we get to like smoke through a collection of things I'm trying to think we've also been on a couple of socially distance picnics that have been fun when I'm one with a couple of friends we all just like said our blankets out like six feet apart from each other and didn't share any food or anything and then just going on a couple just us two um when I'm one over fourth of July weekend that was just like very chill it's just nice to at least like get out of the house and like the weather is nice in LA right now so it's nice picnicking in a park is something that you can like still feel like okay as long as I really am way out spread out from everybody and I've got some shade and it's sunny and it's breezy I don't feel like I'm too much at risk or anything out there so yeah we definitely make sure that we're like well because I think we also like to like take a little like exactly and upset any families or anything we're looking for the the back spot in the corner under that one tree back there anyway so yeah but picnics have been I've been a fun little way to at least get out of the house and try and like pick up some food eat it on a picnic blanket and then come back and keep working from home cuz it's crazy guys that we are still both just on work from home mode at the dabbing cabin right guys March I think this is crazy I think yeah actually honestly really that has to be the biggest like crazy update that I know this is not the normal day-to-day for a lot of people but for both of us to transition from office jobs to now like we work in the same room like you have seen the davon cabinet or you've seen how tiny this studio apartment really nosy baby yeah and and yeah like it's crazy the the desk that I used to like edit and do YouTube is now the desk that I use for like all of my work and it's just like like we are it's nice um that we are always pretty much in like eyesight almost like with each other more or less ooh the day but it's like oh man I know that that that also would like break I feel like a lot of other like newer couples like thinking this were at least like said we're married we're good and but we're used to it yeah you get a lot more like snuggle time with the cat well I just had lunch so why not hit up the cat yeah it's been we are we are very fortunate though the like has to be said that we both have jobs that we can like work from home and you know we both have our health actually because of you know a recent participation in the protests and everything we thought it was like the safest next step for us to go get kovin 19 testing done as the drive for through testing at the Dodger Stadium which I now know is like closed so we were like some of the last like tests it sounds like to go through it which is wild and yeah I'm right now like working on that potentially is another video for like the channel I don't know might be patreon lobbying channel let me know when you guys actually be interested in seeing us like on camera yeah and check our results and all that stuff in the full process it's not necessarily like a lot of cannabis in it at all or smoking-related I belong to say I think we we do smoke at the end but um but yeah would you guys be interested in something that's like less less weed focused and like more I guess just current events at the fact that it's yeah just Co vid testing it's crazy um but yeah that was definitely was an interesting experience so either way that'll be a fun vlog for that to go out yeah I think I think it's so fun there like that and the drive through dispensary wild experiences of 2020 all done within just like sitting in my car right yeah so crazy alright I think I think the the bingo card that we still have to cross off is the drive movie theater we've still yet been yeah but that's very doable it's very doable there's a bunch of um popping up they're just all selling out very quickly we're finding out so we just got to get tickets for one oh I love it I know we've got some q and a's here god you just finished that first what I mean are you gonna strike second one I feel like we should share take a second I love ya we can kick off the kuna cuz I love seeing some great questions even coming into the chat one of the first ones is yeah just like asking about like Alice do you still work at Jeep and like yeah Japan yes definitely still full Jeep and fan um yeah so they don't love your smoking on mono don't mind you consuming yes certainly not it is it is encouraged at my place of work yeah I am I'm lucky enough to be working for a very progressive like california-based social media based company so ya know I am yeah we were great we I couldn't I appreciate it every single day that we find ourselves in a position where we're both in the professional world like I am definitely in corporate America but yeah I like most of most of my co-workers once I know I'm a little smoky secret no I like to keep it that way I'm a Scorpio we're secretive questions oh I love this question from Aaron are you are you currently growing so yeah so early into the beginning phases of our season for season four North Grove North Grove Road Ronal where we will see what popped a couple of these seeds these are show them to the camera these are for fathers is tangerine cookies hey first time growing was seed that's a big deal um we're in the stage where we've done the paper towels and the plates and they've they've sprouted and popped and then we got cups and we put soil and we put the seeds into the soil and now we are watering them and waiting for them to sprout up oh yeah fingers crossed it works out this is our first time not growing from a clown so um they could be duds they could be male yeah there's a lot lot more things that go wrong not a lot more maybe just those two but still early stages early stages but yes you posted but you're very excited we literally just started that like it's coming coming exactly you're growing fingers crossed I got a show I'm seeing someone Cyrus coming in desperate to know very aggressive have you seen have you taken a weed break have you - um yes yeah we don't schedule out tolerance breaks necessarily we tend to take them naturally when we are either traveling mm-hmm or under the weather yeah um so no use forcing a high if you're like under it yeah I know exactly yeah I just don't think you know yeah luckily we've we've never gotten to a point where we're like oh I feel like if I took a break that it would really help my cannabis and take and my tolerance and everything that it would be beneficial for me in that way I've never reached that level where I feel like I need to do that so I feel like taking breaks naturally enough cuz we do a couple times a year at least um with traveling or being sick is is is good and healthy yeah yeah exactly yeah I feel like whatever just doesn't actually thankfully I'm never and yeah like I do naturally if I feel like I need to take rice Oh God also I finished my joints and I can pull up the Instagram question switch off switching that off KJ I'm also seeing another question coming it like going to LA for the first time since we use recreational what is a good first time dispensary to go to that's no life God we I cuz I love we we have at least a two video series where you go to every dispensary in Hollywood a lot of good ones here but if you're two of them in West Hollywood yes that we each gave their own video if you want to see like inside of them because I think they both are amazing for first timers because herbarium you can literally like look into a window and see them growing yep uber areum is also I think their bud tenders and staff are trained very well to handle a lot of first-timers they are in not a super touristy part of Hollywood but also not necessarily off the beaten path eater neither yeah touristy friendly area of Hollywood so I feel like they are used to getting a lot of people out of town that is their first time experience so they're like very prepared to handle that and kind of embrace that which I enjoy also and we would be the artist tree this is a art gallery slash it's the kind of dispenser you're gonna go home after you visit LA and be like yo you guys would not believe this art museum we're growing weed in the middle of the room and you can like walk up to the plant it feels like it's out of a movie it's a very very big store that is laid out very cool just wall to wall very cool displayed products that you can just kind of like go up to and look not a lot of stuff is like behind a counter or behind a bar or anything it's all behind glass but you can still go up and get very close to it and it just covers like all of this space and then they have these really cool big art pieces that are for sale and by local artists and as Clark said they actually have a full grow going on in the middle of the room that you can walk into and touch the plants and like it is very very cool I love someone it's also shouting off the pottery and round that out as number three that's that's a good pottery is and a little bit more of a residential area I would say urban area man and the artist tree are very much like we're a tourist would still go versus the pottery feels a little bit more well turn what pottery is actually close to Leo's tacos oh you go to the pottery get a taco at the Leos taco trucks been like a couple blocks away worth going over there for that very local foods best taco truck there will be a line but it's worth it Spencer giving you the we taco combo lockdown at the pottery is very cool as well they have a lot to offer it's a super cool vibe in there it feels like a cool store that you'd want to like pull your phone out and take picture and [ __ ] there are the bud tenders they are also all very knowledgeable and the pottery sells a lot of cool accessories too if you're looking to pick up some cool like cannabis souvenirs like a cool like jar or vaporizer or glass or something or even shirts the pottery has a lot of that cool merchants accessories as well yeah yeah I do love that it feels like a kind of like cool boutique superstore feeling feeling that baby that was a it's a noisy cricket it's a lot um ooh I love okay we'll start up here um how do you handle fights in a tiny home oh I love it we kind of talked about that about like working from home together yeah um but yeah we do live in a very tiny home um and luckily I don't want to lie and say like we don't we don't ever fight but I feel like our fights are always resolved in the time that like if a fight is started it is ended and it has a we are moving on and we are not mad at each other and not that long amount of time has passed wow I'm high and feel like I just explained that a very bad way but I hope you got it listen fights don't take that long before we can just realize whatever we're fighting about is silly and just get back to like normal and not fighting mode like it's easy answers yeah we get high every day and this is always right there we go let's say we go okay that's an easy I'll that's that's an easy life guys that's that's easy right I love it but ya know if I never win if we've never gone to bed angry I feel like that's a very like cliche thing I've heard before or even felt the need to like I need to get out of the apartment and neither of us has been angry enough to be like I'm leaving and going elsewhere I need to get in my car and drive or I need to just go too far to the distance my literally you know maybe it the most okay I'm you watch TV and I'm gonna go do the dishes right now but like not even that because like yeah we wouldn't leave the room if we were still like in a fight like I don't know it works out a very good relationship we're very lucky very communicative yes we're so so we we [ __ ] love talking to each other we love talking to you guys now never stops love it besties for life do you know any places to get products with high CBD content and low THC content just looking on the chat here okay high CBD content low teens um I would always just ask a budtender if you can go to a place as a budtender on staff cuz I don't know if there's a place that like specializes you know anything yeah it would be better to go to a store if you're looking for something that has some THC in it because almost anything that you're gonna get online is going to be the legal like less than 0.3% I think it is THC that's allowed to be in CBD that's sold online so like I know like Japan just released new cookies CBD geo cartridges that are super cool and can ship to most stage most states nationwide but I don't think those have any THC in the malls at all and like yeah that would be my go-to for something that like anyone watching would be able to get but yeah if you have the ability to go to a store and ask a budtender for yeah something that just has that good mix for you oh if you're in California I will say poppin Berkeley has a bunch of good mix THC CBD products yeah yeah I like whatever yeah we can try to help when ya even have a question firm Larry I've been trying edibles for the first time but they haven't had any effect is it possible that it's a bad product for me getting tired of spending like $30 for these items so I definitely think them like edibles is something that I used to think yeah you know like didn't work for me but then yeah I tried the right brand or the right concentration and stuff I definitely feel like because I know how big a variety that there is the edibles to say for anyone to say that edibles across-the-board doesn't work for them I'm like okay I I would be cure I would be curious to see like what other like because there's tinctures there's like higher concentration recommend looking into potentially making your own edibles if you have any kind of a weed vaporizer and you're able to save your vape tweed afterwards that's been decarboxylated already and you can save that and then turn that into cotta butter and try and just experiment with some of your own dosages I guess you would say of just like how much to put in there and then you're not wasting necessarily twenty to thirty bucks per per edible you're getting at the store I would also maybe yes like its Clark was saying like try try a different kind there are tinctures a liquid might hit you different than a solid maybe just even trying a different brand of something if you're just going to candy maybe try try a gummy ifsar like a brownie to a to a gummy of some kind or something just a different way for your body to try and absorb that THC that's true yeah because it's like it's gonna digest a brownie very differently than a lemonade and everything and I would also recommend yeah if you can look into making your own edibles at home and figuring out what works for you that way that could just be a good money saver for sure my favorite nestle is gonna say almost lost a member when you have a high thought and you're like oh no it's gone forever snatched it my one of my favorite at home like edible things you can make it's just you know edible butter I feel like that's everyone's kind of go to make it a compound butter with different chopped up like scallions and minced garlic yeah and then you use that butter just slice it off and cook it with steaks like I feel like so many people think about sweet like butter and sweet edible it's like if you're really like down for some edibles like see oh my goodness cook yourself just something with butter that's savory you'll enjoy compound butter is exotic bud worth it this question okay I actually are stickers worth it or our fast cars worth it like yeah some people okay now to me reverence I have a slightly different opinion on that I feel like exotic is a very hot button vocabulary word right now that is getting used a lot is like adjectives to describe any kind of like not blue dream [ __ ] strain that you've heard of before exactly but it's would you call it an exotic like watching yeah so I don't know I think I mean we're very spoiled living in California that pretty much anything that we go to at our dispensaries is going to be just good quality and lab tested and going to get the job done so personal opinion if you're living in California like no just go to the store get get witness train you like don't need to necessarily go exotic with it if you're living in an illegal state oh don't dress yeah California bud is exotic to you like I will say California has the best bud but in general I don't think like yeah putting I feel like putting exotic over a strain name is is very much just like a yeah a seller kind of vocabulary word yes there are exotic strains yes that exists I'm not saying that that whole realm doesn't exist exotic strains are a thing but I feel like it's morphed into something that's become more of just a word to sell in push strains then actually it is truly something exotic that's true but I don't know and if you are gonna spend that much money on weed at least make sure it's lab tested that it's like it is coming from a shop anyone that's just like you bro this is my exotic out of those likes yeah exactly or even even a [ __ ] it's crazy the [ __ ] bags that they sell that like [ __ ] I don't even want to get into it [ __ ] black market isn't saying them um let's see here go to munchies spot I will say we live in Hollywood it seems like oily are our go-to though I'm a big fan of Joe's pizza and Hollywood Boulevard and right down the street there's a Popeye's Chicken we are now it's not a it's not beneath us we're not above a Popeye's Chicken here's what I figured out popeyes chicken sandwich stacked up against a chick-fil-a chicken sandwich as someone who was raised on chick-fil-a sandwiches pop ice like consistently is doing better it's it's a better body it's good yeah Discover's Joe's pizza in LA is like my favorite pizza it's so good just a New York style Joe's yeah so good so that's been the go-to munch you spot lately one of those two places where a house divided when it comes to pizza I think my favorite is Detroit style like thick crust like crispy hard cheese on there lots of soft yeah I'm all my bread and sauce she like hates good bread lots of cheese um let's see here um have you been saving your Dee carp weed from your - oh I love someone asking that like goes back to animals um to be honest no I haven't because we don't really yeah we don't really make our own edibles that much so there's no need for me to save it but that is like exactly what I was talking about so yeah I think that's the coolest thing is that if you are vaping dry herb that you don't have to throw it away that these like burnt up bits can actually continue can like pull every amount of THC out of it to me it's like such an ultimate Buffalo move it's like every part of it we're using all of it um let's see here um what'd you guys go to when if you get too high here CBD is a good remedy okay I can get too high um I think we did a full video on this actually what you do if you're too high a while ago alright yes yeah I wanna say maybe over a year I remember being surprised that black pepper because has a beta cario Filene in it which is a terpene that actually like for some reason kind of like snaps you out of the high affect like right so smell some black pepper know some black CBD you can definitely help um also I feel like sleep is is something - if I just get too high just go to sleep and I wake up and I'm fine so and then say I feel like I'm the office because I know a lot of people also use like exercise so just like okay I'm gonna like try just like work it out and like sweat it out and stuff and just like okay yeah like it's too high I feel like only gotten there with like edibles right it's true it's very true no um let's see what are your favorite methods of getting high also we're not smoking right now favorite methods of getting high I would probably say smoking out of my glass bong and I think lurk would say dabs yes I am definitely a fan of dabs I recently got a new quartz banger from bare quartz super super excited and with that what's that thing I'm like oh yeah that was a purchase well worth it yeah old-school with the quartz banger old-school a lot of different um let's see here did y'all get sick from the coronavirus or do you know anyone that got sick luckily yeah oh yeah I guess all right we're not sick now you can watch our video coming out soon very thankful we didn't know no one in our family um got sick or has gotten sick knock on wood um yeah yeah we've been very lucky I'll say that um BAM a favorite horror movie don't worry we're not big horror movie people cuz cabin in the woods count as a horror movie yeah that's a great cuz that's that's definitely my answer anything with any horror movie with Thorin my not so smart it's funny there's a classic story classic theory but it's also funny it's more funny than scary oh my god these joints oh no we're getting high okay no just yeah back to back I remember I watched a lot more growing up but I'm just not a fan of like the horror like jump cuts and stuff I remember like watching so much just oh I don't like to trash [ __ ] jeepers creepers just oh I saw the ring in middle school and it really freaked me out I don't do it no it was not a fun time um let's see here me and my boyfriend love your channel ah thank you what's one piece of advice for young couples love it that's a good question I'd love to give relationship advice I think that would be so much fun guys we just like turn this into our own little just like okay next like whatever couple of minutes relationship cue nice girl what you want um I'm trying like okay one piece of advice for young couples um I mean it's basic but just communication is so key to just like honestly never assume the other person is a mind reader and just like always yeah if this is what you're thinking and this is what you want if you can break it down to like what do I want out of this situation and just communicate that to your partner and they can do the same for you and communicate this is what I want then like yeah you shouldn't you shouldn't run into that many issues I feel like yeah just gotta yeah communicate and let each other know and just yeah you cannot be afraid to talk to each other yeah I feel like it's so cliche and basic but like it's so true and I feel like so many I don't know I would hear people at like co-workers and stuff at like previous jobs that would just be involved with such drama and so just like oh I'm not gonna text him so that like he knows that you know he's upset me or something but I'm like if you want to talk to him and you want to resolve this then why are you not texting him to teach him away just little petty things like that that's just like you're mad so you're not gonna text him but if you really you truly want him to talk to you then you should talk to him like you know I don't know just don't don't get caught up in any of that drama [ __ ] ya know um I think my thing but I would piggyback off of that is also like don't be afraid to just be yourself at like all like times up I feel like there's like I don't know there's there's almost no barrier to like if they thought if any kind of random crazy batshit thought comes into my head that I think will give myself a chuckle I'm like oh I'm sharing it with her yeah like first and it's like if if the person that you're with isn't like your go-to person just to like just to talk about life and just to just you know like just be open ya wheel with and to like be vulnerable in front of and to know that like you can you can just talk about like everything I don't know you had the amount of times for certain guys just like oh no I can I can only talk to my significant other about like XYZ and I'm just like it's languages there should be there's no why restricts yourself like it's so much easier this way why would you why would you like good you're put restrictions on your own life like well it's like I get it not everyone is just like who's lucky lucky to exactly be at that point to be able to recognize that they're a G self in front of let's see what's your favorite movie to watch hi your watch hi I mean like blue planet is just like it feels like always ins always gonna write any of that planet Earth stuff it's something watching a doc because there's like a lot of times never story to it especially yeah animal doctor just jumpy and you're just learning shape like your Sokka I didn't know that like [ __ ] yeah Doc's are great um I'm trying to think across the universe it's a fun one if you've never seen that that's all Beatles music and there's more cool [ __ ] visuals in that and that's an OK story got [ __ ] West world chick in it um yes yes anything I'm trying to think yes strong like visuals and stuff I mean she's been I a lot of times like I'm enough of a nerd that I will fall back to just like the Marvel movies the Marvel movies still like oh I have such a good like just return on like investment in terms of right you're really high and just banjo though there's I mean there's a couple like that are better than others there's a couple flops in there but most of them are [ __ ] amazing right we did we did get high and watch the last two Avengers movie I just randomly yeah was great all of the movies are there to make you go like holy [ __ ] at least a couple of times and just to make you just like like not to make you like shake your brain too much I felt like that's the reason why don't watch a lot of horror movies that are like I don't want to think about something that it says cotton just trying to kill me it follows I don't want to think about something but it's like always just trying to get at me like no no I want to watch this Tony Stark punch a robot and a mouth like thank you okay that's okay I guess the question was like what if you like when you get high sometimes such what you need I love seeing this question in the chat this was also one on Instagram too of do you guys plan on having kids in the future exactly for a couple married and doing well and stuff right now we don't have any plans to have kids in the future but yeah it's something that we've like discussed and I don't know yeah I feel like it's really like yeah I don't know like I love whenever I've talked to like what I would consider like very like oh happy healthy like parents they totally understand that it's like Parenthood isn't for everyone and it's just like yeah and I feel like it's it's nice that if we can be at least like examples of like that because I feel like that's something I just don't see like enough I don't know yeah just like yeah okay we're a happy happy couple us us and our cat gotta for a baby that we're very very happy with and yeah don't plan on changing that anytime soon so yeah love it but like yeah exactly if you are on that life path awesome if you're staying child free also awesome to each their own exactly that's what it's about it's about like I remember I grew up in a Georgia I didn't think not having kids was a choice I'm like even thinking it like I'm good walking this choice is like it's crate still kind of wild to me I don't know maybe maybe other people watching kind of vibe me cuz yeah hello we're getting high on this one I love people are asking like take it down listen I got you on catch on this vape am right yes look at this right now guys really honest we still like so full-time jobs okay yeah exactly it's true working from home we're still like working all day no I mean I'm smoking too but I'm still working I would be smoking in the Jeep and all of us also though so it's not really that different um Salem amber spike exam we like Larry and uh in the chat and the chat coming in just like yeah I like dad coming in to support yeah we have tons of parent friends and just like yeah I don't know I don't want a hot box no baby right great have you seen where we live this is have you seen how much we travel no not child friendly enough to make some very big changes yeah I don't I don't think we're ready to make right now so comes out to all the parents watching seriously I mean I love my [ __ ] parents like right yeah no and I think it's great if you're a parent that gets high that's awesome if you have an adult child that you can share that experience with that's even more awesome we're proud on uncle too I cannot wait oh god right I can only run for years and years and years and years and years but one day one day one day oh god yeah oh so much time where's there's still so much time and that crazy insane this is insane also like the shine I love the pen oh this pen this is such a high Lamas I would totally go to weed-filled trip with you oh dude thank you can I just say like if we're talking like getting really high talking about some like future [ __ ] that

I've gone back and rewatched just that seen multiple times because it is so [ __ ] satisfying and like yes just so many fun things that can happen that's is that where that's where they no wait no that's not where they shoot him but that's where a man gets real big but they don't shoot him on the area there but still that it's [ __ ] epic everybody's all in it together and like airport scene right also it might be basic [ __ ] for picking that cuz that is a pretty obvious like fan favorite scene oh my god no I'm so many babies in I'm like is there anything more baby okay I mean the reveal of Thor in this most recently I don't want to spoil it yeah it's most recent movie the reveal of Thor and the changes that were made to him was like a very amazing sets also the reveal of Hulk in THE min the last night both of those were very good satisfying like I'm so happy they weren't spoiled when they were revealed but also I'm just thinking about hugging Avengers as a whole because we did just watch The Avengers movies recently so I'm trying to think of all MCU all the things I know third Thor is great I love in hella right yeah yeah she's great so like Ant Man and Doctor Strange oh

- shut up mistake boy 420 just coming at you with a quick video this morning still in Washington but stopped by dispensary yesterday picked up some pre-rolls smoked one it was it was pretty good you see what this is there we go tribal County cookies it were two of them so half grab a piece 18% subtle cannabinoids but so as you see in the title of the video it's what's in your pre-roll for those of you who think something like this like mugs or this is gonna be in your pre-roll then I Got News for you're about to be in for a rude awakening so here it is tribal camel cookies this is kind of hard to do it on here but you can see so far well this actually looks a lot better than some three rows I've seen but that there's a tribal can of cookies that's what's in your pre-rolls it smells pretty good anyway so that's what's in I'll say most pre-rolls because a lot of them look a whole lot worse yeah it's pre-roll this my friends is five different flowers distillate I coated the inside of the paper with distillate then I put I mixed together a bunch of hash and Keith spread that out to the distillate then up for five different flours in there through some some of that shatter and hash in there and I also threw some of that sugar wax in there and something else but and then I rolled it all up but anyway this has been what's in your pre-roll and you see it right here [Music]", "DVNSSHr--Yc": "[Music] [Music] [Music] what's going on guys my name is Jeff I'll stood on this platform welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new I don't know what you're doing you better subscribe so you can get some more content in your life I've been posting two to three videos a week keeping the streak going hope you guys are enjoying let me know in the comments if there's any videos you want to see I always think you guys suggestions and that's what this video is all about somebody on my snapchat messaged me and asked me if I would break down this little grinder on my YouTube there's a lot more to it than you think I picked this up and I've been showing it off haven't talked too much about it the company's called like cubis or quipus qub us this looks pretty [ __ ] cool they advertise it as like an airtight smell proof [ __ ] alien great quality grinder and I've been really liking it at first I had mixed opinions on it because it is not like your traditional grinder but it has enough unique qualities to it that made me keep coming back to it and it's actually cut my new daily grinder this is my old grinder I loved it it's done a lot of good but recently it has gotten pushed aside the Cubist's or kumis I'm gonna call out the Cubist because it's a cube it's literally the same size as a rubik's cube actually which is partially what caught my attention to it now if your typical four stage grinder what I really liked about this is the compartment that holds your flour that has the screen that goes into your cave catcher can actually be removed from the grinder so that you can have a three piece grinder you'll have a bigger compartment for your flour and then you also don't have to have to keep compartment now don't get me wrong I love Keef actually like a lot of Keef in my day it gives me a [ __ ] but honestly it's not totally worth it to me anymore ever since that came out because keith was like if I'm trying to get like super lit just looks at Keef now it's like I'm trying it super lit I take blob so the point of Keith has kind of been replaced in my eyes but I keep having all these grinders with screens in them and then all of a sudden I just have holy [ __ ] like why didn't I just keep that with all the lead and I could have just enjoyed the weed a little bit more because that Keith does come from somewhere look how much you keep I have in this guy it's literally built to the brim I have this key thing like half built I just started using this grinder like three months ago so the last three months I collected that much Keef that is insane that that much gave it's just been thrown away from my weed so I prefer to have a bigger compartment to hold my weed and then you also have the Keef actually staying inside the flower also today I have a sick woven blunt rolled by my looming toxic iris it was a pre-rolled he made for me it was totally empty and then I just filled it with my own flower and today I'm smoking on some llamosa I'm a big fan of mimosa it's a nice daytime eye and just keeps you going and it's nice like uplifting like conversational high there's some strains that has no clue man I just do not want to talk after I smoke them but mosa is not one of those it definitely keeps the conversation going not a big fan of blunts but I'm making an exception because this one's woven so that's pretty cool has the little checkered pattern on it love these what about tips nothing I'd like to say about this it just looks cool it's one of a novelty thing there's no reason to only smoke one of them once it does the same thing as normal one which is better that better how about great guy I always have them so I got this rounder for free I hit the company up and asked him if I could try it out and show it off and they said yeah but I didn't like this at first because of the two magnets on the top when I was going to grind it it just felt really Jackie because I just kept going over the magnetic connector but then when I realized you needed to do would you flip it around and then once you give it like a 90 degree turn so the magnetic connector isn't touching anymore you have like a full 180 degrees to turn the grinder and actually get a nice sufficient grind out of it even though I am liking the grinder still I do admit it does not grind wheat as fast as the grinder I had in the past I don't know if it's the fact that the holes are a little too small well it's just not enough teeth but it just does not grind it enough just takes an extra 30 seconds to grind up your weed and if that's a deal-breaker for you you're gonna do one you seeing these things retail for like eighty two hundred dollars which is like your typical high quality American grinder price if you're buying a grinder for like $30 it's just not made out of the same grade of quality metals the fact that they say it's smelter if it's nice if you're leading in the car but if it is truly airtight that means it's also watertight so that means that I can submerge the schooling in water and it shouldn't leak through which I'm gonna try out right now first thing you pump the weed out but look how much more weed you can store when you get rid of a little compartment this tiny little thing can hardly hold any weed so sacrificing the key compartment to store more weed is totally worth it in my eyes you can probably fit like five to seven grams in the bottom compartment if you don't have the third stage of the grinder in there all right let me try not [ __ ] this up I try give you guys a little bit angle if I can so we have our water we have our grinder and we are going to fully submerge it then I'm going to smoke this so it doesn't go out see a couple air bubbles that's concerning me salty little ones it's probably not a big deal alright alright rant try this [ __ ] off hill we will decide it is completely dry so water did get into the crevices where the magnets are but these o-rings that connect it are strong enough that it did not leak into the grinder at all so I can confidently say that this is airtight and watertight not gonna lie did not know how I was going to go I'm very excited that it passed the water test and followed the company on Instagram a little bit and the owners just seemed like genuinely cool people which is another reason why I wanted to make this video definitely has a lot of great qualities to it one complaint is doesn't grant me the fastest if there's one thing I could change about it it would have more teeth so everyone grabs me we done faster these things are fully customizable but you can make like the middle black orange you can do like red red white and blue you can do anything you want almost at the end imagine you're like [ __ ] kayaking down a river and you flip your kayak and you're like bag goes underwater and you're like no but we drew it but then you realize you have this grinder and you're like yes no it's fine like I wouldn't even be worried than iconic look alright guys my battery's dying so I guess that's time to wrap the video up I hope you guys enjoyed this video click like if you did make sure you subscribe if you haven't already got a lot more contact comment a lot of videos I'm pumping them out make sure you tell me what videos you want to see in the future because there's a good chance I'll

to get into from this company but um welcome I'm sorry Cass if your first time to my channel welcome if you're coming back how you do it so they sent me over a pre-roll and this is their purple kool-aid I have never had this strain before they're using the raw do it I'm like smaller like herbs I mean yeah okay yeah it's CBD and it yeah but no it's smells like tea another exclusivity from our farm is the luscious purple kool-aid which originated from a rogue seed that smelled like a dream it's peachy citrusy tropical grape flavor is hard to describe but you just did but as uniqueness makes it one of our most beloved breeds follow the benefits of an explosion of terpenes this use DEA certified organic CBD flour will make your taste buds dance with happiness it's average six percent CBD will go excuse me we'll get you through the day happily it's belonging to the sativa family which makes it perfect which makes it perfect for daytime use it smells lovely dry wine that's the grape yeah I'm not getting a peachy citrusy I am getting the great because I gonna add something it first inhales like it's if I dry wine wine grapes yeah they're very dry yeah I know I don't like it's a dry taste it's peachy citrusy so the flavors hard to describe and the first in here I was like yeah tastes like you heard what I said you know but as you smoke it it's a dry taste you know it's burning slowly which is lovely like I said it's like a dry wine is that that's that tropical that's that briefly because it says peachy - citrus - tropical - great so that's the great bum you can tink I'm saying and I got to try a whiner I'm not a fan of it oh I had aftertaste Paul I don't like that you know I've experienced this is it dry started again to organic CBD yeah it gives me a dry you

afternoon Dylan hope all is going well in your garden this morning mmm very tasty nice white ash on there nice and clean that nice white ash shows you that it was flushed nicely good morning everybody yeah it'll get better it's a fun thing about growing it you've just learned more and more every day you know I've been doing it for years and I still find myself learning that's half the fun about growing you know as long as you're willing to learn boy there's a lot of fun that you can have I enjoy just growing it as part of my therapy you know bonding with the plant is just an amazing thing you know getting to watch it come from maybe a little seed or a clone maybe and then at the very end you get all this medicine that you grew you know it makes a difference you know if you can heal your own problems with your own medicine you need to come down here so we can play some D and E I haven't played in I don't know seven years now maybe it's been a long time I take a back I did play with my son Brandon the other day good lord yeah that would definitely be that's what these guys have Wow beauty Private Reserve I definitely can say that this is a tasty tasty Rolly you know and I'm finding that a lot of the pre-rolls these days you know they're using a you know good pops flour in it they're not using you know the trim good morning you know they're not using trim there yet Northwest cannabis solutions yeah a lot of these guys are you know using really good flour you know they know that somebody's gonna go buy a pre-roll and try it and if you know they like it then they might go buy that house you know or they might continue to keep buying those pre-rolls but if it's a um this one I think they're 750 if I remember right correct me if I'm wrong but I believe they're 750 there are a three quarter gram pre-roll and really tasty really well done very well flushed you know it's definitely you know I definitely think that you know that the pre-roll market is really gaining an edge out there you know a lot of people you're finding super cool custom pre-rolls I saw what was it an eighty dollar one out there the other day it's two grams of oil up in a gram of flour you know I don't think it even has a leaf on it it's all mmm crazy beautiful job look at that nice burn nice ash and no runs the nice thing too is you almost have every one of these has these filters on it now they don't do to just playing papers anymore so you're able to smoke your entire rolling down there and there ain't much of a roach lift you know that's nice good job Private Reserve I believe they have a website on this somewhere be my glasses I guess hmm very nice I like the flavor of the flower because it leaves that taste on your tongue Reid you know where the difference between that and a wax wax is a really flavorful doing me wrong but they don't have that staying power of the flavor where you know that's why I still like smoke and flower you know wonderful stuff wonderful stuff excellent job excellent job 3/4 Graham re-roll all flour in there I assure you flower power definitely mm-hmm I love that taste has that tingle I almost leaves a team believing on your lips mmm really good for you no wake you up get you going kind of a strain you know I noticed the other day too I was talking to somebody on here and on leafy it says that sunset sherbet is has Durban poison in the cross and I was talking to somebody from California on here and they were telling me that it doesn't so I'm kind of curious to find out what the real cleaning age of the sunset sherbet wonderful job nice burning no runs beautiful very tasty [Music] hey Dennis wonderful very tasty very good for a morning one how's it going get my after breakfast medication won't hand me my coffee there kiddo forgot my coffee over there yeah you know that what it mmm well here you go man I'll pass it to you I'd be more than happy to share that's the nice thing about cannabis is it's a very social thing you know it's very social people like to sit around with other people and smoke you know I mean that's the fun part of it you know mmm how this dealers doing [Music] well I think before I go that's about toast you need to take a big fat down here have some of this this right here let's see can't really see it now take a DAB here this was some Girl Scout cookies from a company called dab dudes very very crystally very nice I love it yeah it's definitely I like Girl Scout cookies it's another one of those kind of sativa dominant strains it is really good for the morning you know it goes really good with your coffee really do with this unset sherbet uh-huh that almost tastes like a dessert there that's me I still had the flavor you know that tingly flavor kind of the Hashi flavor from the sunset sherbert and that Girl Scout cookie oh wow amazing that's some great stuff I think I need one more of those before I go actually I think I got a little bit of this this was some this was a Dutch haze was from another company that tried this was more of a shatter shatter definitely has the the Dutch treat flavor to it nice alright I know my needs to be cleaned a little bit again I was like every few days it gets gross fire in the hole a Dutch treat flavor mmm almost like candy Wow now I'm running my rig a little hot to the most beep I guess I run it right around 700 you know kind of depends on preference I know that some people run this down closer like 650 you know it kind of depends on what you want I kind of tend to like it yeah some people think it's a little hot I even run it up to a you know seven thirty I kind of like that you know that really big kind of a hit you know as long as you don't earn the terpenes so it doesn't taste good you know the lower temperatures are really flavorful they're really good for like a live resins horizons you know we have a real huge turkey profile that you don't want to burn off you want to enjoy it you know so lower temp dabs are just great for those it's something like a shatter you know I tend to do it a little hotter you know there's not as an inter beans in there you know the terpene profile hasn't been a long time paired to the good wax or a sugar tur so anyway thanks for tuning in educate elevate and enjoy one love", "VrLVcge8bBk": "all right all right just so you guys know on youtube i'm not ignoring you i'm just addressing this camera right here yeah that camera that is my little dji osmo so all right hey what's going on big flowers instagram my name's matt and i'm here to check out this brand called excuse me let's do this over incandescent hey what's going on big flowers instagram my name is matt and today we're checking out the brand candescent and i have one of their one gram whole flower pre-rolled joints it's called crews now i know what you're thinking cruise does this mean i get in my car and i drive no even though i'm in my car and i'm going to sample this joint please do not operate heavy machinery or get behind the wheel of your vehicle when you're intoxicated now cruise is candescen's play on a hybrid effect so this is a sativa and also a [ __ ] let's do that over what's going on big flowers instagram matt here and today we're checking out the brand candescent and they're one gram whole grown [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] all right what's going on big flowers instagram matt here and today we're checking out the brand candescent and their whole gram [ __ ] whole oh [ __ ] what's going on big flowers instagram matt here and today we're checking out the brand candescent and in my hand i have a one gram flour joint ah [ __ ] whole flour don't say it what's going on big flowers instagram matt here and we're checking out the brand candescent and i have a one gram whole flower joint what kind of joint well it's cruz and that doesn't mean get behind your wheel and cruise i actually want to let you guys know if you are smoking cannabis it doesn't matter even if it has five percent thc do not operate heavy machinery or get behind your vehicle and start driving with that being said crews it's their way instead of saying hybrid they say cruise because it's not going to get you so couch locked but it's also not going to get you so uppity uppy like a straight sativa would so let's open up the packaging let's give it a try and let's see if this is actually holds up to all the hype okay yeah you guys candescent all right so we're opening up the joint right now the packaging is very nice not going to lie they did a good great all right so we're opening up the packaging the packaging is done very nice this is a 27.97 thc joint it was harvested july 27th and packaged august 12th that means it wasn't sitting in this container for too long all right so ooh and it looks like it was nicely rolled that is always a good sign they even have their the brand right there incandescent okay so all we need is really one good hit one good puff to really determine if this is good stuff so and i'm going to tell you guys when you're lighting your joint and you don't want it to run all down the side you want to make sure you burn it evenly the best way to do that is just to let each side like so okay gonna get it all nice and heated up now this from my understanding is indoor flower this is not outdoor flower this is made with a hundred percent nugs from indoor flower damn that tastes good it's very smooth i know i said you only need one hit but while we're here let's take a couple more very fresh i have to be honest i used to be skeptical when i would buy a prepackaged one gram joint i went to oregon about a year ago and i bought a joint and the flour was a year old i'm not even kidding they had a year old flower in the joint but this this is not because we're not in oregon we're in cali all right guys so candescent i opened up the one gram joint i gave it a try and i could tell you what crews i'll be cruising my way to bake flowers or any other delivery or dispensary out in socal that hat why am i promoting other people let's say this again all right so i tried the candescent cruise joint i took a couple puffs and i could tell you if i wasn't you if i was me basically if i'm you and i'm smoking on this i would cruise over to the phone and call bake flowers and have them deliver you another one and another one and another one and another one and another one and another one it's that good candescent way to go guys oh what's up luke okay so i was just doing my product review i have my uh have that little phone right there and that little camera that just died actually uh the thc oh now i can do it for this if you guys are watching me on youtube right now i want to say thanks for tuning in i opened up a one gram candescent joint the name of the brand candescent now a lot of strains you know like there's indica sativa hybrid what these guys did instead of calling it sativa instead of calling it hybrid indica what these guys did they they crossed two different strains and then they they lay but they call it cruz this is actually a 50 50 hybrid at first i didn't really know why they would call it cruise create calm like what the [ __ ] dude like that's stupid like just just let me know what makes what it is i'm smoking i don't care about calm and cruise and no no but now as i'm smoking this joint i get exactly what they meant by this i am cruising down the usa like exactly just like going for a cruise which by the way like i said on this camera if you guys are smoking cannabis do not get behind a vehicle and operate heavy machinery such as your vehicle do not smoke and drive i don't do it and you guys shouldn't do it either do as i say not as i do no but um this is definitely a uh here's the here's the packaging the packaging is on point um i'm waiting to get more marathon og we've been out of the marathon for like a month and a half two months uh the percentage okay the percentage is thc is 27.97 percent the cbd is 0.07 so for a joint like i'll be honest with you guys anything in my opinion this is just my opinion all right you got like okay like 16 and below it's like you know like 17 to like 21 then you got like 22 percent to like 27 then you got 28 to like [ __ ] 33 and then like the highest i have seen tested is 34.25 percent i do not know if they have a flower that's higher than that but even if they did i would be a little skeptical [ __ ] i'm even skeptical about tested weed that tests so high but i could tell you right now candescent is not going to lie not only is this a good tasting high or tasting joint the [ __ ] high is great and let's be honest if you're not there seeing the flower for yourself and breaking it up and rolling up yourself you're always going to be a little bit skeptical of what's in the [ __ ] joint okay price for the point okay let's that's a very good one louis so so at bake flowers we already have half the taxes they already have big flowers already has half the taxes baked into their price most places basically this is 1899. after the remaining tax you're looking about 22 for a top shelf tested one gram 27 like i can't even smoke this all like i'm i'm already done like i'm gonna come back later i'm gonna smoke the rest like like i'm already oh also this isn't even a month old yeah this isn't even a month old yet like the flower in the joint is not even a month old most people get butt on the street it's still a couple months old it's still fresh exactly so um [ __ ] i'm [ __ ] baked yo what's up robert um i'm doing a product review but uh uh uh [ __ ] damn it um uh um it's a good product uh i i don't know what to say now i it did it did its job that's why i'm gonna i'm gonna put it back into the container now after i take one more hit right all right oh [ __ ] damn okay i can descent you did the job dude i thought i thought you're just like nice packaging and i thought you were just gonna be we got nice packaging we're a bunch of chads that just got into the game well you guys might have just got into the game but i don't think so by the way this flower tastes you can def and the way my high feels not all talk at all exactly you can tell that whoever is behind this company definitely cares about how their flowers grown how they want the people to feel like candescent like thank you for holding it down for the industry i am very lucky um to have this brand on board i'm sorry it took me so long to know about you guys you've been down in l.a you guys have been down here for the last three years and i've been a little stubborn with getting your guys's products because i thought it was overpriced i thought it would just be overpriced garbage to be honest but there you go until you actually try something don't [ __ ] hate it so candescent for the one gram for the 1899 you're after tax you're looking about 22 23 bucks it's not even a month old 27 thc it tastes good i feel really happy i'm i'm happy with my purchase and and and with the way everything's going nowadays i really don't smoke pre-rolled joints unless i really have a good idea of what's in there if i ever see this packaging i will trust it all day long uh robert thank you again for for tuning in robert thank you for tuning in louie we'll be back for those hot box sessions soon enough that's for sure",

you see my vocabulary going up but I've been contemplating on these new videos I have a whole bunch ideas I have a whole bits Nate waste on recording you know because I it's just that little bit of um twisted cord lag it's that little bit of um that glare it's those little things that's so annoying like the volume it's so annoying and I know y'all know what I'm talking about the camera all of that I'm gonna pics every single one of those in a new video but right now I'm trying new things like I'm recording on my back camera on 1080p quality 4k I hope it's good if it's looking good then drop it number two in the comments alright but y'all know how we started out of videos off you if you are new like I think you are I mean I don't know I hope so if you are new make sure y'all subscribe I'm gonna give you a little little little little sneak peek into a new video look um Kay artis they have their new tips out I'm not gonna to much but we're gonna get a nice little blinker and like that scene from the video we took creating our own little what's it called dab would you get what I'm saying and you don't know what if you ever have smoke they dab would you know what I'm talking about they banks so much Billy go get it to the second y'all let's get faded now you to be boo boo in and maybe big I wish you call the age restricting my things so if not above 18 or older and don't have a red card what are you doing barrel go get one before you smelt with me but let's get in this blinker I know I just ever be so faded y'all just be like like you feel me no y'all ever did be stuck with you so fail you to be like you get me you just stuck in that motion all right past the past the pimp if you want to see more on that either go to my other videos can I do a bunch of videos on pants or you go wait like three or four days I'm out of that video out for y'all soon the first thing I want to tell y'all guess ain't no ordinary blood okay I [ __ ] up I didn't get woods I got [ __ ] [ __ ] Dutchess man hey there's nothing wrong with a little [ __ ] I know I [ __ ] with them yeah I don't [ __ ] y'all [ __ ] with her not everybody I mean you know like like the black homies you found me not not none nothing to yall you feel me something I know some Mexicans I'm like you fill me de woods but it's usually not black homies you feel me baby maybe all about the woods you get what I'm saying like huh be like hey man I pull up with some Dutchess I get smacked enough I don't know why smack myself but I get smacked in the face you give me and then they'll be like you gotta go wood versus [ __ ] I can't match that many people out there might not know what a DAB would is you might be like what's a damn boy you're not a real stoner if you don't know what a DAB would is okay so number one first things first you get yourself a blunt usually it is a wood but for examples I just felt like I'd be safer using a DUT because with woods they they become they they get out too fast you feel me and I want this video becoming like 30 minutes long you get me I know you don't want to be talking forever all right but I am gonna show you if you don't know what it is yeah it's gonna be in a thumbnail so just look at the thumb now obviously you'll get what it is but I'm gonna show y'all some pictures on my budget uh-huh I just took those you give me I want to show y'all how they look the nugs is super clean it's some weed I had before um one of them is called cookies og and then the other is called Ralph Ralph something I think that he was just kidding I think cuz that's his name you get me so I feel like the buzz was just that he just had to take the name so like I said I cannot see what y'all see unfortunately I can see a part bitter because I have like a mirror set up you know but like I said I am using my back camera does he uh try to get the glare yeah there you go a little bit I'm gonna show y'all the other bus too so don't forget all right we're just having normal [ __ ] ain't nothing wrong with it but as y'all do know for you to have it you need to have Keith wax and we all right I don't have Keith I'll not have Keith and I do not know how to make it I don't know if y'all see it if you don't see the pictures anyway I will not have Keith and I do not I make it so this is gonna be interesting all right so first off I don't know I know y'all only gonna break it down from Zil stepped on one so let's hurry it up okay as y'all could see the blunt is split all right now for them pretty much the ingredients for this wonderful wonderful monstrosity of a blunt you need two grams of exotic buds which is what I'm about to show y'all I'm pretty sure I showed you all picture super nice lovely looking buds okay two grams of that all right a wax cart or wax some people use honey sticks that the THC honey sticks those are also allowed you know but I'm gonna be breaking open the cart a lot of the started hey Anthony that's Langston oh well it's my cart I got more I got more I could do that I don't make money off you two but I mean maybe I said it I'm just kidding I don't care money is not a thing when it comes to YouTube okay it's all fun in the videos I'm not having a good time oh yeah ha ha a lot of y'all come to my Instagram at one gig doe or my twitch at one kid toe and y'all send me love know y'all I even have a little little bit of a group chat going on you want to join it hit my Instagram Antoine get though also these videos take me a while to edit you know it's a long process so if you're not subscribed yet go subscribe especially you

twenty dollar bill all right best way to roll it you get your buds I keep dropping it man now I'm getting extra hair on my weed boom body being just like that y'all got y'all buds in here and yo huh huh let's keys okay skis so what you gonna do is you just pretty much just gonna move it together like a dope is y'all the transaction you move it together ready and just like that ladies and gentlemen it has been magically rode for y'all there was like two minutes for me it was like 10 this it was an ass-kicking like I ripped it I messed it up y'all know when y'all get some exotic how sticky that buddies y'all know y'all know that's it paying no but let me show y'all it looks good in the front I'm sorry it's decent it's whatever nothing to powder I kind of messed up right here that I started like tearing back apart like I lifted over and it was good and in like like like a whole different section Torah so then I had to take a little bit of the butt out just a little bit I'm using for the cave right now I don't even know how to make he I saw some [ __ ] where you've got like get a penny and drop it in here but I've never tried it I might try that but I might just try to just break it down as little as possible we gonna see but it's time to break open the cart let's get the wax on the blunt and let's get this exotic but going this would be really easy alright I have my little little knife here I didn't get a hammer and I don't even know if you have a hammer I'm not sure but I'm just gonna just look you give me I'm just gonna with that same passion in my face all right okay it hurts it hurts I was just about to smoke this okay I was trying to actually hit it before but it is broken open the glass I don't want the glass in the wax so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna start moving the pieces off this is gonna be very delicate and I don't really feel like talking during it so as y'all see boom boom let's combined it Internet to a wax but oh lelou yeah I finally got it I see what takes so long I cut myself as I could see a little boo-boo it's all good it's all in the front of the videos right I got a soft broken I know other people that I could've smoked that is okay because when I do a giveaway soon you might be I have a chance but yeah it's completely cleared I put most of you on the bland as y'all could see look how wet slippery with the [ __ ] wax it had a little bit more but it accidentally fell on the side of the towel right here when I was [ __ ] when I was doing it but I see why people sell this for so much this is a bits and a half to roll so let's get the rest it's not gonna look the most pretty but let's finish it up and they sell final product looks I finally got the the final product completed okay so anyone if anybody's watching this and a they're still watching this comments to castles the letter to and castles I would like your comment I might even pin it you know see how I'm feeling but number one let's

tried I'm sorry it is very well packed super good a little hair on my fingers cuz it's auto wax and I am on a tower right here so I mean you can't you can't blame me obviously right but look at it it looks pretty nice it's super clean a little bit of the nug fell out I mean what else I'll put I'll fix that with the leftover weed that's on the money but I mean what type of guy would I be if I

one is brand new it is their gelato hybrid so this one is sitting at 21 thc gelato is an exclusive pheno-hunted hybrid stream bred from crossing girl scout cookies and sunset sherbet gelato is said to feature peppery citrus notes paired with hoppy pungency gelato gets its name from the fruity dessert like aroma buds are said to bloom in a dark purple hue illuminated by fiery orange hairs and a shining white coat of crystal resin gage is a small batch craft cannabis company they hand triamine are located in hamilton ontario and their parent company is a radical medical cannabis inc so this one's super fresh the store just got it in it was packaged on july 14th so super fresh excited to look at this [Music] okay now that we've learned a little bit about uh gelato by gage um last thing i got to do is test it out for the rating so i'll go do that and i'll be right back all right everyone after testing out the uh gelato really really enjoyed it definitely would be buying again highly recommend it so the effects were really good on the gelato the taste was great um it was super smooth the only issue i think i have with it was if i had if i had to pick one was the um the burn on it was was not great it was good um but it could have been a little bit better and the ash the ash wasn't it wasn't dark or anything but it wasn't super light either so the ash could have been um a little bit better on it but it still was very clean and smooth um so yeah like i said very impressed by it definitely will be getting again so i'm going to rate this one a 9.1 out of 10. until next time guys", "HViZBkNF-uM": "my entire house is a cloud this is the [ __ ] crazy instrument I ever rolled what's up guys my name is Jeff Austin of this popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if not make sure you subscribe I got a lot of dead last videos on the way I would have failed to meet actually making this I was really stunned the other day so I had a bunch of different nuns in a jar and I didn't really know what to do with them so I started pressing them into this mold from Purple Rose supply calm and this is a press that makes you able to make your own can of cigars now what's different from a Canada cigar from a normal joint is that like instead of grinding up the weed you get little nugs and you press them into this little container pack as much of it as you possibly can in then you can fit way more and it burns way slower because it's just these nuts that are just pressed together instead of a bunch of ground-up flour but I made one of these I didn't film myself making it and it ended up being pretty [ __ ] epic I ended up putting caviar in it in three different places because I have like two and a half grams of caviar and I didn't know if the deal with it and I was like [ __ ] it let me put it in this and by the way caveat another work for moon rocks or honeyBun whatever you want to call it now I have this six gram joint that has weed three different strains of honey but and if you can't see there's this little stick that is poking through it and since it compresses so much it needs that stick sitting in there so that when you pull it out it actually has good airflow so I figured that time like the present might as well spark this up some of the message me and said this looks like a wheat tampon it's gonna fly and disgusting that's hard to get out oh yeah now you got it goin unless not completely goddamn it's living in a sentiment finger this is legit six grams it does not look like it at all with a Panikkar like this you gotta light it with a torch [Applause] that's it burning [Applause] yeah then we hit a nice I kind of [ __ ] up though because the joint paper is burning away fast on the we [ __ ] beautiful white ash in their exciting using the moon rocks damn this is a nice hit it like burned your lips as you hit it doing this it's supposed to make the joint last like three times as long as it normally would so this is really something you're supposed to do with people but I decided to face this one holy [ __ ] this is ripping it's really close to getting through the caviar I'm really excited what's gonna happen once you get to there probably wasn't the best idea to put moon rocks in a joint but I think I'd try it should have started a timer to see how long this thing burns yeah just hit the honey bub mean tell it's crazy you get hips like that and it really doesn't even burn being only when you hit a blunt like you see a nice little cherry every [ __ ] time holy [ __ ] that caviar like just these giant a trips every time and super smooth - it's all weed all the way to the end they're coming to sent me these do two different sizes this is the smaller one but it's thicker the other one is longer but it's a little bit thinner this one's a little bit less than twice alright and it's about half the width so you want to super skinny one this is the way to go but I like these shorter fatter ones this one looks more like a cigar to me this log was shorter than a king size joint so there's excess paper so I just kind of cut the remainder off and wrapped the [ __ ] up stoned and wrap the rest of the paper around the mouthpiece and it feels really nice it feels honestly way better than a cigar a lot of people ask me why I didn't make this a cigar and honestly I feel they don't smooth back woods or lungs to off them so I wouldn't do it for this and rather do it a joint if it was possible I took the risk and it worked so I'm happy I did obviously though even if you smoke the Thai sticks the weak cigars that are a pot leaf wrapped around it it's just so harsh like this is such a smooth enjoyable feeling it's like a night and day difference versus having a pot leaf wrapped around it or a cigar wrapped around them I hit the caviar like five minutes ago and it still just stayed there it has not moved like a millimeter I can see the oil burning but it is not moving it off I'm gonna be here for a while god damn I have so high so many people that sit over where you can make them up these I think I smoke my own and show you guys where to get it this isn'ta dad I really don't know how it lasts long term something they pointed out to me when I was at Shaolin in one of my previous vlogs was that they make them out of silicone so it's easier to clean these ones are made out of plastic so I do fear that after a long period of time there might be some wear on these but I just cleaned it after I put the honey button there and it was totally fine after a wife of rubbing alcohol it looks like it's really high-quality plastic so probably fun this is a really stuff that you do all the time though like this is cool but if you like are trying to party like this is when this comes into play is it last so [ __ ] long like I've been doing this over 20 minutes maybe maybe a bit of the weight room so it's gonna be a long evening I'm not gonna lie this tastes very good it is harsh and there's a mixture of strains in there so it's starting to become a little bit more raunchy in taste but in still does have a really good flavor yeah I'm gonna be really hot yes better be smoking with me if you're watching this because like it's not fair and I'm just smoking this whole thing alone come on y'all better be sparking up there I put a link in the description to where you can buy one of these for yourself people keep asking you where they can get their own but dude this is such a cool thing to watch the caveat that I put in it is melting but you can just see how soaked the paper is around it it's just oozing out of the vents that's what she said but like so much movie was coming out of this [ __ ] walk you know I got that clean white ash this was an expensive joint probably it was always that I just had set aside I had this jar where it was just like my tip jars what I always caught it then I would take like a nut from every strain I picked up and I would set it aside and at some point I forgot I had it so I looked at it the other day and I'm like oh cool I have all this extra weed I felt boring just smoking it so I was like let me do something cool with this boundary and then I did something extra cool when I put the caviar in there so I mean this alone is very intense I am so [ __ ] stoned already I'm not even nearly done it's been exactly been a minute since I sparked this and just weren't like maybe a third of the way through [ __ ] I don't know what point we're at in the actual video but I can cut up my videos a lot to make them a little bit more entertaining a little bit more fast pace I am so high my entire house is like hotbox already I'm curious this is gonna get clogged if it's gonna make it all the way to the end so if I said it good something tells me this is gonna be burning for over an hour you know gets a high end it will get withdrawing a like why the [ __ ] you doing this to me blah silly thank you for doing this to me I haven't even hit the second chunk of caviar that's right here and then we got this part right here I'm currently high as [ __ ] I think I rolled the everlasting drink similar to the Everlasting Gobstopper bull way cooler so I I think my favorite part about this is how while I rolled them out these I don't know why but it's just so perfect it just reminds me of like an actual traditional cigar holy [ __ ] I don't know where all these endless trips are coming from because I feel like this thing is making never aggression and I'm just getting hyah hyah better crazy but it's literally on the caviar right now and it is literally impossible to smile whoo damn let's go safety my party house there we go back to Prince trunk this caveat really slowing it down like if I'm not cheating on it it'll just go out right away trying to smoke this in one sitting but I am [ __ ] you're hurting I wish I knew how to make smoke tricks that would be like a lot more entertaining I'll try to show you that how bad I am this is the smoke ring yeah pretty much strata crunch inhales about all you got he kind of did a ghost but not very well holy [ __ ] another was Girl Scout cookies in this another Cresskill cookies lime stunk Juliette Jake you know there was sunset sherbert and there was one other strain that I don't remember but there were six trains in this I'm pretty sure but there at least those five I'm just rambling I'm so high I [ __ ] regret this my entire house with hotbox this is a weed rock I've just decided can you [ __ ] flick your joints this might be the slowest burning attacks that God ever smoked now what point am i smoking too much wheat is the real bush oh I had to roll it you know popcorn paper not available to the public I can say well you successfully went through the second piece of caviar I'm tasting wheat again that's just a fad I bet it'll fit in the [ __ ] drink oh yeah that worked up so high that hurt so bad that was so rough try this one more time it's weird it's not like a thick milk eat smoke but it is so uh so intense well judges they fall down the ash is so white like whatever we died according was some fire athlete pretty much everything I've been smoking recently is in Pennsylvania weed there was a little bit of a drought right now that when the dispensaries all my favorite dispensaries have like a third of the options they normally have I've never been a kid and my dad liked smoking cigars with his friends and be like man it'd be so cool it's a smoking cigar filled with lead I was like 15 at the time but I remember being like dude that'd be like the coolest thing that was cigar for weed like I would smoke in like when I'm older I wanted to do that like I imagine me being like 40 in my backyard looking a weed cigar and that's actually possible hey I did it at 25 it's still hitting super [ __ ] clean I'm so happy I didn't get clogged and we're making our way it cooks the last record honey bud honestly it's like when you're avatar and like me if she has us I know that's like there's a peak - you're high definitely hit it definitely hit my peak I'm at the final moon rock and it was getting hard to hit man like that's me repping the [ __ ] out of it and like that's still not a huge rip that nice little burn I'm actually getting to the end have the superpower where my eyes don't get red like I never use eye drops and like this is pretty much as red as my eyes ever get I definitely get the heavy eyes but they don't get red so as long as I can pretend that I'm tired I'm always good I can't believe they're closed stays like this perfect the entire time very impressed just try it cheap do this now so I can kill it the hit is so disgusting now non-durable a dog is just straight road shit's not really one for challenges but when I made this something inside me just said you have to face this one this one's just for you I was really skeptical and I lit it but the paper was gonna burn faster than the joint holy [ __ ] you guys I don't know the cameras gonna pick it up but like my entire [ __ ] house is just like a box right now the lights pick it up best holy [ __ ] it is just a [ __ ] fog house in this [ __ ] my entire house is the cloud you know those memes were think WYD after this and it's like a picture of a giant blonde the best answer is sleeping I'm going to bed if you made it this far in the video click like and subscribe because I did this for you if you made it this far we soak this together this was a connection between the two of us I buddy just bubbled for [ __ ] 20 or 30 minutes but I lit this an hour and three minutes ago holy [ __ ] definitely lasted over now this thing one eye and it's got a little fingernail left so we're done I'm gonna try to just chief through the rest of this you guys this is not providing a good tip it is too dense it is too thick it is to rock like it's not I'm a weed hit tapping out here I can't light it it's too small I know I could probably put that in a bowl but I'm too high still counting this is the dub thank you for watching subscribe click like I'm too high so [ __ ] ghost in here not just my god but these", "FTdQy7tskoc": "hello and welcome back to the cannabis sommelier i'm your host andrew friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis reviews today we have something really cool because it's the first legal live rosin i've had on the channel [Music] in the past i've had a couple uh iterations of live rosin that have been made through ac and pr and different friends that we could explore that world but this is the first time i've truly had a completely legal live rosin from the recreational market in canada so this kind of dawns a new day very very exciting and i'm happy to say it's from uh some great people and uh good friends what is it we've got big live rosin it's a big drop today now el hasho great dude great man has been featured in the wine pairing channels in previous uh was the hashmaker behind this awesome drop uh this was done with john fowler agriconsole on instagram all these guys you can see they're very active uh which is exciting and they're really trying to change the game in the recreational market it's pretty cool to see friends like this across the country really trying to change the game just like we want to see that's how it can be done is by the right people doing the right things i'd like to send a huge thank you to a follower yagna in ontario shout out to you man uh i appreciate you sending this for me it means a lot before we go any further tax all in this product costs 70 bucks so an absolutely killer price for a gram of live rosin regardless of where in the world you buy it uh quality um that's a killer price so we have big live rosin what is live rosin simply live rosin is you take fresh frozen cannabis so harvest your cannabis freeze it you then turn it into bubble hash using the ice and water to agitate those trichome heads off you get your hash you then put that hash into a micron screen bag a silk screen bag and you press it under heat and pressure that heat and pressure method of excreting essential oils out of cannabis or cannabis uh sieved extract is called rosin so now we have a live bubble hash under heat and pressure that's excreting its essential oils so now we have live rosin a quick breakdown i've written some other articles online and you can find a lot of good information on live rawls and live res and all those things if you need to learn a little bit more about it but let's go back to the cannabis we've got a critical lemon from big and uh i'll be honest i didn't look up anything about critical lemon um but maybe we'll put a little bit underneath or maybe we won't but we can imagine uh kind of what it's going to be i could imagine this is going to be a little bit reminiscent of lemon skunk maybe so let's check out some other things on the package uh total thc 666.4 milligrams per gram uh so quite a lot cbd there's a little bit 7.2 milligrams uh this is live rosin keep it out of reach of kids um when was it packaged that's a big one november 20th 2020 november 26th uh perfect today is january the 9th and this was the first drop they did and it's equivalent to 4 grams of cannabis so that's totally fair you can see all their contact information everything there uh but they're also super active on instagram so go check them out el hasho john fowler agriconsult they're happy to answer any questions uh you may have that i can't elaborate to and this cannabis specifically came from i believe it's called this cannabis farm uh which is a good greenhouse grow in ontario and it looks like a lot of great female growers there as well so shout out to them because we all know without good cannabis you sure as hell can't make any live rolls in bubble hash you can't polish a turd is the reality so shout out to the growers without you nobody could do this extract world so uh let's crack it open i guess that's the the next step and then we're gonna dab it uh but we need to weigh it so you can see that it's a thin package and that means that the rosin is in parchment and i know this is one of the things that the internet and has said no to and will probably change in their subsequent drops i don't know because i haven't asked them you can see our duty seal sealed and signed from ontario i'm in alberta i tried really hard to get this to you guys and let's open it up on here crack that duty seal there it is oh it didn't even need to do that and then is it the pinch and pull from the inside you'd think i had done enough of these by now then i could just do it i just usually slide it sideways easy and then we have inside our gram coined out and you can see a little terp leakage uh you know and that's a detriment of the parchment um i would can only assume that this will go to jars next time uh because this is not um really industry standard and then as we dig further into it it's not folded like we're used to they're put into a little bag so uh that's i guess that's the big knock right off the bat is that i now have to rip this little bag apart and again uh hopefully this will all change for the better i can only imagine it would because this is uh yeah pretty pretty not great of a system don't know who chose that but uh yeah you messed that one up i got like a nice little tert pocket there you can see my terps but let's weigh it out uh let's put it in a jar and let's find out what is going on yeah this is i don't know whose call the bag thing was but not a good call i'm gonna be gentle with it i'm gonna drop it either okay okay let's get the one coin and then we'll get the terps in and i'll just get it on the scale quickly first impression a little cheesy little funky not as uh not as like piercingly loud as i had kind of expected but that is okay and it's outdoor so the color is just a little darker as well but it still looks beautiful and their whole motto is to embrace the cold i'm just gonna try and get everything off of this parchment quick just give me two seconds maybe we could rejig my camera a little bit there we go i will make sure to not miss any i grabbed this tool because i knew that it was in parchment and this tool will do the job perfect here we go i need to go move quick so my scale doesn't turn off i would say that's the majority and we can see that uh you know i don't know if it's the terp leak or what but unfortunately it is a little short um so that is ah yeah i wish you to hit that point nine five we'll try and get it here uh my scale might not be calibrated i know other lab scales have more calibration than mine 0.95 with the with a total scrape so um that's the best i could get off it for sure let me try because i don't want to i don't want to give a bad impression that's not fair there you go okay so there's our answer on the weight it's point nine five uh i could imagine that point five of terps got lost in there so that's fine let's give it the old sniffity sniff that's uh that's super important right so on the nose it has some cheese characteristics some funk not as much lemon as i had actually imagined it might have let's just uh crush it up a little bit here and get it to pop out a little bit yeah cheese lemon it's kind of dell on the nose i could imagine that uh most of the good stuff is actually right here and it is it's quite floral there actually much fresher much floral some lemon notes but we gotta judge what we can smoke yeah cheese leads parmesan cheese rind skunk i guess like lemon pith not lemon peel not lemon rind but like the i guess the pulp from the lemon yeah quite simple nothing explosive uh but outdoor 70 bucks not a bad color uh now it's now it's our favorite time we gotta dab it that's what's super important so um we gotta taste it i have a nice niche rig here i have a joel halen banger there is one i think it's a six millimeter ruby in here i have a carb cap from dig glassworks and i'm gonna heat it up and have a dab and what i'd like to do is i'm going to have my dab at 530 degrees so we're going to take a little bit of warm up here 20 seconds is how much you want to torch your banger usually to get that nice even heat all the way around make sure you're moving it and you know make sure you use the tip of your flame uh best you can don't squish it in like that tip of the flame is where the heat is and what gets the best five six seven eight nine 10. i believe that should be sufficient and i got my cool uh tert timer from octave uh it's fantastic best thing i've ever got for my arsenal this rig itself was actually one of the first rigs i ever bought um to consume dabs through to consume concentrates through 2012 at the opening of the next level underground it's done by niche glass colors purple rain absolutely love the encamo stacks and the wig wags so this is super cool this is a thermometer so i can check exactly how hot my banger is right now we're at 6 25 so i'd like to take it at 5 30. so i'll get my dab ready here we'll get a nice juicy dab ready that looks like a good one let's have a big one nice big dab there we go and we'll check our temperature there we go 5 30 it says cheers to legal live rosin terps are there excuse me but the extract vapor was quite thin i don't know how to explain it um probably a sativa leading hybrid because it wasn't like very thick even though i did cough because the terps were there it didn't give me that expansion that like heart shaking chest rattling the flavors are quite simple again i think they're very reminiscent of of the nose so pretty decently balanced palette but lemon definitely doesn't lead for me a slight bit of skunk a slight bit of cheese i do taste some freshness and some herbaceousness underneath on the palette that comes through that does represent like i guess fresh cannabis but if that came through a little bit more it might be off-putting to some but it does feel like very fresh dirt or the aroma of fresh dirt you can see the melt was nice there's no contaminant this was all i believe the 73 to 120 and washed really really well so no contaminant in the banger a little fishy which is interesting maybe that's the cheesiness and let's uh we'll do a reheat because who doesn't eat i'll hash himself told me he never eats it's good on the reheat though tastes normal you're not getting any of that rosiny like popcorn taste or anything like that on the reheat it's good tasty live frozen [Music] bit of lemon pez bit of lemon hard candy but that's really about it for me all right i think i think we're good to break it down you can see what's left in my banger here we took that at 530 degrees you gotta waste it to taste it that's the model guys um so our big live rosin well first unfortunately um you know i guess appearance plays in with the packaging and i couldn't really see it you know if we have an industry standard i don't know why this was used i don't know whose decision that was uh i know it won't happen next time um so for the appearance i think this took a little bit away from it but once i get it in the jar you know it's it's it's a it's a slightly darker shade it's you know but it's nice looking raws and it's got no particulate it's got no contaminant nothing like that so we gotta give it 16 points 16 points seems extremely fair but the packaging will get caught in those last 20 points so on the nose the nose nose we knows the we know the nose nose and the nose is 40 points so with 40 points to give the nose actually isn't very loud it's quite simple in comparison to other things um it's not ex if i had to give it an intensity of pungency it's like a medium minus it's just a bit above light again uh maybe this ate a lot of the terps and this is doing it a disservice but i'm going to give it a medium minus intensity of aroma of parmesan cheese skunk and lemon some slight floral characteristics on the palette it matched the slight and simple intensity of the nose so it was balanced in that sense medium minus intensity uh of flavor on the palate there was one different flavor that i recognized there in on the palette that was like that fresh earth fresh herbaceousness uh which which was interesting on the finish i wish it had led with more lemons more limes more of a bit of anything for me um so it's got to be uh only 28 points well 30 points 75 percent is totally fair uh let's give it 30 points then we go oh sorry that was taste uh we already oh man now i've forgotten what i gave it before i went ahead of myself okay we gave it 16 points for appearance the nose knows um i would like to give it 30 points for the nose for the palette i would like to again give it uh 15. that's a 75 i'd like to give it 15. i think it left a lot to be desired actually on the palette i wish i had more flavors or more of a finish or more of anything so maybe i might go 14 on the palette and then for overall impression based on my experience of cannabis well this is the best live rosin for the best damn price you're gonna get in the recreational market um hands down there isn't anything better than this uh package wasn't great so it i think that balance gives it uh 75 15 points so we'll add it all up here uh 16 30 15 15. uh can't do that math in my head quick enough but it sounds like about 75 some room to go but a seriously killer first offering at a seriously killer price point for 70 dollars all in um this is this is awesome and i've been way more disappointed before i'm not disappointed i'm stoked that i can buy a gram of live rosin for 70 bucks and i look forward to the next drops this was killer this is a

bit for today I fought I picked up this a niche boys skills pre-roll they're gonna see a little creaminess trade skills 1.5 grams nature boys all that stuff I think this major points to get always pretty role I was just going to smoke it before you know what might do something a bit different much good it just to see what's inside it you know in the spirit of like you what some of pre-roll West case we reviews on a Instagram see that minding some pretty roles and stuff seen exactly what's inside in that and I see these native boys peels and put quite a bit hard round at the moment a lot of people smoking on them like you know the business and that sort of for you know what let's cut one op see exactly what's inside it yeah it's only gonna be a short video like there wasn't quite as I can see what's inside to make sure they like stem use and often show that which I really don't think that will be you know nature would do the absolute business so I highly doubt it's gonna be anything sort [ __ ] in here but yeah let's get this a pre roll out and see exactly the same sue there is the pre-roll to start of it's a case then I'll show you as well we do have like a little glass I've wanted to be a little bit of weed in mind just unfortunate looking this being a bad stuff well yeah come to my class which obviously I'm gonna keep and reusing stuff damn certainly looks nice certainly smells nice as well really nice or skittle smoke coming up there so sweet through II sort of smell Klim yeah just a as well be is raining outside so I do apologize about that didn't hear that stuff but yeah anyway nature boys skittles pyrrole as you see you there let's get this opened up see what's inside it oh just got that cut open as you can see look all our weed there let's go certainly on Thursdays fictions it's looking at the business Google drive's anything that shouldn't be that's all the pulp order stove our classrooms everything you'll save a little bit in the middle well yeah natureboy skits you know you got break your dad didn't roll really nice damn yeah well I expected just really nice ground-up flour doesn't realize anything in there that shouldn't be in there absolutely don't think I can see anything anyway find it all stem is that just a sugar leaf you know it actually is sugar leaf they're so round itself [Music] yeah maybe it's honey's best I don't feel like a stem nut feels proper song might be Tony's bit stoner part from that looking pretty [ __ ] silent it's a nice ground flour it's not amazing that I put it out suppose for some great skills yeah certainly some diggin dogs as well which is just maybe it's been hand ground other than I probably Grandal to be fair a grinder this certain is it's a nice and well ground and I saw some really nice flower I don't know what I was expecting but I thought we were gonna see obviously I'm a DS need to boys pre-order many boom really nicely and stuff I just for whatever to one see exactly what's in there you know I've seen in the spirit of lots of a pre-roll and West case we review them and an Instagram afford apron assault so we could have another loss certainly seems like nothing untoward at the ordinary there's nice ground or flower Labadie the specs so yeah Nature Boy skills pyrrole well I have to do is we roll this now actually gets focus making it but yeah I must see the flash run quickly as well just so you can see that what and where I'm seeing just saw some really nice brown flour yeah it's we the flash on not really helping us see anything who have already seen things this you see for some nice grams of flour really really nice I rise today from that flush is doing anything frizz really is it yeah natureboy stick it was pretty rolled 1.5 grams maybe those are tiny that was stemming now I'm still not even sure if that was the spending it was proper soft and that look it might have been a tiny little step in there but apart from that it's all obviously for fire very nice ground-up flower so yeah and I we see comes with you little lacerations well fun you know sort of forget about Rosie a nice little feature on the pre-roll yellow flash boots like that grieve that that will certainly get some use out of so time to roll this [ __ ] back up like I said that's your meter boy skills 1.5 grab pre-roll go in just to check everything's what it should be in there yeah sound is always bigger major boys as well ways bringing as that fire and yeah what we do this so maybe different if you wanna see me got some more pretty girls let me know its best pure whatever Gordon actually a lot what's inside but yeah there we go Nature Boy skill was lucky a real soon with some washing your people I just wanted to hop on really quickly so bringing into this video obviously I just got that skittles pre-roll I have actually smoked it now as well well I've actually a build-up to spliffs out of what was left of it to sort of nice press smoke one absolutely fire banging taste to it some of the nicest skills I've tasted and the skills are reviewed the skills of my channel was definitely a ladder flavor the UK grade one and boy I would have said wow this the skittles wasn't necessarily as quite loud a flavor of some skills of smoke before the actual taste was bang on like initially tasted like some skittles like the sweet sort of thing no absolutely [ __ ] banging so yeah obviously I just wanted to hop on and say you know end of this pre-roll video have you seen what's inside there even sorted all right that was a little stem I personally not even sure that was still estab if it was it was certain very small stem but it was also not mud softened but certainly didn't affect you know or wouldn't have affected I'd imagine the way the pre-roll would have smoked yeah because it was been him you made bright white ash as you'd expect from eh boys so yeah I just wanted to hop on and just sort of bring that to an end bring it to a close sort of thing you know like anyway actually fought to the flower when I smoked it what's absolutely banging and if you want to see me got more pre-rolls you know see what's inside him and stuff let me know because I can do that yeah I also just want to say we're nearly at 2,000 subscribers it's a big everyone that subscribed really does mean a lot and we've got a cherry gelato and a dosey doe UK two different trains UK reviews coming soon and also going to do a little sort of 2k celebration sort of adventure maybe sort of video so you've got that to look forward to as well but yeah just want to hop hard and bring this video to a close let you know that that the skills was actually banging to smoke as well rather than us seeing what's inside it but yeah Bingle paper wasn't subscribed like I

live rosin by Kaui kosher and this is the GMO oh if you guys want to see an up-close look at this before I when I first opened it before I touched it go ahead and check it out [Music] just get a

__ ] day hope you guys are dabbing on something great today and let's get it in shall we damn it [ __ ] tastes amazing the flavor on this is so good I like Cali kosher it's a really clean it's really clean brand so far all the extracts I tried from them are all very clean and smooth not harsh grape flavor [Music] if you guys haven't tried to need any strains by Cali kosher I I definitely recommend checking them out oh one more in there one more let's get it all right I'm gonna take it's 2 for the review you know how I do I'm gonna take the second one out of my dizzle puffs I really like this cuz you can put a lot of water in it and hit it and it does not you don't get anything in your mouth so this is a cool ass [ __ ] rig I really like it I got it out of the daily high club daily high club box which I am no longer a part of because I cannot handle waiting the extra month for my [ __ ] product to come in but they do have a cool ass box I just don't feel like waiting an extra month to get it anymore okay cause I wear my hat to for the review you're gonna have to get the second one in on the dizzle puffs I gotta say out of stone eNOS this isn't the the like stoniest [ __ ] extract I've had but it is really [ __ ] clean and and it tastes really good it tastes good it's good I really like it it's just not one of the ones that's gonna put your dick in the dirt you know it is only 72 percent on the THC I've had extracts that are upwards of 90 you know percent on the THC so and if you guys didn't see the video or I eat the bugs go check that out those things don't look like they'd be that bad but almost puke they're not good let's go let's get this heat it up everybody who's not following my Instagram you need to do go do so because I will be doing another raffle giveaway doing a giveaway raffle whatever here in like next week so I'll be announcing at Monday so stay tuned for that there's no cars good a nice and hot now we got a letter sit for me those of you

like it a lot a good one all Quentin Tarantino films are [ __ ] good go got another nice Dibble on that for us let's put the sunglasses on for the last hit I bought some new ones the by electric I don't know if you guys have ever heard of electric these are the black tops they run you about 130 bucks if you want the polarize they're like 150 or 160 and 3040 bucks extra I like I'm gonna remind me of the old eazy-e glasses I think they're dope I with my sunglasses at night but it's not night time it's only like noon it is noon people on seven 10:17 extracts all right cheers everybody let's get the last dizzle drizzle in oh man that's some [ __ ] poop I'm gonna be sweating over here huh the other day when I got this hat I had them put a smoking a small town on the side of it'll it'd go okay start factoring everything in for this review smoothness it's really good it's not harsh on your throat it's not like [ __ ] me up right now yeah made me cough is that [ __ ] got me baked but my throat's good the taste is is a really clean GMO flavor a real strong GMO flavor I I really like the flavor price I got this a Manzanilla in Merced California and the price was a little steep it's gonna run you like thirty some almost forty bucks for the gram it's kind of pricey but it's really good product hey there's rosin not resin so Highness it's not it doesn't get me like the highest I've ever been off the extract I've been way more baked but like I said I've had [ __ ] upwards of 95 percent or higher so this is only a 72 percent and it hits like a 72 percent am I disappointed no I'm tremendum by am super baked I've just been hired so factoring everything in I am impressed with it even with the overall strain because I do like the flavor I am really baked and it's really smooth it's good stuff I like GMO so I'm gonna have to give it an even 8 I really like it because I like the flavor a lot and I am high so I'm gonna have to give it to even eight for the Cali kosher GMO live rosin bag they even ate it is a very solid strain I highly recommend it all right everybody that was my review until next time smoke in a small town", "1PXe4ZAsW0Q": "[Music] hi welcome to kena basics today we're loading herbal sage combs with weed keef and solvent list hash oil with the raw cone motor tool the new mean green herb ease from cyclones are in all natural tobacco free pre-rolled cones that we've really been enjoying here at Rafal studios the cones also happen to fit perfectly on the new raw cone loader tool that we debuted here a couple of months back the cones simply slide on the narrow tip of the cone load or tool where it will stay put while you scoop and funnel your ground herbs down into the cone the cones do come with a small plastic straw to pack the herbs in but we find it a lot more effective to use the tamping tool provided with the raw loader kit that wooden tool has a tapered shape with a narrow tip for firming up the skinny end of the cone near the filter and the wide end for tamping in the remainder and the wider end of the cone of course you could also load the cones very easily by hand but the loader does make it easier and less messy and if you're rolling multiple cones the loader is a real help [Music] now we have our cannabis loaded we're also want to juice it up with some very nice honey oil this is a solvent --less extract oil of green crack sativa and I'm using a syringe to drop a few drops into the end of the cone also leaving a little bit more room for some more goodies at the very tip now we're going to add in some Keef to fill out the last few centimeters now we have not tested these cones loaded fully with Keef but the impression is that it would be perfect for smoking Keef cones with an excellent taste of sage and keep complimenting nicely now our cone is fully packed and ready to light but before we do let's check out this cool offer for a limited time you can get an awesome raw mean green starter kit available only at roughhouse Studios this starter kit includes the raw colon loader tool 3 cyclones Mean Green herbal cones the raw clipper liner as well as an authentic raw mini rolling train check out the kit and many other items in this video at roughhouse studio smoke shop and save 10% off of everything with the code cannon basics now let's fire up this age cone and see how high we can get the cones have an excellent sweet sage flavor and smoke very very smoothly the wooden number seven dank tip also helps complement the smoothness of the burn and also stays nice and cool as you smoke the cone all the way down to the tip now we didn't have a little trouble with his comb burning unevenly mainly due to the oil we're dripped into it but even then it held together perfectly without dropping the cherry and even out and burned all the way to the tip despite the variety of contents inside I hope you enjoy checking out the new sage comes from cyclones if you did please hit the like button that's

keep a knife in my chest just to cut holes off i don't know i'm leaving a [ __ ] in the past i gotta go now what's up guys welcome back if you watched the last video and uh hello if you're new here um today we're about to smoke one of these west coast cure pre-rolls provided to us by jacob thank you very much jacob thank you i'm really hyped about those i've heard a lot of good reviews on west coast cures um i've never smoked one before i don't y'all never smoked one before right that's happening i tapped two hits off of one of these but haven't really got like a full experience okay cool and um i'll let you spark this thing up buddy this is chrisley i like how they put it in raw joints i like raw papers so i think that's pretty cool use that all natural taste yeah [Music] a little harsh [Music] damn this is pulling yeah you can't hear the [ __ ] section it stinks damn duncan it smells like some gas for me this is gonna be an easy hot box it does so now that i've gotten into it a little bit it's got a nice little it's got a nice little gassy taste to it under the i swear i think it's that keef it's super it's got a little stink to it for sure dude i mean it looks very hard so that [ __ ] pulls like i mean it pulls like shotgun like i really don't think it tastes that bad compared to other pre-rules we've had not many at least i mean it does have that pre-roll flavor but it's i i expected it to be hard yeah i mean this is [Music] perfect [Music] i hope our youtube channel gives you nostalgic memories and when you used to hang out with your bros and you smoke up or you're chilling with your brains and watching yes we're all bros here this is not bad it's not bad at all i mean [Music] that [ __ ] was yellow yeah he took a [ __ ] that was kind of nasty it's not bad i mean you can you could tell like it's probably a little a little old you know what i mean not the pre-roll of the bud sitting on the shelf a little too long yeah you got to get a pre-roll like the day they made that [ __ ] i mean like at least a week after they made it but like i mean [ __ ] bird there's no telling when they made think about it and you roll a joint right and you just have that [ __ ] sitting there for like a month right it's not going to taste like it did you do that exactly yeah that's what i mean like they need that you need to like if somebody rolled that [ __ ] or made that [ __ ] like that day that's fire i don't want a [ __ ] live resident or keith that's been sitting there for like a month or some [ __ ] bro like yeah facts look at him god damn it that's more expensive than milo and he doesn't even realize that's two of him like they make you buy cats be called or like buy pets really i mean when you go to a pet store and you have to buy it for like 40 dollars like you were just saying bro that's like it's just weird like you're kind of helping them you're helping them out by taking that cat off their hands so it's like i don't know why you're having fun and pay for it yeah that's what i'm saying like that i got it from an actual shelter and like they uh they make you pay adoption fees for the shots and they give it a chip beforehand and all that stuff and they also give you free they give you free like a chip yeah there's a chip in it just in case it got lost and they brought it back to the pound they could check it for a chip and it's got my number on it inside of them yeah it's like under his ear bro he's like [ __ ] he's like a clone bro order 66 right right like this like dude imagine one day just like all the cats that have chips and him like just [ __ ] somebody from the pet store is like executed 466 they just all start killing their [ __ ] owners and cats with [ __ ] machine guns [ __ ] blazer machine guns taking them out there's like yes my lord there's her like it's like the slice and jacob starting to sleep and she's liking rick and morty with the the dog had the [ __ ] robot suit yeah yeah that's a dude that was a good [ __ ] episode dude while he's taking that little hit here you want to talk a little bit about what you thought of that west coast uh yeah i mean i thought it was all right i mean like i said it's definitely not a fresh pre-roll so it's hard to tell like if it was like a brand new one i guarantee you it's really [ __ ] fire you'd definitely tell that was like it's pretty old but it got me high but that's all that matters i guess at the end of the day you know what i mean but yeah i mean the taste and everything it wasn't really there it was it was okay it was all right it was i gave it about like a a six and a half because it got me like high but like taste wise and stuff it was not there in my opinion but that like i said that's an older one so i'm not going to sit there and say like west coast here suck because i've heard really good things about them so i might have got like a dud kind of yeah i mean i bought this a week ago for the video yeah exactly so yeah i mean there and it probably was like made weeks before that so yeah if not yeah so this is what you the price you pay when you're getting a a three roll in my opinion i think the pre-roll it wasn't i'm on the same page but ever wasn't anything special when it came to the flavor um but i definitely would say it accelerated my heart yeah yeah for sure we were already kind of getting before we started so yeah i mean it got me high so i feel like it just um it's cool all in all like it was good it got me high and like that's what i want um i just feel like the taste wasn't there you know like it just it and i mean that is that's what you're you know you're gonna get with pre-roll that's what i said today yeah so all in all it was a pretty good point i mean i or joint it got me high i mean that's that's what matters yeah so pretty much we all said the same thing yeah i i pretty much about have the same the same thing to say i mean it was really it got me high it was a nice uh a nice feel and everything it was smooth but the flavor that i wanted out of pre-roll for that kind of price just wasn't there yeah i expect more of it it's probably like trim or shake that's been sitting in that you know in that joint for like months and i mean it's like i said earlier you know if you if you roll a joint of some gas right top shelf even you sit that [ __ ] in in the cabinet for like what a month even if you put it in a nice little glass jar sealed up it's not going to taste the same it's just not dude and that that's the case i got high i mean i know there's some gas in there because i'm high and there was five heads on that so i mean i noticed some gas dude don't get me wrong um especially if you take a dab after that you know you get really stunned there's some pre-rolls though that like are [ __ ] insane bro but like it's just like you're asking for like a hundred dollars for one joint so that's just just not me but like that's okay you're smoking like four grams in one joint which is cool i get it like it honestly it equals up to 100 but like i just don't want to smoke all that at once i want to save my [ __ ] but that [ __ ] is probably like where it's at that's probably those are probably the pre-rolls you're really going for you're probably not gonna find a solid pre-roll that's only like a gram and it's just strictly but you know i mean like you need to pre-roll with dabs or some live resin in it some [ __ ] like that really get a good taste out of it but you get to say the option buddy okay uh what do i need to say did you just say it dude now y'all got me like thinking all that [ __ ] guys all right i gotta get um wait a second all right so uh yeah thanks for watching the video um so or all right whatever milo is hungry dude dude just do it then if you want to do i don't know the [ __ ] favor all right do you want to do it again endeavor yeah um all right so yeah that's pretty much the video um i hope you all like that [ __ ] uh please leave a like if

minutes food up on the wavy fam that is real one merge because these are all dude the merch anytime there's a merge drops yeah you know I'm like after like one minutes available I'm like on the side

see I don't bring it back and it's about to get night time for you guys cuz I know a lot of you I wanted to see the night time so stay tuned see if it gets night gang [Music] keep down please smoke everywhere we go [Music] let's go baby fam we got the joint lit as you can see it is ripping you guys you guys see the cherry on that thing I think it's back what you guys think about it yes I really like the tip that it has on it it's like I never seen a tip like that before but I'm really liking it because it keeps all the Scooby Snacks we're coming in your mouth and we also noticed that you don't have to get a hella hard like I thought that you had to be like you know how like when you roll hella fat you've got to hit it hard know that one you can hit it regular like a regular joint and it's hitting really good yeah I'm hitting it way too hard it is pretty heavy you guys there's hella [ __ ] weed in there I mean what the weed included but the tip is pretty heavy left away the tip itself see how much it that's some Gaston I didn't even know there was constant rain there either I just see like the celebrity spike scenes and I was like in aware how much to smoke on what should be cat he was saying that bringing a joint like this is like bringing like a bottle oh yeah like okay it's like usually when you go see like a family friend or just somebody like that's important to you bring him like a like a cake or a bottle you know something for like this nice gift big Oh join make sure if you have it comes to your size I mean if you ever go see your friends you pull up with one of these and yeah and if you live in a set you better keep its rental in your pocket in case you're looking up saw yeah it's kind of running a little bit late yeah that's the only thing that I'm trying to figure out how would you stop that or just [ __ ] probably start lighting the other side once I feel like you need to have like [ __ ] yeah look we did it work to catch it up old fashioned hello saliva you know stop the look going out right hopefully that works let me know what you guys do to stop your plants from running put it on but so far what do you guys what do you think I'm highest luck gets high in here it's boxy to be honest with you I'm gonna give mine to pee I'm not gonna if I go it's its exhibits joint the [ __ ] flavor is could be more flavor II like I've been smoking some SF cultivators wedding pie $61 out the door testing at 31% that [ __ ] is way better way better than this but I mean I don't know maybe maybe I maybe it's the concentrates too though I'm just doing a little bit of flavor yeah I mean honestly I'm gonna keep it really guys I feel like it's not hitting like a hundred percent it could be I think if you roll do be better but yeah you know I don't like the fact that it's running so bad I think that's like my main problem with it and yeah I feel like I'm wasting away I'm so high that I'm just like [ __ ] you know but it's like if I were to rolled it I'd be more pissed because it's like damn you exhibit homies these are hand rolled them I see them making them I'm pretty sure I have no idea what is each test bet just a big flex guys we're smoking a [ __ ] $184 joint what let me know if there's things that you guys feel like it's just for the foot I feel like designer is just for the Flex you know I know bass quality to this testing at 27 percent by the way pretty high 27 percent concentrate don't see any wax running or anything like that either so I'm not really sure where the concentrate is in the joint I mean it is like white ash though all the way yeah it definitely does the job oh yeah let's play baseball you know what I was thinking is that like it's a big guys joint you want it to last you how long Lee I don't know I didn't set a timer but it's feel like I'm going kind of fast yeah yeah you right sure it's eight I mean there's still no cuz it's hella fat but it's like you think you'll be just custom

quick all right my dude justin from the calm leaf hit me up says smoke doc i want you to try one of these i said sure why not bro and he sent me over a delta eight pre-roll okay and this delta eight pre-roll is coming from farmer barn those are the people that uh manufacture these um uh the name of this one is plowed pre-rolled joints and the manufacturer again is farmer barn okay but you can get these on the calm leaf site guys all right and y'all already know i'm gonna hook y'all up all right all the info be below pinned first comment let's open this up this has a good taste to it too okay

pre-roll so there's no harshness there's no taste there's no trace of the delta eight so you would actually think that you're smoking a regular pre-roll [Music] i like it i'm just waiting for my first effects to come in so i can let you guys know what this is about see y'all guys can see that there's extra smoke burning off because most of the time i'm not sure how they spray the delta eight onto it but if you ask me i believe it's somewhat like a moon rock but with the delta eight keef instead genius right guys genius i don't think it's possible oh yeah whoa that was a good one like i was saying i don't think it's possible to grow delta eight flower you have to create it but what i'm doing now is trying to find out the companies that's doing the best job at that and i gotta honestly say this pre-roll is delicious it's smoking good and yes i got that fix got the effects already so i guess the more i smoke the more you know what i'm gonna get y'all guys go check this out all right

"[Music] [ __ ] enemy I'll fill it in a finish it today we got a law review about dr. zodiac moon rock free roll but before we get into that [ __ ] of course you know I gotta ask you [ __ ] of [ __ ] please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate anybody that's here and always say cuz I just [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that see if you get a notification anytime I make sure you also follow me over on Instagram it's kind of make underscore no cat that would be make sense canna under [ __ ] that cannot underscore what it is anyway yeah you think I already smoked this [ __ ] right but [ __ ] bad let's get into it slow down I don't know if you guys remember back some time ago I had done a review on dr. zodiacs moon rock vape cartridge that [ __ ] was pretty fire so I figured why not do one of the pre-roll that they have now with this free roll was so cool about it we'll find out if it's actually cool but it has it says it has a supreme cannabis flower I hate when they say they like who is supreme top notch tell me the [ __ ] string that damn it but anyway they got flour here does also keep inside of it it also says cannabis extract which is like it has a sauce in here and it says terpenes so we'll see what the deal is on this [ __ ] let's open it mmm okay so I'm gonna see that you got to keep on the outside the tubes no good I will say that okay so the powder is on the outside the Keith and I'm not a fan to keep on the outside of my [ __ ] and I ain't saying it's wrong I understand I'm not a fan of that [ __ ] and the reason for it is but I will say they didn't over adjust it because some of them just be so [ __ ] frosty when you go to a [ __ ] off you keep just balling up - god damn it so it seems like they didn't over dust it so with it being on the outside it might not be a problem from that so I give it to him on that now I will say on the flip side of me saying I don't like to have it on the outside sometime we'll know if I could say they put them on the inside I got a pre-roll before and I open that [ __ ] up and I didn't find a drop I keep in that [ __ ] and ain't no way nobody can convince me that the [ __ ] was just in the bud and I didn't see it because I'm still gonna put it in my grinder and I shook it so my keep catcher and I didn't get any Keef out of it really so that is one thing when they put it on the inside I don't know if they tell the truth that's really in there so if I put it on the outside that does kind of at least let me know that that [ __ ] is there and like I say it doesn't seem like they over did this it looks like there's probably about point to the point three of a gram on that and of Keith so I think they did a pretty good job on that so I gotta give it sold now this is a little too big from a slaver later yeah man the Snider lighters Douglas an electric lighter if you haven't seen that I got a reveal that two dishes dope but this head is a little too fat to fit inside of it there's my [ __ ] sick as [ __ ] watch nice right so anyway I'll just use a regular lighter see I wish it is that's nice make them up like a sit back like man he leaned back mmm this is nice I like it has really good flavor to it damn I like that [ __ ] he got a pretty taste to it yeah man yeah I'm not I - I might a fan when people put like extracts and [ __ ] in joints I haven't felt like it's wasting extract because the temperature ain't hot enough to really give you the effects from it you know so if that's this almost like sin you might as well just smoke a bowl of dab instead of anything so I don't really like mixing concentrate with flowers and stuff like that because I just realize they don't really make a difference I mean I just feel like I'm wasting extract like let me know y'all so I can go with opinion on that [ __ ] like if y'all think is beneficial or anything because I might be overlooking something on that but to me it's kind of a waste when you do that but they did it on this and I'm not gonna front it but if I can taste I can I honestly can taste the extract the sauce that's in there because you know it's sauce when you hit it on the right type of vaporizer or even just the right type of though I'm not fake but the rig sorry is what I'm trying to say if you get it the right way on the rig at the right Tim you can really really really taste like the terpenes in it so I can really taste the terpenes in this but I can also get that that extract flavor to it I don't know how to describe it you know you get like a after flavor of a dad when you dad that's what I'm kind of getting from that so I kind of got to give it to yeah I like this and it's rolled into Rock own man we're all coming up they got everybody putting these [ __ ] and they stood up yo I just ordered a new bait it's a US adult it's so just like weed and wax and [ __ ] it's the pulsar rock so we don't see how that [ __ ] is so show Peter next week so as soon as I get it of course you know I'm gonna [ __ ] do that [ __ ] for y'all right but Jimmy much else about that start cooking my food for the week get my meal prep in I also got some good news for y'all but I gotta get this series together to show y'all but I got some really fun stuff coming I'm kind of kicking it talking to a child right now what the [ __ ] else can I say about I got a I'm joined but I got some pretty cool stuff for y'all coming like you guys really really really encouraged me when I did the video of showing what bud tenders see like [ __ ] but tender see you guys gave me some very encouraging words so it kind of encouraged me to do some other [ __ ] so I got a lot of stuff that I would be doing for you and I'm working on things right now so just sit tight I know my videos have been a little slow posting cuz I've been working on some other type of things but that's why I figured let me make sure I do this so I could at least holla at y'all but there's all kind of [ __ ] on the way like coming so stay tuned [ __ ] so that is the end of this video I would say that I do like that pre-roll definitely I definitely like it three worlds a lock but every once in a while I like to get one and so on it's kind of cool to know which ones delish and I don't think I've ever done one on a review with you guys on one so I figured why not do that [ __ ] so anyway that's the end of this [ __ ] I'm out of this [ __ ] all right so it's Kennedy make sure you go follow me over on Instagram make sure you can actually got me hooked up okay let me rewind a shrew shrew okay so make sure you follow me on Instagram

yeah guys thank you so much for sticking with us here recently um youtube's really been trying to try to play us for a fool here recently so um you guys saw that we took all the videos down we took them down for a little bit just because we've been going through every video just to make sure that they can't find one thing because i don't know if you guys realize this but we only it only takes two more faulty videos faulty for youtube turns videos for our channel to completely go away so we definitely appreciate you guys continually tuning in we also appreciate you guys following us all the way into our brand new studio this is our first official studio i guess you could say yeah we've had a few bedrooms at double dev studios a living room that doubled as a studio so i mean now we just got a studio that's a studio oh yeah it's exciting so appreciate fist pound to you guys too if we've made it this far um but let's let's kind of get into this video and see what we're gonna smoke today definitely it's actually quite an exciting episode we have the herb delta 8 t8c caviar cone so it's got hemp flower with some delta 8 distillate rolled in some hemp flower keefe so i mean no complaints there it's point eight of a gram and it comes in dope packaging it kind of kind of got a little med seal on it oh is there an actual sticker on there too yeah it's a a seal sticker so there's a seal and then it's just like can you grab that i don't want it to fall yeah got it there we go so i mean i it's coming in i mean the the lab tests say at about 40 um i think it's 80 delta eight and then twenty percent the cbd flowers okay and then we got the uh the keef rolled in there as well so it is a caviar cone yeah it's our first delta eight caviar cone as for the first episode in our new studio you may see us bounce back to our old studio for a few episodes those are just ones that we've recorded locked in the chamber ready to go oh youtube let us and youtube wouldn't let us um send them out because we we got um banned for that week yeah and so some companies that we've worked with they they wanted to keep those videos in the backlog so um we'll have those coming out for you here soon we just wanted to make a video clarifying for you guys what's been going on in that cbd hemp library is still alive and kicking in and just so you guys know go ahead subscribe to free chl if anything ever happens again that's where it gets the updates because that's going to be our backup channel we really appreciate you guys that set up there it's been it was a cool week honestly just seeing the support that we got from you guys and we really appreciate it yep definitely i mean the youtube algorithm god seem to be fighting against us right now but here at cbd hemp library we fight back always and um we're not we're just going to continue making content we're going to try to you know figure out the rules and they flagged us i think goes for a link on the bottom of a video so we're not going to have links directly to the products underneath the video they may or may not be in a pinned comment depending on who's listening but um check that out oh yeah and um we'll also try to have like maybe an under scroll here at some point i don't know if it'll be in this video with the link so you could type it out yourself it really helps us out more than you could even know oh definitely and usually we have coupon codes with a lot of our products so that's to help you guys out and use those coupon codes away but this is also it we said it was from the company herb but we got it from the shop great cbd shop we've been getting a good amount of um delta eight thc from great cbd um they definitely have had a lot of different quality products a lot of different quality brands so definitely excited to see what what herb has cooking up in this j here i agree it is um the first few hits it is like your typical caviar joint in terms of it you taste it burns a little bit slow it every hit's a little heavier because you're getting distilled flour way easier sorry to cut you off to start out you know a lot of a lot of caviar joints are hard to pull yeah because there'll be a lot of wax stuck in there and things like that or it's just packed too tightly but it's it's so easy to pour yeah it is pulling nice that's true and it is pretty smooth i mean it is you know when you're mixing keef distillate flour paper you do get a little bit of extra harshness and if you're comparing it to a just a regular joint but it's not it's not overboard i would say it's it's decently smooth the taste again i think it all tastes also takes a hit in this type of joint yeah typically because i mean if you like that delta uh not delta if you like that flour cbd flour taster even if it was mixed with regular thc or whatever i any oil in a j is typically gonna decrease the taste by a little bit yeah and let us know like so for free chl as you guys saw most of our videos were hovering 30 to 40 minutes with a much longer video so please comment below if you want to see that we may make free chl like a podcasting channel and always a backup for it we like making content to be honest we put out as much as i can edit at this point so um but if you guys like to see those podcasts like to watch us see us watch some games or do long form like that i mean i think that that can be arranged we have enough delta a and enough cbd to to talk for to talk for a few years at this point for sure i mean and we always appreciate y'all tuning in really without the audience i don't think this studio would have ever been it wouldn't have been possible no so we appreciate you guys because we're moving up um cbd's moving up delta eight thcs moving up hope you guys moving up at home i'm actually moving up as well right now every time i hit this jam again i'm moving a little up hell yeah a little bit more lifted exactly and i don't know does this have a strain it had i think it was literally yeah it's called lifted lifted okay yeah so it's not really necessarily a strain in there yeah it has a it's called lifted because i'm sure the key strength could be different from the flower from the delta eight terpene profile or whatever it's definitely a unique mix of uh ingredients i guess i agree it's pretty nice right now burning perfectly also it's burning perfectly definitely can't complain about that at all also if you guys want to see some cho showcases we're trying to get those back popping we had stopped because we didn't have the space and then with the youtube bs and stuff like that i want to get some of those and i want to get some non-rappers and different stuff we actually have one that we have in the chamber that we've been looking to release to you guys recently here too but with cbd hemp library going down for that week and stuff like that that really set us back because we released so much and we have so much schedule that that week really threw us off but we're right we're doing what we can what we got let me double check the cam real quick we're good hey we're good what are you thinking about for for taste because i think it's definitely not as good as just normal flour but at the same time the taste is still pretty good yeah i would say i mean yeah exactly i would say in comparison to other caviar cones that we've had it tastes similar i wouldn't say it's way better but i think with this type of product there's only a certain like grade of taste that you could even get to yeah i would say this is smoother but what are you thinking for overall uh tastes great overall taste probably eight and a half personally like it's like i said it's you go into it expecting it to taste like this like i didn't i didn't expect it sorry to taste like just quality flour i agree and i think i would agree with the rating as well it's 8.5 it isn't the smoothest it isn't the best tasting but you know you're getting into and you have a caviar cone especially with delta 8 you just want to get a little lifted people want to know if the results are the results if they work we've got a question a lot does delta 8 work depends what you're looking to solve but if you're looking to get lifted it may or may not work depending on who's listening no just kidding it works typically it works i said 8.5 for taste as well i think so now we're going to get on to the the effects as we finish this j i will say one uh half episode in i guess you could say the studio feels homey it's nice it's like a nice vibe it's nice and guys we haven't done hardly anything to it we got a couch over here we got this table here we just set up this stuff but yeah they're going to implement the green screen back in but we're also going to have a background it's not a huge room but it's enough space for us to have our own little personalized background and things like that so um we definitely want to make this exciting for you guys and if people come on to the show we want it to be a fun place to hang out and things like that so i'm definitely gonna keep upgrading the studio if you want to um hit me up if you want a cash app or something like that to help out with the studio that'd be dope because definitely this is definitely not free um but we're definitely doing what we can and trying to do as much as we can piece by piece cbd is important and delta 8's important that's why i really felt it was important to keep making videos last week because i mean at the end of the day [ __ ] youtube like if they don't want us to keep making videos we're going to keep finding ways to get videos on there we're gonna hopefully get a website here soon so you guys can see what our top favorites are and things like that we're trying to we're trying to really fight for for the cannabis movement here definitely the cannabis movement is the most important movement going right now well maybe not but maybe not the but maybe not the most important movement but it's an important one and it's one that shouldn't stop being [ __ ] up and forgotten about this is a lot of stuff yeah and in some instances maybe it should have gotten forgotten about but at the same time it really is in our opinion i can speak for sergio because we've talked about it so much a loot of a lot of the issues that are in this country come from specifically like obviously it's drug things and things like that but specifically from the fighting of cannabis 100 yeah i mean i will say i feel i definitely feel lifted from the uh from the caviar joint but it seems that it's like this with delta nine as well the cbd the pure hemp kind of like neutralizes neutralizes it yeah it's almost like a more focused lift you know it's not like i don't feel like oh man you know the giggles are the munchies it's more just like a cone clear and collected 100 i'm really enjoying it like this is like a one one off type thing in this type of pack but um if a new company is out there listening a great idea is if you can get these into some hemp six of ten pack so i'm like they don't even have to be covered in keef they're just like a small like point threes point fours and just have a pack of those yeah i would actually i don't buy two i don't buy too much of this stuff i would buy that i agree because that's nice it's a ten pack something you could take anywhere you go and stuff like that have that at an outdoor bar or a brewery or something like that smoking one of those shits or sipping a beer something that'd be nice man get weird look so i will tell you i've been out in a couple bars and i just sparked a regular cbd joint everyone's like what the [ __ ] this guy's a smoking reefer here like you're damn right smoking reef damn skippy is that the devil's lettuce dude it is indeed it is sir oh we lit it with this bee line off so by the way man this [ __ ] doesn't disappear at all i swear i've been smoking the [ __ ] tough with this [ __ ] you haven't been smoking the hamburger i haven't been smoking i can't i don't know how i would do that but definitely been lighting [ __ ] up with it shout out to the official cbd hemp library and we've given up on the other pad the most limited of additions we're supposed to get more but they're actually they're gone six in existence six so shout out to you five people out there that have one and bought one with the first pack because definitely there are literally only five out in the world i don't even know how many of it lasted or how many you guys still smoke with it or whatever but i smoke with this quite often i'm scared for when the butane runs out of it because there are literally six in existence i actually don't even have one that's absolutely true it's here in the studio does not personally actually have one not that he really likes anything when he smokes mostly a vape smoker but still yeah exactly so you fiverr damn near more cbd hemp librarians than sergio it's very true you have a picture a lighter with my face on it this shit's dope though yeah what are you thinking for a fix i'm at the new studio that's dope too no i agree in the given to have the studio get the door closed only get here guys we get to usually we get up and we flip the bed and [ __ ] like that back now i'm just gonna get up and walk out there and go get something to eat it's pretty crazy it happened fast because i really did it was like [ __ ] i can't get in a place and the next thing you know you're like yeah i'm moving tomorrow [ __ ] it's happening money talk indeed it does but i will say in terms of effects for me so far this might be the perfect midday smoke obviously not the whole thing to the dome but this effect wise is like if if i just coming down from a little bit of cup of coffee just had my lunch about to walk back into work this gives me that type of energy i feel a little lifted but there's the calm there's a focus and i'm kind of ready to kick the day's ass yeah i would be curious to see honestly what it was like facing one of these i think i would like it especially like a saturday morning smoke or something like that i don't have too much [ __ ] to do that day but i agree with sergio if i had one of these i would take a few puffs of it midday and go back to work i now work across from my job so just walk over here for lunch take a few puffs maybe play a game of ping pong and then walk back over yeah i agree and i mean four effects pretty much cleared it out now it's really what i would look for in a midday joint so i mean i'm gonna go with a 9.25 i got you i would tell y'all um that i in my personal opinion the keith doesn't add crazy amount of value on to it it kind of just makes it harder to hold but at the same time the effects are nice and like they're just saying it's nice midday smoke but i i wouldn't say it got me as lifted as the last one we had and that might have been because there was so much cbd neutralizing the delta hthc yeah um but at the same time it's been pretty nice um for my effects i think i'm gonna go with uh eight point seven five percent so if i will say in terms of pure lift that's not really what i'm grading it on because it doesn't like you said it doesn't get you as lifted as you know pure delta eight carts or edibles or anything like that j we have that yeah it's true and the other delta h a so it is in terms of lifts it is a bit on the lower end and that may be because of how much distillate how much cbd whatever it may be but it still is a good overall feel and this is actually i think this would be perfect for somebody who doesn't like being too lifted i agree somebody who's not getting who wants the that actual edge between cbd and thc that line to where damn cbd doesn't quite do it for me but delta 8 gets me a little bit too lifted let me mix them together i think if you're that person who says those words verbatim i think you should try one of these j's definitely 100 especially if you say it verbatim then it's meant to be then it's meant to be supposed to get it yeah 100 so again shout out to y'all for watching shout out to the new studio we're going to keep making improvements we're going to keep grinding it out oh yeah shout out to herb shout out to great cbd shop for supplying us with the herb that's a that's a nice sentence shout out to the delta 8 thc caviar cone it's been a good one i mean it's always overall grade almost forgot overall grade for me um i'm going to give it an a minus actually it sneaks into that elite product range for me because i do wish it was more of them and but i mean you're buying one pre-roll but um it would be dope if it wasn't a pack of them or something like that because it is something that i could probably smoke one of these whole ones in a sitting yeah i'm by myself if i'm being honest and usually when i buy something like this i would want to be split by people or something like that but i'd really probably want one by myself if i was being completely honest but still it's an elite product it has me feeling good um so to be honest it's on the b plus plus a minus fringe but i let it sneak into the a minus simply because one it's also a new product and it's nice it's it's four like we said that smoker who wants in between cbd and thc definitely it's definitely a niche product something you know celebratory i don't know if this will be your main consumption of cbd or delta eight but it's definitely something fun to spark up when you're in a celebratory mood or want to start the weekend off right or whatever it may be but i'm in that same b plus a minus ballpark but i'll let it i'll let it slide into the a minus as well okay it isn't doesn't leave there's not much to complain about i would say but there still leaves some room for growth there there could be a bit better in terms of like overall effect and things like that so again shout out to great cbd shop for supplying

stoner fans is the real senior stoner back at you for a instructional session on how to make Jimmy joins I'm gonna be rolling eight so I'm gonna be using two cans and here's what we use in addition to that if you don't already know we use easy wider one and a half gold only we use THC distill it this is Applejack we use vaping it extracts moon rocks farmers reserve out of Mendocino County we use Keef custom-made for me diesel and we use what I call dry sift moon rock dry sift diamonds I have these made for me they are dry so I can crumble them into my Jimmy joint the first indica strain we're gonna use is King Louie King Louie's one of my favorites this was actually collected in January this is very very fresh flower but I want you to take a look at it and remember I told you my evaluation process from flower so let's go do it before I roll I inspect and the inspection process goes the following way I like to verify what I'm getting at all times I think it's very important so I put everything I buy under light with a magnification of tent and it frankly helps helps mid mrs. stoner understand the cost factor in better weed and really understand that we're getting what we're paying for take a look these bugs have some of the prettiest red hairs on them that I've seen in a long time okay so this is gonna be the first bug we're gonna use and what I like to do is put it up kind of so I know what's going on and then take a very close inspection with my tweezer light okay this bud is for you is what the said to me now what I do is go with the process here's the process distill it gets rolled on the following way you hold the paper with your finger and then right next to your finger touch the table then go all the way to the end so you're basically leaving enough room for you to take and use it as roach because it's gonna drip down you know distill it really melts into the joint that's why I like to use it a lot but you don't want to use too much distill it use about 1/10 of a gram of distill it in each joint and I'm gonna show you what a line looks like that's a line of distill it you see it what I encourage you to do is play with your own formula you might not need joints as strong as I roll them you know because I put so much into them it increases my per joint cost obviously now these cans are nitrogen sealed for freshness the brand is Queen of Hearts you can look it up the very popular commercially available brand but they've got a lot of traction that's why I use them they've got a lot of traction they've got a lot of credibility they've got a lot to lose so they really have to do their homework when they're adding streams and such because those of us who are queen-of-hearts people we know the streams we like we know the strains we don't like it's not as simple as just discontinuing something so now what I do is I take the buds and hand crumble them and when I say hand crumble I mean hand crumble this is not a time for a grinder I've really perfected these joints to another level and just so you can see this is the texture I like to get the flour to like to get it to that texture let's proceed it's gonna take me a little while to roll up eight but I want you to see the concept the concept is everything gets done the same way to every single joint that is really the key to the Jimmy joint is that I make them all great okay now I only go one way in Jimmy joints that's up what I mean is I only add to the formula I never take away I would never call just the joint of marijuana Oh Jimmy toid you Jimmy's way it's a very very specialized item frankly it should give you the effect of a vape pen a bomb and a DAB rig all in one just watching mrs. stoner smoking Jimmy joint at night sometimes it's very gratifying to see how medicated she gets just not a few hits not like taking a few hits of a regular joint I've made in that way I think what we're gonna do is we're gonna roll for for you guys because rolling eight might just take too long and I'll make you suffer through the video I don't want to make you all do that but let's look closely once they move my hands and what I've done here let's move closely let's get in a little bit here here we go okay so can you now see up on it a little bit better I'll move that and you see where the weed is how the flower now is equal I have equal amount of hand hand ground flower okay now remember historically what I would do with it Jimmy joints is I would have flour mixed already in Jimmy joint mixture and add that in since I started using Queen of Hearts flour there's really no need to do that this flour is already Emeralds best kicked up a notch flour honestly I've never had any better no matter what strain I get it's just magnificent the Queen of Hearts let's go into the next part next part is our moon rock now with a moon rock it's a really unique process you almost just want to wave it over it I'm very serious about that moon rocks are really hard to come by the real ones so you want to just get a little taste of moon rock into each joint a crumb of moon rock I went to Amsterdam once make a long story short - the cannabis cup with a buddy of mine we were judges and I brought about a gram of hash back I was so scared to bring stuff back I made that gram of hash last year's years I was putting a grain a little grain into joints here's my teeth what I do with the Keith is basically a pinch a pinch spread out over the whole joint a pitch spread out over the whole joint a pinch spread out over the whole joint a pitch spread out of the whole joint you do it the same every single time that is the key to Jimmy joint consistency now what I do is I go into the diamonds the dry diamonds and I put some on my finger don't laugh and then I crumble them into each joint individually so it's like a powder it's like a very fine dust that gets into the joints now what happens is when you smoke that dust you're basically smoking solid dab that make any sense so I mean we're talking about really strong joints because I put a lot of dust in roll that up safely but then what you do obviously is take the joint make sure everything is in its proper place now remember you put diamonds on this thing you gotta be more careful than you would be with just a regular joint you don't want the diamonds falling out so you try to crimp the sides as best you can and roll these are one gram or 1 point 1 gram joints with all the other things added in they come out pretty thick we do the same thing and repeat it and move on the key once again is consistency you know one of the things I don't like having to do is reaching into my joints and worrying about which one I'm gonna get oh did I get the strong so for me it's about knowing they're all the same in terms of potency they're going to taste different because I use different strings I'll use the brand Queen of Hearts but I do use different strains this is an indica roll I will I will roll indica heaviest I'll make a 10 or 20 roll indica then I'll do a 6 to 8 roll sativa and a 3 to 5 roll hybrid keep them in a different pouch so they're easy to distinguish the buds look really different between sativa and indica it's really cool when you start rolling different strains like that when you go from indica sativa it's really an interesting feeling and your fingers because the buds actually feel different when you crumble them you know the size of the buds are different it's a very interesting process I encourage you to think about rolling in bulk you're rolling more than a few joints at one time it's more efficient for your time it really lets you put your ingredients out in front of you that know what's going into every joint consistently hope you enjoyed this Jimi joint demo haven't done one in a while for you all it's a real senior stoner have a great day out there Cheers", "YE0ybIVUu6E": "Joe Avella: Lowell Herb\nCo. is one of California's largest marijuana companies. Lowell specializes in producing\npacks of pre-rolled joints. Last year, it rolled and\nsold over 4 million joints. In order to do so, Lowell needs a lot of cannabis. This is David Elias,\nCEO of Lowell Herb Co. David Elias: Right now,\nwe're selling about 1,100 pounds a month, soon to be up to almost\n1,300 pounds a month. We're rolling 25,000 joints\na day out of this facility. Joe: The recent legalization\nof cannabis in California for recreational use has allowed companies like Lowell to grow at a rapid rate. David: As of last year, our revenues have\nincreased just over 300%. Joe: Lowell let me take a\npeek inside its facility to see how they make\nso many joints a year. Thank God, because I roll\nmaybe two or three a year, and they're all terrible. Let's check it out. How you doing? David: Right now, we're best known for our one-eighth pack of pre-rolls, which is seven pre-rolls\nin one-eighth of an ounce. We also have a quarter-ounce pack, which has double the number. We have jarred flower, which we sell one-eighth\njarred flower as well. AJ Fay: So, this is where\nwe store all of our flower. When it comes in, it goes\ninto a quarantine container, which is where we do our\ninitial R&D lab testing. When that comes back clear and it passes our\nquality-control standards, it moves over into these\nother two joined containers, which is all usable material. Joe: Each container\nholds about 2,000 pounds of marijuana. My new LinkedIn profile pic. Joe: Strawberry Banana, Mimosa. AJ: Some Gorilla Glue. Joe: Silky Johnson. AJ: The Rude Boy. Joe: The Rude Boy. You got any favorite strains? AJ: Sour Diesel. I love Durban Poison, and I love that Strawberry\nBanana; it's a great indica. Joe: All right, cool.\nAJ: Really relaxing. Joe: You seem like an indica guy. (laughs) The cannabis is put into this shaker to separate the big buds\nfrom the little buds. The big ones will be\nput in jars like these. Employee: This is 77 eighths in total. Joe: Seventy-seven eighths? Employee: Yeah. Joe: So... that's... gonna be 7 pounds? AJ: No, that's, like,\nless than half a pound. Joe: The first step in making\nso many pre-rolled joints requires this machine: a knock box. One-hundred paper cones,\npre-attached to filters, are loaded into the machine. Lowell starts with a blend of flower, which is added to a loading tray. Each tray holds 1 gram of cannabis. The tray is placed on top of the knock box and the machine vibrates and bounces, pulling the flower down\ninto the paper cones. Once the joints are filled, the trays are brought over to a roller. AJ: So, we have about 40\nrollers working each day on one tray per hour, so 100 joints per hour per roller, and that's where we get our about 25,000 joints rolled per day. Joe: Then the joints are\nbrought over to another station where they are placed\nin packages and sealed. David: When you think about pre-rolls, pre-rolls are very convenient. It's easier for the user; they don't have to buy the flower and roll it and then put it into a joint. Joe: Lowell also sells flower in jars if you like to roll your own joints. David: Here in California, we test for pesticides, microbials and potency. So, when a customer gets our product, they can actually see the\nTHC potency right on the pack and know that it's been tested for all the other items that are mandatory here in California. AJ: So, once everything's\nproduced and packaged, it moves into this container, which is our quarantine container. Joe: Gotcha. AJ: So, the lab comes here on site, they send their reps, and they do a random sampling based on the batch size. Joe: So, they just go in,\nthey grab one of these. AJ: So, this was a box of 25, they took two or three out\nof there for lab testing. Joe: Yeah, \"lab testing.\" AJ: And in a few days\nwe'll get the results back, which means if it passes it's able to be labeled and sold to the retailers. Joe: OK. How often do they\ncome through with tests? AJ: We test every single\nMonday, Wednesday, and Friday. Joe: After it passes, the products are labeled, boxed, and shipped out. Got his newest product. They're coming out with 17-pound joints.", "ZVAVZvE2SBE": "this channel is strictly for viewers 18 plus i do not use or promote the sale of illegal drugs or harmful substances this video was recorded

here on channel 4 2008 today we're going to be determining is West Coast cure cured joints aka pre-rolls really worth 15 bucks a pop I think it's affordable for a pre-roll 15 books in it really bad I feel like that's how much pre-rolled should be costing across every brand alright I just depends like what store you go to sometimes you can find a 3-pack for 25 bucks this string that we're going to be smoking on is wedding cake they say there's one whole gram in here the packaging I like I like the way it's like simple black it comes in like maybe like I don't know how you guys smoke or Medicaid but if you do blunt this is like what a pack looks like for one so that's why I like it opening it up it has a really pungent smell to it like a very very strong weed smell loving the tasting west coast here I love west coast care brands you can never go wrong with west coast here whether it's a pin a pre-roll dabbing and I just really like this I cannot wait to spark this up this smells like wedding cake cookie actually so we're gonna spark this up my roommate bought me a new laptop for the channel I'm so excited so we're actually going to set up the laptop it sparked this at the same time see how highly actually okay so if you're not getting high right now whip up that blunt you've got that joint you've got that read and let's get it okay I'm gonna actually cut this pre-roll open just like the tip and then we can break it down the last 30 seconds of the video and see what's inside the taste is impeccable like this like I said the smell of the stream was fruity and pastry at the same time and that's what I'm getting from the taste to zone actually was gifted this laptop because I was complaining about editing and that's another reason why I haven't been even posting first simply cannot edit well the slow computer that I have so I'm gonna take this over and flip it over this is the Microsoft Surface go I wanted this laptop I didn't think I was gonna get it like I could

is up Kenna Pham and welcome back so check it out for this video right here I have some different flour for you guys I'm going to show you guys now all this flour right here is different price points this is all different levels of prices some of them actually might be around the same level of pricing but we have you know the more budgeted stuff down here going all the way up to the more expensive stuff and I'm gonna show you guys this as a comparison video so you guys can't compare the really cheap stuff to the really really dank bom top-shelf stuff and then that way you guys kind of got a good overview of what the flour scene is like here in a state of Oregon okay so if you're coming to Oregon if you already live in Oregon this is a great video to kind of give you a good layout of what to expect you know what I mean if you're coming here and you're like hey how much money do I set aside that what do I want to get blah blah blah blah this video can help you so without further ado let's just get into it okay guys so first up let me set some of these ones aside because we're gonna get to those those are not where we're going to start off we're gonna start off with the lowest the cheapest ones and work our way up so the cheapest one I have right now here is this misty mountain days coming in at 16 percent THC this is an indica and this is by green source Gardens okay now this right here runs about four dollars and fifty and over 4.4 dollars and 20 cents sorry so this is a four dollar 20 cents a gram so just imagine what you could get for like a quarter or even an ounce of this stuff because you can't pick up ounces here in Oregon so but anyway that is what it looks like okay [Music] that's what that's what we're dealing with for the $4 20 cent section really cheap really really budgeted I didn't want to go really lower than this even though they do have stuff that is lower than this they do have stuff that's like three dollars a gram two dollars a gram stuff like that but you know this is just I figured you know this is pretty good budget like four dollars come on so anyway I'm gonna open this up so that's what you're dealing with okay [Music] okay not too bad I personally wouldn't smoke this just because that's my personal preference if you are somebody that's on a budget or you don't really give a [ __ ] you just want whatever you know you can get the most of most bang for your buck this is something that you should try out then okay if that's your preference if that's gonna work for you then more power to you however my personal preference I would not waste my money on something like this okay I don't smoke this kind of butter this is really really low grade Bud really really low grade but okay however it's not the worst I have had like nasty green bud that was just awful anyway up next this is at the seven dollar price range so seven dollars a gram so we jumped from four dollars to seven and this is Sookie's by Alta crest and this is a 50-50 hybrid which I kind of doubt that I don't believe that it's a solid 50/50 hybrid it's probably more like 60/40 or something like that anyway 23 percent THC with pretty much no CBD I mean it's going got a point one percent CBD so there you go that is that there's test date let's open it up and take a look at it alright alright so we're just gonna show this big nugget here or vamo it's really dry oh I just lost some of it I just lost a little chunk over here oh shut those right there anyway there's really dry guys this one's really I mean you guys could probably hear it it's just snapping dry and it's not bad I guess it's all I definitely stepped up from the $4 gram you know at least it's more of a dense nug let you know but that is the $7 section so that is what you're going to kind of expect if you're you know looking for that $7 budget-friendly strain you're gonna get stuff like that majority you might you might you might get lucky and find you know something here in Oregon from a certain dispensary that is really bomb at that price point but most of what you're gonna find at the $7 price point is going to be something along those lines okay now we're going to move up one more to the next tier which is I believe here this $10 yeah so we're gonna bring in the $10 ones alright so first up for the $10 actually you know what I'll do this one first actually since this one's opened here at the top we'll do this one first alright so $10 a gram this is probably let me just say this before I get into this $10 and up is probably as far as quality goes as far as good quality this is probably the best bang for your buck $10 now these $10 strains right here I'm about to show you would go like I've seen firsthand in places like California and Nevada I've seen strains just as dank as this if not a little less dank go for like 15 18 dollars a gram in those states so being able to get what I'm least three right here on a buck show you 410 that's phenomenal within itself okay can't beat Oregon prices telling you anyway so look at that this is the hypnotoad 20% THC headrush hills is the farm this is one gram and just look at that purpleness man look at that purple old [ __ ] I dropped it anyway let's do it pull these bad boys out of here oh look at that just beautiful nuts frosty as hell man yeah look at that frost on those nugs beautiful purple in there nice tints of green just what you want when you're looking for nugs and the smell I know you guys can't smell none of this but holy [ __ ] guys this smells great the terpenes are on point with this okay this is some really really good quality for ten dollars a grand okay same with this one this is a 10 gram one two when we open it here so this is the Donnie burger 13 okay you green no-till [Music] and again $10 a gram for this one and I mean just look at that Oh smells phenomenal it's very pungent guys as soon as you take it right out of the bag I mean just phenomenal smell just nice dense nuggets break up nice like if you're rollin blunts or something with this you'd give me you'd be the joint lovers and blunt lovers would love that flower right there it breaks up really nice all right so again Donnie burger 1325 percent THC and then here we go this is the garlic breath now this is probably one of my favorite strains out right now with the GMO if you ask me hey what are your favourite strains right now what what do you recommend uh it would either be the GMO or these garlic breath sorry this garlic breath or the garlic mince uh really I mean I just love stinky strains okay I really do I love that gasps that pungent nest that smell through the bag that's what I like that's what I look for now look at this is a big note look at that Oh beautiful how does one want you to know you're my favorite girl I didn't look at that nice big nug fire ten to ten dollars a gram again I'm telling you that's what to expect here in the state of Oregon okay now so those are the ten dollars set those over here now we're gonna move on to the 12 to $14 arrange now I have a twelve dollar one and then these other two or fourteen so I'm going to show you guys the twelve dollar one so this is the m4 twenty nine percent THC this is super dense that's like a rock I mean that is super dense guys smells great though smells really really good but super dense and just very nice lime bringing some bright orange hairs very nice bug like listen to that listen that listen sit yeah it's dense but so twelve dollars a gram twenty nine percent THC top shelf now we're moving to the last two which are these two $14 a gram and if you ask me my opinion right now they're not that much better than like these are like when I showed you guys these ones that are ten I mean they're almost there they're really not better okay they're kind of the same these just happen to be more expensive I don't know why oh I really don't maybe it's just the flour company or whatever but this is voyager number one from seven points oregon twenty nine percent THC with pretty much no CBD and i'm going to show you guys this 14 dollars a gram for this [Music] or get that nice snug again dents really dental if you you're liking those hard den snugs then you know you want to go for the 12 to $14 sections because that's where you're gonna get a lot of these dents nuggets the smells great phenomenal smell very chirpy very very chirpy I guess maybe that's why it varies in price why this is more expensive than the other stuff is probably because maybe it's more chirpy I don't know but then here we go another $14 gram one strawberry cream 25 percent THC again by seven points Oregon which is a good farm they make good product wash look at that beauty look at that beauty it's the cutie with the bootie I mean seriously though like just nice dense little little tents little very very little tents of purple in there you know just frost it as [ __ ] I mean it looks like somebody took like a salt shaker of tri Chrome's and just shook it all over this bud I mean just drenched it I mean it's super trike City here and I really like that I enjoy that again smells super good it's got like a fruity strawberry smell so that that's really good so there you guys go this has been a comparison video of the cheap budgeted stuff versus the more expensive stuff here in the state of Oregon now let me just end the video by saying this okay guys here in the state of Oregon this is kind of the norm of what you're gonna find at most dispensaries now there are gonna be some premier dispensaries I like to come from your dispensaries because they're more high-end so you will find stuff at those kind of dispensaries that are maybe like you know 16 to 18 dollars a grams stuff like that however this is what you're going to find add just your average basic dispensary that you're going to be visiting in your local town or wherever you're visiting a hatch or anything like that this is majority what you're gonna find and you're gonna find dank bud like this at good prices okay here in Oregon we have the cheapest weed in the United States okay I know there might be some people in the comment section that would like to argue that point maybe they're from Colorado and stuff where they also have cheap weed there as well but Oregon is the cheapest in the United States we have the cheapest and the best bang for your buck okay as you guys can see these $10 grand ones you can't like that's phenomenal that's phenomenal okay so I like I said I just want to do a comparison video show you guys comparing the budgeted stuff the cheaper stuff the the B stirs the whatever you want to call it the low end low grade cannabis versus the high grade you know top-shelf stuff you know that way you guys can get a good idea of kind of what it is you're dealing with here in the Oregon cannabis market okay now I've done a lot of videos on the flower here in Oregon I've done videos if you guys check my channel out I've done videos where you know it's the budgeted but a bunch of different cheap stuff I've done stuff what top shelf looks like here in Oregon I've done this video now that you know kind of compares the two so I'm going to be moving on to dams I got a bunch of dabs here we're going to be moving on to a bunch of different products and stuff like that that we're gonna be moving on to and I'm gonna go show you guys in the next video kind of a comparison of cheap dabs what are expensive dabs and then kind of doing the same thing where I'll show you guys comparison of both cheap and expensive dams alright so I hope this video has been somewhat informational for you guys if you love Bud if you love cannabis if you're STONER like me then remember please hit that like button drop a like on this video show that love hit that subscribe button at what as well so you can stay updated with the channel and stay updated with all the videos and stuff that you know I come

I'm out of here much love Oh thanks Trey dumb [ __ ] go hey are we salad clouds around they look like", "Ge0ORhYJmoc": "what's up guys welcome back to Kush Coast and today we're gonna talk about using your 120 sight cones machine and how the order forum a lot of people get confused on what cones to order and basically they come in different styles you can get cones Raw's these are the raw versions they're brown they're opposed to be organically made or whatever these are the basic white cones this is a company that you can buy it's called J wear and they make cones as well they're pretty cheap but when you buy from J we're compared to buying from the cones company the cones companies gonna ask you what sides you want them in small that it added a large when you're buying half grams you're gonna want the point six otherwise known as the smalls and these ones will do the half grams and then if you're ordering for the one grams you're gonna want the one point three I don't know if you can see that there gives you a size one point three that's for your actual gram if you use the gram ones it's really hard to get a gram in them so they call them one point threes or they're a hundred and nine millimeters the hundred and nine millimeter is the way you need to know if you're ordering from other companies like this J wear because they don't come in sizes point six point that it it comes in reefer King size and party size but the hundred and nine millimeter is the actual size that gets you that one gram but if not the ninety eight millimeter will do half grams pretty good but you get a lot of extra paper just so you know so basically some of the things you guys are gonna need beside your cones in the machine you're gonna need a grinder to grind the product I prefer these coffee grinders like this these suckers right here get the cannabis to the exact consistency you want for it to be able to burn smoothly you can over grind with these real easy and just make piles of Keith but if you just tag it a couple of times which we'll show you in a minute it keeps the product real consist and it helps surface stims which you can pull out later of course cones when you buy the machine it comes with one of these scrubbers and before you reload this every time you need to make sure you clean it otherwise you get Jam ups so this is a real important tool to make sure you don't lose you're gonna want a pair of tweezers in case some of them get stuck down in there and you can tweezer them out if you have problems this is a good emergency tool to go to you're gonna want a couple of different size rods or pins or whatever to be able to poke down inside of the cones and help pack them in case they got air spots in them these work really good we just got a piece of bamboo nap in we've been using them for a long time if you guys want and you guys don't have that much product you guys could cut off little pieces of card like I did here and this card will actually fit on this combs machine let's see it goes like right here well maybe over here there it is so it goes like that and then we got another one with an angle and we put it like that and you can block off holes this way and only fill in so many without losing product through the rest of the holes a couple crappy old business cards work really good for that but they also work good for stirring and making sure that you can fill all the cones so these work really good we got an old film container here and the reason why we have this film container is because you're gonna need a skel if you're doing it for shops to get them the exact weight so this helps hold the cone up and not spill all the stuff out of it as you're weighing them so you could go through and weigh them real fast like that but these are a couple of the essentials that you guys are gonna need besides some product for us we've got some gorilla glue these are some buds that work quite pretty enough to go into the sacks for people there's a bunch of smalls in here but so we're gonna make these into joints so go to waste we also got some green queen and we have a bag of pitbull and even though it's really good smoke it just it got real lar fee it didn't get real dense like we wanted it to so this all get rolled into joints it didn't make it into the bag so a couple of things you guys want to know to start you want to really clean the table really good otherwise it'll go from a one-man job to a two-man job on the bottom of this cones machine right here it have suction pads these suction pads are crucial for you to get through this once you stick this sucker down and the spot you want it at and make sure it sucked down real good to where it's not gonna come off leave it there don't keep picking it up if you keep picking it up you're gonna cover the table and keep and when you cover the table and keep it won't stick no more and if it doesn't stick you'll never be able to pick this spring up on the inside and be able to turn it like this it'll keep picking up with it and then you can't two-hand it and pick it up this spring is real strong in here so you want to make sure that it's tucked down real good so you can actually turn it okay so now I'm gonna go ahead and get out some cones and then I'll show you guys how we load it all right so to load your cones machine I'm going with these point sixes the this order calls for a lot of handout pre-rolls so most of the handout pre-rolls you get in the shop are gonna be 0.6 s or half grams those are the ones they usually hand out the gram size joints we'll do in a minute but basically you grab this stack of cones like this and then you can real easily just walk along and drop them down inside of these holes like this and it makes it really fast to go through it and dump them you're gonna pull out the little paper stints that they give you and you're just gonna go through and load this whole machine down like this until you get done so I'm gonna go through and load this and then I'll show you guys how we do deal with the grind all right real quick just you guys know we filled this in the down position if you can see here it's touching that's the down position and then when you go to lift it up that's the up position it sinks them all down to where they're down inside of there lower than the grade of the actual top so that way when you put the Cannabis on there or your material it'll go down inside there so now I'm gonna show you guys what it we do to grind it and the consistency you're looking for a couple of things that forgot to mention you're gonna want a couple of Tupperware containers we're gonna want one for grinding your product into then you're gonna want one to put the finished cones in and this one we'll use later but for now we're gonna roll with this one so basically we're gonna get our coffee grinder out and start grinding product let me get that set up so I could show you what it looks like so for me I like to go through it and try to remove as much stem as possible and get rid of all your chunks of stem those will end up plaguing you later when you go to try to tighten joint down and twist the tops those little pieces of stem will start poking through it so I'm gonna just keep breaking this up like this getting it inside of this grinder trying to pull all the big chunks that I can find anything hard real pokey you want it gone but make sure you got gloves on so you're not you know making everybody's smoke all dirty dead skinned and you don't get your hands super sticky or black this products real sticky and it'll ruin your hands real fast it'll make it tore you can't touch the papers without ruining them so you want to make sure that you get your hands covered with some kind of gloves for this process it's just better all the way around and sanitary for the product as well you don't need to fill this very full of course you don't want to be sitting here all day long doing tiny bits at a time but I mean you want to make sure that it's got a good chunk in it just not super packed to where gonna make it hard and you have to fight the lid on it so once I get it about like that I'm gonna throw my cap on and this only takes like a couple of seconds you'll listen and I'll let you hear it there's one and then I'll do one with a shake then I'm gonna open it up and you can already see that it's pretty ground down pretty fine so a consistency like this is really nice but you have to still be sure that there ain't no bigger chunks like this these little chunks like this will get stuck in there and mess you up real bad so you're just gonna go through it and break them up make sure and I move the product from one side of this box to the other just to make sure there ain't no big chunks that did get broke up like that one or any big stem that you see you're gonna want to make sure it's broke up as well any big stems but that's basically the grind right there then I take this and I slide it down and then I go on to the next one you can see all the kief in it there's a lot of Keef in that if you go too long all you will make is piles of Keef there won't you won't have any mass to it so when you go to smoke the joy what happens is this one and either gets so compacted that it doesn't want a bird or two it'll start running oil all the way down your face when you smoke on it it gets so tight that the oil just starts pouring out the end of the cone and you don't want that so I'm gonna go through this bag right here and knock out as much as I can and I'll show you guys what it looks like when I get it all browned up okay here you can see our consistency it's fine grain powder like tobacco we removed all the stems like we talked about you need about 65 to 70 grams to do 120 1/2 grammars you always want to go about 5-6 grams over so they're not light but plus you're gonna lose some even with your scale on the point system which we'll show you later so I got my consistency ground up set that off to the side say this is the area I'm working in I already threw my pile of stems away you're gonna want to take a moist paper towel and wipe this down real good and make sure it's clean you're also going to want to touch the bottom of your suction cups and make sure they're clean and moist and there's nothing stuck to them then you're gonna set it down and you're gonna make sure it's planted on the table solid so that way when you go to pick it up later and turn it it doesn't come up off of the table but now that we know it's on there and it's already in the up position not the down position where the white papers showing but up position am i picking it up and locking it into place it keeps the papers from getting destroyed now taking the old card I like to use these business cards and I like to sprinkle it on here and try to go pretty evenly and you're not gonna fill them all right the second you're just gonna spread some out across the tops and make sure some little pieces fall down in there so that way when we do the first beating you can make sure that you get it all the way down to the cones filter at the bottom the little crutch so I'm just gonna get some down inside of these like this and once I'm confident that I spilt a little bit in each one and that each one's got a little tiny bit in it I'm gonna go ahead and go through like this and if you do it light-handed don't go Bam Bam Bam just like it actually gives you a better pack than if you're slamming on it real hard then I'm gonna go through and I'm gonna add some more and this time I'm gonna get a little fuller and a little fuller until they're all filled up you're just gonna keep repeating this process and if you do it if you take the time to do it right the first time you won't have to bunch you have to fix nobody likes having to go through and fix a whole bunch of these combs it sucks so to keep the process fast it just do it right the first time and you won't have no problem so I had it a little bit and add some more product and I'm gonna do this until I know that all the paper are covered that each one of them have some to the top of that white paper in there I don't know if you can see that with the camera but you got to make sure that it gets all the way up to there it looks like I need to grind some more let me have a second and I'll be right back guys so I got more ground we're gonna get them all filled up a little fast make sure we get all of our holes filled and you can look down in them and see which ones didn't get it which ones did and of course I didn't weigh this product which I probably should have then I would have known I had enough but I don't got time I got orders to fill so I'm just flying through it as fast as I can we still have thwack sirs to do which I'll make a video on that that's where we take whacks and then keep rolling which I'm sure everybody's already knows how to do but we get so many questions why not make a video about it right and of course we don't get paid for by combs or anybody else for any of these videos we post you guys know nowadays YouTube confiscates all the money and it doesn't allow anybody to do any type of merchant handling or any type of third party marketing or anything like that for anything with cannabis on it they uh ixnay your videos monetization so we don't get paid for this we just do this out of you know share and share alike and this culture was based on that so all these secret keepers nowadays you can keep your secrets and Joe money alright that's looking pretty good we got just about all of them full some of them are a little short but they'll make up for it later as we're pulling weight out of them cuz they're always gonna be over so you're gonna be taking quite a bit out as you go [Music] alright now when you go to the turn it it's stuck to the table really good and they're gonna all stand up for you just like that right there now you're gonna go and pick through them and you're gonna throw them on a scale to see what they weigh and that's why we have this little cup here and we set that on the scale before we turn our scale on to tear it I also like to keep another cup on the graphic pass this one over here because as I pull them these way approximately for the half gram joints about 0.2 so at point two you need to make sure that this says point 7 or 0.8 and in California and Oregon to be able to say that you're selling it to a shop and it's medicine you need to make them weigh exactly so that way they're not getting a messed up dosage scale so point 7 is what they really want them to be at so you're just gonna take over here and make yourself a little pile because as you can see when we shook this thing it kicked out all kinds of product around it so as soon as we're done we're gonna clean it all to the front of us get it back into our bag or our Tupperware and clean the table again and start over again but this one still says point eight so I got to get it down now it jumped two points there it is right there that's close enough okay so you're gonna take your poker you got two different pokers you're gonna take your poker and just to get you a nice flat top to be able to grab it with three fingers and you're gonna do a shake like this and that shake is gonna tighten it up you can hold it up to the light and look through it and you can see that the product made it all the way down to the bottom and there's no big air gap here and if there is an air gap you just keep shaking it until it comes out when you crease it with your three fingers it's gonna make a little try thing like that kind of like a triangle right once you got it like that you're gonna give it a gentle twist like this and then you're gonna shake it again to help tighten that twist into place and when you're done it should look just like that right there to keep your scale from being on for long periods of time though the trick is to go through pull them out one at a time weigh them make sure that they get their weight right and set them right here in this jar fill up a jar like this first and then go through and tighten them all up after you're done it'll make it a lot faster for you in the long run and you could have multiple jars and go through the whole thing real fast but unless you have somebody else here helping you and you're doing this by yourself this is the best way to do it right here all right guys I'm gonna go on to finish it in this out I'll show you guys how many we get and what they look like when we're all done all right made it through all 120 it took me about 28 minutes 29 minutes or so and just from going from here skelling I'm dumping the excess inside of the cup dropping them in here boom boom boom until I had my cup full shut my scale off take them twist all the tops throw them inside of my Tupperware that's what a hundred and twenty look like it would normally go straight from here twist them put them in a two sticker label um and then put them in off to the side but this company doesn't need them to so there is going in Tupperware and they're gonna be delivered like that and the tough work so they stay dry and they don't dry out any further before you guys even get to this process though you guys should practically roll one see how it smokes and make sure that it burns properly before you get to this stage where you're making hundreds of them if you get some cannabis that people grow or if you didn't grow it yourself and you're purchasing it they didn't flush it properly the joints won't burn right and you don't want to make hundreds of them and hand them out and get a lot of complaints about the way they burn I mean the number one reason for them not burning right is because of the way people dry and cure it but if they don't flush properly that's another reason why to moist a weed won't grind white right or it won't burn right so you want to make sure that it's at the right dried consistency to be able to grind up nicely not so dry that it's you know turn straight to dust but about four to six percent is the average moisture level that you're going to be looking for my next stage will be after this is to clean this to repeat the process and I'll show you guys how I do that alright so real quick for you guys to clean this the simple way is to make sure everything's down in the holes first using a card to scrape all any big chunks that's leftover then you take your brush and you go through and you brush off the top make sure everything goes down on the inside like this here make sure it's good and clean then you're gonna make sure that it's in the upright position not in the bottom closed position that way this can go all the way through and clean really good I like to choose a section this is in section so find a section start at a section and roll with it and just fly through it like this right here and this is pushing everything down to the bottom and this will make sure that when you put the next set of cones and they don't stick to the walls that could be a real big problem if you get them all caked in there you can't get them out you end up breaking a bunch of papers this is the best way to do it just like this right here all right so we got it all cleaned out I don't know if you could pan the camera down here and see inside here all that that's in there so we got our tough water dish over here I'm gonna just dump my extras in there I'm gonna take this bad boy lean it over on its side like this so I could see down it I don't know if you guys can see in there and then I'll take my brush and I'm gonna go through and I'm gonna scrub this bottom plate off with the brush and get it really good and clean and try to get all that stuff out of there and onto the table it's weird holding it like this for your guys's angle but uh you got to make sure you get the thing super clean you don't want this thing getting gummed up it'll gum up real fast on you if you have to you have to clean it with alcohol or something that's fine clean it with alcohol but then make sure you let it dry out for a long time before you use it again because the key itself will stick to everything like glue if it sits there the longer it sits there it'll stick so hard it'll be real hard to get off so the trick is is to go through this as fast as you can and try to get you know all of the product back off of the off of this 120 sight combs machine so it's not stuck to it like glue then you could give it a couple of days it's clean set it off to the side out of the way try not to get the two or the three little suction cups dirty you got your tongue over here and you look at this right here see how it automatically keeps up and starts to clump up that's because it's got a lot of oils in it get your card out scrape it all right back into your tough wire and you're gonna repeat the process again and again and again so you're done with your tada but you want to make sure that you clean this table off really good I got me a paper towel right here and I'm gonna get it wet and I'll use that to read moisten the table again and make sure that it's tucked down real good because any of these little particles right here they're gonna mess up your guys's suction with the suction cup so grab a paper towel and then go through and just give it a good wipe picking up all those little green particles flip this bad boy over make sure my suction cups are clean stick it to the table make sure it's stuck now you can turn it BAM back in business time to reload and go again and basically that's all there is to how you do this 120 sight cones machine it's real simple it's made out of real hard plastic and if you can afford it I know they're expensive but if you guys can afford it this is the way to go for mass producing joints the cones works good they got crutches in them so you don't get cannabis or tobacco or whatever you're using in your mouth and these are the subway we prefer to do it if we're gonna be doing them by the you know buttload but thanks for watching be sure to LIKE and subscribe and we'll catch you guys on

have not seen my 2 gram jeter video make sure to go check it out posted it maybe three months ago if you're watching this video where i wanted to upload it but this is the one grammar this is gonna be my first time facing uh the one gram jeter i've never smoked one to the face every time i smoked the jeter i split it with somebody the two gram i split it with my homie lorenzo and then i remember my homie bliss me out with one of these the one gram they actually had me lit two and today sunday friday uh we bought a two grand pre-roll and we split it between three of us still got high as [ __ ] so i'm curious to see how high i'm going to get with this one gram facing it to the dome so blue skittles if i remember correctly is going to be a cross of blue diamond and skittles this is going to be an indica strain this particular one is going to be testing at 30.65 thc zero percent cbd this was manufactured september 22nd 2020 today is i think august i'm in august [ __ ] um october 16th the burn time for this is i think five minutes about 10 minutes yeah you can see right there burning time 10 minutes um yeah man these [ __ ] pre-rolls highly [ __ ] recommend them let me know how much

um this is all plastic everything on here is plastic it's going to come sealed up just want to lift it up oh that smells weird all right y'all this is what the pre-roll is looking like like i'm guessing they brush it down with some oil and then rolled it in keith i think this is maybe like a point point eight of some flour point one of some wax point one or some keith maybe i don't know but let's go ahead and spark this up see how it's tasting see how it's smoking all right y'all came to the front yard because there was too much noise in the back the [ __ ] uh pump was going on just

normal and the wheat what is quite cool i try and it's quite nice um i try this in the holland anyway go back to this little bad boy and what has happened and the art and the cbd isolate what is in the from help and the tapes and minor cannabinoids that can include in the cbg and cbc um that and a lot with previous and products that people yeah quite interesting but let me open this it's safety card we like that let me smell this bubble what's this inside kind of sweet and tiny that really shoot exactly and smell and here we go and that is cool this this is glass it's glass people this is good it's glass tube that that is big shout out um no plastic you know cool nice glass tube uh that people yeah look i was saying they look nice i will if so use and the own papers what we have as well and at some point i'll be delivery of these bad boys uh don't you order it those people yeah this look nice smell quite okay not anyway we got we changed our view and i light up this bad boy but we here you go we go it's time to try this little bad boy uh people uh coffee is check uh lighter check and of course our spiritual check yep that here we go ready to go people i smell very piney and heavy piney what is correct because and the pineapple excess should have little tiny sweet piney healthy flavor however we see how gold is it's quite moist very mellow it smell the pine on you not every day you take kind of sweetness almost nothing almost go tasteless and i think if i'm honest i like these blends for you on the sleeves instead to use tobacco because it's almost tasteless and you have your whole almost whole spectrum and the real deal stuff now i don't say it's bad because it's not however to compare to two flavors what you have from this uh flavors what you have from that uh yeah this little lay down however you know it's nice ben honestly it's good quality and the herbal mix that uh you know it's how it is and i tell you that we go um it's more it exactly taste better than ham flour that i think i like this approach i like this approach to use herbal mix and infuse with with cbd isolates well that is done um i think it's better idea to do it and instead to have perroll hem however i think price of this is about 10 pounds it's 9.99 um it's a little too much i know and they give me and the nice and the glass you know jar and that that it's all cool and that i think it's a little too much uh it's only that my opinion um if i much prefer add you know another tenor and have this bad boy and i have 300 parts and it i i must be picky i'm sorry um overall it's no battery it's very mellow almost you smell it tastes nothing that as the art medicine for you yeah i think in the cook yeah it's not unpleasant what sometimes can have unpleasant than the smell that it's it's okay i mean i think it's still uh it's still um little down compared to these products that people anyway i still be smoking this and now i'll be quickly jumping to show you in the website

but today's review is gonna be a little different it's more than a paying other dinner review okay I got a product that I just ordered and it's fun you should know yes I love this company you guys that are trying to save a little bit of money this is definitely you're sorry you could go on they have good products and they are really affordable so I've got the team wax joints guys yes the team wax joints I had to order me a few of those because I wanted to see what they were like so we're gonna give our opinion and see what they're like now the T wax joint is yeah the tea wax joints is a joint and it's rolled in distilling oil and then it's covered with teeth I love teeth seems like I mean I've been using this for a long time and with the CV being having really been collecting that much Keith okay so I love when I give a chance to give something as teeth infused like these links right here from Plain Jane so we can smoke this and see what it's about because they really look good as you can see all right a matter fact let me just give you a quick picture so yeah I could see what it looks like so as you can see this thing is loaded with key all right so let's light this up cheese gun now the reason that fire was on there like that because I reminisce all your when you also see b-boying takes all three the key they use some premium keep on hand so premium flour and oil and I could taste more I'm gonna give this bad boy to burn evenly there you go so it's pretty smooth honestly I like it I do so as you can see how it was burning that all you boy oh he was keeping the little farm cherry on there so I got the 3-pack and this thing is good so I'm definitely gonna be getting much smoke on with I wanted to know is this thing going to give me way more buzz they're normal alright this thing is 35% CBD I think see they send you this when you get your packet it tells you about the company and also gives you information on the flower but this one has some cigarettes are gonna have the honey flower so we're not gonna go over that but I can't tell you that this is 35% CD right here when I'm guessing that's the oil the flower plus the keep goodbye I'm the one thing no this place was this one stink up in here this gonna sting leave this smoke coming up off this thing we even in backup well be careful with these guys I know with this here you really still tastes mostly flour so it's not overwhelmed with the oil and it's not overwhelmed with the TV taste either straight flowers guilty hello shoulder joints last a minute - I like it I'm trying to make one of these myself I haven't done that yet some good stuff guys so smoke doctor signing out I just wanted to let y'all know that the T wags joints are good hey so I'm gonna finish this hair and I'll be back with another review pretty soon guys peace", "OUMeKCeIWFU": "[Music] don't forget to like the video and subscribe to our channel to see more videos hello everybody welcome back to York River cannabis in today's video I'm gonna be showing you how I make CBD Keef here on the farm but first if you wouldn't mind and you are new here to the channel please consider subscribing and supporting our channel and for those of you that have already subscribed thank you very much I appreciate the support and if you wouldn't mind please give the video a big thumbs up to show that support so folks today I'm going to be teaching you how I make CBD Keef here on the farm and it's a really easy process but the number one question I got when I posted a picture of it on Instagram was what is Keith and what do you do with it and first and foremost Keith is just the trichomes of the plant where all those cannabinoids liked to hang out the highest concentration on the plant is in those trichomes and that's what we're extracting today now if you're watching this video and you want to think you can make Keith today you can but first I'm gonna tell you you're gonna want to freeze those buds for a minimum of 24 hours then come back and check out the video but you can do it with buds at room temperature but you're gonna lose out on a lot of the Keef so let's talk about why I like to freeze the buds and before we head into the house and get the bag of buds the reason I freeze the buds is to make the trichomes brittle from the plant material whether it's a leaf over the bud itself you don't really get much from the stems in this process but you know you want it real brittle and that's what freezing does it makes the trichome very brittle when it's at room temperature the trichomes tend to be a little bit more fluid you know so to speak they have more malleability and they're not easily broken off from the plant material so that's why freezing is an important process to collecting the most amount of Keeffe the next thing you're gonna want to do is you're going to need a trim board of some sort with a screen so trim bin trim tray whatever it needs to be a 150 micron screen in order to collect the kief that's a big deal and I will leave links to those things in the description below so if you don't have them you can go ahead and grab them so after that a lot of people say well what do you do with Keith well Keith is a real easy way to get rid of a lot of the plant flavor in cooking edibles and just overall the increased potency of certain things so Keith is just the trichomes it's just cannabinoids so the flavor dramatically decreases because you're not extracting from plant material in the cooking process you're extracting just in regular you know in the room you're not you're not actually adding anything to extract those cannabinoids and it actually eliminates a process in the cooking because when you do cook with oils and butters and stuff like that you need to go through the process first and with our magic butter machine you know if you want to make even magic butter you got to get the flour or get the butter put it in the container mix it all around strain it and then have it harden then you can cook with it this essentially eliminates the entire process of doing that you can add Keef to any cooking recipe anything it doesn't change a thing you just add it in and it's ready to go so one of the things that I will tell you about Kiva's you have to be very careful with it now with CBD not so much with TAC you have to be very careful with it because it's so potent you only need 1 to 4 grams for certain recipes I haven't seen a recipe yet that calls for more than 4 grams so think about it and one of the things I got a tip from is when you do extract this Keef go ahead and weigh the dry flour before freezing it for the recipe that you usually use it for so for instance when we make our CBD oil here we use about 14 grams per cup in about total of 28 grams so what I would do if I was going to make oil with Keef which I probably will in the near future is you're gonna take that 28 grams weigh it put it in the freezer for 24 hours then break off the trichomes and then use the Keef in the oil recipe now why is it so important to do this well it's be important because you want to make sure that your recipes stay on for where they are now you can say you're gonna lose some key if it's not going to be the same amount but you also lose certain potencies when making the oil with the flour you don't get everything and same with the Keef but the Keef is highly concentrated so with that being said guys look for more Keef related videos after you see this one we are going to start using it in the kitchen and start cooking with it a lot more to see how this all plays out but I got to tell you our partner farm Vermont has been using it to make certain edibles and they are absolutely loving it and a lot of the people up there love it because it gets rid of that plant taste and if I have one big complaint about CBD oil itself is that it has that plant flavor that a lot of people just don't really like so this is a way to get rid of that plant flavor so let's head into the house let's check out our frozen bag of flowers and get ready to start making some Keef so over here in the freezer now we're gonna head over to the kitchen I'm going to show you what to do with this frozen bag of flour okay so here you go here is what you need I like to use a spoon because I know it's clean has been through my dishwasher some people use quarters if you are gonna use any type of money make sure you wash it sanitize it throw it in the dishwasher because money is one of the dirtiest things on the planet so you want to make sure that it's clean because you know bacteria does find places to hide everywhere so this is our frozen bag that we got now the first thing I like to do is I like to mush it all up so you can do that you can also get rid of some air in the bag to make it easier and you just go ahead and you beat beat it up with your hands as best you can and as you can see these buds are already starting to turn and to just dust like materials I can show you here in the corner of the bag look how fine this material already is now you're asking what's the speed for the spoon is a trick a lot of people use to break it up even more to get more keep more trichomes breaking off the flour so people use spoons I don't recommend a fork or a knife but people use spoons and money anything with a rounded edge so it doesn't puncture the bag so what you do is you take the spoon and you throw it in there and you shake it around and this also helps to break up all the plant material and that spoon is essentially when it hits the flour and it's frozen is breaking off the trike um like I said people use all kinds of different things I know that a half-dollar a United States half-dollar is one of the more one of the more common tools to do this but I've seen spoon and like I said I've seen quarters but I just money kind of freaks me out with all the bacteria that lives on it and I just didn't watch any but you could just easily walk it and you're gonna do this for quite a while so let me just fast-forward this you're gonna do it for about three probably about three minutes alright so we've jostle this bag around for quite a while and as you can see there are some buds that are still kind of intact that's okay you know you're gonna get that and you can break them up even more once we get the board so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna let this bag sit and I'm gonna go and grab our trim tray that we have now this is essential to what you need to make Keefe you need a trim tray or trim bin and I'll leave that information in the description below go ahead and find one on Amazon but that's what I'm gonna go grab that and then we're gonna get this process started okay so here's trem tray and you need a makeup brush or a paintbrush of some sort this is going to come in handy in a little bit but right now it's going to just be put off to the side so now that you have your you're broken up trichome bag of flowers and leaves or whatever it could be trim it could be bugs whatever you chose to use you're gonna go ahead and open it up and dump it out onto the tray all right so we didn't use it all because we got a bigger bag here so then what you're gonna do is you can break up the buds if you like some people do that some people don't I mean it really depends on how well you beat it up in the bag and you know how much Keef you think you got off of it this is our cherry one flower so be interesting to see how much Keef comes from this and this is about a about two ounces in the in the bag so now what you're gonna do is you just lightly do this on the tray you're gonna take the spoon and you're going to lightly drum it don't go crazy don't smack it just lightly do it you're essentially sifting now the Keef from the material and this process is very important because this is how you're going to collect your Keef so I'm gonna do this for a little while probably about five minutes where you're just stirring it and you're collecting that Keef underneath that micron screen so let's fast-forward to five minutes from now you okay so after working this for about 20 minutes this has been about 20 minutes of jostling around rubbing the buds between my hands and kind of chopping them up a little bit this is our result for the kief now you can do this all day long you could go probably an hour continue extracting Keith but at some point you know the time just B gets ridiculous for the amount that you're actually getting so your first couple checks should be pretty good I like to check every five minutes just to see how everything is but yeah so now we have quite a nice pile of Keith going for 20 minutes worth of work this is what we got now that is a lot of flour and that's what I consider biomass cherry wine that's a lot of the stuff that we we harvested very late you know and it was the bottom branches and they're not the best buds but this is a way to reduce the capacity that you're holding so if you're having a storage issue this is an easy way to get it down and now we have a really nice big pile of Keef here this is this is looking really good at least a couple grams if not more of Keith and and like I said before guys this is a this is a way to make stuff a lot less flavorful when it comes to your plant flavor and I can't stress that enough the few recipes that I've played with with this Keith you really can't taste it and I think you know if I get complaints or like you know hey how do I get rid of the taste of CBD oil that we make here on the farm it's very difficult before to get rid of that taste you know I've added cinnamon I've tried a lot of tactics but overall you really can't mask that plant flavor and well Keith just essentially gets rid of it altogether and that's what's making this pretty popular our farm now that we've kind of got a dialed in for what we're doing here so I hope you guys enjoyed today's video I really hope that this helps you make Keith if you have hemp this CBD Keef again guys it's very potent and I know it doesn't look like a lot but you don't need a lot for your recipes and if you are gonna start using it to cook my suggestion is taking the flour that you're gonna use in that recipe freezing it and then harvesting the Keef and then using it in your recipe for the first couple tries once you've figured out what you're extracting for Keith and what works for that recipe you don't really need to wait you can just start mate well you can start weighing the Keef and going ahead and cooking and have the Keef beforehand but you still need to decarbonise needs to be D carb for any recipe that you're gonna do whether it's oil butter or even just adding it to a chocolate bar still needs to be D carved but that's what I have for you today guys if you are interested in Keith or flour please let me know and go ahead and send me an email at York River cannabis at gmail.com and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible everything that I use today I will leave in a link in the description below so you can click on it you are definitely going to need a trim tray and you are definitely going to need one of these little brushes and then of course you will need some hemp flour but yeah that's what I have for today folks I hope you enjoyed it you can always find me on Instagram and Facebook those links will also be in the description below and I will see you in another video take care", "OvmpO1vjoc4": "in this video we are going to show you how to make pre-rolls fast using a cone filling machine first and foremost please wash your hands before handling any material to avoid contamination place your vibration table stabilization mat on the surface you will be working off place the vibration table on the stabilization map plug the extension cord into the wall outlet plug the vibration table into the extension cord place the cone filling machine on top of the vibration table set the cone riser aside for now load your cone filling machine with empty cones [Music] grab the material that you will be filling your cones with today we are using menthol meadow an herbal smoking blend from herbal spirits use the switch on the extension cable to turn the vibration table on once your vibration table has turned on begin filling the machine with your material the vibration action of the machine will shake your material into the cones use the included cone packing tool to pack the cones while the vibration table is off continue filling the Machine and packing until the cones are full once the cones are full turn the vibration table off using the switch on the extension cord place the cone filling machine with the cone riser underneath it on a flat surface rotate the cone filling machines while lightly applying downward pressure on the riser the machine will eventually slide down on top of the riser while simultaneously lifting the filled cones remove each cone from the machine fold and twist the end to finish [Music] congratulations you have just used a cone filling machine to make a lot

and like comment and subscribe if we haven't already if you're new here go ahead and turn those posts on applications to be notified every single time I post a new vendor today I will be showing you guys how to pack a bra code when I pack a little bit I already go ahead and start pushing it not too hard so you don't take out the filter just cuz I like an extra tight impact you're trying to pack as much as we can into this Rock Honan this is a classic rock home and I just basically started stuffing I'm pushing I'm not the best at this but this is what works for me and yeah not everybody obviously does it the same way I don't like um stuffing too much all at once because I feel like it's harder to go back and push everything in and make it tighter for example like if I were to wait build all this up and barely started stuffing it right here it would have been much harder it would have been loose from the bottom that makes sense we want to have everything evenly typed I usually pack my clones all the way to the end I'm just gonna go ahead and I actually learned this little trick I'm closing it a different way and twisting it up and from Louie okay mr. Tate see you simply you start pushing the XS and this makes the paper burn the burn start from the inside and it makes the joint burn and I've tried this out and he really does work so yeah credit to him for that little trick and now you guys know that", "7lqkReXMrh0": "I need to say this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or you have a medical marijuana card like I actually do myself I don't wanna show you my personal information hi yo what's up guys Ronnie really back at juice I would know this frame review for you guys in this video it's been a minute since I did a any strain review video or anything like this so um if you guys want to see more of these videos let me know down below in the comments and I'll definitely get him out because you know I like doing these videos but um I wasn't even planning on doing this review or then I was just thinking like I haven't done a review of eating I know why I said [ __ ] it why not these are pretty cool so let me do every one them so I got um two packs of these um dutchy pretty rolls but they actually called them um and it is cigarettes so um I don't know I just thought these are pretty cool because ever since I was like young and I first started smoking weed I always like at least for me was like always a dream like the day that I'd be able to like walk until I can Circle K or you know I don't know if you have support cases where you guys live a gas station you wanna me and I like buy a packet like cigarettes but like weed cigarettes and then I mean so we finally got some cannabis cigarettes so that's pretty lit in my opinion um but yeah I got this mo dispensary go ahead and get them from a [ __ ] gas station or nothin but still [ __ ] lit what hopefully one day they'll be gas stations but this video will be reviewing the Northern Lights one if you guys want to see a review on the purplish green let me know down below in the comments and I'll get back to ya and that's my stupid fire concentrate it's right now so if you guys want to see a wax review let me know down below in the comments and I'll get that out too but yeah let's just hop into this so duchies Northern Lights cannabis cigarettes basically just pre-rolls but they're [ __ ] on fire but yeah let's go over the pathogen real quick so this is the front of it pretty basic pretty simple but it's [ __ ] I don't know it gets the point across and it's the open enemy and so it says duchies right there Northern Lights obviously it's the indica made with 100% but source from premium genetics and then it comes with six potent 0.5 mm cannabis cigarettes and Isis keep it keep out of reach of children yeah 6.5 pre-rolls in the back of it just says Northern Lights as a pure indica and is arguably the most famous strain in the world yeah that's definitely one of the most famous strains so that's the back of it pretty plain and simple and in the side of the box has had the Arizona Department of California this side just has some other warning on it nothing else crazy yeah these road forty-four dollars plus tax but they actually that's a little bit expensive in my opinion for like six point five three rolls that's like three grams three grams for 45 bucks that's a little bit expense that's not expensive but on the pricey side you know what I mean um I've got these when everybody won't get one free so I paid 45 bucks for two of them I'm still like $22 each so can't complain I paid about 20 bucks for this I don't know if I would pay that full price 45 bucks for them that's a little bit pricey maybe if I needed something convene I was going on with the trip was something I'm one of them maybe I would but like just done like the everyday occasion I don't think I really see myself kicking these up too often but they are really sick so I already smoked five of these they only have one left for you guys so you open it up it comes in these little bags or this little bag and it's to keep it fresh I'm pretty sure oh I didn't notice that this is just now but I guess it comes with a sticker I don't know how I missed that but yeah that's pretty cool I'm so a little sticker mm-hmm yes that's kind of cool so you can like kinda it says Northern Lights all the time in because you can like try out all the flavors and like make a little collection wall I don't know do something cool don't mean that I mean but they normally it comes in a purple bag I'm assuming for this indica I guess it's the tables would probably come in like a yellow bag or something I don't know the only meaning so we got one to one and they're normally they'll be like if you if it's a fresh pack so I haven't opened this one yet so I'm gonna open this in the next review so you see what it's like when I open a fresh new sealed box you see I'm saying completely schools so there'll be 6/6 ones in that one but this one only has one left let's multiply already but you take it out a little small but it's hey let's [ __ ] pack completely tight in there so my first time taking these out I was like kind of thinking like them like these are kind of small you and I mean I don't know if they're gonna be like they're gonna do me like that they're gonna really give me the lid off for just like one y'all know saying but they not they actually do you just this oh oh yeah they probably like one of the most potent pre-rolls i've ever had they're also um really packed like they packed perfect when you select even though this is only make point 5 and it's like pretty small it's gonna burn for about oh it's gonna burn for about 10 minutes or so so it's [ __ ] fire yeah so this is the pre-roll give you guys one more look at it and then the crutch even has their little logo in it so that's kind of cool yeah that's the joint nothing else really to it um I forget all the top of my head what this was tested at but I want to say it was about 24% 25% but I lost the sticker sorry yeah let's just get into smoking this now if you guys are smoking along I forgot a lighter I think I got one so yeah a soft bunch of this now though hope you guys are smoking long hope you guys are smoking something dank and if you guys are cheers let's get it so dogs in the background I don't know if you hear that let's get it shoes all right so yeah this is [ __ ] fire you can see already and just burn them pretty perfect not running nothing at all so the taste on this is like so far you can tell us that you can definitely tell us made from straight yo my buds they're not using the trim and no [ __ ] like a lot of pre-roll is doing on I mean definitely some fire and this a pre-roll that thing has a pungent like Northern Light stage like um definitely like that classic indica pungent like skunky taste um definitely fire now like and like I said before like these things like these joints even though they're so small they burn for a minute and they burn perfect like you see that [ __ ] like it's I never really look at the ash till just now the ash is not the best color you want to see one smoking a joint but I have seen a lot worse so that's not I don't know let me know what you guys think about ash down below in the comments but you can see how it's smoking it's not running at all smoking pretty much perfect you know I mean like perfect the taste them like it just has like a pungent funky taste like nothing like too crazy like the taste isn't like too good I mean it tastes fire it tastes like some fire bud like that I thought if I roll up a joint myself it would taste better than this but I don't know if it really all depends I don't know it's just personal preference and it all depends I don't know I haven't really smoked flour too much I smoked many concentrates no but he's good but not like what I remember you know I mean but it's definitely definitely has that classic identity that Classica indica like you mean like you see me stuttering over my words a little bit definitely getting kind of tired relaxing yeah just classic indicate indica high so let me go over the raisins but I'll read this real quick usually in these reviews I do like five riddance log over the package in that age the smoke the high the price point not like give like an overall review so um the packaging I thought this packaging was pretty cool it's just I got a little like a cigarette box but like a [ __ ] for a week I mean so it's pretty [ __ ] dope I thought it was lit I like the concept but like I like the idea behind it so um I give it a four point five out of five I just feel like they could have added like a little bit more information about the strange like that on the box because it doesn't really say too much about the strain or any information at all you know - but it says Northern Lights and that's it but besides for that I thought the pack pretty dope so let me know what you guys thought of it down below in the comments and if you disagree with me or you're with me on any of these just let me know down below in the comments but the taste on this um they gave like a four out of five I think that's pretty accurate because like I said it's not the for a pre-roll it's [ __ ] fire a secret age for super tasty um like on for a pre-roll it's like top notch but I feel like if I just bought some top-notch flower like a Potter 8th for 45 and rolled my own joint it probably tastes better than this and if you're fatter than this you know what I mean but it's fire for sure the smoke they looked the way it smokes you guys seen like this thing rips like you know some of those pre-rolls dispensaries are giving you they don't even brown right don't hit right yeah but this burns like perfect all the way down to the grudge this smokes like it his [ __ ] yeah you guys been seeing so this the way it smokes I give it a 5 out of 5 because it's like it's ripping you out I mean you should smack him the high the high is up there but I got kind of stuck between a four and a 4.5 out of 5 so I gave it like a four point two out of five because it's [ __ ] fired but like I said I definitely had some more to fire like for 45 bucks I feel like I could get like a way far like a way better eighth the only mean I roll my own [ __ ] so I feel like they're paying more for like the package and just like that the looks initiated this static of it you know I mean but it's definitely fired the next thing was um yes I'll give it like a four point two out of five for the high the price point I gave like a four out of five it's a little bit pricey for something like I hit like three grams applied for 45 bucks it's a little bit pricey but like if you're going off like if you need something convenient like it going on a trip or something like that that's [ __ ] a good option for you because I mean they're [ __ ] they're really good they they're coat when they burn [ __ ] perfect this you guys see I mean everything about them is good but they're just a little bit pricey so come if you don't mind paying a little bit sure I guess I go for it but me I couldn't see myself on them unless I was like going on a trip and I or I needed something convenient everybody sneaky use some [ __ ] I mean because I feel like I think I got that I already said I can definitely get away far for $45 and roll my own [ __ ] but if you don't know how to roll I guess over these or something but the price point I need like a four out of five so that makes the overall rating about like a four out of five but um these are definitely fired so if you ever see them in your area duchies that she's pretty rose that can we pick him up and try them out um if they're having the buy one get one free deal definitely pick him up and try him out place uh 20 bucks for three grams can't go wrong as fired like this video and want to see more reviews I'm gonna down below in the comments and if you want to see a review on these on [ __ ] dream big rolls there's something I'm going to comments to I'll get that out and add some like fireworks I could do every review on so let me know down below in the comments if you like

why it tastes so [ __ ] good because they put turkey in this [ __ ] so i just want to let you guys know that i want to i want to make a video i want to make the i video to make the video to where i

we just opened it already boom it's going to come with a glass tip with the brand right there it's gonna be a two grand pre-rule i don't know if it's two grams of flour or maybe like a 1.5 or like a 1.8 with like a 0.2 of oil and then some keef but it could be two grams of flour oh yeah it has to be two grams of flour because it says two grams of vendor flour and fused with oil all right so let's uh it says it's going to burn for 25 minutes straight that's crazy where does it say that so hopefully this last 25 minutes it says on the package up i sparked this [ __ ] man and if you guys watch my videos you guys know what this noise means but if you don't go back and find out but let's park this [ __ ] okay so i never really buy uh heroes like this with like hella grounds in them tastes more fruity it's a mix of what girl scout cookies and little roast cookies is the airflow is crazy close out huh that's crazy you think you're done blowing off the smoke and just keeps going it tastes good huh like fruity yeah it does taste hella fruity usually i don't like to taste the pearls they should which is good it doesn't taste like they put trimming in there seems like they put little buds at least you know look at the eye it's not canoeing too bad either i mean a little bit you can see how about saying that brain pretty good just a little bit definitely worth 30. i mean like uh we kept my 30 dollar eighth and hold up a whole ways that's true i don't know how i feel about these where they come he has a glass it is cool it's cool it's like it was like something like it was like my birthday or something yeah it's like something occasionally like when we went to the lake that's a perfect gift yeah that's perfect yeah 30 bucks tell me how much you guys get this for i'm curious

going fat ass it's like you're vaping bro like the clouds are white they're not standing at them this is a good people i don't really [ __ ] with like an eight like eight and a half you know like the flow of it so the air flush is crazy yeah but she's hitting nice i wouldn't rate the airflow but i would say it's good like it's perfect well yeah i guess you can rate the airflow don't rate this [ __ ] like 10 out of 10. it's cool to be giving a raise yeah like this 16 solids and we're like halfway done through it already and it's not canoeing like we can tell one side's burning more but it's nothing it's in the burnout isn't it even now it's been even out the more we smoke it this is the only other pillow i'm aware of that's um in competition with the packwoods and the even around me the pacquiao's are like uh 60 bucks for the same [ __ ] two grand [Music] i usually don't get like this what are you calling me for no mom it's an infused pre-roll the paper is infused all right supposedly you take it to the dome and last oh yeah it's cash they're sauces they would the carts are pretty good took though have you tried the potter's cards nope there's a little base because

like you're i don't know like straight cbd no i haven't just straight cbd though but i i've had the i had a card that was 18 cbd and that [ __ ] was felt good 18 is pretty high yeah cars usually have like like two three four um some we doesn't have to use absolutely somebody doesn't have this one has one percent 1.5 percent wax has like two percent yeah that sounds like two percent yeah that's crazy how much was the price but they you can buy cbd huh that's gonna be for the video man i'm pretty lit only that [ __ ] uh 10 out of 10 in my opinion taking actually to the dome i would have been even wondering so uh look i didn't i didn't see this but it said additional ingredients additional ingredients terpenes so that's why it tastes so [ __ ] good because they put turkeys in this [ __ ] so i just want to let you guys know super kawaii", "6yPZz9My9NM": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel today you're gonna be making Keef M&M brownies so listen to it for this recipe you're gonna need some roughly three graphs of T so let's put that on the scale [Music] alright so I'm gonna be using roughly 3.5 grams of Keith which is 8 so now I'm gonna put this in a mason jar indycar to keep so let's get into it [Music] we're gonna be using the mason jar easy r4q the good thing about using the mason jars is what I mean um is the holder [Music] once your teeth this D card I'm you gonna let your mason jar sit for about 30 minutes all right so it's been over 30 minutes so now what we're gonna do is add the coconut oil to the mason jar [Music] now you want to filter out your coconut oil using a cheesecloth so let's get it - alright guys so now our Keefe infused coconut oil is now done so now I'm gonna go ahead and start wrecking on to keep browning so let's get into it

so if you can I'll wreck them in buying a pan that come with the dividers like this if you think about this is what's it fake my brother's gonna be equally square so for me I like that but if you don't really care about the shape of it don't they do but if you want your brownness to be kind of kind of similar in sizes I recommend getting a divider buddy we're gonna put this in the oven for about 20 to 25 minutes the temperature that I want to be using would be 350 so let's get into it [Music] [Music] all right Mikey brownies just now done thank you guys for watching this video don't forget to Like share and subscribe peace [Music] [Music]", "bBaF5_NmQzs": "we're going to keep this role in here episode two of this 12 episode saga is that overstating calling it a saga is that even the appropriate word how are they all right you're watching the song I did you the saga continues pre-rolls major seller for just about everyone that sells them I want to show you guys innovative ways to package your pre rolls again 2019 being that critical year that you have to stand out you have to get your share of those millions of consumers who are coming into the market for the first time you got to separate yourself from just the traditional pop top and you should subscribe to the channel too because we're going to be showing you eco packaging innovation in 2019 and other stuff to Ingrid without further ado let's let's show the audience some pre-roll options if you are a dupe tube user and you want to get away from that but you're not quite ready a way that you could do that is to get a punch and put your tubes into a pouch and then you just have a little bit of an upscale way to market your product a little on the fence with that idea but I could even see that being that had like a really like premium or like luster looking pouch with like nice felt a nice like velvet exactly that could be really with like as gold hot stamp or something for more premium trim like we talked about before that fits for it you know you're telling a story it's say for example similar to the first batch of naturalistic feel to granola vibe it's now in the woods vibe but you have a bunch of pop tops you want to make additions to it so whether it's a craft label or a craft sleeve or putting it inside of that pouch its additions that we can make to alter the vibe that you're giving and then you know the next stage is we can really give a custom feel to exactly what you're looking for to build it from scratch but we can do those alterations in those modifications if you guys have already made purchases to get it more on point with what the store that you guys are trying to tell okay another way to move up from the duke tube is with these four tubes which you can get in any size and we can do all kinds of finishes on them this one has spot UV on it the clear varnish that adds some shine and it has a hot stamp on it this one is using a spot pearl varnish which is has a slight sparkle to it you make these any size and something you're going to hear also that we hear all the time it's just about how you keep these fresh so we do with people putting the doob tubes inside of tubes like that or you can put it in a little baggie as well - if you think freshness is going to be concerned if you're not moving through the product really quickly really popular for people that are trying to get away from the plastic look still have that really cool you know cylinder a cylindrical look but completely made out of board recycled board so really with a nice alternative to the classic plastic duty alright next up it's a folding box that has a soft touch of varnish on it so when you hold it in your hand it automatically feels a little bit more elevated or a lot more elevated than any kind of standard do to be folding boxes are far more affordable in terms of cost and like rigid more premium boxes so you might think oh I can't afford a box for my pre rolls because you know the price point isn't high enough but folding boxes like that that's like a 25 to 50 cent box depending on the volume that you're ordering versus the rigid ones are gonna be more dollar than two dollars depending on of course the specs of what it is it's simpler and more complex but don't rule out boxes for even low ticket items because there's ways to do them really affordably Manny I want to get you on the show before the Animus but what do you think about what have you found people like using on the pre-rolls has it been more like your customers have been more folding boxes rigid boxes tins what are you kind of seeing in the market so for like a single that's where I think people are more cautious on the pricing but for packs that's a higher retail price point Melissa welcome to the show that's the vault box you guys said a lot of you have seen that child-resistant certified you need a key or the flat object or pencil the true versatility of the vault box that's a beautiful rigid box no like buttons hanging off easy for consumers consumers love it and perfect for a pack perfect for a pack it's another fan favorite we've shown on previous episodes of the cannabis packaging show whose creation was this one is this a ingrid or had the creation you you come on to the show and hold the product is a family place its own this was another customer who had due to dupe tubes that they were trying to elevate the look of so they went for a larger version in this box there's an insert inside that is holding their tubes it's holding three so that you can do it in two Kasim sativa hybrid you could do a morning afternoon and night you could do a blank blank and blank three different strains whatever it is so these are ways to sell the product often the packaging is going to dictate how you're actually selling in your business strategy so those are always fun conversations that have when people are saying aren't so like not just making the packaging but what's the strategy behind how we're going to sell it gold plated tin gold plated if you want to go with like you know $100 pack of pre-roll isn't really make an impact you got the gold plated tin it's just more when we talked about we cater to all markets and Gucci's of the world the marque mass markets of the world if you're going for that vibe you're telling that story you want to elevate your packaging to the highest level if you're not and you don't then we find affordable ways to still tell your story and if you need a child-resistant sliding tin go to contempo packaging comm and drop your email in the box and we will send you when it's ready we'll send you an email when it's ready got quite a few see our innovations in the pipeline Jody's excited about them I could sell with with a quark trap which is a nice way to package on your pre-roll and then you can put it in something else these things are wildly popular my thing with these is like okay for how do you fit all the compliance information on them so like is it going to be a label that Flags or do you put it in a box I think sometimes I see brands they have a really nice primary package they're not considering compliance and labeling and then the end result because it's not done you know thoughtfully is the actual consumer gets something that doesn't really look too professional kind of looks tattered this is one example of something that you could do with those vials just put it into a nice box like this which would showcase them as well because this is clear acetate that look of the product being suspended is really cool doing it with clear inserts and showcasing the product so it's not really competing with the packaging but really the focus of what you're trying to show off Nick what do you like in terms of pre-roll packaging what are some of your you know that you're selling to into the market or even as a consumer what's like good pre-roll packaging yeah so I really like the cardboard spiral tubes I think it's you know a changeup from the the typical pop tops and we've had a lot of people very interested in them recently and and we can dress up the wrap with different print print techniques and make it you know really be able to tell your story we're constantly bringing you know boatloads of shipments in here so again tacking on to some of the shipments that we're bringing in so you don't have to be afraid only over a couple of thousand pieces of flying it in and if you have the time we can tack it on to one of our many boat shipments so that we can add you to the large retailers that we're doing and make it much more affordable than if you were just on your own we could do a whole show in 2019 about projections and how do you buy efficiently and how do you not just buy when you have an immediate need because you incur unnecessary costs but that is not the purpose of these shows so angry please continue all right last two things to show our non contempo items but definitely worth showing because they are very nice this is a lipstick tube that is a push to release feature fresh seal to the clicking and has embossing on the top stay tuned and this last is a box this is from Milan so we shopped the market in like big fashion cities to stay on top of trends and this was just a gorgeous box that obviously the dimensions would be different for pre-rolls but I'm just thinking like that would be that's like a game-changer that I think sure that under the Shelf and you've got like like a pre-roll or like a simple box versus that thing in terms of making an impact and getting people to notice you that's the kind of like thought process I think we should be having I think it's important to also consider what your consumers gonna do with the product so in the case of a bigger box that's gonna go on a coffee table that's gonna be a showpiece for a party they're having it's Christmas time you're having a Christmas gathering everyone gets their own pre-roll another thing that's popular in the market right now if it's a three pack five pack seven pack of pre-rolls where is that going when your consumer consumer leaves the store they're going to a concert they're going to a show it needs to fit in a purse it needs to fit in your pocket so those are the types of things you need to think about in terms of the actual end user so to speak and what they'll actually be doing with and how does that add to the overall experience that that packaging provides so keep that in mind as well just drop in great points right here knowledge boy I love it all right guys any other pre-roll stuff from the showroom that is worth showing our wonderful audience Ron's coming up for the display show drunken building displays longer than I've been alive so we have full boxes once more about the lux and they're really clean packaging that's soft touch finish with a nice hot stamp on it all right good stuff all right we'll see you guys the next episode

squeeze it and there was a stem that poked through it there's always something with these p-rolls i swear i swear i swear look at this right there all right here we go there we go here we go here we go here we go all right all right all right one hit talk about it two hits and a score you guys know the [ __ ] rules no games no fakes here we go let's get a nice even light for this first hit best we can all right here we go y'all oh here we go here we go [Music] the terpenes extremely notable a nice healthy looking white ash on the tip there no seeds yet [Music] the smoke is smooth the turps get even better on the second hit the more it burns it's burning a tiny bit uneven but that could be from the light you know one hit review very much impressed this was an 18 gram joint grand price point for me still a little excessive yes weed is legal in california yes this is designer weed i'll cut it a little slap because they are well known for this you know the elite of the elite but 18 to 20 gram joint just a little high sell a lot more if we get it down a little bit um score out of 10 for the joint effort pre-roll reviews i'm gonna give this joint it does have a massive stem poking through it so i got to give it you know i can i can't give it any higher than a 9.5 that stem is going to burn funny 9.25 is my score for that out of 100 you guys got to read the full review on respectmyregion.com see what that kind of averages out to 10 categories 100 points 9.25 is where i'm at for this joint effort west coast bluetooth review the stem is right there in the middle of it

today in the name of what's in my pre-roll we have this eight gram grenade xxl infused pre-roll from napalm with originals flower so uh this is definitely by far the biggest joint i've ever gutted i'm not sure how i'm going to deal with that i have some ideas hopefully this all pans out but yeah let's go ahead and just jump into it if you're watching this on my patreon page thanks a lot i appreciate you being a patron it means a lot because this thing was [ __ ] expensive sorry to use some foul language there but uh yeah it was 150 on the menu pre-tax uh so thank you to tropicana for making this happen giving me that 15 discount got me out the door under two bills but still very expensive nonetheless uh but yeah let's take a look at this tag cause i'm interested in what we're gonna find here um so we've got eight g's it says seven g's of originals indoor flower and 1g of live resin and it says lift tickets infused rolling paper so i guess there is a g of live resin mixed in with the flower we'll find out together um and then also lift tickets are infused so that's like more live resin in those papers so in any case that's what's going on here with this label let's see if there's what's on the back okay this is the actual testing panel here just came right off that pin and this is what we got in here so 28 to total thc and it does say 7g a flower 1g of extract southwest caregivers here and when was it made back on 8 26 so not too long ago were just coming up towards the end of september now it's about the 20th um so yeah not too old just under a month about so interesting let's see originals og rolling paper by lift tickets so that i don't know we're going to find out together but that makes me wonder is the live resin just what's in the paper because lift tickets is you know it says rolling paper and then flower by but doesn't say concentrates by so oh but wait oh oh ingredients never mind hold on cannabis flour cannabis extract live resin diamonds cannabis extract live resin infused rolling paper alright so that answers my question of course there's the government uh warning they're always watching um so yeah we should find some diamonds in here as well as the flower and then of course the rolling paper is infused so maybe i'll be able to save some of that maybe not looks like quite a bit of cb oh never mind i was reading that wrong i thought it was 11 cbd i was like wow that's a lot but uh point one four five percent cbd so not too much compared to the thc in any case let's get into it and see what's good i'll take this tag i'll put it over here i'll move my sticker because i imagine there's going to be a lot of flour coming out and so this is it let me zoom out you don't need to be that close this is the pin here is the seal so you see you have the official napalm seal um and yeah i mean i think that's it i don't think i actually pull the pin that would be pretty cool but but i think i just twist this off so let's go ahead and watch the seal break together or if it yep there it goes and you can see that it's got that kind of amp anti-tamper seal stuff there stuck on the jar and here we go it's ready to come out let me zoom back out drum roll in your heads boom there it is damn this thing is huge uh definitely again the biggest pre-roll that i've ever gutted the surface looks a little strange just before i pull it apart i thought i'd zoom in on that and i do want to get a dry pool and not neglect that because there's no going back on this one and how the heck oh maybe you do have to pull the pin no i don't know maybe not do i just we're finding this out together i should have did it say pull pin on the instructions to use no no okay uh i don't want to break it but it doesn't it's like stuck in there what the [ __ ] hold on hold on here you get to see me mess with this thing and be a total idiot let me try to pull the pin no okay it doesn't work all right well it's in there it's stuck in there and it's like if you spend this much money on a j and you can't get it out of the cap like what the [ __ ] maybe i gotta unscrew it all right okay i'm just there we go okay i don't know what i did there i think that was my fault so pardon my retardation um pardon that my use of that because i can't erase it and we're live in this video so i'm sorry for saying that but yeah that was my fault i think i i feel like is this screwed in or what what what's going on here this looks like porcelain i should have probably read to see what this is made of but looks like a nice tip it smells great i gotta give that to the originals the uh i can smell the ogenus from back here so let me go ahead and get a dry pull on this real quick and it pulls just fine like i feel like if i lit this up it would smoke perfectly it's got that like really nice it's almost lemony it's like yeah definitely a lemony um maybe minorly gassy but i get more of a freshness off of it so it's like yeah but there's definitely a fuel in the taste too on it so i'm gonna enjoy smoking this flour for sure it's got a great taste classic og so maybe the originals you know i don't know it's it's it's definitely uh on point with a lot of very popular ogs i'm not gonna comment more than that but it tastes very good um all right so let's go ahead and get the right angle on this thing because there's no going back here we go with this here looks like this is where it was actually sealed together so here we go snip snip snip now this is a barrel and i really am curious about how they put these together because it's just like this big tube and i'm like is this you know i mean are these all made by hand hand packed most likely at least like do they cone these out at first how do they do it so let me see i'm going to try to actually cut down the middle here i'm going to try to preserve the paper as much as possible maybe i'll be able to roll it back into a j let me see oh there we go here we go i'm just going to open that up there it is there we go all right awesome well there it is it's coming out in a big old barrel because that's what it is in here all stuffed in oh man i don't want to lose any of this material so i'm going to be really careful as i pat it out of here come on now come on now come on now here it comes all right here we go is that no no i'll be honest i am on the lookout for seeds only because that is what i saw in another video where somebody had opened this up oh special k i just i'm glad the paper caught all that only one tiny tiny little piece managed to make its way off all right cool so the paper is pretty much intact i don't know if we'll see if we find any of those diamonds in here i don't know what they're supposed to look like this stuff smells so good though it's really awesome i definitely love the the smell i'm getting so let me go ahead and get more of a centered view here as i go through this it's a lot of material as i was saying i don't even want to breathe too hard because it'll just go everywhere um so let's see what we got in here already just a little passenger there so far now this is going to take a bit it's going to take a bit but i i don't uh don't see how where the diamonds are exactly and uh you know eventually um if napalm sees this video let me know what i'm looking for exactly because i'm not seeing it i'm seeing a lot of this though which i'm just suspect now because i've seen that other video special k i believe is the user that put that out and there are a lot of these little tiny looking pieces that like are not seeds because i keep smashing them and they go away they're just very suspect you know so but uh the material itself i mean i kind of like the grind it's not grounded down to nothing um so that's good it's got a good consistency it probably would have smoked pretty well but it does have the occasional passenger man it is just so hard to go through this much material though to be honest i probably should have put it in a rolling tray i think i think maybe these chunks i keep coming across might be something to do with the live resin i mean it doesn't feel sticky it doesn't feel like a concentrate by any means uh when i'm breaking them up but i'm just you know finding these little clusters in here and uh and yeah so i just want to be thorough this is probably gonna feel one of the longest joint videos also i hope my phone holds up uh heat wise because it tends to overheat but yeah i just keep seeing a lot of these little bits of things so i i think those might be the diamonds i don't know i can't say because it just feels like herb when i'm when i'm busting them down but they have a c like shape so it's very uh suspect in that way but not yeah not a lot of passengers really you know i mean i've come across a couple here so far there's just so much freaking material in here and so let's break it down you know we're talking about what 150 bucks pre-tax um so that's a quarter so and i mean you've got a g of live resin so i'm not sure what that goes for concentrate wise um but yeah breaking it down by its components what is what are a couple weights maybe like uh 80 bucks you know let's say 48 yet each right and then you get a g of live risen whatever that runs so this really isn't too bad considering that they constructed it also and i mean i am kind of going by more store prices pre-tax etc but uh but yeah i i wouldn't say it's necessarily super overpriced because there is something to do with this construction but as you can see it's not free of defect you know i mean there are a couple and i mean it's just so much too i'm used to just going through one gram so this is seven times the amount of material that i'm used to going through and it's like i can see as i'm doing it there isn't too many but there are just little tiny pieces that are suspect it's got a good consistency though i've really got to give it to that because yeah i'm sure this would have smoked awesomely um just the way that it's got a mix of like really finely ground stuff and uh and really big chunks in here and it just smells so good yeah it really does have that classic og scent sweetness to it um like the lemony citrusy sweetness with that fuel in there yeah i can't wait to smoke this stuff but uh and i just brushed those stems back in there so i mean i'm not seeing anything crazy i'm not seeing any seeds you know i mean that was the question after seeing the video that was released not too long ago would we find any seeds there's nothing sticking out at me you know and i'm checking as you can see i'm checking all these little bits as i'm coming across them but i really don't think we're going to find anything but i just want to be sure because yeah you can only make this video once and i mean you know yeah i have to say this looks pretty decent i came across a couple stems but you know stuff like this here there's gonna be there we go there's another one over here so i can pick these out you know and there's probably going to be a bunch more of them you know not not a supreme amount because i you know otherwise i would just be doing it right now but as i go through it i'm sure i could find more of that we found that bigger stem so there are some stems in here just a little bit nothing crazy again especially when you consider the price point you know and the and the work that goes into making something like this now i don't know what kind of material they started with maybe they get a good deal on lowers or whatever you know but uh yeah can't really see anything to complain about in here um but i'm not finding those uh we're gonna weigh this out right now so it comes out to eight g's they must be in here i guess like but i'm not seeing what i would suspect are the live resin diamonds or whatever so anyway i'm getting a notice that my phone is getting hot so i better move along and get this weight off uh because this is again a really long video um so let's go ahead and get the scale going i'll move you guys over there here we go all righty and there it is and you can see that pretty good from right there so let me tear this out yeah i'm gonna try to corral all of this material in here it is again more than i've weighed out before so i'm hoping this all stays in here be cooperative here we go oh all right so there's some left on the paper coming up to 7.7 and i did there's a couple crumbs out here but not a whole lot so that is what the weight is coming up to you now if it's supposed to be not including the paper then so be it uh it's going to be kind of a pain to pull this paper off i think oh let me try it hold on i want to give it away just to see if it comes up to at least here we go here we go all right i'm throwing the paper into two so you", "McyyS1F183k": "hey guys what's up welcome to my channel welcome back to my channel today I'm going to be doing a review on this CBD pre-roll joint vegan on my name's Robin change get you changed big buddy range no we're not the same I found my local smoke shop so some people ask me can I get it CBD without ordering it online like how can I just go pick it up smoke it today you know spark in them you can pretty much pick and pick it up anywhere I've seen it at gas stations I've seen I've seen it at smoke shops like dispensaries you name it CBD is pretty much everywhere they even have CBD stores in different places when I first seen it I thought it was just one pre-roll like I couldn't see what it says but guess what it is - because secret nature is what the packaging looks like I think it is so freakin cute it's called frosted cush and it is to see your city rose to free Rose that our CBD and it says in the comment you suck you how they think how they say later on there and at the bottom it says organic cannabis flower so we got to see what secret nature's all about I've never tried them before or anything they actually are from Rogue Valley Oregon hmm so if I ever go to Oregon if I like I might have to go and check this out but this is what it looks like and then it just has a little tube this is so cute like you can keep your ashes in here if you want you can keep your yeah joints whatever you smoke but it is to pre-rolls in I swear this stuff smells so freakin good this is what they look like what the tips look like I know you guys did it I hope you guys can see I'm glad you like the beauty gurus but yeah this is what the tips look like you can see like get some cbdu at the tip I don't see any like sticks or anything actually there is a little stick right here it may not be a stick but yeah they're rolling pretty tight and roll pretty good but I know you guys are waiting like I'm out to spark one up I think this little tube is so cute like it keeps it so it fresh that's another thing that's a big plus okay [Music] and I've seen this packaging widget I'm not gonna I ordered some sheet but from other companies I haven't water from this company because I want to try it out first but is she good does she hate like I love Jon Odie's like I like instantly star like slow no I didn't smoke weed earlier but almost all over though like I should be more up a little look like a little glass who does she hate rude [Music] okay secret nature path look sweetie would eat this is a 80 milligrams this is 80 milligrams y'all can see there but it says hopefully hopefully y'all can see that but it says pesticide and something else like Andy to see but everything they passed off on us good remember I said make sure it is lab tested and there's its lattice be laughed at it even got the test ID I got it done and Bill Costa labs I don't know what the where that is but they basically tested it and they even have a test ID on the bottom of the package so this is how you know you can some legit smoke okay y'all don't want to be smoking their trash yes you can get trash as cb2 flouring the way this whole he it's so hard I taste I can't really get a good taste off of it and that could be because I burned my [ __ ] taste but it's off this morning when I was drinking coffee so hope they can be proud [Music] enhancing burning over there I'm really going in sales but I decided to burn alone today but I was so anxious or yeah like my shirt I've got this shirt for like $1.99 yah and I was like [ __ ] I'm getting this you pay a shirt a video shirt I need a shirt and it's not like a little crop top and a guy like a little permanent blue not in the front I was going out but the way I'm set up right now like awful Aang get up you know at this point I'm gonna have to take them out and see thing our incident because I did do a video but if I find it you guys already know it will be in the description box below but yeah folks we did so I'm gonna have to check him out though for real because my my small shop they were like 17 dollars I noticed it's the one that I go to you I don't know baby taxes on time so I got a I'll be finding all the deals on the actual websites so yeah but I was just trying to look for different things that I could help other people with that don't trust virus [ __ ] on my or just don't want to wait because I thought when I first arrived CBD I didn't know want to wait for some [ __ ] to be shipped to me I wanted to find the pre room and I went looking everywhere I'll just type in CBD near me and then everything just popped up that's really high that's really how you got to do it anyway like in order to find what you really want and check out new people in trying to shake you just gotta try shape but make sure it is the lab tested okay even if there's not and you just want to try it give it a try because I still do the [ __ ] but I try to make sure that I do see lab tested somewhere on their website just because you just don't want to be smoking trying it's like who's what want to be smoking my catnip or some [ __ ] potpourri so Scooby [ __ ] but it was a book you don't know what the [ __ ] people be putting in pre-rolls a shade so just always make sure you know what the [ __ ] you get I don't care if they [ __ ] cheap [ __ ] that [Music] and to get research but this good though like this it's kind of instantly calling just kind of instantly telling me because I was like a little anxious before I started this video but like now I'm cool how are you guys liking these smokin easy guys like these or what because I do I like familymoon I like filming them yeah yeah so someone had basically asked me like what my race is and to be honest I've been told so much [ __ ] that I really don't know so I decided I'm going to purchase a kit and that'll be I'm gonna do a video I might do I don't really know but if you guys are interested in you guys would like to see that let me know good and you know we gonna be smoking so talk about Dorne because I've seen some other people do it but I was told that I'm all like I was told that I'm mainly black and I have like 10% Hispanic in me which is weird because my mom is dark-skinned and as you can see I'm not dark-skinned I [Music] don't matter please [Music] when you find look at the box leg I think it is this CPP or THC but it says CBD everywhere on the box a handmade oh let me read this yup it says our joints are made with premium hand trimmed buds ok beat we never use shape trim or anything that is not top shelf material 100% flour with no artificial beads no artificial ingredients or additives this is Road in organic hemp papers yep got a smoke clean this

bottom and then this is exactly what I just read to you guys let's get it under I feel good I know I anyway so I like how he hits me hard real hard actually I don't really like their tips I will be honest above it I thought I did but they're not really it's like a lot of I can't really show it I don't know there it is so as you can see like it's really wide and open and there's I see me becoming

we're using the rips today I think there's like six feet of paper in here so you can make a lot I know a lot of the pre-rolls I see online and it stores well to be real with you they look really overpriced and I would have paid that money I'm gonna show you how to be yourself easy and you don't need to use rips you can use any paper but the same method applies let's dive in make a pre-roll and stuff that thing up just grab a piece of paper cut it in half or a third or you can do the full thing I'll show you what that looks like in a minute go ahead and roll it into a nice cone shape no right or wrong way here you can watch how I do it I'd like to give a little extra and make that tip nice and firm what you want to roll it as tight as possible wrap it right around there and then you're gonna go ahead and grab your tape and you're gonna tape that and the paper cone is set to go next parts are optional you don't need to cut the top off but I'm just gonna go ahead and do it give it a chop and the next thing we're gonna do is go ahead and grab our papers we're going to pull out of rips about the same size as it cone cut that just go ahead take that paper give it a lick roll up a nice come here now let's go ahead and set that down put the paper coat on there and roll it from the bottom on up you want it to be nice and tight so that when you pull it out it stays and it's a nice perfect to come keep rolling don't stop just roll it right past the paper until there and it is three two one and there perfect go ahead and stick your finger in and pull out the inner paper mold this will leave you with a nice perfect pre roll well almost perfect couple more steps we're gonna use our raw filter tips today and we're gonna go ahead and fold those up and just toss it right in the end there you could do it without this highly recommend it though especially because you're gonna be packing it down makes it easier and yeah I wouldn't do it any other way and you can make it filtered about anything just find any piece of paper that has a little resilience we're gonna go ahead and stick that right in the back of the cone tap tap tap tap tap and we're going to go ahead and cut the top of the paper off so it's even and easy to fill but there it is that's the pre roll you would spend money on and now that you have the mold you can just keep making them really simple now there's a couple different ways I like to do this first you could just drop it in just like that and stuff it down this works its effective the second way is just dump it on there and push it in this is maybe a little more effective but my personal favorite the most effective is describe a piece of paper and fold it and chop it sell it's manageable to hold and go ahead and dump it in there and just use it as a chute to slide it right in there makes things a lot faster the paper is laying around it's not waste we're making you see everything here you're making the process speed up a little bit keep going ahead filling it packing it down you want to keep doing this you don't want to fill it and then pack the whole thing down or also be too loose you want to do it in steps it's a process fill it packet Philip packet and repeat let's go ahead and twist that top off here dress it up that cone is looking fat nice and there you see it it's not hard to do you got yourself a perfect color right there and that's how you make a pre-roll and that's still a fat size you know if you're passing out around to but here's how you make a bigger one let's take a full piece of paper making the same style cone but you're gonna pull two pieces and combine them this time just right on top each other now it's like one extra extra large go ahead same process roll that out from the bottom give it a lick twist it project there it is and that's a huge one thank you for chilling today I hope you found this video helpful and if you liked it give it a like drop a comment and let me know if there's anything else you want to see especially when it comes to rolling up because you know I love to roll up also don't forget to subscribe to true buds tv.com to be eligible for all our future giveaways

some raw cones classic raw cones uh authentic purist natural fibers unrefined natural unrefined rolling papers one and a quarter inch size these are probably my favorite things to smoke now i've never been particularly good at uh rolling joints um so i've got the same thing here uh raw rolling papers um that i could roll into a joint i'm just not great at it i find that a lot of my smoke product falls out of it and that i always end up rolling it unevenly and i don't get the best smoke experience i know that there are people out there that are fantastic at rolling joints i'm just not one of them and i think that i'm probably an average roller so when raw created these cones at first i really didn't know what they were all about but now that i do uh they are my favorite go to so if i pull a little tab here we'll see in here are six of these uh rolling papers these raw cones they come with a packing tool and they've already got filter tips in there i love filter tips you can buy filter tips separately raw tips where you just roll them up yourself but with these cones they're already in there so it's the same thing as rolling a joint these are the same papers that you would use you don't have to add the filter tip but instead of rolling these you pack them and what i'm going to do here is show you how to go about packing a cone so here let me set this aside we're going to need this and what i'm going to show you right here this is finely ground up tobacco this is pretty necessary you got to grind it up finely i use a grinder it's got a magnetic top you can simply push the tobacco leaf into the grinder you spin it back and forth the teeth eat it up there are little holes down there for you for it to drop through and this is a multi-chambered grinder so it falls through onto the screen here and i can continue to sift through and you can get some finer things down below in these lower chambers here but i've already ground it off and i'm going to show you just how easy this is this takes absolutely no rolling skills whatsoever you simply take the paper you pick up the tobacco and you drop in a little bit just to get started now you take the packing tool and you use it to push it down here to the very end add a little bit and yeah these are for tobacco use only now i pack it in pretty tightly but not super tight again you need air to flow through so the issue i always have with joints when i roll them is that some parts are just more tightly packed than others and air doesn't flow through the right way but with these i never have a bad smoke experience at all especially with the filter tip here at the bottom it goes a long way now i still love joints don't get me wrong and i know that there are people that can whip them up you know without even really looking at them i've watched people roll some amazing cannons and have a whole conversation with somebody else and seeing people do it driving down the road though that's not recommended keep your eyes on the road you can't text and drive then you shouldn't be rolling and driving that only makes sense okay so look at i've got it pretty well packed in here probably fit a little bit more in there on the top but you can see that and now all i'm going to do is push the papers together and give it a little twist what do i have here i have something that looks a lot like a pre-roll if you ever walk into a dispensary you can buy these pre-rolls so cones give you the ability to make your own pre-rolls and end up having a perfect little joint that'll smoke really well it's got kind of a canonical shape you can see that and that is the raw cones i highly recommend them", "YyeYeKGCpD8": "[Music] we'll then start by initially going very slowly and turning machine up and as you do this you'll start to hear a little bit of electronic sound initially coming to machine as you can see here we're starting a very low vibration and building up that you can see here the butter medium setting with the machine this tends to be the area in which beetles start loading a lot more material in and working that material this is going to start initially packing down and vibrating that material in there now if you start to have an issue with things floating at the top and not packing down properly there's a nice convenient function of this machine which is at the high function as you start turning it up the vibrational difference and what we're doing here this will initially have your product vibrating on top and sync it down that knowing that it can't over pack your free rolls if you have so much waited product on the top so always staying conscious of how much material you're working with at all times will keep your p rolls from being over packed or under packed and occasion from here if I feel comfortable enough with my three roles in pack I will turn the Machine down and off to this low-end all function for safety purposes you can't turn the Machine off as well afterwards so I'm just gonna be moving this machine up to a very good tampering speed here to where we can actually start introducing the product and three rolls I'm not looking for an aggressive speed by any means just something very light to make a nice movement on there and as you can hear that's kind of the sound we're looking for on this very light as I'm moving my material into this I'm stirring it maintaining a good consistency of product if it separates with the Keith on the bottom there and we started getting a lot of big material on top it can make for a very uneven pack and it will make it a very major struggle for you as far as getting all of your joints evenly packed as you so desire as we're going through this and getting an even pack you can see that not many of these are vibrating and moving which is meaning that they're not sinking into the pre-roll any further than what we have it so this is when we're going to step up the motor a little bit and see if it can sink them in as you can see they're starting to rotate further and further and the center ones are starting to have a much more dense pack we want to make sure every single one of these pre rolls is capable of moving on its own to get the pack we so desire I'm not pushing these in by any means but slowly rushing them over across from each other and as you can see a lot of the seeds and the stems are pushing their way to the top through this vibration to do one last finishing product I am going to give it a high volt and as you can see they sunk at his best it good there from there I feel rather confident in my pack and I'm really curious to see where these pre-roll sets so I'm going to unscrew my locking screws here out of convenience and just keeping your parts and pieces together again I highly recommend just keeping these with the tray if you have a container next to you or anything else like that feel free to put the locking nuts in there however do not worry about the washer so much yet until we get this top tray out the top tray I'm gonna move on over to a reclaim Abul bucket over here in which this product is completely viable and ready to go for another run or any other process that you're wishing to do we can set it down here or a nice easy way to get these out is make sure you grab your washers set it aside and tip it upside down as you can see here all these are kind of full still so you can proceed to give them a tap and go forward some of these may be rather densely packed in there so I highly recommend having a ballpoint pen or even metallic chopsticks is actually a very useful tool we use around here as you can see we're ready to go and the material is packed and ready to go right there for another run or whatever you desire to do with it from here I'm gonna be taking out the base the bottom tray pulling it out making sure I'm not hitting any of the pre rolls we're gonna look at those crunches just to make sure and see how even those are going down on the bottom making sure that all our papers are completely even the same size now different papers are gonna have different specifications as far as their tolerances go and being made manufactured so keeping that in mind when we're working with these can give us a lot of different variables so now that the machine is not going to prevent that from here we press down and as we see here before us all our papers are pushed up and forward and ready to go from here they're gonna need a pack as well as a fold on them depending how you like your product you may need to insert a tiny bit more material in one or take out other material and others but then 10% variable is what we're saying with our machine here and you're next a little free roll", "RjOpejjgug8": "what's up guys steve here with ian a 5-star vapor lounge he is the manager here and we are going to be talking to you today about the five things that you need to know about CBD [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so the first thing that we want to talk about number one what a CBD and is it legal we all know the medicinal benefits of cannabis the main two components in cannabis the main two cannabinoids are THC and CBD CBD is a way to get all the health benefits and the medicinal properties of cannabis without having to sacrifice your your your cognitive state in a way that might you know hamper your work ability CBD actually has most of the same medicinal benefits of THC but just without the high and it's the medicinal stuff that is in a more concentrated form yes like you're not getting as much CBD yeah from traditional okay yes smoke so you got cannabis and you got him so cannabis is actually very strong very concentrated in THC a very low concentration of CBD industrial hemp is actually very high in CBD but very very low if not anything of THC so actually a lot of the CBD comes from industrial hemp it actually doesn't come from cannabis lucky for us and lucky for a lot of people that are that need the medicinal benefits of cannabis while CBD legality can vary from state to state CBD is not only legal in Missouri but it's also legal on a federal level they actually just passed a new farm bill that was an update from the 2014 farm bill completely removed it from the controlled substance act is it legal yes however do be smart about it this stuff especially our flour and our pre-rolled items do look a lot like the quote unquote real deal so I recommend that the customers leave that in the package until they arrive at their home if it does feel a little disjointed yeah studies have shown that CBD reduces pain inflammation anxiety depression migraines seizures IBS psychosis and mental disorders and nausea so thirdly how is CBD take it you have sublingual sublinguals are a quick way to get in your bloodstream usually just drops under the tongue topicals creams balms there's even patches that are great for muscle and joint pain then you have your pills pill form is great capsules really quick and easy way no hassle no frills way to take CBD then you have your edibles edibles are delicious there's all different kinds of edibles vape available form of CBD can be great for somebody who's already using an e-cig or already has a vaporizer that they're using on a daily basis and when it comes to flower we have the jars of loose flour we have the roll-your-own kit that has the filters and papers included and then we have the pre-roll we have regular pre-roll and then we actually have a Keith and honey rolled pre-roll concentrates concentrates include wax shatter crumble any sort of concentrated CBD isolates and CD is also pet safe there are specific products designed just for pets you could also take a sublingual that's meant for human consumption and give that in small doses to your pet either through their water or in their food meow the fourth thing is how much CBD do I take we always recommend in your starting dose you should usually start about 25 to 50 milligrams and then kind of go from there start a little smaller work your way up and just see what works for you it's not uncommon for people to take upwards of a hundred to two hundred you can't really overdose on CBD so take it you know if you want to start at a hundred start at one hundred if you think that's what you're gonna need one good thing to know if you are using any kind of sublinguals or anything like that with the dropper most droppers are one mill per dropper so you can figure out hey I've got a 30ml bottle it's got a thousand milligram of CBD and you just divide that a thousand by 30 mils and that's basically how much each dropper will be so the fifth and final thing that we're going to talk about will I pass my drug test with CBD yes you will however some CBD products do have trace amounts of THC in them the legal limit for CBD products is 0.3 percent or less THC a lot of the products that we carry are 100% CBD pure CBD or isolates isolated zvt if it says full spectrum that's where you get into that gray area where yeah I'd include something like that and the flower and and yes again it's very trace amounts but if you are using CBD on a regular basis at all I would recommend sticking with isolates and pure CBD and stay away from the flowers and the multi spectrums in the full spectrums now quality is a huge factor know where you're getting your stuff from know where your shops getting their stuff from if you're into CBD at all you know the names like green rose and fresh leaf and summit stuff like that that's what we carry so it's all lab tested most products aren't only just lab tested they're double and triple lab tested and keep in mind even if you're at the point three percent you're not gonna get high from it on the other hand if you're not getting drug tested the multi spectrums are fantastic they have what they call an entourage effect because you're getting all those camp cannabinoids to work together all that synergistic stuff going on aside just all they say all the harder right pretty role in the flower stuff it's some of the best stuff for anxiety and insomnia sleep disorder sleep IDI

saying we're at Ben's house in his backyard and I I bought these pre-rolls like on Friday last week and I I'm already saying I already opened it I already used five there's seven of them and I saved two for this video one for me and one for Ben and as you can see the brand is called hervana it says 20% THC and the only thing I have a fault with this back packaging is look at it I don't even know if it was like airtight at all you know like this is not like yeah so it doesn't keep the joints fresh that's my only neck and it was a bit dry I'm not gonna say it you know I'm not gonna lie and uh I don't it's just pretty much all I can say about that but you have the lighter thing right here and you can open it well packaged not gonna lie for every ounce they buy they plant a tree or for every ounce that's bought from them they buy a tree or plant a tree that's pretty dope yeah so they definitely aren't giving back to the planet you know says a lot about a company that whether they're willing to you know do that so here's Ben's oh yeah and the packaging is biodegradable or some [ __ ] I don't know so they also gave you some matches tied to a hemp wick yeah so [Music] oh I'm running independent no I mean coming in my feeling [Music] so these are point fives each seven joints and these are for mostly the people that can't roll or in a rush and yeah those are basically lonely like from from a stoners perspective always try to get an eight and just roll your own because you don't know what they actually put in these I'm not gonna just spend money and then empty one and see what it is because I spent money on it but people some people do and sometimes it's just shaking these pre rolls so you just got to be aware and like I said the the airtight packaging was not there so it definitely does not keep the joint as fresh I mean what do you guys say about the joint it's smooth though right yeah oh it strain is this that's another thing I don't really like about is that they just call it hybrid which is a hybrid blend so it's a blend of all this stuff and usually when I hear blend I just think that they just blended all the remaining shake together their hybrid [ __ ] hopefully it's not the case but in the end I can't really tell but you could follow them and see it there I mean who knows you know good and it's definitely not bad you know I've tasted four screw holes right and this is like a little point fiber so it's like for those of you who are tweeting cigarettes but smoke weed like cigarette besides this you know I don't think ban was expecting the smoke all joined by himself today I just came through with it but luckily it's a point five so I feel like anyone can handle 0.5 yeah I'm gonna that's one good quick and like so when you smoke things quick especially when you only want smoking it it's still gonna be slow smoke like the other ones the other five when I first opened out that Blake's house mean and just had one were just smoking it yeah then when money came I gave him one to avert itself and then a half me and Blake shared half and then you came and I was just like you know just save this for what my do a video I played salsa [Music] but also seen a video recently of owl owl smokes which is basically the same kind of packaging just colored differently so I'm guessing that this this is a generic freewill pre-roll package that companies can buy okay I don't know if I mentioned it but the percentage was about 20% THC solders be like it's pretty good and this was running in about to pull 8th buys 25 bucks for the whole pack which is not bad right I mean I've seen worse or worse for price more you know [Music] look at it but yeah as you can see most good none of them ran at all so that is a plus in my book because sometimes you buy pre-rolls sometimes you buy single pre-rolls and then they run and it's just the [ __ ] ten bucks on this single pre-roll and like I said pre rules are for people that really are in a rush or can't roll or they just yeah basically on a rush or can't roll but if you can just always try to get the flower I for one was in a rush and I just wanted to like just pull one out and smoke it whenever I wanted instead of getting my fingers all sticky because I've somehow lost my grinder so I would have to break that out with my hands though you froze lost your grinder yeah I find it but it's like no I'm saying but yeah check out the coming company hervana let me know if you guys guys have tried their pre rolls in let me know if you thought it was pretty good you know so far I'm liking it like I had I really smoked like three before this so it was a pretty good smoke not gonna lie but it's not like the greatest pre-roll in the [ __ ] game you know yeah oh yeah well I also was uploading a video today and it said the gave you mute gave me an option to say is this video allowed or washable for kids or is it not this is like an option they added on YouTube like recently so I just click no this is not for children on all my videos so hopefully this is like a better chance of me not getting deleted they just added that so I'm guessing they're kind of like you know compensate for I don't know you know I don't they don't know but hopefully I checked the all of them I checked no they're not made for children hopefully I don't get deleted again that's dumb that they just delete your account for [ __ ] that in here twice twice how do you feel you feel high a little bit a little bit yeah so uh maybe the strength isn't as what it's advertised cuz 20% on a joint is pretty hot should ya be getting me pretty lifted that goes to say back to the the shake in the blend that's probably what what the case is mm-hmm but I mean I don't know I don't know what to say to take after this new it's a kick creeper yeah you gotta expect that with payrolls as you know you can't really expect to get too high because you can't expect the quality to be too high that's the first time smoking I didn't know nirmaia took a very there yeah so if you're like everyday smokers you know by your payroll is pointy not the way to go either that's true but like I said I was in a rush you know I'm saying that could roll guys yeah I can't roll good but good enough to smoke you know I'm not saying I'm like it's master roller over here but guess the job done but other than that the joints both of our joints are pretty much done hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I will see you guys in the next one peace out [Music]", "4zyUYVu3CtM": "hi and welcome back to our how-to and product review videos here at es studios today we'll be discussing the raw cone filler this relatively new product was created by raw with the intention of easing and expediting the process of packing raw pre-rolled cones they come in both king-size and 101 quarter to fit every smokers needs let's go ahead and take a look at what this ingenious new packing tool has to offer attach the raw cone filler itself you'll also find a bamboo packing stick as well as an additional packing tool which detaches from the bottom of the cone filler to make it easier to pack the trench an extra mouth tip for the filler and a short instruction manual are also included will take you step-by-step to show you how these nifty tools will come in handy when filling your pre-rolled cones now that you've unpacked all of your cool new tools you're going to want to take your ground up over tobacco and begin filling the top of the filler with it then using the packing tool that comes attached to the bottom of the cone filler pack down the herb into the trough until you can securely closed the filler then you're going to take your pre-rolled cone and slip it onto the mouth tip of the cone filler being careful not to wrinkle the paper now close the top of the filler ensuring it grasps onto the tip of the cone then at a slow and steady pace slide the top part all the way forward then all the way back to its original position being cautious not to detach the cone as you go some users like to partially slide the top back and forth a second time to pack it further while others use the bamboo packing stick to slide the rest of it through the mouth tip and into the cone as always pack your herb further down into the pre-rolled cone using your bamboo packing stick to ensure your cone is packed evenly throughout finally twist off the top of the cone and there you have it a perfectly packed pre-rolled raw cone despite the fact that Rob's a great care when creating this innovative and effective product we have run into a few minor issues with it and have received several complaints from customers regarding them personally the biggest issue we've come to find is that the cone filler will oftentimes leave a partially unpacked space near the filter tip causing the cone to be flimsy our solution to this has been to pre pack the cone slightly before using the cone filler in order to avoid cos the complaint which we have received them most from our customers however is that the pre-rolled cones will at times not fit onto the mouth tip of the cone loader unfortunately this issue has been addressed by Josh himself the founder of raw rolling papers as he has stated that because of the fact that free rolled cones are all hand rolled there will always be instances where they will not fit perfectly onto the comb through it in any case the product itself is still quite effective and convenient as it makes the process of packing pre-rolled cones ten times faster and simpler

may is not too bad we are in july today is july 14th or 12th july 12th today we'll say okay so the package on may 8th i don't know what that means because if you can make these pre-rolls in january

that's just an unknown let's open it up see what we get here's that little sealy sealy sealy sealy so boom we're getting in there what do we get oh it's a little package there's a thc picture on there

some little tinfoil wrap there like a cigarette pack normally you just pull okay oh yeah there's there it is there it is pull that away and then we have ten readies up in this batch boom look at that there's your retican ready now the marijuana inside you can clearly see there's marijuana inside that's good that's good that's what i'm hoping for let's do math real quick here the package comes with 10 pre-rolls the package weighs 3.5 grams of dope so in each pre-roll you got .35 of marijuana i paid 24.99 for this package that makes every pre-roll about 250. so 250 for .35 grams of dough now let's see what's in the pre-roll just for fun that's what this is about we're recreational we're just doing things for fun i'm gonna rip this batch open let's get you open let's see what we're smoking on is it sticks is it stems is it seeds we don't know let's see it's not dry and crusty i will give it that you know you're not uh may 2nd package date the weed that's falling out is not dry and crusty there is a bit of humidity left in there that's what you want yeah yeah we'll do a little dance for that okay so there's .38 of dope in this pre-roll that's on point perfect ah do another dance you're getting dances today now let's see what's actually in here so it's not too bad look at this this is a stem here okay that's something you don't want to really pre-roll right here that's leaf okay so there's a bunch of leaf getting in there this is definitely bottoms okay this is bottoms this is the bins after it's handled weed you're going to grab all this bits and you're going to put it in your parel that's what's happening here but there is flour in there too it's not all sticks and stems it's not all leaf matter you can see the leaf matter there's chances you know when i roll my joints i report all the stem all these little bits that affects my smoking goodness these are i'm pretty slick i mean i am slick but i'm also pretty happy this is a little slick pack um i'm looking forward to getting all snapped up here it's [ __ ] 420 right on the dot too hmm not bad not bad not a whole lot of flavor there's really not a lot that stands out on that taste i know i'm smoking weed but there's nothing to complain about either right i'll just start there so good good good good in the past i've had two other radicands actually have them right here i have the waffle and the god bud done both these they were both 29.99 which is a great price and they were both quality dopes they passed the test they're rebuyable they're suggestible check them out check out redican this is gonna be perfect for me throughout my day a quick little snap snap i'll take my i'll take bowl hoots throughout the day just to get my medicine so i can keep going that's what this is very convenient actually and for 250 per joint all i need is one and then i continue on my day this one's almost going out though i need more than that so you got a second one going right away before this one goes out and you just gotta keep her going it's smokeable but it's not flavorful that's what i like to say there i smoked my second one i'm getting down there i'm getting pretty snapped up i am feeling good i'm starting to forget words here you go friends take one of those put it in your mouth later later as easy as that smoke three at once if you want whoo [Music] you can like two up and give one to a friend if you want that's how easy that is to they're quick lights that is nice it's not like uh they light like a cigarette you smoke you know one two three four five there's five more somewhere one two i lost three okay so no i have four i have four in my hand and i got five six seven eight nine i lost one when i threw one to a friend but the neat thing about these this is really cool let's

smoke but we this is decent weed okay there's there's not a lot of taste there it really just falls in the sativa category that's what's going on there so there's no point for really enjoying your bud the weed needs to be better but the convenience and the actual product is fantastic straight up fantastic these are quick you want to go out on the boat you want to even [ __ ] take a rip on the sea-doo you want to go up in a hot air balloon grab these like wherever you go you can just have these with you have these in your car have these in your glove compartment i just smashed through 10 retican readies the overall smoke was a little harsh a little dry there's not much flavor in there at all but the pure convenience of having smokeable weed rolled up into something like this to just

the taste crisp clear crisp and clear it's piney you know what like yeah if you got a taste for it you know exactly what you want if you don't smoke tsc very much excuse me i mean taste and flavor-wise yeah that's worth the money that's why it's worth any dollar amount you assigned to right up to i'd say 60 70 bucks i could pick me worth it it would be low it would be well worth it

are around $35 it comes with seven pre-rolls so that's around $5 per pre-roll I've been using them for a couple months now these are all the old containers I have what I like about these CD joints is a you had to keep that body hive that you get from smoking THC products but you also keep a mental clarity so you can really think and you're not as foggy I guess is the best way I could put it my favorite thing about this product is the packaging the packaging is just so premium it can be reusable that's why I kept all my cases because you can fit your pre rolls or joints in there that you made yourself and just use s container it has a magnetic flap so it won't open random little matchbox addition to it is a very handy just in case you forget a lighter but overall other than the price it's a very good product and I would definitely recommend anyone that would like to try any CBD drones and also get a cool package", "di5IVd9pECg": "all right i was about it i was about to smoke i was about to smoke one of these and i was like hey might as well make a video on it right so i'll make a video on it and we're gonna have box hot box the bean [Music] let's see if you guys haven't seen any of my other videos i have two other videos of jeter i have a one gram in the xl this is going to be the baby jesus um these are [ __ ] gas man literally um one hand of these will get you [ __ ] feeling different already like if you and your friends are not heavy smokers you could literally split one of these between three people um i split i mean we split one between three people and honestly i got pretty lit off of it i mean like it wasn't to the point where i wanted to but it got me way more high than i thought it would these things are amazing man this is a five pack of baby jeters this is a fire og is gonna be a hybrid for some reason this package doesn't have any of the thc information you can see everything's all blank maybe it was like the setup case or something the display case or something but the manufacturer date and packaging date was september 23rd so a little bit old about over a month old it's a five pack premium indoor flower with distillate oil and keef weighing at 2.5 grams these periods are going to be weighing around a half gram each burning time is five minutes let me go ahead and open them you gotta push down that comes sealed already open to seal you can see there's four of them in there it comes with five already smoked one all right i know this is all right y'all know this is a weird angle and [ __ ] but i'm in my car so i don't really have a good place to set it up i'm gonna go ahead and take one of these out spark it up um i already know how these are hitting man these are [ __ ] crazy small ass [ __ ] joint bro but [ __ ] hits like smack so let's go ahead and spark this [ __ ] up got the clipper spark it uh are [ __ ] crazy [ __ ] love these joints if you guys haven't tried any of the jesus strains before i recommend the fire og i recommend the gelato 33 and i recommend the durban poison the banana cushion was cool it sounds good but i don't know to me just it wasn't like i was like one of my least favorite strains that i've had i probably had all of them already but the only one i think that i haven't had has to be maybe the ramadan grapefruit that's probably like one of the only ones i haven't had you can see i've been hitting it for a cool amount it's barely starting to to burn down they also have um a different line of these where they're not infused it's just like a fire ash puro and they have different strains on them so i need to make a review on them because they have some pretty good strains i don't remember off the top but i remember seeing some cool ones it was a lot of strains i haven't had before yeah these pills are really good though man i mean one is like all right two of them will get you highest like though especially in the morning have you just smoke with these especially in the morning man you'll be smoking these they will hit hard um this is already midday i already made a video if you guys haven't seen made a video about the dab cap so i'm already pretty lit but it's a good joint you know just to like get you level-headed um you know if you're not lit so so far i've been recording for four minutes and 20 seconds so um that five minute mark is pretty true i guess the first minute of this clip was me talking about it though so and i'm talking about like that first part where you guys see me come to the car that was like a different clip so i'm talking about this clip right now it's recording when i put the camera up is that four minutes and 45 seconds we hit the five minute mark now five minutes three seconds also what's really cool about these is that they do not turn off if you cannot hit it for like a cool minute and it'll still be on by the next time you want to take a hit officially been smoking over five minutes so it's true burning time is about five minutes if this weighs a half gram it must be a 0.4 flower point five of a key point five oh some wax i'm guessing that's how it works um unless you count the point five gram as a pure flour but i don't know uh that's gonna be it for the there's gonna be a for the video though y'all hopefully y'all enjoyed the video hopefully i'll tie y'all son hopefully i'll learn soon hope y'all got lit with me and um catch on the next one man peace okay bye", "YW6EEZNiwFw": "hello everybody okay today I have a super quick tutorial walkthrough if you will we have a lot of people really interested in CBD joints but have actually expressed that they don't know how to use CBD joints so I'll kind of walk through this you know product this is made with industrial hemp flour it is a full one gram joint it's rolled with raw papers it does have kind of you know like a paper filter in there so when you're in handling the part doesn't go into your mouth and so with that this is the part that goes on your mouth it will say we're all on it and it's more like the slender side at the bottom of the joint and then on this end is actually what you're going to light with fire with flame I'm gonna use matches we also sell hemp wick in our store here we start CBD you're welcome to use lighters pretty much anything that will make fire is how you're going to light the pre-roll but I'm just gonna basically show you how to light the pre-roll on how to put the pre-roll out Oh quick other thing to note because is a full gram I don't recommend smoking the whole thing out once this is a really great product to share amongst your friends this is also a really good product for yourself but just to know that you don't need to take puffs to complete the whole joint you kind of smoke until you feel it so usually for me when I'm smoking enjoy by myself I'll take you know anywhere from three to five hits kind of let it rest see how my body is responding to that and then if you want you know there's no harm in smoking more just know that to get the effect of smoking CBD you don't have to smoke this whole one gram joint that's actually a lot of CBD in my opinion and I'm Allison to go on this piece and this is a side that I'm going to light and we're just gonna do a quick little minor joint if I can light it so the point is to light the paper kind of light that hole first you know circumference of the joint you do take a few puffs really big inhalation is just to kind of like get that cherry on the end of it lighted and then from there you can just kind of inhale and take as many drags as you want like I size you through to four drags but the other thing that I wanted to show you guys is how to properly put a joint out so I recommend using a metal ashtray there's also ceramic ashtrays if you happen to be outside concrete is fine you definitely don't put it out on anything wooden because this is a flame but you're gonna basically take the end and so this is how I'm gonna preserve the joint so I can smoke it later if I choose to I'm just gonna gently kind of tap it out you basically want to suffocate the flame sometimes depending on how much you smoke you can kind of push that lit piece out and again I just kind of dampen it out you know just to make sure that flame isn't still lit but you can put it out and basically when I wanted to refocus I would just light from the end again but that'd be south and basically you're trying to suck the heat from the end all the way through using your lungs that's what's lighting it and pulling and burning that hemp butt of that hemp flower set you can have the effect of smoking CBD so hope you guys like that video if you have other questions for us you're too afraid to ask feel free to you know DM us on Instagram also come visit us in our store at restart CBD we're always happy to talk to you guys in person and yeah we actually sell these pre-rolled joints both in our store here at restart and online at restart CBD calm we carry about six to seven different strains both in loose bud and pre-rolls but yeah girls are a great way to have the convenience of smoke CBD without the pipe without the grinder without all the accessories and a really good fun way to experience this specifically in group settings like taking these to parties so thanks again for watching we appreciate you and check

but i'm sure you guys can make the guess of what this thing is used for and it is used for gathering keef i've explained it i haven't explained it i've showed in a couple of one of my other videos i've been like oh yeah this is my keef box or whatever but people have always asked me like what are you doing why are you shaking this what is this box like blah blah blah basically you put grinded weed in the top you can fit like a [ __ ] qp of grinded weed in here if you really wanted to and shake it around and you get keith out of the bottom now it might not look like a lot of key but if i scrape that together that's going to give us a nice little line that tony montana would just [ __ ] snort right up his [ __ ] nose okay so today we're gonna [ __ ] around with the keith box a little bit i'm gonna show you guys how it works i'm gonna grind up the rest of my uh buds jar the ones that's like all the different strains i'm gonna grind up every single one of these buds which is probably like probably like four or five grams in here maybe and i'm gonna throw it all in here and we're gonna shake it up we're gonna get the key from it i'm gonna show you guys how much we yielded and uh we're just gonna toke on it so i hope you guys enjoy the video and this one's for all you keith lovers out there and hash lovers too because you can uh get a little collection like i'm doing here big ass not a little collection and i got this within a matter of weeks like maybe a month um not even trying like if you try every day you can have this jar filled in probably a month but uh i'm gonna make some hash out of this once it's full so let's get to the token let's get to the session i'm here with my boy icee so we're going to get some [ __ ] big clouds in here so let's get it going boys all right you guys so i'm going to get rid of this keef here that's already in the box just so we can see how much that we're going to yield from the weed that we're grinding up here with just this little bit like 4 or 5 grams so let's get rid of the keep that i already have in here but this is how much is already in there from just a little bit of shake and [ __ ] that was sitting in there look at that nice little [ __ ] pile of keith boys and that's you know barely barely trying to get the [ __ ] key so i'm going to take that throw it in the key jar here basically that's how i fill my jar up all the different strains and all the different weed that i haven't put in here just goes through and boom crazy [ __ ] keith collection all right so yeah we've got about let's see one two like six or seven nugs in here and i'm gonna get them all grinded up and right into the [ __ ] keith box i will see you guys after this is all grinded up because it's going to take me a second here these are all pretty hefty little nugs so and i don't want to overload the grinder so i'll see you guys when we got it all grinded up and in the box all right so we got the grinded up weed in here it's probably close to [ __ ] 70 grams of grinded wheat in here so as you can see it feels more than about half the bottom and it's pretty [ __ ] thick like if you wanted to you could probably fill the whole bottom just by spreading out all the weed and [ __ ] but i'm going to give this a shake and i'm going to show you guys how much we get see all that weed in there the other way it's hard to show but yeah so close it up now you don't want to be [ __ ] aggressively shaking it all over the place or you might have some leakage and some keep coming down but just softly give it some some shaking so that you can hear the weed and you know the weeds [ __ ] going all across the screen and that's pretty much all you need is it just to move around a little bit because if you shake it too hard all the keef is just going to be like leaking out the sides and i don't know what the newer box is but mine is an old box i've had it since i was in high school so all right boys let's give a couple more shakes here okay so we barely shook it and you guys saw how much weed was in there took out the keith entirely so this is what you guys are gonna get just from that little bit of [ __ ] weed in there now this is just from a little bit of shaking i shook the box for maybe maybe 20 seconds sit here and shake some more boom right there you got an instant pile of thief and it's not done like this isn't all the key you're gonna get like it's slowly gonna fall through the bottom and it's slowly gonna build up on here but if you just grind up all your weed that isn't like your immediate personal smoking weed or weed that you don't really care about that much if people have extra wheat i mean i'm in the position where i have extra weed and you might be a little envious of that but [ __ ] it put your extra weed in here and when you're toking on it and grabbing from it or whatever periodically you're just gonna have a [ __ ] little like excess little thing of key from the bottom and it's great for sessions it's great for packing up the bowl with a bunch of keef grab some hash put some keef and everything you throw that [ __ ] on there and you're [ __ ] like maple so let's get some session going that was the box and i'm gonna put some [ __ ] clouds in the air like we do on this channel so cheers boys all right boys so it's only right to pack up a fat keith bowl with the keith that we just got you're gonna use a [ __ ] ton of it for a nice keef mountain oh my gosh how's that you guys guys [Music] you already knew keep it quiet [Music] already [Music] you", "NRP8dYFXOZY": "I just wanted to show you guys this individually I've showed these in a previous video but I didn't review these individually CBD hemp direct sells some pre-roll some options include 1 Grand Prix rolls 3 gram and a jazzy pre-roll joint with Keith infused in it now I've smoked one of these and a little risk associated with this is that this one here with the wrap on it and with all the bud that came into it when I put this on the scale it comes out at 4 grams it's about even when I put one of these two on it it comes out at like 2.8 so that's obviously less than the 3 grams of flour that you're supposed to begin so for the 15 dollar price that these are they really while 3 grams of flour is worth $15 these things go pretty quickly I was lucky enough to get these as add-on items before CBD hemp direct updated their website and got rid of add-on items so these were definitely worth the add-on price but I don't think that with what you get out of these pre rolls here that they're really worth like 12 bucks or 810 a gram you know this one I think you can get it for like 8 bucks I got it for 5 and I feel like it's barely worth the 5 so if you are a fan of pre-rolls and you were curious as to what you'll get with CBD hemp directs payrolls they blunts are juicy J hand perhaps they aren't tobacco wraps so they're a lot smoother and they are absolutely full of flavor the strawberry is actually really really strong and the natural I thought this was gonna be more of like a green tobacco leaf flavor but this is actually like a very light vanilla very very pleasant if I were to go back and get more pre-rolls from them I would just order Naturals the tubes that they come in are really cool though this the the reason I bought this pre-roll here was just because I wanted the screw top tube the one gram pre-rolls you might get this with the quark super satisfying to hold CBD hemp directs buds are you know little harsh so you know keep that in mind when you're ordering this these are the AC diesel strains they used to use cherry wine but they upgraded their pre-rolls to AC diesel so if you were curious and wanted to see a pre-roll in size comparison before ordering one this is what you'll get", "0uQa8MqasHo": "yo what up youtube welcome back smoking with small town you know the rules kids bounce on up out of here and if you're new to the channel click that [ __ ] down below and subscribe today i do got a weed review it's another cavi cone review the strain today is original gangster there's the packaging it comes in the original gangster this is a cavicon it is a top shelf flower infused with 95 distillate and blended with keef so it's like moon rocks well it is moon rocks in a joint so i have done a few other reviews for of the cavi cones if you haven't seen those go ahead and check them out here's the boxes and and stuff here it is by caviar gold they are a great company they got the jane silent bob line i have reviewed a few of those if you haven't seen them go ahead and go check it out but the original gangster here it is and it is uh total cat like the total cannabinoids in this is uh what is it [ __ ] my bad 630 milligrams and total thc 472 and the cbd 102 milligrams so it's got a lot of thc and a lot of cbd the original gangster is an og and you can get these at a lot of dispensaries they're starting to get quite popular and today the strain is original gangster i want to say this is an indica dominant hybrid but i'm not 100 on that and they do run you about 20 bucks a piece but all places sell them for different prices so don't hold me to that the other one i reviewed was the apple drip the apple drip one if i remember correctly i gave it 8.4 and it tasted just like sour apples or like green apples this is that original gangster by caviar gold i do have uh a lot of their stuff here the moon rocks the jay and silent bob line uh if you haven't tried their tinctures this is these are really good too i recommend taking about 15 drops for like a novice but you have to experiment with those drops and see how much are good for you i'm not sure if they still sell these but they used to have the little cavities which are like these mini joints and they're fun they're really mini you only get like six hits off them when they're gone they're little mini joints okay so far [Music] for the original gangster i do taste the og the og comes through but it also has the distillate in the key so so far i like it and there is one and a half grams inside each one of these pre-rolls these joints the cavi cone it does get a big resin ring around it once you start you can see it right there that wet around there that resin ring that's all that [ __ ] all that thc that distill it the more i'm hitting it the more it's hitting me let's see which one i like better the original gangster or the apple drip because i want to say the j and silent bob ones are a little higher in the thc than these i believe you know what time it is cheers everybody let's get a shotgun in there are a few strains i still haven't tried i gotta review the uh snooki buchi's pre-roll and i have to review the king cavi the king cavi og uh pre-roll i do have those i will be reviewing them uh in the next week or so oh i cheers up let's try it again sorry [Music] whoa ah gotta get that burp out there we go i love how slow these burn they burn so slow they last [ __ ] forever like i said before these are these are good for two maybe three people it'll get two three people lit because i'm already stoned in i'm not even halfway yet the ash is a more of a white to light gray it's not all white ash but it's got the distillate and the keep in there too so and it doesn't have any information what distillate they use or what key you know i really don't have any information on that maybe one day they'll put it online or on their packaging so far i'm not disappointed i like the original gangster they do have flower of this too they don't just have the pre-rolls you can get an actual eighth of original gangster uh like weed the flower and i want to say it's moon rocks like comes in the box like this one here this here was the strong berry and i've reviewed the ice water and the strong berry if you guys haven't seen those go ahead and go check them out okay i'm gonna get like two more hits added i can give you guys my official review uh quick movie recommendation the shawshank redemption if you guys haven't seen it you're [ __ ] up you're missing out it's a great [ __ ] movie uh it's a prison movie but i don't think there's any rape in it not that i remember no prison sex so that's always good it's a really [ __ ] good movie if you guys haven't seen it i definitely recommend checking it out uh the shawshank redemption it's a great flick and burps okay last hit let's go all right let's calculate it up okay price that varies from place to place for what you're getting uh because it they burn they last forever and it's got the distillate and the keep in it uh these are extremely [ __ ] good so for you know 20 bucks 12 bucks whatever you're getting them for it's a decent price it's good for what you're getting the uh the look that looks like ju all the other ones they use the same cones and everything else can't see the weeds so i can't tell you about the look the the smell on the dry pool on this is tastes like an og nothing crazy about it it's pretty normal the high or the smoothness the smoothness is there it's my throat's not all [ __ ] up and it's even in the joint this isn't even bong hit and the high the high is there too i'm loaded but i'm not any more loaded than i was when i uh smoked the apple drip but the apple drip had a better flavor so i remember giving the apple drip an 8.4 so i'm gonna have to give the original gangster by uh caviar gold the cabbie cone i'm giving it the 8 3 because it's right there on par with the uh with the apple drip but it doesn't taste as good so the apple drip gets a point better for the taste other than that they're almost identical in the way that they get you loaded so i'm giving it the 8.3 that was my review hope you guys enjoyed it until next time

review today i think it tastes like weed [Music] thanks for watching guys today we're going to be reviewing a cookie's purchase that i did on my last little haul at the cookie store which is the selfies pre-rolls which i'll insert a little closer up clip of the pre-rolls and the packaging here in this video now i have tried a couple times to film this video kind of unsuccessfully what's up you guys it's king kali here for another mini vlog even though i don't know what order of my vlogs are coming in on which is why i'm gonna sound so excited in these vlogs compared to my little review videos where i sound just kind of dead sometimes but anyway we're gonna fix that we're doing it on the go vlog today yeah so i'm just saying this isn't gonna be the main video you guys this will be inserted in the video just like another vlog that i have coming up um but i have a lot of videos coming up so i'm not sure when this one will be up but we're going to be doing the little selfies we're actually going to smoke so i did go ahead and smoke both of the indica pre-rolls already the medellin the medallion was the indica it comes in little two packs half grams so each are 0.25 grams there's selfies payroll so they're just little personal hits that you can do the medallion tested at 20.4 and less than 2 cbd when i smoked these and now let me tell you guys i don't think this is like super premium flour i think this is just for a quick on the go smoke for a nice little quick smoke i'm in a little you know easy to go packaging i don't think this is the most affordable pre-roll if that's what you're looking for for your money because for eight dollars for two um little pre-rolls that are 0.25 grams you could purchase a full gram per roll for like 10 bucks you know and get a little more worth your money but then again it's not going to come in the cute little packaging and it's not going to come in a little .25 gram it'll be a fuller one but that's completely up to you and there's tons of little selfies i'm not little selfies but little mini pre-rolls and joints that are out there now to try today we are going to be doing the one that i showed you guys a close-up of in this video which is the super glue so super glue is a hybrid strain this one tests at 20.4 as well now super glues origins um should be northern lights and skunk so let's go ahead and like this one up and see now if you guys look in my video it is really small like really tiny like i light it and it's gonna be gone in a second it's not even going to be a really long pre-roll video now i will say that it is like a super glue it has a very kind of um funky kind of taste to it to me it's not super sweet it's not super harsh it has a nice little white ash at the top of it here um where it's starting to burn i mean like two or three hits this will basically be done and you put it out so let's go ahead and hit it again so for a little pre-rolls that you could just take on the go with you guys you know if you're just pulling up somewhere and you just want something to just pull out and smoke on real quick this is like a fun little idea do i think this is the perfectly best tasting flower to be honest no i think it's okay it's not the worst flower ever smoked um doesn't taste just like trim or anything it does have a nice taste to it but it's not something that you know i pick up i would personally prefer to roll my blunts or joints if i'm gonna smoke them but yeah it has a nice white ash coming to it we'll also open the lime which is the sativa here on camera today too let me go ahead and grab the little clipper that i'm using for it because i don't know where any of my scissors have gone but the clipper works just fine to open them up we'll go ahead and pull one out looks just the same as the other one um this other little one is pretty much almost gone anyway but for a hybrid i would say this has a nice mellow taste to it it's not like a strong um too strong of like a taste to me to where it's you know unsmokable but i would say this definitely has more of an outdoorsy type taste to it because it is sun-grown pre-rolls most likely because it's eight dollars for two little mini pre-rolls it's cute packaging i like the little reflective packaging that they have um but just for a little on the go pre-roll i think that's the really only point to it the lime which is the sativa taste are tests at twenty point two percent thc less than two percent cbd let's go ahead and light the sativa one up and see how it is and hopefully i mentioned it when i was talking about the super glue but that one is a hybrid the medallion which is the one that i don't have to show you guys to smoke is the indica one which is this one right here because i tried to film the video before and it wasn't working now i will say these are cute these are cool um definitely like to throw in your purse or something or your backpack and not have it smell and just want to open one or two it's definitely nice because they're small also they don't really go out or anything so i think that's the nice thing of it too now when i also looked up the lime in the medellin just for kind of strain info for you guys i think the lime is more of just a lemonade lemon strained derivament um the medellin comes from specifically cookies brand flour they rolled out the medellin as a sun grown strain before i'm not too sure on the medallions madeans medan's origin um but i just wanted to go ahead and do a little fun little review because i haven't done many pre-roll videos i think only just the one which is the lift tickets that i did before for you guys but i'm going to go ahead and end the video here and thank you guys so much for watching if you guys want to write any

thank you for watching guys have a great day bye", "aM1yQRZ6g7Y": "what's up everyone welcome to the smoke session today I'm gonna be talking about Keith and I actually have some Keith's loaded up in the bong if you want to know how to get Keith you just have to get a grinder with a bottom piece like this not all grinders have these so if you're just going to your local head shop you just have to make sure you ask about the bottom piece that might have the pollen collector is one way to call it or if you're an illegal state you can just ask for the Keith catcher you can see that Keith in there usually they come with a little scooper so you can just scoop up the Keith easier if you don't have one of those a something like a penny or a nickel works well also I have the high side loaded up let's fire it up before I started using grinders the biggest thing I really wondered is how much weed does it really take to get a certain amount of Keef so my answer to that is it depends how good your weed is for those who don't know Keef is the trichomes on the buds basically so the more tri comes the more buds you're gonna get the other thing that can help you get more Keef is if you have your grinder like this and you just hit it up against something hard you could use your hand if you need to but you'd have to hit it pretty hard what works best is just a really hard surface like a rock or maybe a coffee table or any sort of table would work great and that knocks the Keef down into there I'd say to get about on average like enough to put like a Keith dome on top you probably need at least maybe about a 20 sack at the least two grams or an eighth would be ideal probably for that and to get a key full like if you want to fill the whole bowl up with Keef like I said again it really depends how good your whe it is but the best estimate is anywhere from 7 grams to 14 grams you know so that's 7 grams at the least to 14 grams I would say at the most but like I saying it all depends how good your weed is because the Keef is the trichomes that comes off the buds let's take another rip of the bowl if you liked what you saw make sure to give the hit to that thumbs up button

from sac or West Sacramento if I can get it to focus here alright so there we go there is their Instagram 2019 recycled so this has got some standard warning and all the information on the pre-roll so you've got the THC as being 228 potency twenty two point eight two which is what they have had on the other ones this is a one gram this one was 729 it is called balance balance allowance anyway let's break this thing open I did not see any perforations on it but we'll see if we can get into it in a plastic too [Music] all right so we've got a little bit of product in the tube not quite sure where that's coming from because it seems like it's pretty sealed at the top anyway [Music] looks good the paper is a little bit past the tip but so it was packed a little light in this area but you can just squish it down to to fill that you can see there's already a little I wouldn't call it breakage but a little bending at the end that's packed correctly it doesn't seem to do that thanks that is tough balance thanks for watching", "OvKV_L8iLHQ": "[Music] this how it looks how the hell i can't park i'm gonna turn in here and follow the signs oh okay this is the parking and i'm going to park in

the cbd is the relaxation okay so with relaxation we also have the full spectrum which is a delta strand of thc within the legal limit okay everything we have is legal so which is less than three percent but if you're doing it in an edible we can do two ways we can do it with the relaxation of the cbd or we can do with the relaxation with a slight euphoria with the legal limit of the thc i like that version okay so will we have a more hey you guys what's up welcome back to another lip video today we finna get super super late super super late off some cbd yes if you're in my hometown do not comfort me cause y'all are missing out y'all haven't even tried it go down somewhere in a row down here at chattanooga but dispensary they have five stars on google reviews i'm going to link all of their information down below so y'all can check them out and have a legal cool vibe to yourself daily like i will because i have anxiety i do take cbd gummies here and there and they bail me out instead of just thinking about crazy stuff all the time and being paranoid etc so today i went and spent like 92.86 to give you guys a good review of um cbd products and to try it for you guys i know that some people are skeptical of the effects especially if you have a high tolerance for medication and stuff like that so i'ma try it out for you starting with this this is five servings it's like a peanut butter stick [Music] 50 grams [Music] and this is just like um five dollars i think but if your child has adhd and they're on medication already i'm motivated i always talk to your doctor [Music] trying to open it all the way for y'all this is how much i gotta open and we're just gonna squeeze it through there [Music] wow i'm sorry for the smacking it's so good it's a little bit thinner than uh [Music] [Music] the most expensive item that i purchased there it is the delta a 600 milligram strawberry shortcake and you're supposed to put a drop of this under your tongue daily so it can be in your system every day so really give you the effects of being calm and have a sense of euphoria without being super tired and lazy oh i can already smell it smells super good next time i think i'm going to get a vape but i'm going to see how this video does like what my views look like my likes and comments are looking like also i'm kind of sad because i did reach a thousand subscribers twice and now i'm at like 996. so i'm probably gonna lose subscribers anyways i lose and gain subscribers daily so [Music] if this offends you i'm sorry go watch another one of my videos or making someone zoom but we're gonna get a full [Music] drop [Music] uh-huh [Music] that was stupid oh i don't know what i think oh my gosh i think i feel it already so i held it under my tongue [Music] and the directions didn't say to do that it just says take ten droplets um first everything and take one or two servings per day daily but it has a good flavor it has a feeling it's like really thin it's not like an oily texture or a watery texture it's kind of like air but a little oil it's weird i don't know how to explain it but i held it under my tongue and i tasted it a little bit then it didn't taste like nothing and then my mouth was melted and yeah i feel good i think i'm second other one i feel it immediately whoa whoa [Music] [Music] um oh that's so weird i've never had a picture before and that's supposed to be like the best in the store it's supposed to be like at the borderline of being legal and i can see why i feel immediate relaxation but i'm not lazy like i just got like a boost of happiness too but um [Music] [Music] um [Music] let's see how this pre-roll goes oh i didn't even tell y'all i got a pre-roll yet we're gonna get to it this is the other one i forgot what this is called i think it's sour sugar candy and i got a gram of [Music] that [Music] this one smells better so if you want to see me roll up make sure you comment below if you want another smoke sesh a little review of chattanooga but dispensary let me know and i will be rolling it up in these uh the first flavor is grape ape it's the organic hemp wrap plus cbd is infused in the wrap i've used this before and i love it another flavor is the hydro lemonade same kind of wrap and they're vegan real cute really cute and the last one is maui mango and i got all three cbd hemp wraps for five bucks so if you want to just get some wraps go in there because they taxing at the gas station for these with every purchase you get a free pre-roll oh love all pre-rolls is made with us so without any further ado i got my pink big flick and get into it i haven't hot box forever because hey i just don't like having a car smile anything except fragrance [Music] whatever you got to say i don't care try it first and then you can complain [Music] because it's really not even that bad for real i'm not playing i'm not kevin they have 14 different strands of flour and this is like one of those oh now this is all 14 in each free roll and it really is made with love because you know papers be going out [Music] but literally every time i do a video these people come to work on me and my boyfriend house which i love that they're working on the house because you are getting it renovated and they're coming to that job but still like they have a good flavor though no cap go and buy you just a little gummy in there or get you some reloads and you can get a free pre-rolling if yourself [Music] i'm feeling relaxed but my mind is straight i can go to work and be focused [Music] a little [Music] okay y'all so my overview is it looks like it's a filter in this b that's just smoke baby a little bitty green okay so um i think i'm definitely going to be converted to cbd for sure

done but as I said on yesterday's video I've had a lot of stuff on the plate in a minute so I've had a hard time last cut the works not gonna lie it's been stressing about things things that don't even really matter I don't know why I'm getting stressed out over it so obviously some things do matter but yeah just a little things all build up the line you're not getting stressed out over nothing

out a bit have a look at this pre-roll it's come sealed as well so you know it's not being tampered with well one second guys a bit awkward where I'm trying to do this see if it goes I look at the pre-roll if he was to come for the pre-roll as well I think the roach they say broach on there they some bro dogs absolutely filthy wow that is really nice the terpenes on that is crazy I smell so sweet [Music] it's really tightly rolled as well so there's plenty in there hard to get fun out of it to be honest [Music] burned him very strange I know so into it Bernal at before to be honest so that we cherries just come straight off [ __ ] massive cherry as well ice better now now after that cherry off from the a up again third panes on this crazy don't even say start a proper join it's nice a bit funky I like it I CBD isolate terpenes Monica cannabinoids for Wayne percent see woody I'm gonna keep the job as well so when I've got joining the pocket just use that tube site don't get destroyed in pocket Matt Saunders join me pocket get down the road because obviously rolling indoors smoking out so I get round the corner and it's a lot bent up and [ __ ] it's not very strong this joint it's not very strong at all there's hardly any froggy to it also you psychopath and they don't really fall out you've had nothing I look look at that guy's they still just came straight out I took a puff on it and then when I went to take the Jordan at the mouth it all just fell out so yeah it's pretty well it's a no from me it's a shame that he's so mad at what it looks like looks a bit fairy there's a bit weird that's not markup at say to be quite honest pretty disappointed really I didn't bring our Ritter's out cuz I thought I'll just be smoking that but now I can't do this to step and look at the cherry their cherries come off and all that just came flying out we side that properly we pulled it on the camera now it's quite funny now um yes really make me down there as say yeah I've got the lemon skunk and that bike and irises on me and I haven't got a vaporizer to use this or add a brick or anything for this I've got a vibe indoors I can use with this stuff with I thought I can use no no no I can't use liquor with me I can only use like Chateau or flower see I'm not doing of a pity hour later on just on the shower or just video on the lemon skunk before but I'll do another one back in a second guys CS bit disappointing that is not sure how that says yeah pretty well hard to buy but if I balled out I think Oliver would have definitely made a complaint because hemp elf sent me all this over yeah big shots who fares from hemp health is really sort of me out with all this stuff see ya anyway I'll do another review at the lemon skunk because it someone ages ago I don't know if it's the same the same sort of a fee no it could be a different fee no or different Bachelor together so I don't know it might be a different supplier see I'll try the review on that this stuff as well and I'll do a video of the fake liquid this is going to be a standard shortly flavor liquid anyway so there's no expiry date written on there what's the percentage 500

gone by in the shop a lot a bit of time that's what I'm getting there the office ice the nice won't really sweet when it when I opened it up and that so I thought it's gonna be nice and I disappoint

"okay this is the reefer Ranger we're going to do a little display of it at the top plate this is the center plate and this is the lower plate slides right on sets down we're going to use a 109 cones all our materials have been classified through the screen now we're going to lay our material because we know we have three hundred and twenty four cones all one gram so we're going to weigh out 324 grams dropping our cones in of it dropping our cones we've already adjusted therefore the height for raw cones if you have another manufacturer you can use you can raise it or lower it to cut the cones properly and you got allen wrench and we use that with the helen wrench so just the height right here at all four corners all four corners and then they and they just drop straight in yeah just drop the cone just like you normally would and any other cone filling machine the boring part okay we're going to spread our material in in the holes to fill up to one gram of material [Music] to see any stems falling off now we have all the material in the holes that's all should weigh about a gram in each hole I'll vibrate a little bit okay now we should slide off your your Center plate you just vibrate it and all the material will go down into each [Music] [Music] and you can take off your top play all your tones are full pick up your plate send it down on something flat and all the cones pop up we're ready to roll even quest Thanks nice tight joint each one of these rolled cones weigh just the right amount zero three that's what's that's alright which one yeah also it's that's our

tell you a little bit about the machine what comes with the king cone how you use it and how to create high quality pre-rolls with this machine so let's get into it the king cone is a cone filling machine for those wanting to step up their pre-roll production but aren't quite ready for a higher capacity machine like the cone packer or sluice box the king cone is great because it has a modular design which allows any of the parts to be easily replaced if worn out another great benefit is that out of the box the king cone is compatible with 109 98 and 84 millimeter cones and because of the king cone's modular design we can design custom trays for many different sized cones and tubes so now let me show you what comes with the king cone the king cone comes with a vibrating base which has a control panel on the side two overflow containers which catch any excess material which doesn't make it into the cones a cover shield to secure the overflow containers in place an 84-90 millimeter tray and an additional extension tray to do 109 millimeter cones finally the machine also comes with a lid to prevent any spillover so let me show you how it all works your king cone will arrive fully assembled but i will give you a quick rundown of how to put it together first you will place both collection trays on top of the vibrating base these will click into place thanks to the magnets on the bottom of the tray then you place the cover shield into place covering the exposed parts of the base an important thing to note is that there are two switches along the bottom of the vibrating base and you want to line these ridges up with the grooves on the switch so the cover sits flush with the vibrating base once you have the cover shield securely in place you should lock it into place by closing the switches on both sides next you place the base tray on top today we are running 84 millimeter cones so we don't need to add the additional tray we only need to add the additional tray if we want to run 109 millimeter cones the tray we have on right now works with 84 and 98 millimeter cones if you want to do other sizes of cones a custom tray can be made for whatever size cone or tube you want to use the first step is to load the cones into each individual slot there are 169 slots on this machine and once all the cones are loaded into the machine you want to spread the material across the top into each cone and as with other pre-rolled machines without a metering tray you will want to pre-weigh the material since we are doing half grand pre-rolls you will want to pre-weigh around 100 grams of material as you spread the material across the top you won't want to do it as evenly as possible use about half the material and run the vibration to ensure each cone is well packed once each cone is about half packed spread the rest of the material and run the vibration again this time you may want to place the lid on top to ensure that the material doesn't overflow once the cones are fully packed the next step is to pull the cone cartridge off the machine and place it on a flat surface once placed on a table the cones will pop out and can be easily grabbed to be finished off with a tamp and then either a twist or a folded top as you can see the king cone pre-roll machine is definitely a great way to increase production while still producing high quality prerolls one of the advantages of the king cone is that it actually bounces the cones up and down rather than just relying on vibration this helps create a good pack throughout the pre-roll so that's how you use the king cone to make high-quality pre-rolls if you have any questions at all or interested in any other pre-world machines packaging or cones please visit our website

city like a rocket this morning time got stuff to do for me that's when I believe sativas should be taken what I mean is somebody got an era era and you can't see it was not its tried again people I don't know I'm trying to see what the strain is here it's nice I just can't tell you out what it is it's nice it's mad smooth man you says industrial hand me this doesn't give and you're like this fight I don't know why I take so long to load the same and I gotta ever again oh my god I can't get information on the guys it's just three sativa it doesn't tell you what trying for y'all trying I think their site is down because it's taking that long to load and then when it does load it's an error this is math smooth it tastes good there's no harsh taste no I could see I like this idea I wish you know I have more fun it's still not even loaded and it's an error and ever trying to I'm trying to show y'all again focus be see what I recommend it yeah you know and I mean it's hard to go take a recommendation you don't know the straining I'm gonna try to find some information again and put it as a pin comment but I like it it's smooth I'm feeling it above my eyes yeah it's a t because I'm like yeah this is nice just can't tell you what strain is FC BB you see having coughed one it's smooth oh my god I like this but yeah guys thank y'all for checking out the review I'm sorry that's all

you in the next one I'm out", "siVBKmKx4Q8": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "KOVcgEON8y4": "you know guys what is going on welcome back to another of rads like video today we're gonna show you guys how to make Keef infused coffee it's uh I don't haven't tried before so we'll see if it's gonna work or basically we're doing a mythbuster we looked online you can't really find a lot on it and some people say it works some people say it doesn't and be kind of figured out maybe a good method to get to work for you guys so here it is let's get into it alright so what we're gonna do is we're gonna put a scoop of Keef in to the coffee that we brew so we're not that sit for about fifteen minutes to a half hour and that should allow the weed to fuse with the milk that's gonna be in your coffee first things first you're gonna need obviously a coffee maker your coffee I need milk because that's gonna bind to the THC your grinder with your Keef yeah coffee cups and a thermos to let it D carve a little bit yeah so kind of the plan is is to brew the coffee mix everything together in the thermos and just have it sit there for about 15 minutes coffee brews at 195 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit so if we let that sit for 15 minutes it might carve it a little bit of it a little bit it's not gonna be as good as say D carping it in the oven obviously because it's gonna be out of way lower temperature by like about a hundred degrees Fahrenheit so it's not gonna necessarily be carpet fully but you're still gonna get same effects if you use a really good thermos and let it sit there for like I don't know half hour longer you could probably get it up til you know it's full potential but we're just gonna show you guys quickly and yeah the method yeah cuz reading online they say it needs to be in boiling water which is 212 degrees Fahrenheit for 90 to 120 minutes which we're not trying to wait that long right this is supposed to be a quick convenient way to get high so we're gonna put that to the test so the original way to make this it calls for 0.25 Tuesday point five grams of Keef four to six ounce drinks we're gonna up that though to a gram four to six ounce drinks and see if we can get more effects that way as well keep here how's that you guys can really see it just from the angle that's sitting and I want tip it so it pours everywhere so that's what you guys see I really hope this works this is good chunk of my grinder Keith's going out into this experiment but I guess we're doing it so you don't have to if it doesn't work doesn't really say how much melt to use so just gotta wing it so when you're making edibles you normally use butter but that's obviously way more fatty than same Elka's so I'm thinking for the amount of keep that we have the ratio might be all right because it's 0.5 keith and we have 2% milk so 25 of Keith with I would have probably guessed maybe like a hundred milliliters of milk maybe I don't know probably even less than that but I would probably say you want at least you know a milliliter per point hold one gram of Keith that seems about a reasonable number and obviously you don't want skim milk because that's that's gonna be [ __ ] for this you're gonna want a higher milk so in 2% 1% all right but go with the two probably a better choice yeah a higher percent the better but so we got right now so got away to you so while the coffee is boiling and whatever I would say that you might as well take the keys that you have and pour it in your thermos that you're gonna use do you trying to multitask and wait waiting for your coffee okay so the coffee is ready Keef is pretty much in there so I'm just gonna pour it in it looks like all right there we go you got our key floating at the top of our coffee we're gonna pour in as much Memphis as we can yeah just like none haha not gonna be uh never got mixing we can add a little bit more milk later I don't know how it's gonna mix per se but Rick it off a little get off a little bit I mean your backup coffee leak you know okay now we wait 15 minutes so it's 6:20 now I'm gonna wait till 6:35 well at the very least it might so I mean some didn't even call from milk Barlet yes understand like the heats enough to activate it well I mean if we find it with the milk then it should in theory wrong work so yeah that was one that I saw somewhere else but I was like yeah it makes sense [ __ ] so now we're just gonna let it rest for 15 minutes and we'll have ourselves somebody to keep you coffee keep copy alright so we let the coffee rest for about 20 minutes so we're just gonna pour it out we're gonna have it a quick swirl you know hopefully get it all mixed up nicely yeah let's see oh don't drink it up like that it's not some pressure but I forgot a little bit of pressure you wanna lick it get all the keep Dylan oh yeah [Music] that's kind of gross hey why it's a keep you metal oh this smells very strong whiskey does it oh yeah all right well Cheers do tease yeah it's real they keep you holding Clark Basel is coffee tastes like [ __ ] because it is [ __ ] Austin yeah well you know mister we're missing some sugar or missing the sug my coffee black except today not today I don't know if it got hot enough to do anything like I really don't know I feel like you need to microwave it but that would just ruin the coffee so and it would've really Keith is not how I supposed to microwave Keith I don't think okay well hopefully it's hung off is that good yeah it's probably fine this isn't alcohol bro yeah that's Kia happy interesting mm-hmm it adds a flavor all right so we're gonna drink this cup of coffee are these cups of coffee mmm and they were gonna report back to you and uh I don't know however long it takes to hit us or we're not hit us what you know yeah see you guys in a bit all right so we're back honestly I had very minimal effects probably got zero point five out of five so yeah it's pretty minimal we definitely have some recommendations to maybe make it work better like 100% IPD carb door you're Keef it would work on a percent you could put it on anything and it will get you baked you put anything you picked and maybe maybe I was thinking if you could do like a stovetop with your milk and just sit there and stir it for a bit to like help it bind better because I think like having it in with the coffee didn't find very well yeah it was maybe too watery I think possibly infer for it to bind cuz like just when I drink my cup of coffee at the very end all I got was like a [ __ ] giant dump of Keith in my mouth and I was like eating sawdust is kind of gross yeah the temperature I think was a problem I just don't think it's hot enough to do much and it doesn't stay hot enough long enough for it to do anything so I think be carving it is the most important part of it but it's supposed to work without dee carving and I don't think I could say I've really worked without dee carving yet don't think there's not enough heat to do it I mean if you have something that I was like actually wait hotter than boiling say if he had like I don't know like 300 degrees Fahrenheit or something like that I would probably have a better chance of working but the fact that it was only like two regular boiling water temperature I don't think it's gonna cut it yeah and I mean what we read was it would take 90 to 120 minutes in boiling water for it to be active and there's just no way that that is convenient at all for yeah colicky what maybe would be convenient as if you had your coffee and you put your Keefe in it and you had it sit there for one and a half two hours getting video later realizing out to the mountains for a hike or something that's a good idea maybe it could work but like but just letting it sit for like 15 minutes it really doesn't do much case tastes pretty awful too yeah though there's an interesting flavor is uh is yaffe and as you could say yeah yeah not my favorite coffee I've ever had alright so those are basically our recommendations so I didn't work you guys want to try it let us know how it works for you guys in the comments down below we're gonna be trying this again but with the hash we made in the hash video I'll put the little card up here and maybe link in description who knows we'll see oh yeah so we're gonna try with that hash and make another video so you'll see you guys in the future so yeah remember stay rad guys catch y'all later peace out lady listen scrapped goodbye", "bHGQrMd07pY": "[Music] - rollin yeah okay here we go welcome back slowly youtubers Steve Blair here obviously and the next video is gonna be on juicy fruit CBD hemp Keith now we did the unboxing video we took a little pulled one what anybody wanted to see first and we did that and then we were talking about the next video we had mentioned thrown out there that we were going to we had the idea of pressing hash out of Burnett's videos product and some people really liked that they were hey I'd love to see that so here's what we have we have what's called sharp stone I've had this for quite a while I don't know if you can see can't well the names like right there alright cool so basically I don't know if you guys have ever seen one of these but what this is pollen press okay and a pollen press what it does is it takes pollen from flowers and presses it now there's three essential parts here obviously there's the the chamber which you put the product in excuse me then there's the plug which goes in over top of the product and then the cap which goes in over top goes out goes over top on the outside and then it screws down tight and then you press everything so since we've got all these ports apart here let's do this now here's the product first I can't smell it because it's glass jar but we'll show you what it looks like in there anyway let's see if Leslie down in the bag that's what looks like when you get it [Music] this is what the journals like this is one gram here so in my past experience of hash making it takes two things to make pitch heat and pressure but when you have dry particulate like this what I like to do is I got this little scooby thing basically I want to take the product Wow like solid almost so it's pretty well pressed in there okay pack it in there pretty good what I like to do so have this little bit over a little bit of water here I kind of like to take a little bit of the water and put it in here like this kind of good see if we can get a drop because it's not going off my finger there we go it's a little bit of water to kind of get it to solidify I was probably too much actually but we'll see here maybe it was enough just kind of get it to start to get a little moist because being that is so dry we kind of want it to kind of stick together congeal this is maybe the word I'm looking for tonight what I do is I start I kind of pre-press it by pushing it with this thing like this together this is just how I do it I mean I don't there may be other people who like to do it other ways but I find that this is the best way with this type of press that we have kind of gets it all together and one ball makes it easier to manipulate and deal with no if I was gonna put the whole gram in there in the press I probably wouldn't go to all this but I'm just one person and I just want to you know use it a little bit at a time so the recipe is fresh in the jar and then actually I was probably the perfect amount of water actually so now we've got this piece here kind of stuck together scrape all this up here this is where you start to kind of work it with your fingers now you can see it's a little more like pliable see some appliable easier to work with yeah you know sometimes the process of doing these things as is part of the the whole roulade self-medicating in some ways so basically you just kind of roll this in your hand with your thumb you just kind of keep rolling Chuck it's all used up you don't have it all over your hand anymore and now it's a pliable little ball okay now we have this tiny little ball here now remember I said pressure and heat the reason we're rolling it around and our hand is to warm it up okay warming it we're getting it soft we're gonna get kind of congealed and mixed together now we need the one last element that makes it hatch and that's pressure and that's where this thing comes in this is nice and warm this is like almost my body temperature if not warmer than my body temperature from friction so let's try and hurry this up so we don't lose that heat we've just just ate there okay so now we could talk a minute about something here I don't know if anybody knows that this is 17.2% CBD um they carry other types of Keith they have jazz Keith and I think they might still have therapy I know they pre-press therapy and jazz into its own hash but if I were to purchase this myself like I did here okay and I wanted to purchase jazz hash I would rather maybe buy the kief and press it little by little on my own because then I'm making it and it's just fresh as it can be instead of already pressed put into something and sat around for a week or two till it goes out the door and into the mail and to your door so I would probably like I did this I would buy it little by little and process that's why I have a press now I can find out where these can be purchased and put that description in the link down for the information in the description sorry I can find out where you can purchase these and put that information in it's cruising down below so it doesn't take long for this to happen I mean the magically takes a moment I mean it's not like we're making like five pounds of hash here and we need to keep this up to temperature and we need to put it in a great big press and press it and have a keep pressing for hours and hours and hours until finally it becomes hash this is on such a small scale that this inside your shitty black button now twist this out yep and now what was Green what was this color nice bright green is now this color it's getting darker it's almost black here's what we're gonna do because I like mine a little darker than this we're gonna take this off of here because once you press it once you're not you don't have to stop there you can press it over and over and over and over so now all we have to do is come and get it warm again in her hand like this a couple passes over your hand with your thumb woman right up and soften it back up again because basically when we press it we're smashing all the trichomes and all of the little little bits will trichomes but there's another little pistols that's the one I'm looking for the trichomes and the pistols and we're mashing them together and now they're kind of congealing into one mass take this cools down as we need the heat repressive sit there now that's some juicy fruit flower here flowers and we ground it up already so we're not gonna go outside of the realm of the product itself that way we don't have less CBD from a flower or more CBD from the flower we have the exact same amount of CBD in this flower as we have in this Keef and therefore with do a fair assumption of how well this hash tastes because now we don't have different flavors from different strains you don't have to do it that way I mean you can make yourself some juicy from hash and put it on the top of casino cookies if you I mean I know you guys know that but I mean some people prefer to just keep it together like this here is a pipe tool I took the little Brook the little tamp part off and I just used to pick in the spoon because I prefer to I think those are more useful tools than just about anything when it comes to smoking there you go now that's the color again bright green and as you can see it's gotten even darker yet you can see if you look on the edges they're yellow still shining through the bottom there so I think this is alright now we can now presses come in various sizes okay we have if you travel and you are what I do go out and about you can always just take a smaller press which I can put this in here and show you how it works quick if you want I mean I mean you can't answer me video but basically it's the same concept only there's no twisting part you just have a various number of plugs a cylinder which is this company's canister which is the same as my grinder and then you have various numbers of plugs for various sizes and then you have the two caps on top and one bottom and then what happens is you put this in mm put the first plug a second plugged and then you would take your material here hey guys I said one now it's back into a little congeal Bowl put it in there don't take the cap or the second plug and put it in and take your cap and put one and all you would do what this is just twisted by hand like this mmm he would let sit okay that's long so you get the gist anyway now this is where having a different size plugs comes in because you would take push this off yes take this plug off now you see how it's flush you're not gonna be able to how can you get it out right you know get it out then you take the small plug from the back and push it and there it is just like that so you see now a large scale press for like if you're at home and a small scale press or if you're out and about I mean I I travel around so I mean mm-hmm there have been times I've taken my small press out with me you just did one or whatever because you don't know anything room to carry all this stuff so now we're gonna put this in here yes take this there's the chunk like that right here on top and I'm gonna give to the camera guy he's been quiet sitting here observing observing observing what you think tastes good tastes good oh yeah his hairs compressed it's the cave just been squished he's been running around our house that's good all right okay that's damn good that's tasty no I've had I've had the juicy food on soon and this this is damn good this this is good guys and I'll tell you I think it's better to in my opinion to press it yourself not that there's anything wrong I mean if you don't have a press I mean there's other methods to pressing I mean I've seen people use parchment paper and an iron I've seen people use - method where you take a piece of notebook paper and you wet it excuse me fold it up you put the stuff in a baggie you fold it up you put it in between a piece of notebook paper fold that up wet it and put it in your shoe and walk around all day long like that because then you have constant pressure and heat from your body heat boot - I mean that that's one of the things we used to do when we were in high school don't get any ideas if your kids watch and probably should have said that but this way we were I mean you figure out all kinds of ways to make it work in fact it's very flowery compared to the flower like when we smoke the flower by itself but this has movable like a botanical like flavor but then again you're getting the pollens and the pistols and the trichomes and in that is the terpenes and the flavors so yeah it's gonna be a much more I guess a much more Powell flavor we'll try and get like down here at the bottom with a we showed you what it looks like from there so give a good look at the water here yeah that's some pretty cool bubbly action there right on just being keep it's more of a concentrated concentrated amount of trichomes Wow like that okay so we've gone through the motions we put it all together which smoked it let's hit the daily thing this is by far a better flavor and taste than just the flowers itself its counterpart so daily thing three parts one star being the worst five stars being the best packaging you know normally I'm down with the green and white thing I mean we've got a very my lighter you know normally I'm done with the green white thing but you know what's this this like non x-ray metal kind of a dominium foil as a friend of mine on youtube would refer to it DM Gareth dmg info DMT info shout out to you because an aluminium foil which is probably the proper way to pronounce it for house spoke is it that bad I mean that's really different I mean we're used to the whole white envelope black envelope we're not gonna say this company's name here but you know we've got gold envelope so now we have like silver leads it's different crinkly [Music] SMR or whatever that is what I called it's gonna be a new thing in the daily ASMR or whatever that it's gonna be the new thing for the daily thing yeah yeah okay so packaging isn't that bad it's important getting that it's not that bad I mean it's not flashy it's not like old juicy fruit color like the color tasty flavor well the color in this is very bright I mean it's really really bright bright bright yellow the falling under the packaging again with the glass jar very classy I like it it's it's different it's not the plastic containers like the godly goop stuff comes in the wax or the butters so the glass jar is part of the package he was really good taste and flavor taste amazing it tastes botanical as all get-out I mean like flower to the max even in the pressing like you can see them there's still some yellow even though it's black on the outside like that there's still some yellow down in there you know which means it was a real good press you want it to be black and and hashing on the outside like that but you still wanted to remain yellow inside if you were to press this until it was black the whole way through in my opinion that type of hash tastes like it tastes like almost like like hash oil and you still want to have the essence the taste of the flour so in my book do you want to keep that yellow in there some of that the smoke wasn't that bad it didn't I didn't hack and cough it was very smooth it was very tasty it was a little heavy on the back end I mean it was really concentrated but here we are again it's just concentrated so it's gonna be a little heavier of a smoke not so dry like I thought but we are adding moisture to it to get it to congeal so you know you take all these few things into factors um flowers aside just this product I thought it tasted really good like amazing so on a scale of one to five I give it four and a half four and a half is good family there's no even reason to go into why I'm not giving it the other half I mean out of what I've said you the viewers should be able to gather the few points that probably make up that half that I'm not giving it would I recommend the product yes yes I don't you know every time I use a product I say I would recommend it but there are times when I'm not feeling anything and I still recommend the product because of its potential or so forth I feel this a feeling already I feel it in my lower half of my face and my neck and shoulders what about you what do you feel do you feel it I got it I feel like like right where you're anyway your neck come becomes like your skull okay so where you're Abdullah I've been down it would be yeah yeah so I say I would recommend this product and so long you sell this product guys don't ya go out yourself this product presser guys I'm I highly recommend to press this product it's really good as price and if you can't if you don't own it press get one yeah or like I said there's other alternatives you can always go online there's so many great youtubers out there that are pressing Keith now you might have to like check out my gaya a THC Keith but it's all gonna work this somewhat the same but but a press is is a is I mean if you're an of its smoker and you enjoy and everything I mean you're you are you're already spending the money on the product itself for one but are you spending the prop whether or not you're rolling joints bonds and or even smokin animal fancy bong I mean you gotta you gotta spend the money for your soap so I mean why not go out and buy yourself a press mmm I mean and now I mean like okay you can buy the stuff pressed but to sit down and press it yourself is a whole nother level of satisfactory out of that exactly the process the process now they make pollen boxes I have one I didn't feature in this because we didn't bring the pollen from the plant to the hash stage um plus some of the reason why I didn't just do that prior to this with all the other strings we have is because my problem box kind of got broken and I don't repair of it so you know moving things around I kind of dropped it like a dummy but hey there are means of being able to get the flowers so you don't even have to buy the power you get the flowers put them in a pollen for sugar box and shake off the pollens yourself or a a grinder that catches the thief and press it yourself from these products that you're already purchasing as well which camera guy has one yeah camera guy has a in fact we have grinder right here camera guys this much nicer and bigger grinder but if you look here inside the grinder is a screen and I catch this - Keith into a little container here no I haven't caught it yet we probably ever use that grinder yeah and again it's made by can't store we use it I mean we did use it does not as much as we use the other one yeah that one's a little bit bigger in fact for the vigeous right exactly for the videos so you can do this on your own even you don't even have to buy the pollen you could collect it on your own which again if you're an avid smoke we probably only knew this it's not in your noodle well now I'm telling you you could do this and do it with all the types of smokes or collect all the pollen from all mash more together than one big harmony hash that's what I call it when you have a whole bunch of brands of stuff together and it's all in one container ground up and then all the Keef is collected from the mall I like to refer to that as a company ash a bunch of things all together but nonetheless I would recommend the product because it works the way I feel it is different from the way camera guy feels it but then again order are all of our genetic makeups are different and he could just be experiencing it a little differently there's nothing wrong with that each products gonna work differently with each person but one thing I can say is it is centered around the shoulders neck area which mine's not in the back he's in the front I feel it more on my mouth and my front of my chest and neck in the front but you know could you speed because I'm talking a lot but with that said um you know guys I'm gonna disclaimer this time I tried to every few times because I don't want any misconceptions with anyone this company doesn't pay me in any way seaweedy him directors not pay me in any way they do not you know I placed my order they do not give me any more than anyone else I don't get no free [ __ ] I don't have any secret anything with them it's just straightforward like everybody else oh I am gonna ask is now that their website is up and running because I prefer their products a lot just give them some understanding and some time they got you know every system has its glitches and its problems so try and be a little patient with them I hope that everybody this is the day before Halloween I still got that holiday on my mind for some reason I guess because I didn't get to go trick-or-treating like everybody else it's a day before Thanksgiving right now so I'm gonna try and put this video up tonight yet but maybe tomorrow but either way I'm just going to say Happy Holidays to everybody we're at 93 thousand over 93 thousand views on our on our channel which is awesome guys thank you so much and I hope you're all having a great and happy and safe and wonderful holiday with family and loved ones and enjoying much turkey or any turducken we're we're turducken turducken I've always wanted to try to duck hen if you had one put it in

turret that directed that directed that that small roles focus focus focus but it comes to five already been smoking in but it's not see this guy for you for you to what it comes with five people with about 0.75 three-quarters of a gram and each time come to the cool smart board lighter torch and the case that a convent is actually very heavy-duty very very very impressive I gotta say though I some blood on this out of mine this is uh as wet as a super Sour Diesel 25.4 4 % TT 4 to 12 percent CBD and it's actually pretty smells good but definitely good presentation this box is awesome and the letter that the concrete is awesome too as well let's just jump right into this and just walk it up get a little taste it'll taste with you about it so yeah see how it is [Music] yes it actually takes pretty damn good see woman's ever ulis mmm Thanks it's delicious either way we do about I gotta say - presentation on thing it's good the way it burns burns pretty pretty evenly you know tastes freakin good this [ __ ] is frickin insane it's made of only the hand-picked Triple A indoor bug was the hybrid for those people who don't know about you know these this is a hybrid of this flavor and they don't for someone some of the other people's that all our based on some of the other pre bowls that I had in the past in previous videos people joints specifically I feel like these ones burn a little bit faster than the others would you agree with that yeah I did these bread a little faster on a scale one to ten I'll set up I'd give these like a solid eight point eight eight point five eight and a half want to scale one to ten for presentation and everything one things that you expect when you smoke too late that you expect to get like super blasted I think definitely the way it's presented mmm you know I tell you know somebody comes to the hey I rolled the joint but then you come over then you're like y'all hold up a second let me pull out one of these bad boys oh wait I got a lighter with it too you know it just makes it for anything else are you just really shits up like that for this it is definitely better quality than like then like an actual cigarette case or a super box for those of you smoke cigarettes you know this is easily just crunching versus this [ __ ] that like that's it ain't breaking this is like heavy duty and the - my dog I say is pretty damn good it's pretty good hi from scale 1 to 2 10 don't say the house probably about a 9 yeah some flowers if you guys have Lulu watch the act that's [ __ ] fire the act about Gypsy Rose before he live very good yes Thomas girl was 10 how would you say the high of his buddies he says about seven eight I say about nine no I like to hire a bit como vamos surpassed them I wanna love I do see I'll be killing roaches at other people's house or act like calling embarrassing but so we got time for today guys", "8Kn5uNpZC24": "all right we're gonna do a review of some CBD and today we are coming here from San Antonio Texas and we are looking at this top shelf twisted CBD and flour and right now it's going to be looking like it is a hybrid sunset sherberts2 flavor contains CBD CBD a CBD GA and under it's got under point three well 0.3 percent THC Delta 9 2 C and I know it's really hard to see but it does say lab tested right there and then it says premium quality right there so my phone camera is kind of crappy but this is from also this is from twisted as well so this is called twisted I guess the company is called twisted it um says that twisted is a proud or twisted is proud to offer you premium top-shelf CBD hemp flowers infused with strain-specific Terrapins that give you that entourage effect and flavor experience you've been looking for warning consult your doctor or a physician before use if you are pregnant nursing taking medications or have any medical conditions do not drive or operate heavy machinery keep out of reach of children this product has not been evaluated by the FDA and is not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent any disease then under the sticker its I can read says this product may cause impairment I guess I'll just rip some of this off real quick cool that's coming off sweet perfectly next to the warning under that warning is adheres to all Department of Agriculture hemp testing requirements of less than 0.3 Delta 9 THC as noted in the agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 and then the address twisted Brands LLC five three seven nine Lanzarote Florida so I guess this is made in Florida ingredients industrial-grade hump with terpenes and terpenoids aplan whatever it is terpenes on the planet so correct me if I'm wrong I mean that's what I read but uh yeah we're gonna be looking at this top shelf CBD so so squeeze sides blow cap and there we are we got some beautiful looking buds smells amazing I've got my scale right here legally so we're just gonna see how much it weighs cuz I bought this fair unfortunately $35 for some medic medical or top-shelf CBD buds so we're gonna just pull this big old thing out here Wow okay oh that's a big putt got my scale over here let's just go for it let's go for it come on see Wow actually uh I mean 4.1 so I guess they hooked", "EZ8C_0-Uk8Y": "what is up guys that blank talker back here again welcome to another video man in today's video we got a product review of some pacific stoned pre-rolled joints a hundred percent premium cannabis so a little back story on this i went to my local disco over the weekend and they were having a sale on bees they were 40 dollars before tax and the second second one they were offering is for penny so i got two of these and I've been smoking on them and I've been liking the lead so let's get on with the review so how you open them it is childproof so you just squeeze the sides push the front end right here you have to do it there we go and then well BAM it comes with 14 joints but I've been smoking out of this one and one and another thing that's pretty cool with this as well is that they tuck it up with a little pack of matches my dude like that's what's up so you know if you can't if you don't have the lighter or if you don't smoke this much you don't have to get a lighter you can just use these matches out of this box so I am a little bit stoned [Music] this is my second time trying to record this my phone ran out of space so I'm getting double liddie today's let me know what you're smoking on down in the comment section below I'm gonna light up the match and we'll get on with it man just gotta have my ashtray next to me so go and light it up so it's just give me a second so hell yeah I like using the mattress man I think it's pretty cool different because I always use lighters books and Clippers but you know it's something different I thought it was kind of cool something really different but I really thought and the Pacific Stone they really did a pretty good job with the packaging and the joynton and adding the matches I thought that was pretty cool and I really do you think it is worth 40 bucks I think each joint joint is like about half a gram each so that's like you get 14 so that's like about 7 grams and for 40 bucks oh well after taxes like 46 48 bucks the tax here is pretty ridiculous in California but [Music] but yeah so you're paying just about 50 bucks for seven grams so that ain't too bad in the this ain't no [ __ ] pre-roll either dude it has a pretty good taste and I get pretty stoned off it and I usually smoke it with somebody dude like I smoked it with my mom and just like splitting it and smoking up with somebody dude I got pretty [ __ ] stunned and like smoking a whole one dude that like I get completely but you know if you see this out in Southern California man I recommend checking this out man even if you're like a tourist or something like this this product would be perfect for you [Music] because you don't have to die the [ __ ] papers it roll them grind it up like eg just buy it already done really good flowers [Music] so yeah man I was pretty I was pretty stuck when I saw this because I think one spark it's federally legalized in the next couple of years I think after that twenty to twenty five years after that in grocery stores you'll be able to buy a pack of joints and I think that would be pretty [ __ ] sick and you know it's kind of can't come early I know they're just only selling it at the Disco's but still that's pretty cool [Music] damn we're almost done with this and then I'm going to get out but I'm going to have their website down in the description below and yeah I really liked it like this these green rolls man and there's a lot of [ __ ] shitty ass pre-roll companies out here in Cali man they always tried to [ __ ] rip it off and it's [ __ ] just complete food in bottom shelf like disgusting ah [ __ ] but this has some really good flour in it and it's worth the forty bucks man [Music] oh yeah man if you have it already shoot me a ball on instagram at that glint okay I've been pretty consistent on there trying to post more so follow me on there and ID live streams like two to three times a week and join in on

today's product review if you see this product man check it out [Music] - it gets louder you won't be disappointed but I feel all relax man this one thing though that I wish they would have is like what strain that is because you don't really have the strain name or alright I think it's an OG because it says premium OG so maybe it is indica gotta look into it a little bit more the bucket under

got this set I got this I got this sent to me so I don't know how much it is but you have to be 18 and older to smoke no THC is just pure CBDs man so you guys might wonder what CPD's are man CBDs is like is a comes from marijuana but removing all the th seized you know though the stuff that makes you feel hi this is the body buzz to make you fully functional like it's good for anxiety depression nausea arthritis else timers and you know a bunch of other stuff that I don't know but that's what I was told and that's what I read so let's look at this so you want to squeeze the ends and pop up thud OH squeeze pop man Oh smells pretty nice I'll show you guys yes II see oh oh the goods that came out of it what oh they're broke well I mean the filter fell all the way in at the filter hmm how do I resolve this it is I go lie to you I pulled it out and it was all falling out I had to take this tip off put everything back in and put the tip back on you can see out a little bit where the tip is closed just shoving stuff back in hopefully it still smokes well I'm gonna shove it deeper try it out smells like burning marshmallows mmm burning burning pretty fast smokey they don't smell like marijuana or taste like it just fall into my mouth you know pretty much rain fell out with that ash you think well that's it not one that's it so uh final results I do recommend this for people that's overwhelmed with whatever is going on with their lives I need to relax this could be your solution I feel actually relaxed no chips on my shoulder I don't feel high I feel like I can operate and do

share peace", "JP2JGx_hQkA": "hey guys as dab connection we're checking out the filter for 20 I'm and it's supposed to deliver taste not tar pick this up actually at the MJ biz contact Expo I guess you can reuse each one of these for two grams the exercise was handing these outside I believe but it looked pretty interesting and imma give it a try and we'll talk about how good or not good it is so we'll roll it up the throw in some what do we got some DGF fruitcake let's get to try and see how it works alright so what else is not interesting on this thing is I was gonna I thought you to roll it to like fit inside but actually has this tip and it looks like it's probably a silicon tip and it actually just goes in like this so we're gonna kind of see towards the end and that's how it fits in if it's really melting or if it's totally fine I'm gonna hit that to the end and we'll see what it looks like we take it outside we'll start hitting it so we lift this up give me a try it and gotta say it's a alright so you lift this up giving it a try and you gotta say the airflow is really good I thought it might be kind of restricted but it's actually really efficient you don't really feel like it was in any airflow it fits in there nice and it does seem a little smoother also if it's like it's kind of hit it hard in one direction and it kind of burns more evenly but yeah I kind of like it so I'll just keep hitting this for a little bit I'm gonna get to the end we'll take a look again see if it gets all melty or not so kind of a mid mid join update here look at that tar in the center really is picking up a lot of tar that's that's pretty amazing so we'll keep hitting it and see what that looks like we'll see what the end of that looks like at the end alright so now we're done with it and yeah the rubber did looks a little so I can't really tell if the rubber burned or not but it didn't get that Bernie and it did and that was me hitting the end maybe you're not supposed to yeah but look at them mtar that god I mean that's pretty good and you see earlier in the video could see the clean one that's quite a difference in fact let's go grab a clean one put them side by side so you can see what the difference is yeah so that thing picked up a lot of tar there's our tarred one there's our clean one that did pick up a lot of tar I'm a little worried about that burn eNOS and you know what overall I'd still use this product I probably didn't hit the lien if I it does get money but let's melt it with a lighter and see if it really gets burning so I'm gonna try that out right now alright here we go let's see if this rubber melts yeah that does not appear to be like some kind of heat safe silicone that's just a piece of rubber so you know I understand it maybe even says the directions don't hit all the way down when I'll check him to be sure but would be nice that they would just upgrade that to something doesn't burn so easy you know I know they have like stuff that like handles higher heat this doesn't seem to be it but overall I you know I still like this product and I got to say the effects are more light you don't feel OHS groggy but it feels very clean it feels kind of like a brandy more of like kind of a vape cartridge some people might not even like that effect but if you are looking to move a lot of tar this probably will work I just recommend probably stop hitting it when the joints about like you don't be that far away just stop hitting it but that's it thanks for watching guys this damp addiction have a great week", "gmJnmNMsUsc": "I

a automated joint rolling machine it was one gram he couldn't really adjust the the weights of it just spits out one gram but it's interesting than the less at 500 a minute they also had a sixty five thousand dollar grinder called the flood Buster there's a video of that as well but first I wanted to show you the Pulver set 19 it's a grinder from fritz it's thirty thousand dollars and it's really precise you know pharmaceutical grade you can do coarse or fine which is really nice based on whatever cultivar you have or how you grow and then apparently it also doubles your yield for extraction so all in all it's a really nice piece of equipment wanted to kind of show that as an option as a scale the future of cannabis if you will and then dive into that joint Rowland machine and touch base on a blunt rolling machine as well so come check it out see this crazy thirty thousand dollar grinder [Music] some tickets different different grinds different sets the Culver at nineteen a beast it's crazy all right the bud buster it's only 65,000 so let me know how many you need put in a couple of grams in there it's got a filter screen so spits out these see further down the stems so as a beast that's probably half a ton at least check out this joint rowing machine at 110,000 on a bobbin system you can do mints and bleach natural white paper whatever did a hopper it's got a vibration shows it in there it's got a grinder I mean a wheel spits it out all in one length and then you have to get a filter you're shooting to slap that on there as well as an addition but it's nice and compact I like it very limited though and not tested [Music] here's the size I don't think there's anything in your the relevance small maybe one ground oops correction on that apparently those machines were specifically made for cannabis so I can only assume that they have been tested fairly certainly had been but regardless the scale and scope of automation is here it's just a matter of when you know Big Tobacco decides to to get into play the one exception I think that we have to survive is is canna gars but in the meantime you have blunts already being rolled there's options of hemp and mint and natural unbleached white papers with filters and rolling at 45 a minute on low speed eventually 200 a minute on the high speed so that's there I think it's gonna take a while to figure out how to infuse canna gars with oil or rosin with filters and make them look just as nice so again I think that's something that it's gonna still be handmade for a little bit but that's my analysis from MJ biscone definitely let me know what you think in the comments you can find me on social media at super chronic Josh or you can email me at Josh at Seattle super chronic cough a.com if you want some more information on how to buy these machines and then if you want to hear the recap of MJ biz con you can go to baked and awake you can find them at peyton awaked on youtube and amazon and mars all

pre-roll from saterra of b98 which is bubble kush 98 which supposedly came out right before the whole y2k thing just said that i think 197 but i will tell you it has a nice sweet smell to it i can smell it i got a five pack of pre-rolls i can smell it through the the packaging and if you can and i'm going to tell you like this if the pre-roll smells you know some good flour because most pre-rolls smell like grass and ass but this smell good nice sweet smell to it taste wise more earthy kind of kind of gassy a little bit kind of earthy almost like almost like dirt but i get a bad weight can be a little bit of a rough smoke as you guys can tell but overall it does the job and it's a good feeling it's an indica but it's nice man i paid what was it i think 30 something i think 30 for the pack of five so not too bad it is what it is i just thought i'd get out here real quick just let y'all know what i'm smoking on let me know below in the comments what you're smoking on where you got it from even if you're out of state i mean we're all just one big [ __ ] smoking community anyway so but stuff is nice man i like it um i will say i'm in the process of getting a job right now so there might be a little break in between the the strain reviews um as the budget's not there right now but i will say that in the meantime i might post some workout videos or i'm just vlogs or stuff like that in the meantime because just because this is a better water channel doesn't mean that's what we got to do all the time but b98 give it two thumbs up it's a mid to high kind of high but definitely definitely worth checking out if you're in the indica you know um so yeah like i said there might be a little break in the stream reviews um which is kind of good because i feel like i need a little bit of a tolerance break anyways because i'm flying through eighths like it's i'm clearing an eighth in about like two days so i definitely think it's time to chill out for a little bit you know i wouldn't mind if the [ __ ] wasn't so expensive but like you know anywhere between unless you're getting minis which are even hard to get down here because always sold out the minis are 27 and then it goes like 43 dollars and up and like that's just crazy you know i'm better off just probably buying an ounce of something and sitting on that but either way i love y'all we're at 24 subs that's crazy thing is how i literally just made the channel i don't even think a week ago so that's what's up i appreciate all of y'all um subscribing to the channel i will say if you do happen to

cannabis business podcast today we're asking the question can we table really enjoy pre-rolled joints on the line with us is Dan chemists with good CBD products yeah I'll bet they can so this Yahoo Finance article says that hardcore stoners typically have a strong disdain for pre-rolls you know I start I stopped taking pre-rolls from people and smoking it probably a year maybe I think was a year ago when Jim his straight line analytics report came out where he tested five infused five non infuse joints and they all came up moldy so Jim McCray is a an analyst and writes about you know everything including lab tests and everything so it was straight land and straight line analytics and Jim not taking my joint for me to kind of reflect on that as a whole seeing billboards that said mold to gold and you know the mold moldy joints so when you don't know what's inside of it you know you don't really want to take it I guess you know historically those pre-rolls were just trim that bud tenders were rolling when they had the time there were no strain specific options it just was a joint you didn't know if it was an indica or otherwise so there's been a lot of improvements from packaging to strain-specific for a more discerning customer as much as you know $420 for the average customer in $10,000 for a canna Garf or some buddy who has more disposable income than they know what to do with well you know is what's funny about all of that right it comes down to can you trust the pre-roll right can you trust the brand and then that comes back to that whole thing of branding and then you know it reminds me of like you know ethically sourced coffee how do you really know and how do you really trust so for instance I've got some pals you know I got some pals where I'll all burn their pre-rolls because I know and at the same time like somebody just walk up and hand you one of the cheap $3 pre-rolls that they grab from the counter in Washington State you can bet that's Flor weed you can bet at war weed brother well I have to be careful too with you you roll fatties of indica and you know me when I smoke an indica during daylight I stop talking I just something zoned out I just can't speak and so I just I just stay away from your joints as well and I consider that a badger courage my brother yeah personally I prefer grabbing a really good bag and rolling my own okay I will still fall prey I'm weak you know if I'm in the field and somebody says hey hey hit this you know what can I say I'm working no doubt when you're you know when you're burning random pre-rolled joints and Jim McCray said at all you're you know you've got such a high potential to have a funky bird so there's a lot of cannabis users who refuse to sacrifice quality for the slick convenience of the pre-roll many cannabis users would claim that cannabis companies knew that people probably wouldn't be unrolling the joint to inspect what's inside so they made prettier packages and raised the prices but in a year since the cannabis industry has expanded brands have up the quality of pre-rolls using higher quality weed papers and filters so they combined cannabis user from California Colorado Arizona Oregon and Washington spent 59 million dollars in pre-rolls in May 20 19th alone see part of the reason I'm going into the field and going into California is I'm gonna go see you know are they on a parallel track like Washington was is it like when Oregon first popped or Colorado or is it on a different track and one of the things I think we're gonna see is that same naivete with regards to yeah yeah pre-roll and then eventually the market gets savvy and says you know most of these stock well you've got an option when you visit lols the cafe down there you can have some pre rolls apparently I don't know if they're owned by the same company but Lowell herb company has some pre-roll packages that are currently available in the California marketplace so when you look for convenience quality pricing so 2019 each joint doesn't have to be unrolled to know what the product is up to par the cannabis quality accessibility and how the pack feels how 2pac smokes the car the filter the burn so many factors that go into a quality pre-roll most cannabis brands will say the Dupree rules are fire that it's the world's best saying you know that that that's what distinguishes them I think there was a graph from MJ business daily that said two-thirds of all cannabis growers think that what distinguishes their flower from others is that it's better that's it so essentially you want to have so you know the convenience the quality but the pricing needs to be right - and that all comes down to trust branding I think still is about what's the highest THC at the lowest price and then you figure out what brand you want but there is an opportunity for branding to differentiate to stand out with quality convenience accessibility and having an honest transparent production facility where you know there's quality well I see I put this one in there as soon as the market gets aware right as soon as awareness comes then all of a sudden that that convenience isn't convenient anymore it's like yeah yeah it was convenient oh you're smoking mold oh okay I hope you know right and and so it's interesting to me because I see it as a market where there is a great opportunity for somebody to be very staunch in their branding their marketing and their pricing and just to lay down the law yeah yeah you pay more for this why because it's real right because it's real you know we will see in California but in Washington and Oregon you can find a 1 or 2 dollar joint you can find a three dollar joint without falling over okay it seems really convenient unless again it's literally and I've seen this this doesn't mean you know it's weed they're sweeping up with a broom okay from the excess of the trim table it's been there for three days on the floor and they're gonna go churn it you know throw it in with a bunch of other stuff not to say all growers did you know that are all producers processors but a few and you know a few is plenty who wants to burn some old ultimately when convenience is no longer the thing that that is the main point when there's a lot of products that are convenient it's going to be substance over style and so not to judge a pack by its cover if the pre-roll costs more you have to ask why is it costing extra is it craft cannabis or is it just margins is it really VIP or you know with those canna gars I'm not gonna buy those anymore because they're just too expensive I've had enough to know that it's not worth the price so you know spending thirty five to forty dollars for six joints isn't really gonna be something that I'm going to do last year I rolled a hundred and seventy three blunts this year I'm on pace to do more than that once are my guilty pleasure I do like joints I don't like the pre-roll cone-shape there's a better draw a better experience from a cylindrical joint and I think you're gonna start to see that as more companies are buying automated machines I'm getting a lot more inquiries for pre-roll robots as well as blunt machines in California a cylindrical join rolling machines in Canada people that I can afford two and three hundred thousand dollar machines are gonna set the pace because when you can manufacture product for 50 Cent's and make money revenue profit other people are gonna have to either jump on board with that same machinery or private label from you they're gonna white label they're gonna pay you or they're gonna find another SKU they'll sell all day right that's the thing is again even you know crappy joints sell all day and if you build a machine and I mean like a business machine right so so the automated pre-roll the market the quality weed the quality ethic you put all of that together and pump joints out all day long you're gonna make a lot of bread I spoke to some companies that make automated machines you know the multi head check waste systems and other packaging machines some of them believe that Big Tobacco is gonna come in and come up with a solution I disagree I think they're going to end up one of these pre-roll robots and and joint blunt rolling machines and incorporating that because the injection method doesn't work so this Lieberman over styling technique is what other rolling machines are doing in addition to the filling not the shape weight but an actual solution that has weights so multi-head chuckwei system where everyone is every pre-roll is accurate up to a hundredth of a gram and that's gonna be popping out so I just got notification that in January 1 of the main manufacturers in the United States is going to launch a pre-roll robot fully automated making 3,600 an hour so that's almost twice the next fully automated machine called the Hephaestus pre-roll robot based out of Israel they're already have competition people that used to work for them have left and are starting another company that's gonna be even more competitive well you know every industry all the time right yeah yeah weird Larry go oh he loves to start a competitor well I mean that's the company that thought that just filling it base by volume was enough and this individual said no we have to have accurate weighing for Health Canada for the US whatever and so when the manufacturer said no this is good enough I would bounce too and so if you're not listening to what the market wants and you're just thinking you're gonna do it when you don't really know what the cannabis industry needs or wants then you're already obsolete you need to listen to the talking that's exactly right this market moves fast and with the capital constraints that's currently happening in the marketplace essentially if you don't have that automation if you can't scale expand and automate your process you're done like I said you're gonna be paying somebody else to make your product cuz you can't afford to so we've got a fully automated list on your videos check that out just come back to talk to me edge for all of your solutions now we're gonna roll this one up I'm Josh Kincaid this is the talking heads don't forget to Like share and subscribe or don't and I'm out", "r00PSzhYiN8": "hey guys my name is Bobby and I'm going to show you guys what a real corrupt moon rock looks like this one right here that I'm holding is og flavor but they're also made in strawberry vanilla ice cream and their newest flavor peaches and cream now it should be covered up like this in key and when you open your nug it should look like this should be nicely covered in hash oil and if you look a little closer you should see

I protect a cannabis on a regular basis for PTSD arthritis in both my knees and ankles social anxiety and a few other conditions you can learn more about through watching the previous shows on this channel this is the productive cannabis kind of sewer a channel dedicated to medical cannabis patients and adults 18 and over so good morning everyone good morning good afternoon good evening no matter where you are in this world thank you for joining me today at the productive cannabis connoisseur for a nature smoke session it's another great day out here in sunny California and yeah welcome have some of my tea I just heated up some chant tangerine juice i juiced some tangerines that I got from the the grocery store yesterday and I hated them up and I will i juiced it and then I here poured hot water with the juice so it's basically orange tangerine tea I guess I don't know if you could see it how orange it is without me spilling it out whatever it's orange oh I didn't feel like having any like TT like especially the especially the jasmine tea it seems a little too jazzy for me yeah yeah so this morning happened was really kind of scary to me but I'm okay I'll try to tell you about in just a second so movies market what is some of the some of the [ __ ] cookies - a little tiny bit and I I saved whenever I would when we just harvested last year's harvest whenever I would take the buds off of the stove I would save the stems and when I would well joints there would be leftover herbs it's good but the leftover herb and put it in the back so with the bag and the stems so I have a bag full of stems and at the bottom of the bag full of stems is a whole bunch of keef so basically what I did last night was I took the stems and the key fits in the bag I poured it into a colander and sifted it out so I could get the keys out so these joints that I made are composed of Keith and and [ __ ] cooking so late [ __ ] cookies so it's pretty strong so yeah it's really good and if you know you want to save on money there you go smoke the Keef save the Keith the Keith can be as strong as the Keith can be as strong as hashed a lot of times so yeah so cheers to all you guys I hope that's a little helpful advice you like might want to follow I don't know it can get you through some times where you don't have any herbs so yeah cheers everyone so the scary thing that happened what was kind of scary to me is I woke up this morning and I was blowing my nose and then I went into my front bathroom where I could see better because the Lighting's better in there and I noticed I had blood coming out of my right nostril and I blew it and it was just blood coming out but it wasn't like it was coming out and I was like okay what's going on here and before I panic you know is the first thing to do is a panic whenever someone sees blood so that I coughed it did a cough DUP lipid with mucus I know it sounds gross and I felt like it was coming from this nostril though it was only coming out of leading out of one nostril my right nostril so I was doing a little looking up about online about bloody noses I had a bloody nose when I was a kid punk during the wintertime and my mom just told me to sit with my head you know back and I have something on there to catch the blood and eventually did stop bleeding but I looked up bleeding nose bleeding bleeding noses and specifically out of one nostril and pretty much what it was saying it's just the environment you know that I'm in all the time it's probably dry so I think what we have in the fireplace going last night and then the heater kicked on too so that have a lot to do with that bloody nose thing I'm not having it right now it's it's fine my nose is fine now but it just startled me as I woke up and my nose wouldn't stop running on the nut that nostril and it was like I thought it was just regular runny nose and I look in the mirror and it's blood and I'm like oh [ __ ] okay but it seems to be okay now I also was doing a little research and it was talking about how you know just of course naturally you're not supposed to pick your nose and don't pick your nose just blow it out or whatever and it means that you're if you've got need to pick your nose it means that you have a lot of dried up mucus inside of your nose and that's not a good thing to do is to pick it because you could pick it in and all segments Bluff look I know it sounds gross and I hate to laugh about it but I also read about high blood pressure how that can have something to do with it but I'm doing okay I'm alright my nose is fine it just scared me a bit at all cuz I haven't had nosebleed since I was a kid really you know so dry air stress probably need more humidity it's inside the house because out here outside it's definitely not dry ha ha ha it's very much more humid I'm spend more time outside definitely I think maybe it was just that thing that I would just buy a lot of dry stuff by the missus by the the fire last night I wanted to get some photos too but I couldn't sorry about that but that won't be the last fire huh maybe I could do something fun like that for New Year's Eve or something you know although most people consider New Year's Eve I mean some people consider New Year's Day not to be the first day the first year I mean the first the year the turning of the year they don't consider to be like alright New Year's Eve now it's New Year's Day yay the 1st of January some people consider December 21st to be the official beginning of the new year so and that's what the ancients our indigenous cultures believed they felt like I don't know I just feel like everything's been turned around so much throughout the ages in order to give those people the indigenous people no credit for all that they've done for this world the ones that helped make it what it is as far as the natural world and then as time went on we learned how to destroy it all the progress that was made all the artifacts that have been destroyed you know the tombs that have been raided it's just crazy that so that was a little bit of a scare yesterday I did have a busy day yesterday too so let's go go going and trying to stay mellow at the same time but you know that is when things like that happen you can always think of the worst scenario okay scenario and I don't feel like I need to be rushed off to a hospital or anything my nose isn't still bleeding for a while after his bleeding my head was aching a little bit but I think that's due to dehydration not having enough fluid to my body and my body dries up really quickly during I mean during the summer during this season too I just need to stay hydrated and I'm not here to be a physician I'm not I'm not a doctor so if that's happening to you really figure out what it is if you're worried about it check it out yeah ah so it could be something more serious for you or something I for me personally I don't feel like it's anything for me to worry about the bleeding is stopped and my headache is subsiding thanks to this joint so somebody was that's somebody a viewer and a subscriber a really kind person that contributes to this channel offered up a suggestion for because yesterday was Monday and I did a show we can bake nature smoke session and Anthony here talked about like it's garbage day and stuff like that yeah the garbage trucks or whatever this person suggested I do a show talking about that the sewage and all that here and how that how that works how that goes down around here definitely I'll do that on Monday because Monday is when it's garbage day so I think that would be cool to do that and I could do a little more research about it definitely has changed throughout the years the way they handle sewage uh on this planet really I'm it is kind of fascinating to find out more about that so yeah we'll come up I'll do talk about that on Monday definitely this keeps going out because it's humid out here it does feel better on my nose whoo I remember one of my brothers having a problem during the winter and they would there was a humidifier in the room and stuff so this is just dry air heaters on more fireplace definitely so oh excuse me yeah yesterday I didn't do much of anything except for the wake-and-bake well as far as videos go outside of the camera I'm doing all kinds of [ __ ] the yesterday's yeah it was definitely a busy day going hustle and bustle trying to get the the stuff that we needed to make friends giving dinner to make dinner for this Thursday just kidding the basics just to make the pumpkin pie we we harvested the last pumpkin so to end up all you end up combining both those pumpkins together to make pumpkin pie I don't know if who's gonna videotape it it depends on how things turned out on that day it would be cool if I could do that so I'll see I'm not gonna make any promises cuz I hate to say I'm going to do something then I don't do it you know that sucks but yeah yeah I'm gonna do I'm just gonna do something simple this year for vegetarian wise well not vegetarian maybe Pesce pescetarian cuz it's to eat fish and my son eats fish and that's only food meat the deeds also and so but my husband he's gonna have the Cornish game hen that he bought and yeah it's gonna be it's nice it's just funny how this holiday Thanksgiving the real meaning of it is lost what really happened to the Native Americans and the more research that I do a little bit here and there I'm not no scholar okay so don't get that in your mind at all but what research I did do about Thanksgiving and what went down and that whole event it was just so bogus had they turned the story around when they go to teach it to children in school when I was a kid I mean it's like a lot of the history that it was told in schools made no sense it's like wait a minute but and if you question it then you get like you know reprimanded for it kids should be allowed to ask questions because that's the only way they learn you mean adults will get frustrated with kids asking so many questions why do you think they asked so many questions do the soul they just came on this earth and they're trusting you to guide to help them and explain things to them instead of saying just because I said so you know what I mean they're trying to understand the dynamics of how what it takes to live on this planet because they forgot you know yes they lived on this planet before but I feel like our minds get wiped once we shoot out of the womb and get all kinds of poisons pumped into our systems ie immunizations and all kinds of [ __ ] later on down the line that they've added to the list of poisons to put into kids and adults systems like the flu shot for instance a lot of people who get the flu shot and they get the flu the [ __ ] is that [ __ ] there's supposedly what you get the flu shot and so that makes your body resistant to getting clue with those shots there's all kinds of other [ __ ] in there that you don't even know about so I've never gotten a flu shot and I never will and if I do then you know there's something wrong with my brain you know something happened to me so you just so I got so far away from getting stuff from nature and just getting it through a pill or through a shot or you know what I mean with the what's happening to a world guys what's happening you know what's happening to people it's really damp out here and it's hard time to keep this lit keep it lit yeah I'm gonna get around to doing the show that I saw I was gonna do for the chakra system the last part to day cuz yesterday I thought it'd be had to do it but it got so busy with errands we had to run and stuff it yeah excuse me so yeah we had to tend to quite a few things yesterday but yeah I'll get that going on and I talked about how it was a kind of a viewer subscriber to suggest that I you know do an Amazon wishlist I was still working on that I tried to get on that and then I had to get out and get stuff done I didn't list on my about me page and I'll try to remember to put it in each video for the description for each video so you can see the links for PayPal if you wanted to donate to this channel of productive cannabis kind of sewer and its can be going towards things to help this channel while like a new camera that way I can improve the quality of these videos make it even better make em EMP I'm sure you guys probably enjoy the quality of it already but but I mean doing different things being able to zoom in on certain shots like an owl or something if I wanted to and to do a video just about that I mean I'd like do it I want to do more nature nature videos because I think it's inspiring for a lot of people so it'll get them more connected you guys if you don't feel connected more connected to Mother Earth so yeah oh I'm feeling good so if you're wondering this hat that I have mine it's that hat that I was telling you guys about the my friend M Cody Shelton was gonna send me because I remember when I showed you on if you haven't seen it check it out I do a show called cannabis and creativity and on that show I was showing you the process and the progression of this painting those commissioned to do in order for a trade for this really cool hat yeah it's really cool bumblebee black and white I mean black and black and white black and yellow hat I love it but anyway I did a painting of Cthulhu and I was showing you the stage but step-by-step process of how I make it and so she sent these in the mail for me for the for the trade there and that was a nice trade because this this hats very warm it's very soft and it's also adjustable I'll show you me and and she also sent me an extra hat which was really nice so so this is what the Hat looks like it's similar to what I have on this is a different design she said this one is made out of wool though and see that right there it's where she's got string on there to where like see that Carol it's a crocheted in there so that you can adjust it to fit your dreads you know so so I might want to make this adjust this to make it a little bit bigger but it's nice it's nice and snug but my dreads do you see how thick they are so yeah this beautiful hat beautiful beautiful work time and attention I could tell she really went all the whole nines and I really appreciate him Cody's her skills for crocheting because I like it it's nice to be able to put my dreads up and not have this like one unicorn horn here is just standard that's it and wearing hats when you have freeform dreadlocks or just dreadlocks in general if it's not free for whatever this dreadlocks in general if you have a hat to put on to keep your hair out of the way so your dreads don't get dirty your dreads can be like a lint magnet and a dirt magnet if you do the wrong things with them like you put too much crap on your dreads you know you don't need to put a bunch of [ __ ] on your dreads to make them you know healthy you just need to keep things simple and a lot of people they don't want it they just want to be messing with their hair 24/7 and when you mess with your hair a lot and that's when you get the damage the damage becomes tremendously horrible uh-huh sometimes depending on how far you go with the damage so yeah I could talk more about that on the show I do call it cannabis and freeform dreadlocks so I won't go further than that but these hats are awesome they're beautiful a level I've got how many of our hats that she made a bit one okay I've got the purple and the blue one they've got the skull ones the bib and then I got a skull one without a bib said all of them [ __ ] oh I'm gonna have the black and orange one that's four then I've got this one that's five and then six for this one here so yeah I guess I'm a hat collector of em Cody Shelton's crocheted hats he's got some good hats she even made knitted a hat for my husband I was like a gnome hat like conical like gnome hat and this is made out of wool and he's had it for quite a while and he loved it so she's got skills and she's really good so I'll leave her link in the description below her shop is called little fish ink so I think she has a big cartel I think she's still selling on Big Cartel so I'll look up all the necessary information and if you don't see it in the description below right away while you're watching this and afterwards you're looking if it's not there don't fret I will get to it because like I said almost every video that I make because I'm recording on a cellphone there's only so much I can put it on to the description you know for it to effectively upload because I feel like the more stuff I house the the more information this phone has to process the longer it takes and it probably taxes it a bit so if you don't see the description the links right away yeah like I said don't fret and I'll try to find a way to I don't know no I don't want to put that many links in the about me page just just wait for it it'll be there trust me man I cuz I I love her stuff I love her she even does a little cool knitted plushie dolls - they're cute so I don't know if she's still doing it but she was doing that for a while - so yes I did say that I was gonna try to experiment with learning how to crochet myself again then I found myself picking up the the yarn and then using it for a doll that I just have to be in it you know filling it and I just haven't been feeling it like sitting down and learning how to crochet I just haven't been feeling it so just going with that and so when I do I'll let you guys know I'm not wondering you're like I don't know I don't want you guys to get the impression that I'm gonna start like a shot where I'm selling hats and stuff because I'm not even there but I love these hats that she makes they're beautiful and they're comfortable and they're soft and they're warm you know you think somebody with with hair of the stick is mine I wouldn't need a hat but it gets chilly and I get cold so huh and not all of my hair on my head is this thick some of its then like little tiny dreads so I'm a really medium sized red so yeah this is main part where it stays warm on the sides of my head oh goodness whoo so yeah in Cody Shelton awesome hands so yeah I think it's important for people to support independent artists people that are like corporate mixed up with the corporate world and [ __ ] these people these are handcrafted items items that they take time with pieces of art this is a work of art that I got on my head and it makes me feel proud to wear it you know because I know the energy that went into it was filled with love so it's beautiful and I I feel thankful you know to know someone that talented so yeah and it's really pretty nice out here right now it's amazing yes we still have stuff growing out here in the garden we've got habanero peppers very bright orange

such a high tolerance I smoke a lot well once twice a day right this show you out here with the moon rocks it has moon rocks in out so that's what I was told you're [ __ ] hits hard and after like two or three minutes then you start like holy [ __ ] you too I'm gonna be a vlogger this is what I want to do I want to film and bring you guys some bomb-ass [ __ ] you know and my friend was talking to me about some things that have you do this like I said guys I'm not gonna sit around and get stupid high all day I don't wanna get stupid high and not be able to function so I only take a couple hits and I put it away this thing right here has lasted me days this is probably one of the coolest things I've ever done I've never thought about this but I'm not buying one of these instead of buying just like grams of weed like I hit this before class and I'm good the rest of the day like I don't even need to smoke before I sleep I go to class I get my [ __ ] done I'm still energetic by the time I come home I'm chilling and my bedtime I need to be in bed by 8:30 I need to be in bed right and I need to be asleep by 9:00 this helps me right here and I don't have to smoke a lot like that [ __ ] is probably for value one of the best things that you could do higher fat guys like seriously try them out it just helps you put you in a space where you can think straight and focus like for me I think about things too much way too much and this just gets me to the point where a man I'm focused I'm trying to bring you guys some some insight on how I think about this product and why I would buy it again and want this [ __ ] is bombs [ __ ] like it tastes good I guess he's stoned and like for anybody who doesn't smoke a lot of weed but wants to try and try the good [ __ ] like really legitimately who like if you just started smoking weed and you're like never heard of Keef if you never heard of moon rocks you've never heard of all these different stuff it's like this is a good way to put your feet into that and see if you like you'd see how intense it is but let me tell you if you've never tried moon rock if you never tried Keef you never tried this take a couple hits and then just put it out but I just dropped it in there close it up air gets locked up and they can't it has nothing to breathe on so it just dies out that's what I'm guessing I hope you guys enjoy", "kyDnfHFKO70": "those dabs are no jokes that just ripped me oh my god hi friends welcome to that high couple where we explore and discuss our passion for cannabis today we are doing another delta 8 thc video quick recap that is a cannabinoid that is extracted from hemp cannabis plants it gives you a similar feeling to delta 9 thc that we all know and love but we sort of like to think of it as thc's little brother something that's not going to give you those same kind of paranoid effects from higher doses but i think the biggest surprise from this video is that i had no idea how many different ways you could apply delta eight for this video we've partnered with hometown heroes based in austin texas using hemp grown here in the united states they extensively work with veterans and a portion of all proceeds goes to help the vfw and the dav they sent us this big box so let's pop open this box and dive into it so let's start with the way that we've already at least featured on this channel before which is using a cart so we've got a 510 thread vaporizer cartridge here it's got 600 milligrams of delta eight and it is flavored after strawberry coffee and because it's a 510 thread cart you can pretty much put it into any battery is good for those carts and install it click a button and you're good to go oh cheers alice there we go i love it get this started oh nice big hit off of that yeah does kind of remind me of this kind of cotton candy flavor to it especially with the strawberry cough oh yeah really nice flavor it's not like overly sugary candy but this is this is good i would not mind smoking on this all day long so another way to consume delta eight is actually by smoking moon rocks kind of like a turducken of cannabis you take bud you take wax you take keef you push it all together into this crazy kind of hash sort of looking like thing and you can easily add it to a packed bowl or even sprinkle it into a little bit of a joint what this is is cbd bud with delta 8 distillate on top and then rolled again in cbd keith another very easy way to consume delta 8 is actually with delta 8 infused edibles edibles everybody loves edibles yeah we are looking at three different flavors gummies are kind of the go-to for edibles i love that i'm looking at pink lemonade fruit punch and blueberry and blueberry so these have 25 milligrams of delta eight per gummy and there are ten gummies in each container pretty good off of this vape i've taken a couple hits a bit yeah it's it's not that i'm high because i know what that feeling is this is different but i do feel pretty chill pretty uplifted that's what's so great about delta 8 is that i feel like we could dabble in every single way here and not get so floored that we couldn't get off the couch because that's not what the whole point of deltate it's to give you a kind of milder experience so cheers cheers everyone yeah that's good get a little gummy definitely don't taste the cannabis i don't taste any cannabis in this whatsoever if i just ate this out of a candy jar i would not know it's inedible what's great about these two is that it's kind of in the same genre as cbd which a lot of states have legalized and are allowed to ship and everything like that go ahead and check out the website for like exact details on bi-state specifications but pretty much all of this can get shipped nationwide which is really cool great way to experience cannabis a very popular cannabinoid without worrying that you're like breaking the law this is only one cannabinoid off of thc is delta nine that's delta eight exactly right another edible way of experiencing delta eight we have a couple of different tinctures usually one of the strongest ways to feel the effects of cannabis definitely the strongest in this box yeah yeah this is each bottle comes with 1200 milligrams that's insane 40 milligrams of delta eight per milliliter with tinctures usually it's good to just do them right under the tongue absorbed into your body really quickly tend to take effect really quickly great way to infuse food too if you're doing any kind of cooking add a couple of drops of this to it and like bam your whole meal is now infused this is the natural tincture this is mint tincture and this is berry i'm gonna try a little berry oh going for it you know i'll try a drop of the mint it's like a i was expecting it to be a little bit more syrupy but it's flavored water almost yes there's there's a lot of different almost like mouth sprays mouthwash that kind of reminds me of i mean this is also the mint so i'm definitely getting that's true that's true you should be feeling the effects of these very quickly i know i'm already just now starting to feel the first effects of the pen getting in front of the camera you're just like oh what's the next thing going but this i'm just like in the flow of it right now yeah there is just kind of an uplifting sort of happy mood and we haven't actually smoked any thc today so this is all just purely a delta eight high rolling on to the next product i see what you did there we're looking at this roll-on topical i know you can infuse delta nine you know thc with different topicals especially because it works really well for like veterans for anyone that has chronic muscle pain you can roll it on to very specific pain points on your body relaxation it has a kind of like i i rubbed a little bit on my arm earlier and it has a kind of like minty tingle feeling as well yeah i could actually see this working really well for any kind of a like post workout regiment um i did just roll a little bit on my arm and i do see what you mean there is kind of like a cooling like very light tingling effect feeling really good if you've got any kind of like neck or back or muscle cramps of just rolling that in and feeling the medicine get inside that's great nothing to do with like smoking or eating i this could not be easier for anyone that is totally adverse and afraid of cannabis in general the last way to use delta a that i was really surprised at hometown hero is introducing this to the market is dabbing it dabbing we've got delta 8 dabs here color on that is really nice and light let's try a delta 8 dab and see how we feel pull out the last things we've got some goodies here these are both dope rolling trays like cool and kind of trippy and sort of like future get kind of westworld vibes from these got kind of like alien sort of angel robot it looks very cool on camera too with the light hitting it damn yeah i'm trying out the sixth final way to do delta eight which is dabbing it cheers everyone as alice the first to try this this new delta eight experience infusing it into these dabs that was a big dab too it tastes a lot like cbd very cbd taste but i do enjoy the taste of cbd so there you go that just ripped me oh my god cheers everyone yeah i am feeling nice and groovy right now between the vape and the edibles and the tincture and my arm is feeling all tingly we've also still got the moon rocks there i i love it shout out to hometown hero i really am a fan that dab is kind of like next level

the three people who are like I stumbled over this what is the cabbie challenge Jordan good texture Jordan what is the cabbie challenge challenge that's weed in the world is testing in the world and how di art Kohn our cabbie cone was a high assessing for your life let me tell you something as a guy who enjoys weed I've smoked many cabbie cones that's why I think I might be up for this cabbage challenge every day that you take you have to hold on for 10 seconds total and other challenges you can't let it go out at any point so you cannot relight it so it's don't you so you can't stall you can't relight it you have to keep it lit the whole time all right the lighthouse I don't know I'm gonna keep it look I get the whole time if there wasn't a challenge we're gonna go light on the lighter rule okay because I've just never been in a world where you won't need this particularly because I'm gonna be talking ten seconds and each time no letting smoke out no ghosting I can't explain earlier tell the kids we're gonna see it or tell the old people like me were smoke actually take a hit to kind of go out and you know but let's point out we're not competing against one another we're just competing to finish that's right there Frank we could both move not the world we're all looking forward with our multiple winners there are three basic stories in the world the kids let's say human versus human human versus environment human versus themselves the cabbie challenge is the third it's human versus themselves we're gonna push past game she said it best in four words that took me like nine it's a mental game all right here we go it's me and Jordan me and [ __ ] team US team hi all right three two one count it I just listed I did I forgot good I gotta stop yeah but it's like a natural thing yeah like I wasn't trying to cheat I'm just used to like 10 seconds long [ __ ] time you know what man when we began the cabbie challenge I was like this girl telling me now I'm like tell me sexy like you're my master in this here we go ready count this stay in there here we go kids don't do that if you only think about me I read layers and your jacket well I got I got dress you're trying to forget and throw me off I got dressed for the cabby challenge are we allowed to COFF turn the cab challenge here we go I'm juicy moving the right stuff whether training the astronauts and shed to go out of the moon for the first time that's what this is like it sounds like a [ __ ] physical challenge so where they put you in those rooms of nowhere there's gonna be no air in this room pretty soon because that's I goes through the after I said good that's okay because I wasted [Music] Oh in the zone it's okay [Music] you know honestly we'll see as it gets I don't want to talk at the game but is less difficult to all the content seconds that I thought was gonna be I thought I'd be like pounding the floor like Jesus Christ but when he says good I'm like really I like ghosting at the end number one it makes me feel young to say ghosting because I'd ever do that until today and number two mother told me never to waste anything I feel bad about Ashlyn on the floor reminds me of a restaurant I used to go to as a kid caught the ground round what they told you the throat of peanut chosen where the worlds are colliding is the world is so small and that's what we learned during the Caddy challenge here we go cuz it's not something you grew up on the East Coast we're on the west coast now but everything gets to the middle she's super late that's I'm gonna get

we both once we have three [ __ ] weed cabbie challenge is a multi-generational thing as you just saw and it's okay to lose back it's the sweetest funnest way to [ __ ] lose somebody call me a mover

things that's what you're gonna be like and subscribe", "p1QJy-qpSEc": "[Music] yo yo i'm drew gilchrist and today i wanted to talk about the blunts that everyone is talking about and when i say everyone's talking about him i mean like i've had countless messages from people saying hey drew can you make a video about this hey drew what do you think about these so what i'm talking about here is king palms and they actually make blunts out of palm leaves and people have been talking about these for kind of like the last year two years but then recently i i think it's kind of recently they added in a bunch of flavors because i'm pretty sure that when i first saw them they didn't really have any flavorings it was just the blunts by themselves and they were still really nice and people were already talking about them but now they introduce flavors which i guess is kind of like the best part of having a blunt because you kind of want to use a blunt wrap in a situation where you know you have some bud but it's not smoking the best but you still want to smoke you don't just want to throw it away and to be honest that's when blunts come in useful the most because it will help it burn that whole way down help it kind of smoke and you know if you have blood like that the chances are it's probably not gonna taste the best so since king palm announced all the flavors the one that i saw which i really wanted to try was the banana one because whenever i smoke a joint which has banana wax in it i absolutely love the taste and i kind of figured that you'd be able to recreate that taste with instead of wax having the flavor in from the blunt now the one thing i'll say as well before we get into this right king palm may have went a little bit overboard with how many they sent me that's so i'm gonna be doing a giveaway of a hundred king palms over on my twitch later on today at 9 00 pm the link for that will be in the pinned comment down below also the link for king palms themselves will be in the pin comment down below so definitely definitely check them out so they sent me over so many different ones there's literally no way i'd be able to try out all of them in this video like it's just not gonna happen so yeah i figured i would just try the one that i've been wanting to try the longest which is the banana one we're gonna go over to the setup that we had the other day on the other video and i think we're gonna pack this up so this side says it holds a gram so i'm gonna weigh out a gram and hopefully it will fit perfectly wow that was way closer to a gram than what i thought it was going to be i feel like this is going to require more than a gram of bud but that's just me looking at them how bad they're so this is what it's looking like it looks really really nice um really weird it doesn't make you feel fancy when you're smoking these tips are really nice as well um i can't quite focus on that but that doesn't really matter but if i slide this out of here then this is what we're filling up so apparently that fits a gram that goes in here so now maybe maybe it will fit maybe it won't be too little a bunch of you guys last time said where the [ __ ] is the 150 grinder it's right here i just don't really like using it all the time because it's expensive i don't want it to last you know i don't have like a medical condition that requires me to use it every single time so i just use it on special occasions because you know it is quite uh it's quite a fancy thing and for that reason i want it to uh i want it to last so it's just everything has a lifespan and you know i don't want this one's lifespan to be any shorter than it needs to be it grinds up so nicely like this this is me with the grinder right next to the microphone you can barely hear it so i guess we just have to see whether that's the right amount to put inside this it comes with a really really nice poker with every single thing i'm actually holding this the wrong way so that's what we got there i feel like i feel like that's not enough i don't know i feel like it's not enough i'm probably gonna have to use a bit more honestly this this pack super super nice like really really easily um i must say this this is honestly the easiest cone that i've ever packed in my whole life damn this feels really nice well it feels like you know when you roll a really nicely tight joint that is exactly what this feels like yo that is yo that is crazy look at how perfectly that fit in there yeah that couldn't have been more perfect i mean i know i noticed in a gram and i know i thought it was supposed to be like a recommendation i didn't think it was gonna fit on point perfectly that is wild i'm really hyped right i guess we're gonna go back to the desk we're gonna smoke it sweet we have the whole thing here i once again i'm really really surprised that me weighing out exactly a gram came out to pack this to the exact end like i kind of figured it would be like a rough ballpark it wouldn't be able to be exactly accurate but somehow i guess it was so i guess we start sparking this up we see how it tastes i'm pretty sure the flavouring is actually in the tip so you have to like do the same thing that you would do on like a cigarette where you know you click the ball on the inside it makes it pop and then that makes it get a flavor oh oh okay well right now i haven't clipped the thing and it tastes really really good like that tastes really really good it could also be that because i've left that bit of bud for like a week it's like gotten better over time but the last time i was hitting this weed it was not smoking like this and it was not tasting like that either so that's without me pressing the button right now it's already smoking really really banging that's already really really sick just the fact that i haven't clicked the button it's tasting really good like the taste of my bud is still there which to be honest i really wasn't expecting but it fully is 100 tastes like i'm just smoking a joint right i'm gonna press the button it smells like banana wow so one of my friends told me he was like yo if you're using one of the flavored ones just know that you literally can't taste anything else other than the flavor which i guess is a really good thing because you know if you have bud which doesn't taste the best you put it in this you're making it taste good yo that's crazy yo that's crazy once i'm gonna see if my housemate wants to try this do you want to try this yeah look i'm filming right now so you gotta want to take this on on yeah we've got my house mate how's it going so test this out this is the banana flavor banana oil and i put some i put some dog in it [Music] bro i could taste that before i even put my lips it don't taste like dog does it just taste like banana wow that's crazy i've never had anything like that before there are other flavors yeah there's like there's watermelon berry [Music] okay so my thoughts on this is slightly different to what i thought it was going to be going into it when i went into this i was thinking maybe it's gonna taste like you know when you put banana wax inside a joint no no no no this tastes like i'm eating a banana the craziest part about this as well is to see how this is actually smoking and burning this weed wasn't burning that clean i've actually been saving this dog specifically for this video because it wasn't actually burning like the cleanest like it wasn't burning pure black ash but it definitely wasn't burning white ash either the taste was all right it wasn't crazy but like genuinely i actually plowed some joints from it and being like no i don't want to smoke this i'm kind of good now this on the other hand [Music] i wouldn't be putting this out before i clicked the button it was tasting and smoking better than it was before when i was smoking it just in normal rolling papers like way way better like 10 times better and it's just sick because you know most blunts that you would put somebody in that doesn't really burn clean if it's not like a tobacco wrap i would say most of the time it's not really going to help it burn and the reason most people use blunt wraps is for when they don't have the best weed i'm also kind of just gasped by the fact that you can actually put a gram in this like this only had a gram throughout the whole thing and it looked like it did it's smoking like it did i feel like if i'm rolling like a backwards or i'm rolling up a dutch masters or something along them lines i usually have to use way more than a gram to have it look about that size wow i am so so impressed with this like what was the other flavors they have as well right so they have berry they have watermelon they have margarita they have mint and they have the banana i'm pretty sure that's all the flavors they have at least that's all the flavors that i have the one thing i'll say as well is the mint definitely is gonna be the strongest one out of them because i could smell the mint through the bag you don't even have to open the seal or anything to start smelling them in whereas all of the other ones i'm pretty sure you can't smell through the bag it's just strange because even though it tastes like so strong that it feels like i'm eating a banana it doesn't taste so strong that it doesn't taste like it could come from a joint naturally this still as i'm talking it i could believe that this was just a strain that tastes like this well people this is pretty much over it's getting to the point where it's about to be dead i'm probably gonna have like one two more pulls on it [Music] that was so flavoursome it smoked amazing like the bug that i put in that wasn't smoking that good i'm so so impressed that that just made the joint so good yo the thing i haven't even mentioned about these guys yet is that you know that the size of that was the one grand one so they do these as well they're half gram ones wait check this check this so to all the people who were like oh i can't smoke pure because you know i can't put a gram into a joint or i can't smoke pure because my bud's not clean enough this is the answer like you can put half a gram in this one like just for context to show how big it is in your in your mouth like it has a little tip that comes out here and this bit will fill up with the half gram and it will smoke amazing literally how i've just had it this is the unflavored ones i'm not sure if they do flavored ones in the half grams but even just smoking stuff through these wraps in and of themselves will have your joint taste and banging i'll probably smoke one of these on twitch later on if you want to have a little look at that but i think that's why i'm going to end this off here i want to remind you guys that later on today i'm going to give away 100 king palms people 100. so if you want to get the chance to win that definitely check out the stream the link will be in the pin comment down below so guys definitely check out king palms those guys are absolutely amazing thank you to them for sending this over to me i've wanted to

stain though it's like it's like you have to be driving down the street and you smell a skunk you know how this gun smell comes in the car now to those of the those who don't um appreciate good cannabis when they smell that smell when it gets in the car it's like a skunk right now what's crazy is that when i smell that when we're driving down the street i'm like um yeah well you smell like something good that's what this is doing for me right now it's that stink that only us cannabis hemp cbd and marijuana lovers could enjoy this is that stink this that is that good stink i don't know i don't know what else to say it's that good thing it's think good mm-hmm breaks down nice and fine check this out no seeds just that little bitty piece of stick right there that's because i broke it off of that bud and that one bud is enough to get this blunt going and i've been waiting for this i'm i'm four hours past due on this blunt because i'm supposed to get off the phone and i had this blunt roll about both charity i just had to have this bumper i was supposed to have this blunt roll about 4 30. man it is 8 30. but you know being that it's an og a legendary og i know it's taking

with you're better off asking what can't cbd help with right but it helped with so much that this is so long the list is so long and right now it's calming me down uh on days like this i can really really feel the effect because i had an attitude i had an attitude about having to work so late i was upset and now i'm smoking my cbd and as it starts to kick in my brain is just like whatever that's why i really need cbd smoke breaks at work i really do because it would calm me down but the reason i don't is because when i know i'm going to do a review i don't want anything else to be in my system i don't want to be smoked anything else to have any kind of taste i just want to smoke and review what i'm doing that day let that be the first smoke of the day and oh my god it's worth it oh

like really healthy as weed because it's like if you look at it it's not it's wall growing it's well flushed and everything and then the compare to a really heavy indica yeah take it out let's compare and contrast that this is an indica in here and see how it's all compressed and yeah that's what I'm saying look at that this is the your indica right here this is my indica we're not smoking this right now but it was here a little bit later look at that we got that so here [ __ ] smells good but yeah this right here everybody we got some yeah the Mendel breath that she's fired [ __ ] we got

free yeah there's thirty bucks yeah thirty bucks but he told me it's like do this [ __ ] right thing and I'm like dude honestly I'm like we're about at [ __ ] raw what how about having a hoop we're about to roll a [ __ ] of them in a joint so [ __ ] stay tuned y'all again everybody the SEC really glue some sativa I'm juiced man this is about to be five then we got this [ __ ] T you gets literally smelling it out of the container like you're just smelling it rocket almost literally like it reeks through the [ __ ] container I've been using this when there's we don't care how mad you house think is it oh damn that stink match sticky and I even break it down I literally just broke it just little pieces and I want to break the [ __ ] by hand now look at that you look at you look at closely like super super closely again this camera doesn't really do any justice but like if you look at it super close a [ __ ] is [ __ ] yeah that's just something bad so you know what you could do to grind it minimal yep do a couple just do a couple turns here let me show you how to everybody let me show you how sometimes like I think about it on my dude if you grinded if you grind the [ __ ] load out of it bro it could potentially take away some of the like trichomes engine you know anything a lot of people press down when they're grinding and like yeah you have to obviously present but like to a certain extent press down it only do like do one full turn another full turn another [ __ ] that's it that's it you need okay yeah that's really all you need you just kind of need them kind of like break down this little bear looking good yep was looking good nice fallin grinded and everything too so it's good I also today I'm the one that rolled it let me know how I did I'm usually not I'm not a roller definitely not a roller so it looks it looks nice from this side it doesn't mean he's good from far apart from good this side is likely what I'm gonna show you guys this a yeah a little ugly except for me I'm gonna taste that just takes to just take a hit and just taste that [ __ ] bro that girl that gluing on [ __ ] joke bro that guy was - yeah thank you yes make sure you acts nice impressing this oh you should have put a minute just a little oh [ __ ] no wait hold on I'm just thinking it's up to you but I'm just thinking on the bug I think now would have been at from the inside yeah yeah but no I was thinking I'll think I do that other container has a little layer like honestly with your Pig we could've just have my seat where's it now but my shits at the house let me check one of my things oh yeah so we slapped on some regard and well hold on you miss egg let a book all right yeah what is that some longer than what this is the the fire oh gee turns over whoo it's that one pass out that one book one book yeah that's just fire wrong oh let me see the right there oh nice yeah you're kind of just melting at huh yeah should it be warm yeah oh yeah huh yep even better yep there you go now it's getting more moist cheers gorilla glue with some OG fire wubba Oh some by someone the way that the og og well but no no no no let me rock rock introduce me man you introduced me to a new technique on how to spark it I knew it yeah whatever guys like this look you gotta make the usual somehow get into the facts how much cheese with that she's so [ __ ] loud you think about that first couple of heads bro what's up first couple hits I had a little bit of a stress on my mind my mother from whatever I had stressing from where our stressing banana just like kind of like weight the table my shoulders I'm just chilling I can just not worry about it and just be chilling and bright so what I'm trying to say is that I'm lit what was good though y'all have you guys ever smoked that gorilla glue what's poppin let me know in the comments down below makes you guys drop a comment there's no way guys a friend what you guys are smoking on mm-hmm but yeah this is some gorilla glue some Gigi number four so I'm really cool for so g-g-gee it's definitely paid like hella good like better or worse from your previous experiences hmm can't say just yet but I think this is good who knows actually because I know we had some guerrilla glue not so long ago honestly if you're right nut so that's what I'm trying to remember I was like you remember Johnny's guerilla game that's what I'm saying that shows fire to it look like an indica yeah and gorilla glue or also known as GG 4 created by Gorilla Glue stare decisis Evo dominant hybrid and multiple award-winning strain famous for its high THC content yup it a verge is 18 to 25 percent THC this one average is 22 this batch that we got 22% so with the imagine with the wax to this Pilate Helen oh yeah no [ __ ] regard and wax is looking like 50% but you may find it as high as 32% some dispensaries 32 some dispensaries have this [ __ ] at 30 to 30 when you get to 30 percent THC that is that's 5 [ __ ] right there that's that's fire yeah cuz the 30s that's why what the yeah yeah and then the CBD is very low ranging between a point zero five at a point one I honestly don't like I really don't like [ __ ] homes in CBD I don't like that should be giving me headaches in shape so let's see this is a 5 a 5 star out of 5 Gorilla Glue number 4 this is a really good strength and it's crazy too because the guy was like I asked him all that what do you recommend and he reached his hand on the back of something pulled some [ __ ] up and I was like GG floors I looked but he put his hand in a in a black pants and a black hole you just put that he just needs wet his pants and he's check out that [ __ ] and I was like Oh fire it's yeah I have two of those it's wait I don't get it so it says sativa but it's recommended to smoke at night interesting very interested if uhrin types of sativa yeah let's see in different types of engine typical typical effects relaxed card mouth sleepy common usage depression pain and insomnia okay that's kind of cool gorilla glue for us on itv4 was created this is that the strain gets his name because of the resin that collects on the scissors when trimming gorilla glue number four has several parents parents due to extensive background Sour Diesel sour dub cam sister at Kansas City Kansas and chocolate diesel the hybrid strain has won awards at the 2014 catalyst Cup in both LA and Michigan I usually don't cop that much unless I'm smoking like taking a nap described as a bunch of trichomes with a few but leaves in stocks sticking out the aroma is very strong true that and as most is mostly diesel with notes of chocolate and coffee although sweet and earthy is also it's also used to describe it you'll be going back for seconds due to the full-bodied and flavorful spot you mention it I do taste the chocolate milks in the smell is really [ __ ] nice I'm gonna lie this is gorilla glue this gorilla glue I'm not gonna lie it's Pollock in my top five best smelling weed flowers top five it's in my handful for sure not top five for me not me right now what I'm really on is all like the the oranges all the of the sours like the line technically yeah technically I try to choose I try to choose one of every category if that okay that makes sense yeah so out of like the ones that smell like these the gorilla greens like you said sour diesels and honestly cuz like Sardis let's just smells fire stuff too we really can sister [ __ ] and chocolate diesel I've never tried that sour dub neither so our diesel initially actually trying to a chocolate it's a strain called chocolate peppermint you remember that fan it's [ __ ] it tastes similar to this but [ __ ] now that I think about it I'm like Sour Diesel does [ __ ] smell like this too and I just gotta have both comparative we got to start doing versus versus yeah yeah like this versus this huh I'm Donna another hit 11 a campaign stepped out let's see the buds are green with orange hairs that's it is very oh it's spongy resinous and covered in trichomes it was yeah yeah the little dents what are the parts yet because it says it's this very dense spongy president then the trichomes you can see all that [ __ ] you really can't I really want to get a camera week the [ __ ] young man well imagine how high-quality are [ __ ] video get a microphone a microphone a freaking the colors the microscopes doesn't just end up looking at the [ __ ] well when our tree looks under my physical eyelids green that they know people have a bunch of like [ __ ] that in German and the little Tigers well you date that [ __ ] just marijuana a [ __ ] a cannabis plant looks really [ __ ] crazy then you zoom in and you see literally every little detail you see the trichomes are like little little crystals on there it's like it's like clear you know like orange hairs they're nuts like do this it's such a it's such a satisfying view like a whole nother filing Wow it's a home of the funny hobby like yeah that should say that [ __ ] has a lot of information though you know the glue is because it's really popular I know a lot of people like it with new [ __ ] a lot of people like been emoji to vent emoji remember the one that we smoked the vent emoji or do a send us upload that video curl igloo makes you chill medical and recreational users boat it gives a full body melt and despite the sativa dominance the body effect may be a result of the THC CBD ratio but let alone the copies a lawyer buddy if you guys ever smoked on some Gorilla Glue I know a lot of people out there it's kind of crazy bro this is what I really like about having this type of channel and having the type of community that I'm trying to get together you know it's like everyone's different parts of the world I have people commenting from the UK people from the East Coast and I'll shout to you guys try people from [ __ ] Antarctica but even from [ __ ] marty at what gods it Mars I don't know why I was hunting Bush out there but and you guys be smoking on like [ __ ] that I've never even heard of honestly people will drop a name or a strain or some [ __ ] and I'll just play what the [ __ ] I never heard about that I'll check it out yeah they did for sure I always say oh yeah I try this one we bro you don't have like if you guys are from California then we might have the same strength but you guys are from like somewhere else y'all have different strains like in London in a night like over there overseas do they have cookies like they should but that I'm pretty sure burn it would be smart enough to yeah setup with cookies club and in the UK especially London [ __ ] yeah oh yeah oh that's just legal out there hey Canada - mmm but maybe he already does have dispensaries in Canada and UK Glasson it's Canada cat in Canada that's just the legal legal that's just like you're smoking a cigarette you just have to be on personal property at urine which is the hostas personal property and you have to be of age we're both we're both 23 or 96 babies this is an 18 and up channel but it's all literally for all educational purposes I'm loaded with let us know if you guys are loaded and bloated with us learning gluten for sure I feel like I've been lettered in bullies inside that was 13 since eighth grade this is just like Lil D freshman year we started smoking it's crazy we should make a video on how I first started song in breath why we started smell good I'm there because we wanted to get our tolerance off for the under the influence we would have smoke sessions uh-huh and by his crib my house we would like kick in by like these offices because we are apartments are connected to like pretty much you can say abandon offices and [ __ ] so we just glad kind of walk to like the offices in shame and we just be like smoke and [ __ ] we smoke a [ __ ] blunt it's crazy back in the day everybody loot all it would be like six of us and we don't opt like two dollars and fifty cents each literally two dollars to fifty cents these food walk the shell end up then and we're all like 16 17 and no no we were younger yeah we were younger and the guy the guy that used to work but at the gas station that we used to go this guy he would let us buy [ __ ] like Swisher's and [ __ ] he just wanted to make sells you know so he's like [ __ ] which works for us and yeah yeah exactly and I'm pretty sure bro we all like tell a little to the video server to keep making dropping videos like that bro that [ __ ] I should have a funny bro [ __ ] that's just really crazy bro we don't drop $2.50 clothes if you go to the gas station get changed and by a blunt go to the walk walk see if we can get a ride to the plug house and so now we would walk or it was an adventure yeah it wasn't that far the plug look over the bridge for the bridge yeah cop like a good like a 10 sack or a 1.5 roll that [ __ ] in a blunt maybe two maybe like [ __ ] split that point what point eight point eight

seeing that the owner doesn't see it as a business based on fresh air he clearly doesn't care about paying guests kids don't do drugs and end up like that", "bwbZTN4fMGM": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'll be showing you how to infuse starbursts so delicious and surprisingly was one of the easiest edibles i've ever made and i feel like i'm going to make these many times in the future they turned out so well [Music] to make these starbursts here's what you're going to need some starburst candy i wish i could have had the all pink kind but we don't sell them in canada so i just got the original infuse coconut oil and optionally you can also use a concentrate or extract to make them extra strong and some lecithin to help with absorption first i have the top part of my double boiler and then i'm going to peel the wrapper off of some starbursts and place them in the bowl i use 30 pieces here but the amount you use doesn't matter too much the recipe is very forgiving then you're gonna heat up a pot to a light boil and place your double boiler container thing on top and then using the spatula you're going to use to mix everything together add a scoop of some lecithin and then mix that in they do take quite a while to melt so just keep an eye on them and for the first five minutes or so they probably won't melt that much so you can pretty much just leave them be but then after five minutes when they start to melt like this um just keep stirring them and watching them until they melt all the way down then once everything is pretty much melted like this we can add our coconut oil so i'm going to be adding one tablespoon of coconut oil but you can add for this amount of starburst up to three tablespoons of coconut oil and to make it stronger i'm also going to be adding some concentrate now we just have to mix everything together so i'm having some trouble getting the starburst and the oil to emulsify together you can see um the oil kind of just doesn't really blend into it at all so i'm going to grab a whisk and see if that'll help us emulsify a little bit better so using the whisk aggressively actually turned out very well everything mixed together and it worked better than i expected honestly now i'm just going to put my starburst mixture onto a baking pan that is covered in waxed paper and then i'm just going to place another sheet of wax paper on top and kind of roll it and shape it out to the thickness i want in the end i feel like i wish i would have made it a little bit thicker so it would have been the exact same thickness of actual starburst but next time i'll do that i guess and then i just use this sharp utensil to kind of just shape it so i could have nice corner edges and then i placed it in the fridge now while i'm waiting for it to cool in the fridge i'm going to heat up my double boiler again because um i don't want to waste any of the starburst and the coconut oil mixture that's left in the pot so i'm going to make a little drink out of it so i have a whole video on how to do this and to be honest that video is going to give you a much tastier result than this one because this is just like a little makeshift one i did and i'll post the link of how to make that drink below pretty much you're just going to add some water and heat it up so you can get all the mixture combined and then you're going to add a drink mix to it and then cool it and serve it over ice but check out the video i have on how to make an infused starburst drink because it's like literally one of the most delicious drinks i've ever had and you can put quite a bit of coconut oil in there and you can't taste it which is very surprising considering how much i put in it okay so now that our drink is made and our starburst has cooled down a bit i actually left mine in the fridge a little bit too long it was about a half an hour and i felt like it was a little bit too hard for me to cut easily so i just took it out of the fridge for five ten minutes until it was ready to be cut so i'm just going to start by cutting these little edges on the side which i'll probably just snap on while i'm cutting and then i'm going to cut all of these into squares after i cut them i realized that i feel like the size was not accurate to the size of a starburst so when i make these next time i'm going to actually place a starburst on there and measure it out now they're all done so i'm just going to throw them into their little container and that's it they are ready to eat [Music] these turned out so well i'm so so happy with them this is probably going to be my go-to instead of gummies now they just just everything is amazing thank you guys so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe thanks so much guys have a wonderful day [Music] you", "-09iMrZscgw": "thanks for watching cell block turk uh got some fire flame for you right here uh we about to be um looking at this uh hemp wrap today uh yeah so we're gonna be twisting up with him rap um so without further ado let's jump to close up and get into the review all right bird club let's get some of those bird emojis flapping in the comments section as we get ready to take a look at today's blunt today we're looking at these natty organic hip wraps and this is sweet now if you watch me for a minute you've heard me say that uh sweet blunts are not my favorite um like pipes let's go ahead open these up give me got the pipe back so we can uh see what they look like sorry bird club we got these natty organic wraps out the pack then we got four we got four tips um i typically don't use the tips but i am going to use it this time so let's go we'll get this one and then we'll all right we'll run those joints all right let's go ahead bring this in for a smell test and see uh what they smell like all right burkha all right burke up we got the uh maddie unwrapped and got the scent going on this sweet blood pencil and i have smelled um still presents with a play-doh kind of scent but it's very faint very faint um if you're looking for like a sweet blunt to smoke and you want that that strong sweet taste this isn't the blunt for you that's just me going off the smell alone though um we'll go ahead and get some of this weed in it see what it smokes like i'm hoping that it smokes with that mild uh sweet flavor because if it is these may end up being one of my favorite sweet buns but let's not jump ahead let's go ahead get some wheat in this thing and see what it smells like all right bird club we got this natty organic hip wrap rolled up um it is a full width cigar so you can put a whole bunch of wii in this thing um the filter uh uh helps absorb some of that space um the taste on it from moisting it is is it's fair you still get that sweet taste from it it's not as light as the smell of it is um hopefully i'm still hoping that the uh smoke doesn't have too much of that sweet smell which i describe as play-doh because that's the closest thing that i can get to the actual uh smell of this um let's go ahead and um get some fire on it and see what it smokes like and again i'm hoping that that sweet taste and smell isn't very dominant all right burke up we're gonna go ahead and uh let's park this joint up see what it hit for again if y'all watch me for a minute y'all know that uh sweet blunts are not my favorite let's go ahead and uh get some fire on it and see what the first side stream is like kind of gives us an indication of what it might taste like it's never like really definitive but uh it can give you an indication okay all right um that's actually bad at all um what what i'm what i'm getting is a lot of vegetative uh kind of scent the kind of vegetative stick with most hemp blocks you do get that sweet aroma but it's background vegetables coming out first that sweetness is coming through um i'm not getting the burning of my date yet but let's take first pull see what the um smoke tastes like all right um the sweet taste is there sweet taste is there and it's up front is the very first taste you get however i know it is the very first thing get from the smoke it's not overbearing or over over uh it's not it's not it's not it's not too powerful you still get the vegetable from the hip wrap and i can still taste my weed in it that sweet taste is just um it's just there it's there and you can tell us there it's just not overpowering that that that's smoking actually pretty good put this filter in there uh you get a nice uh you get a nice flow a smoke i usually don't use filters but the way this is smoking i may that i may i may start using filters a little bit more the way that this is smoking i usually don't like to use filters because they take up space in the blunt that can be used to hold [Music] wheat yeah this thing looks like this thing open all the way up nice ass on there nice gray ash yeah that's that's smoking pretty nice so what i'll say to you if you uh are in the market for him hemp rats give these natty blunts a try um they're not bad they smoke pretty good uh you like sweet blunts i mean you really want that intense likes like like pipe tobacco sweetness taste these are not the blunts for you although they do present with a um nice sweetness smell and aroma it's not it's not very dominant so so um if you're looking for a more dominant sweet that's that's this ain't the way to go but if you don't mind a mild sweetness in your smoke these will work for you they need to work for you they smoking pretty smooth where i'm at before for a dollar so um you know what i mean as far as uh cheaper blunts go these these hit these hit pretty good um if you try these let me know what you think in the comment section that i'm too little marley i'm out bird you", "y0iRtNf13bE": "- Hey growers, I'm back and I'm between the two Grobos and I've\ngot some gummy bears. They've completed our recipe\nand they're ready to show off, so it's a little bit of show and tell now. I coated them with a\nlittle bit of refined sugar because they were quite\nsticky coming out of the mold, but they're really nice and sweet and nice and powerful. (upbeat music) Okay, the first step we're gonna do is we're gonna add the powder of the Zen Zingers Cherry Bomb. To that we're gonna add 45 milliliters of reverse osmosis water, and we're gonna stir this up really well. The instructions say\nto use a wooden spoon, but I don't have a wooden\nspoon here in the office, so I've selected this\nbeautiful metal spoon to use. This is on a medium high heat to begin. Once it's all combined, we're\ngoing to go with a lower heat. We want it to continue to boil, but we don't want it to boil too much. Now that it's boiling, I'm going to set my timer for four minutes and we're not gonna touch it. So we are not gonna stir\nit any more at this point, but we have turned the temperature down. Once four minutes is up, we'll be back. Okay, so that was four minutes. So we're going to take the\nconcoction off of the heat. Now we're going to add the cannabis oil. If you'd like to see how\nto make cannabis oil, check out our video in the link below. I'm going to add this whole\nportion of cannabis oil. I've made this before. It's nice and strong. We're gonna be making\n15 of these little guys. Great, now I'm gonna use the syringe to fill up some of these\nlittle smiley face cavities. I'm going to fill 'em\nthree quarters of the way and I'll come back and top 'em all off. Once that's done, we're going to put these\ninto the fridge for 24 hours. Then we're going to\ncover 'em in table sugar, store 'em in a flat container, and they'll be ready to consume. So that's the end of our gummy bear video, but we also have a couple of\nother videos you can check out. If you'd like to find out how\nwe made the cannabis honey oil that went into this recipe, click the link in the description below. You may be asking yourself at this point, what on earth is that gorgeous guy doing between those two Grobos? That's a good question. We've made a video about how these two grows are progressing. One we topped and one we left alone. Wait a minute, yeah, one we\ntopped and one we left alone. So you can check out that video in the description below as well.

novelty yes this totally [ __ ] happened the same day as the green kratom story look i'm slowing down i swear i'm on my day off and i'm only doing caffeine to be fair though for this particular story i ended up pussying out slightly instead of going all in which is a pretty big theme for me after all the disposable vape that i got had 92 cbd and only 8 delta thc look already went too damn fast with the gummies i have to work my way up gradually i'll do something with only delta 8 thc and then next i just really really didn't want to [ __ ] freak out i'm tired of freaking out anyway on march 21st after work i was already basically coming down off of kratom i put on the 1994 lion king and started to get to work on the vape i started out slow because i honestly had no clue how it would hit me but pretty soon i got into it enough to where i was taking pretty big hits and holding them in it tasted peppery as [ __ ] i hadn't smoked actual weed in a hot minute but i'm pretty sure it tasted almost exactly like a super strong indica is meant to taste like it got caught in my throat a decent amount of times i didn't cough with every hit but i was coughing with a few of them i hit the damn thing a total of 40 times while watching the lion king which is an hour and a half long movie by the way maybe i could have gone a bit faster but i started out really slow because i didn't want to overdo it and it took me a while to start speeding up my hits it didn't feel psychoactive and i'm pretty sure all the relaxation i felt came from the cbd i munched on a bag of nacho cheese bugles and it at least made it easier for me to eat a [ __ ] ton of food also i'm pretty sure colors were a bit brighter especially during the movie i don't know sounds like placebo to me look i'm fine with that i had a relaxing night i don't need my brain to be going a million miles per hour my brain isn't really in very good shape these days i'll try something with just delta 8 thc soon and the show goes on", "Fj5PoNrZ3OI": "welcome to community cannabis review today i'm going to be doing a review on a cartridge i'll be doing a review on a select co2 oil cartridge the strain is cinex which i believe is a cross between cindy 99 and pineapple express so um i grabbed this one because this one looks really really nice you've seen it you can check my other videos if not but um check out the other co2 oil carts from them and they look like some standard co2 oil like fairly dark oil this one looks incredible same price same like batch as all the other co2 oils but it looked great so let me turn the camera around and show you then i'll take a couple puffs [Music] hmm [Applause] [Music] hey [Music] wow [Music] alrighty so let's get into this um first off i'll correct myself by saying it is actually a cross between cindy 99 or cinderella 99 and vortex i had not heard of vortex prior to this but seems like a good strain um very interested after just reading a quick leafly article about this strain seems like it's heavy on um less on the mirror scene in the cardiophiline which i get bored of seems like it's heavy on pinene and limonene potentially which i really like so first off trying to make more videos but struggling to find the time and motivation and also more so just not get greedy because i recently just bought like a gram of six star hash rosin that i was wanting to make a video on but i just got into it way too quick and didn't even take a picture prior to me opening it so i feel like that's not the best way to make a video so i'll buy another gram eventually and get a video on it and it was super great um but first let's start with what we have here cine cynix um so let's see it first off amazing for their co2 oil you normally don't get anything besides like that dark black oil basically which i'm not against for the price that it goes at it's pretty good stuff wow that's one of the best cards i've had in a good while um definitely has like a little base layer i always notice a heavier notes first a little bit of like that peppery taste but it is strong with the definitely taste a good bit of pinene in there and then maybe some like lemonade as well lemony is always light to me so if there's a lot i couldn't tell anyways that really really evens it out it's not it's always like such a standard boilerplate co2 oil taste which is a lot like whiskey or like there's usually a lot of humiliating in there this one it's got i mean it's got the slightest bit of that taste to it but it has so many other like terpenes going on that it overpowers that easily and that it's good it's uh it's very citrusy but it's like a heavy citrus it reminds me of grape with but it doesn't it's not like grape flavor it just reminds me of grapes grapes like a heavy fruity taste to me it's like um orange and mango is kind of mixed with like a peppery peppery main taste yeah so that's all i got on this one really but i mean that is a solid cart right there for their select co2 line highly highly um hats off to them because that's really really well done so thanks for watching i'm going to try and get more videos out especially some new brands not just the same old stuff but unfortunately there's not many new brands to work with so yeah i'll see what i can do but thanks for watching and grab one of these check it through the window of the cart first but even the dark ones look are pretty decent in my opinion but i mean if you see one like this go for it alright thanks for watching you'll have a great", "qGjdbTSg6cA": "[ __ ] [Music] cheers

"why don't you do the hitchhiker for this chevy i guess remove that because that just looked weird as soon as we just moved that down the line was this yeah welcome back to flight crew 420. it's your boy stoner jeff it's your boy king tree you already know the vibes and today we are doing the puffco versus the cargo review because one of us just happens to have one of each yeah honestly that's the funny part i gotta end up getting the puffco and he and the pina colada so it's like why not i read the reviews i've i had to go with the garden yeah and puffco was just like the first like brand i saw as like these remote devs so i was like [ __ ] why not buffalo was a good um like i almost got one but i was like all right yeah so to talk about the specs i guess i'll go for the puff coat first um well pull straight off the website right here but it says handball on glass just like any type of bond i guess water filtration you can tell by the little like tube up in the middle it is four heat settings 20 seconds average heat up time intelligent heat calibration whatever sesh mode functionality which that's actually pretty cool seven and seven inch high by three basically three inch high bass which i mean yeah two hour charge fast charge thirty dev average battery life 30 dab average battery life so you can take 30 dabs per battery life removable ceramic ball which boom detail uh led band which is a little light right here that tells the i don't know why the hell that thing obviously case included haptic feedback in silicon valley base which is made of silicone so you know structure when they stay and it stays on the table and whatnot anyways that's the that's the stuff about the puff coat so jeffy i want you to talk about the carter the carter relatively the same thing comes with the carb cap a little holder for the car cat just dangles it i like it don't lose your car crap yeah comfortable ergonomic design is actually is pretty comfortable to hold not gonna lie that one is two though i don't know this one is kind of weird they're both pretty comfortable though it's easier just like real quick the it's got the rechargeable battery so the batteries you can just change them out you pop them out the bottom so if you ever need to change the rechargeable batteries and do that it comes with two different types of buckets which i really like it's got a glass quartz bucket or it's got the titanium bucket which is i don't really prefer titanium anymore kind of past that right but it's cool because like they don't it's not gonna break or anything like a glass mic but uh it's got four different temperature presets you just turn it on hit the button and go all the way to the top for the highest lowest you just want to really taste it of course this one also has an app that you can use where you can control the temperature the time of the dab all that good stuff it tells you how many dabs you've taken i don't use the apps because i just like to dab real quick and go i don't really i don't even want to see that number either how many times how many times have you there today three thousand holy [ __ ] okay yeah uh haptic feedback i don't really know what that i think that's just like the vibration when it's ready i think so too yeah that's pretty much it you can interchange the glass if you need the same thing with the puffco and the card cap you can get different card caps you can pop the glass off here get some different glasses we got recyclers which is dope i kind of want to get a recycler for sure that'd be [ __ ] sick i wonder how do you open this [ __ ] because the top yeah but like where it doesn't have a tear on it see this is trippy maybe they didn't make that [ __ ] child proof but they'd be making these things a door that could work too well you should always have a safety net so you can open your dabs not just in case if you're in the water you have to stab somebody before your dabs just carry a knife on you it's not a bad decision you can do it it's legal now we're about to take some dabs yeah take some dabs test out how each of these mofos work but we kind of know how each of them work but like we're doing it for y'all obviously just going to show you real quick so tutorial yeah we could do a little yeah tutorial a little each one real quick uh i might have to see your thing again yeah let me see your knife it didn't quite open huh did it quite open no yeah do it just like a [ __ ] cut the [ __ ] out my table yeah i don't know what you expected there [Music] don't care can't see it well they can't see it so it doesn't matter so yeah taylor go take some dabs i'm not gonna lie i'm about to clean up that one so i don't take some of those other dabs i really don't know what he just said tom's gonna so the good thing about these mofos is that like all i really do for cleaning them is just take some regular decolor q-tips and put it on just like the lowest heat setting and then just circle and circle and get this [ __ ] up real quick it's not it's not hard to clean the insides at all but then sometimes when it does get like too sticky or whatnot on the inside like you do or at least like after you use it like you know a couple rounds or whatnot you should probably like put it in it's like some or at least i use boiling water i don't know what you use well he's taking a dab right now so wait what kind of bucket is this silicone plastic hard plastic so i got some shattered from so my my buckets come out like there's like these little buckets put them in my nail and i just heat up the nail and i cleaned it off that works too because it's glass already so i just yeah i'm about to say this one on the inside like under this [ __ ] is like a little like titanium little bucket i will give it to you though this one's the bucket's a lot bigger on this one it is so [ __ ] way bigger oh hell yeah god damn yeah you could one yeah [ __ ] i didn't even realize that yeah that was huge so sweet bread shattered that's what this [ __ ] is called what's 68 percent that did i didn't realize how long it was shatter cream dick hannah oh santa cruz that's lit all right let's give her add some of their crumble uh i remember one time my friend he combined shatter and crumble you put it in like a little silicone container and put it in the wax melter yeah and then melted it down and like you mix it together don't even know what that what is that technically considered butter i don't know what is butter is that just like whipped his appetizers like mixture that's what it is no i really don't know just some type of [ __ ] all right i got me a little bit filled up in here so i know y'all can see but if you like you hold it you hold there's like a little button on the bottom you hold that to turn it off and on like it's right under here right in the bowl piece you hold it to turn it off and on so i got another student i just turned it on right now made like a little vibration so that's how you know it's on and then every like if you press it once the temperature like that's how you know what temperature is every time you press it it changes temperature so blue is the lowest greenh red is the third hottest and white is the hottest hottest but who white is also set mode to where if you press it twice on here just get here for like 20 or like it'll be hot for like 20 seconds straight or something like that but just like kind of stays heated up yeah and yeah that's the gist of it i usually like to start on white and then go down to like blue or something or blue or green but yeah got my [ __ ] up in here let's see how this goes so yeah once you hit it twice it starts like flashing and then it'll vibrate like it'll vibrate three times when it's ready so yeah that's basically what it's doing right now i know y'all can see but the white light is flashing and it just vibrated so now it's ready c that one doesn't get too cloudy yeah it'll vibrate one more time once it's off and then usually there's usually like a couple like after pools you can take yeah cause it says heat it up a little bit but yeah that's the puffco carter explanation i just took it out [ __ ] it pretty much you just it's already i think it's on oh it's already on yeah so you just uh when it's off you hit the button five times of course like normal and then you just hit it once and it'll start blinking i don't want to do it now because i don't have a dab in there yeah you just hit it once it'll start blinking and then once it uh it'll blink blue and then once it blinks green or once it's green solid green means go just start hitting that [ __ ] i usually like to wait a second after it's heated up after it turns green and then i throw the dab in there just because how long it stays on and that's what they told me to just like wait until after i heat stuff and put the dab in there okay just cause it's like taking an actual dive still so you know yeah i get you yeah so yeah that's pretty much it you want to switch that is it what switch okay but you need to do it i'm gonna try this one oh goodness it's already ready uh clip it five times yeah yeah it on clicking fast there we go you want to get your dab ready first though oh so now it's getting ready yeah how do you change the tent click it what the [ __ ] you can just still change your time well how many times click just once that's the highest oh lowest oh oh okay there's nothing in there there's something in there there's still something less apparently [ __ ] barely yeah this bowl is hella small goddamn you can hit some pretty good dabs out of it though how do you start this thing again you know what how do you start this thing again don't or you already got your [ __ ] loaded no i was gonna do it afterwards okay oh uh double tapping there you go you vibrate that one time yeah see that's why i always like to get stuff that's a little bit manageable with your fingers like chatter or something because then you can just throw it in there afterwards can you change the temperature mid you say what can you change the temperature mid here nah well i don't think so but you know i think i like keeping this one too so hmm yeah i prefer three whoo yeah three i like to say that you get a solid dab with three okay all right you have anything to say about i mean it's it's about the same relatively i think it worked like comparisons pros or cons like like what do you think the difference is like since you got a carter and how does like the pupil feel uh i feel like the temporary like the controls probably a lot easier on mine just because it's one button and then like the blinky things not like the colors and at the same time i think it's just because you probably know how to use it yeah i feel like it's just a little bit simpler like i mean like i don't like it looks cool though i like it i like the lights and stuff but like i feel like that's just a little bit more simple uh i think for me i kind of like the default ball of this one i kind of like how also you can change the uh temperatures mid hit yeah that was that's a nice thing but the ball is hella small you can still take pretty good dabs i know you know like the damage it took was pretty good but at the same time like i put that [ __ ] in session one time before i just put like a diamond in that [ __ ] like a full diamond and yeah this is hitting that [ __ ] for a minute yeah that [ __ ] it says you probably could do the same thing in this one too but stays heated for 25 seconds 25 seconds yeah that's the lowest it'll be i'm doing one more just for the love because i gotta [ __ ] with this one i don't know i kind of think i like the carter better than the puff club in my personal opinion i already knew like it because that's what the one i bought okay i'm still stuck in there i mean like i said i think the default ball is better just because i think the design of it is just a little bit better than that one yeah the glass is nice i like the glass they're quartz yeah hold on because i'm gonna take one more get out the puffs this only is hella wax in there too it leaves like a it leaves like a pretty solid like liquid like afterwards yeah but you can still be hitting that for a minute too honestly yeah i think we shall see focus v it's pretty solid dude first of all i thought i gotta get you a half of alkaline water 9 to 10 ph that's a little bit on the acidic side but it's better for you because the electrolytes that's why the ph changes but it's water that gives you going i wouldn't go water hurt i do like that one too because you can put pearls in there too like the that pearls bro i accidentally put that i just didn't suck that [ __ ] up in my vacuum and vacuuming a couple days ago like i was like really looking for it and then like i was just like it's like something like that on the vacuum and i'm just like okay what the hell is that and i just started here to spin like hella hard on a vacuum i'm just like wow don't tell me like i'm just like it's literally making like spanish [ __ ] like that the vacuum took that [ __ ] there perfectly some fun oh yeah i love white the white one yeah third the third one is the one for me on that one because it's like the perfect amount of smoke but you still get the taste i've never i haven't done the highest one i don't even know why i'm sorry but that [ __ ] hit me all right i was holding on to the puffco because that [ __ ] just woke me back up it just told me like yeah actually his too honestly they both hit good like i can't really tell like like preference wise i really like honestly at this point it's kind of just like our preference because it comes out the price too because mine's 50 bucks cheaper true 250 yeah okay so the carter was 250 puffco is 300 and same functionality same functionality basically like i said the puffco bowl is just a little bit bigger but you can also i like the changing of this one though i don't know he probably could do that too but i think there's even a bit like i think everything we got was the basic one for the puff coat so like can you chase can you get different buckets or huh can you get different buckets for it different buttons buckets buckies for like the puffco yeah i'm pretty sure you can is it like glass ones yeah see this is a different one because the one we got a titanium but not with that little glass at the bottom well no these ones yeah so yeah you need a couple different bottles i have a different one for this one oh yeah you can also forgot you can smoke actual weed out of this one there's an attachment for that yeah that's glass attachment that's dope yeah you can you can get a different atomizer for this one and you can smoke actual flour out of it that's just a jacket it's a top four chocolate cake cracker glass travel glass another glass of pink glass oh that one's double that's a recycler that [ __ ] hold itself glass stand another bottle could oh everyone let's see what they got for yours that attachments call this thing these are kind of cold damn they sold out the pink ones that's so funny i like that thing i like it sticks out too like a regular like it's like really like a regular rig oh yeah your attachment is actually pretty cool that's just a glass attachment it's not even like that's halfway down this [ __ ] though oh yeah see that's the those are some ball pegs with different chargers okay it's another recycler same recycler [ __ ] okay okay that one's pretty good you can go to any smoke shop too and like they'll have like their own like kind of oh that's stupid avocado bowl for the puffco it's hella funny sriracha they got a sriracha bowl for the puffco oh man that's hilarious oh my god it's silicone that's weird i don't like taking hits on the silicone i don't know that [ __ ] feels so weird uh i'm not trying to hold on all my homies who got some uh 3d printed accessories what a lanyard attachment what is that for the whole does it stay around your neck why do you need to attach it hold it around your neck oh my god just put it in the case and just fill it up with the water when you want to hit it stabilizing stain bro okay did you do the different batteries of course you know we got to change those bulls balls cases balls caps that bubble cap look different from that one yes i like the black i should have got the black matt's pretty old naked swabs that's what that's good yeah they don't have much bread accessories just like replacement [ __ ] oh you see that looks like a cup bottle there's a recycler too i think in the middle that kind of looks like it was just like really the perk is really high i don't know that's weird yeah that's it i don't really got too much see but they got the they got the other different versions too and [ __ ] you got the light up ones with the colors oh yeah all these different colors and [ __ ] those are 300 or 350 [ __ ] i like this oh that purple one's nice that green one is hella dope too yeah oh that red one's actually cold too i like that one i don't know sold out though oh yeah yeah i want to see the different puff coats because there's like four different ones a pearl yeah this is the one this is one that's basically just like the carter you could like put it on it only took them a couple carter did it on the first one but then it only took them a couple yeah but you gotta think about it like i think pogba was the first ones to do these they're the first ones to do it yeah probably once like everybody else got like the hint of it they're like oh let's put this on there the puck was like [ __ ] hold up [Music] but yeah i think that's pretty solid i mean i said i'm pretty good for preference i got the puff cup for 300. you got it for like 250. so it's up to your preference like i prefer the car this that's definitely like i would definitely stay if i could like if i could put my comparisons in two i would say that like the puffco i know personally like because like i know two people that traded their puffcoats ricardo's i'll make this [ __ ] um like i put that [ __ ] in my uh you can put that [ __ ] in your uh in your car oh perfectly yeah same thing you can put that [ __ ] in the cup holder like how often does yours malfunction you say what how often does yours malfunction what do you mean like about [ __ ] yeah sometimes it like dies i mean by the inconvenient times when i want to hit it but that's because i don't be because with the puffco you kind of do gotta be weary of it and like actually like when you're done hitting it turn it off because your battery will die yeah this one turns off automatically oh you hit it okay wait like i said boy like i said that's the that's the upgraded one or you know good the good one i feel like the puffco like the peak pearl probably does that probably but this is just so that's it was it like 400 for the puffco bro it was like 400 for the gopro i think so um yeah 400 for the uh p 405 and then this one right here was 300 so it's just a hundred dollars more but then again he did say that's only 250 and it basically does this already a payment plan of 4 100 payments i don't do that i'm [ __ ] up about my [ __ ] and holding it what did i say about the bowl it says something about the bowl i was like magnetic oh basically just like a calibrated ball long story short but it looks like but it does look like it's magnetic too i don't know my head said the same thing it tells you how many times you like yeah it basically gives you all the same things just the p pros a little bit different bluetooth oh they got wireless charging oh that's nice that means you can just sit it down the uh charging pad that's lit charging now it's got the auto sleep function yeah double water capacity so [ __ ] better [ __ ] filtration i could put more on it or you just get a different top two hour charts 30 second position 30 second heat up time case and then yeah i mean if you got it like that get the puff cup if you really want it but i mean yeah it looks like the pro basically does like everything the the peak pro does everything that carter does already but you know it's the name since they already like you know starting with the shades but it look it looks kind of better too i'm not going to go home they're the supreme of the e-rigs yeah so i don't know talk to you like i said you got the wireless charging mat too that's actually kind of cold but at the same time you have to get that in my opinion i got the i gotta i mean you know i do got android chargers like i got a lot of those android chargers like the um carter takes those type c chargers the same ones that are for like the switch or like updated androids and stuff like that like galaxies like yeah yeah at least i think that started on a galaxy nine in plus i have no idea but yeah that [ __ ] the switch you get something like uh hp complete like laptops chargers by those but like this like the puffco at least this one takes a regular android charger like you know i i'll not explain it but with [ __ ] say android charger that's the one that most [ __ ] is talking about playstation controller chargers yeah yeah well i don't even think that's the same one right it is okay okay well yeah ps4 controller charger type thing oh yeah xbox controller because they officially use those too but yeah it takes those type of android chargers so yeah like i said it's up to preference to me i kind of do [ __ ] with both but i got the puffco and i'm staying with the pup though only thing i like about that one better is the default glass but besides that like everything else is to me is and if i want better glass i'll just give you another thing of glass different attachment i don't know how it's like kind of it's got to be slanted like that but it's nice it worked you hit it like that anyway for some reason yeah i think you're just used to hitting it like that now because you usually like turn it down with that one i kind of like do it sideways instead of like straight up you put a lot of water in it so it doesn't matter if you tip it yeah how do you feel obviously i was definitely sticking my mind got you price and everything yeah it was definitely an easy choice yeah yeah that's it for the review i'm i have to give it a score i mean i mean i don't know necessarily about the sport yeah i mean looks like we decided that we got the whole thing so yeah i mean we did what we did um i really can't give it like a score in my opinion like i like both of them like actually both like good machines that's what i'm saying is really up to like preference like i said that's two the card is 250 this is 300 the pro is 400 so yeah you can make the choice off of that one all right that's how i feel about it yeah i mean i'm just gonna i would say go with the card just because i've had it for a while now and i know how to use it as easy charge it quick yeah yeah yeah all right well that's been the review we kind of decided nothing nobody changed your mind but it's up to you because we both have one already anyway so yeah gene all right thing that was flight crew review like review carter versus versus puffco um kingtree you already notified summer job in another episode", "gWPLnATICbQ": "hello rso sos here and i've gone all the way to butlands [Laughter] i wish i could smoke like this all the time all the [ __ ] time just smash through that [ __ ] ball and it granddaddy's going there now you what's up oh see this one this was the one that had granddaddies how [ __ ] is stone i am yeah [Music] i can't keep it it must take every day these these are glass tips these glasses they're cannons honestly he's a far boss
