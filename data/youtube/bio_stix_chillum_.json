this one i am excited i haven't seen anything like this in my dispensary and it's pretty much a chillum pre-packed with 0.3 this is some berry air it's only testing out at fifteen point four nine percent fifteen point six percent but it's looking pretty good i'm excited to bust this open go ahead and crack open this seal how are you guys doing today hope you guys are having a good day so we open up comes in this tube all right first thing i notice this comes off the sticker and there's weed all on it but uh all right [Music] let's go ahead and unscrew this i guess that's how you're supposed to do it all right i'm not getting really too much of a smell so let me know these guys are smoking on down below and uh go ahead and give this a taste test [Music] cheers [Music] okay it's pretty smooth i like how the smoke stays in there it's not just pouring out like it should or it usually does normal ones um and one thing i forgot to mention these are 0.3 and the chillms these retail at 10 so it's one of those price points to where it's like it's not that bad to throw out ten dollars if it doesn't work out you know but at the end you do get to chill them glass chill it's not super thick but it's definitely not you know china glass so that's good we'll go ahead and rip this again yeah i mean it it's smooth it doesn't have too much taste it almost has like a berry a fruity berry like almost like a wild berry type of how that berry very matter of fact it's almost more like a blue dream how has that blueberry [Music] i would say blueberry with the with the hint of hazy [Music] yeah it's not too bad you know if you're on the run you're having a walk you're on the drive anything like that i feel like it uh definitely can be a quick little smoke you know instead of getting a pre-rolled this or that is something that you can get very convenient easy quick and uh get the job done guys like this video go ahead and give it a thumbs up comment and if you like content go ahead and subscribe cause i'm always posting new videos thanks guys", "9jWso-r727E": "yo safe guys is toxic meat and today we're back movement of a kind of this review and it's not ordinary kind of this review so this one's going to be coming out in the week so what we've got here is the og Chilam we're trying to do this property they're hard for us like I said before it's got a few finger marks on it forgot to wipe it down before we start the video but we've took some pictures we've been looking up like where your children start from it would have been a plain Chilam it would have gone into like a conical shape a bit like a traffic cone shape and they would wrap a rag at the bottom and they would like cut hit in between the fingers and stuff like that sometimes you use a pebble or stone as the balls so it would get quite hot when the brac was there is like a thing to call it down basically it mainly was like it originated in like India I think it was don't hold me to it but they've made glass versions these and best versions because they're in like really nothing holding it in here so you've got a packet quite a lot to start off with just to give it that extra bit so it's not too too hot and just dump hot too much on it like it's not like a bong hit it's not like a pipe here you're just doing small little puffs no one again Isis packed what we've got in there is we've got some star dog mixed with some probably exclusive purple dog mixed with some chocolate local CBD hash if you haven't seen the review of that links gonna be in the description go check it out and then topped off with a bit more startup as you can see down through there hopefully well you going to see pictures anyway but this is pretty packed inside of here so this should last as a nice little little time we are going to struggle because we've got this we're going to try and like with this we've got a windproof lighter so hopefully it actually helps us like the Chilam a little easier so once we've got it lit we're going to light it like this for a stop once we've got it lit we are going to try and do a one-handed method hopefully it works be able to light the Chilam so first time trying to chill up so we're going to let you know exactly how it is so we've got our whimpering fire we've got a chillin right you might have packed it a little too tight now there we go when you give it up get to the end of it don't talk it as hard because when you get to there get much pop pop back and hit me in the throat so part my memory is for guys basically did do most of the video as you can see nice little bit white ashen now some of this gray is is the some of its not burnt properly we still got a bit too burnt but we was hitting the children properly but after that again obviously those all storage was filled up on our phone and we forgot to delete some old videos so just trying like this again that's that now that was the last hit but as you can see space with us the og chillin it's a really nice piece of kit so basically you're not meant to do it in a middle finger and the ring finger only meant to do an odd little finger and the ring finger that's the original wave but I just can't get used to that because broke my knuckles quite so so basically you could smoke it this way if you smoke it that way that way the original way you can use it I would say is like a bit of a doctor foot bongs so if you want to feel any side up you can fill it right up on this side and just a massive like yep so it fits in your downstem so if you've got a nice luck connection that fits on that fill that up you can have a nice long here if you really wanted to there's a couple different ways and stuff up to use it I'm feeling quite high this star though purple dog and the chocolate local partners kicked in really nicely it's really nice hit on it um it's not as harsh as I thought it was going to be some pipes have been a lot harsher so yeah but ot Chilam some nice like resin buildup in there as well nice resin builder you can see after a while of using this if you I'll call wash this you would get some nice reclaimed buck so there's a good little handy tool to smoke some material through and still get reclaim as well because it's glass is a lot more easier to clean and get you material but if you know how to anyways guys this has been a really nice one children ot chillin May she gets off one I got this one from my marital mystery box if you haven't checked that video up I think it's gonna be in the description got a load of different things there was like parsley stuff that was for the giveaway so then we basically put some of the stuff that we want inside and now we're reviewing some of things for you guys we've still got a pickle drip pipe another American pipe a bracelet pipe some bowling like material like rips left not wrapped up in cigar people blunt wrap so backward split bulbs we've got the og sweet ones in the on point so gonna be rolling with them and we got some hemp natural wrap I think it is but yeah I'm very slow at the moment that's just hit me about a hundred mile an hour really nice hip really mellow but strong but yeah

[Music] [Applause]", "aS8SJVRdQ0k": "Wow welcome back fellow youtubers fellow subscribers fill a medicator z-- fellow fellows I got a little stumble up there because I'm I'm real excited about this product um I don't I don't often oops I don't often do these kinds of reviews but I'm gonna start with a disclaimer this is a legal smoking product I will be using 100% legally organically grown hemp in this product this video is for anyone over the age of 21 if you're not 21 there's the door get to steppin the reason why I'm excited about this pocket seen anything like this this is like icing this and I had to get one um it's in here lots of bubble paper Nike knife bubble paper is crazy but this is this is made by a company called Jack the Ripper's scientific inhalations that's what it's called scientific inhalations and it's me by its called Jack the Ripper Jack the Ripper alright by scientific inhalations um i don't think there's any other kind of like website info or anything like that oh yeah there is so i'll make sure i post all that info and a little bit of like flavor text yeah so basically this is what it is so this end here when you put your mouth that's a little clip it comes off and then this mouthpiece here comes off and it leaves this empty could you imagine why it wouldn't want to be emptied anyone I'm fine anyone I know ideas you way in the back then no it's not saying you can stash your stuff in there okay Hume in the back here silly you don't put your shoe here you put it in here okay the reason why this is empty and hollow inside turn this whole back is because we're gonna fill this up but this anybody know what this is way in the back no you wrong what this is is coconut toasted like it's like a chuckle basically and this whoo sorry guys it's late here in PA this is organic cotton I'm gonna show you what we're gonna do with these so let's point this down here a little piece right here to fill this sucker up now I got this from Planet roll-your-own PPP plane it Ryo planet Ryo I don't know if you guys have that kind of thing in your area you know I don't think you do I don't think there will be I think there's any like two or three stores here and this is it there's like they're not anywhere else and uh a guy that I talked to a lot in there his name is Tony tony from Planet Ryo I'll leave the information for them as well in the description he was showing me this and I just couldn't help it's bizarre it's weird it's cool and I like it so I bought it so we got the charcoal in there like this this yeah palm now he said there should be enough in here for a couple fills and I do have some mother that's probably a little too much I do have some other coconut charcoal from a different type of product I got it's sort of like this product so let it be known that uh if I do need more charcoal I do have it somewhere and I'm sure the store that I got this from will end up carrying more charcoal because they carry these products so then it makes sense to me that they would alright so here we go says to fill in about 80% now it seems about eighty percent to me about you hmm many percent karna back yeah okay so now we're gonna take say half this me yeah no us gonna I guess stuffing with this righto ramming that they give you oh maybe that's a little too tight let's try more like this I've seen as far - it was so difficult hmm well we're learning together here folks let's try it like this there we go that seems a little better I think that very ah there we go there we go yeah I'll just take these little pieces here and put them in there yeah yeah there we go that seems pretty cool and then says you're supposed to after you get this done like this put the mouthpiece back on and put the clip back so tastes kind of like he's kind of like coconut it's really hard to draw I don't believe it should be that on a draw so maybe that's what this end here with the pokey puller is about you take this extra out of here I'm still pretty still pretty heartless to get it to draw maybe I'll fluff it up some maybe that'll help that's a little better a little better all right so let's give this a whirl guys so this is the nd pack obviously yeah yeah it's not a bit so let's get some flowers here with this one so comfy put this cotton back in this baggie I'm gonna rip this flower off like so okay so it's gonna pack this in here right guys got the little rx cross there which is pretty sweet that's pretty sweet I think it's pretty sweet goodness drive yeah Cheers I look at that cotton look from the first job that's pretty smooth I just really catching all the gunk that's pretty sweet look there's like no harshness no throat hit let's turn to gather like moisture though you see that why should you feel kind of guys kind of funky it's kind of funky well don't that whole thing round wow that's kind of dirty it's kind of funky looking cotton definitely looks like it's been smoked tear out this again oh my god it's kind of crazy can tell us hand-blown cuz look at the tip like it's kind of like a balloon abuse any obtuse it's not very flat okay just do the daily thing oh you know you can see that the continent really filtering it out which is really cool cuz that's that's like [ __ ] it is not going in my lungs [Laughter] why wouldn't I why would I want this in my lungs I mean hemp is organic but that doesn't mean it doesn't have [ __ ] they won't get you sooner or later poki stick is helpful okay so design all together it's pretty aesthetic you know you got your mouthpiece got your clip holds everything together you got your chamber and put your charcoal put your cotton you put your basis material in the glass bowl with the top I mean it's pretty simple it's pretty simple it's not like rocket science you know like watch science show the design on a scale one to five one being the worst five being the best I gave it a 4 I notice for now reason I don't really go any further than 4 at this point it's because two reasons one I do not like the way this is shaped I don't like the whole bit byte kind of I'm not into that round would have been pretty cool maybe inside out so that it could catch any resins or anything and the second is the ball piece is kind of cone-shaped I mean this kind of this kind of end here is more like what I'm looking at you know I mean I don't have been pretty cool to be like that like round dipped pretty cool um the design on here on the says Jack the Ripper kind of low leg thing can you see it I mean excuse me guys huh not really it would almost be more exciting to not put all the stuff in there you can just use it as a children maybe stuff your herbaceous material in there and smoke through it that might not be a bad idea I mean it could kind of resonate your Bisutti course for later but I don't know I mean maybe it'd be really hard to draw through or Vasudha goals that are packed in there who knows [Music] I'm not I'm not quite certain that this is a gonna become popular I mean maybe", "ed1bNpaNbNg": "I'd like to tell everybody tonight about a little item I found that the local dispensary and it's called Chilam oh gee it's a glass tube that's pinched a little bit and see pinched a little at one end then just continues out in a straight line to exit and what I discovered by hit-and-miss is if you take a filter that you can find these very commonly anywhere on the Internet this is the size I found and I'll take a little and cut it so that there's a cut it like maybe two-thirds through the diameter this is difficult I've never done this before and then you can shape it into a cone I'll try to do that and stay in focus maybe fold it a quarter of the way over and give it some disciplining pinches here and there doesn't have to be perfect and you can actually take this if you want and you can take a like the tip of a paintbrush I'm using and you can force this down into the notch and it fits well enough to stay there I don't and if you can see that it's forming a little cup a little Sybil's and what this does it allows a consumer to consume a very small amount of cannabis very quickly and usually with a very good effect I wanted to get to the back end of things and the diameter of this is such that you can take again a commonly obtained cigarette filter and you can insert the cigarette filter on the other side so you've got your cigarette filter there and I'll just turn this over and you've got a screen there as far as the type of metal and whatever arises from the keep that is given to the screen and the cannabis that that's kind of up to your own decision-making and comfort zone okay so there you have it and you can I'm sure everybody out there has got a better way of loading up here and I just wanted to show that this I've never done this before so I can't really get me in the picture here but I'm putting them you can just barely see putting the and so on and then you can pack it in again with I've got some you can see how little I kind of wanted to get everybody's attention to see how little actual cannabis that you you know pull it back that you're actually taking in you're that's that's not a really great amount I would roughly estimate it's about half of a conventional bowl but I'm not a really long time user so don't take that one too seriously okay and so you probably", "5VtO5QZKo58": "[Music] today we're going to show you about canister grinders and why it's good to spend the extra buck on a badass grinder but then we have semilla Delft we're gonna talk about ill adults and why it's good to spend the extra money and get some good quality but nothing like sobs badass water-pipe we're gonna get back to that one too I'm gonna tell you about the sob sob rigs with titanium nails we'll get back to all that stuff first I'd like to show you about the Switchback pipes that we have here on every five calm beautiful colors the blue the greens the oranges we have about 300 different colors and varieties on every five Calm first for my demonstration I have a 20 pound cinderblock that I'm going to lay right on top of this pipe right here just like that I'm gonna lay a 20 pound cinderblock and this set this right here is 60 pounds hovering aboard hovering right above this right here and I'm going to show you I'm going to place it down on top of it later on and show you you know different variations of weights that it can handle look at the colors on these pipes absolutely beautiful for this demo I'm going to take this 30 pound cinderblock and this is not made out of plastic this is some heavy [ __ ] right here and I'm gonna place it right on top of this just like that but that's not all because I'm going to take sixty pounds this is thirty right here thirty pounds I'm just gonna play see just like that just like that I don't have another cinderblock right here but each this one right here I'm gonna place this one", "Bwv68FUOcZE": "what if I done

just outside of Nani tall in India well we're all packed up [Music] I can cry mrs. place we are heading to another ashram that's located in the jungles just outside of Gwalior we've been staying in this jungle ashram for about a week with this Baba called sharm sunder das baba humps honored us baba is this guy that is liberated in the sense of like a Buddha he's a Buddha and he's been meditating in caves and he's been just doing this true spiritual work for the last like 30 years he's what we called the real deal [Music] in India they touched the feet of saints they pranaam bow down and they touch the feet of these people as sort of a recognition that they walked the path a recognition that this person is a reflection of our inner divinity a reflection of our divine potential touching their feet is a way to surrender [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] sona baba the guy with the long hair yeah every day he would try to give me a smoke with him today was special because we were heading to an ancient temple that is maybe another hour into the jungle we're like three hours into the jungle at this point when we arrived here the sona Baba asked me to drive with him I was like okay fine you know I'll leave my little my comfort zone of my group of friends and I'll Drive with this with this guy plus I was like I could get down with some hash right now I'm we're going to this ancient temple in the jungle maybe it'll enhance the experience it'll allow me to tune in to this to this moment more it was just us in this other guy and they whipped out this pipe and I was like okay yeah why not why not the power of why not well we were heading to this temple not only to just bathe in the beauty of this magnificent place in the middle of nowhere but the Baba wanted to give us spiritual names it's an honor and a real privilege to get a name from a saint or from a guru hike down this thing [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] it's nice this temple is built around this cave and this cave had a real deep tunnel into it and these Yogi's would go into the cave and they wouldn't come back out and so it developed this legend that this cave is the entrance into the underworld so nur Baba grabs my hand and he's like come on we're gonna go we're gonna go we're gonna climb and we climb to the top of this temple maybe it's seven stories or something like that we're gonna climb up this climb climb climb Jay okay guru Buddha guru better move without your mother Billy man I love the man Baba good not even good Nadi so I walk in and the first thing that happens is just a swarm of bats just start flying everywhere and I'm just like oh okay yeah of course of course there's bats [Music] oh yeah I put it oh come in look up for the bets oh yeah it's uh oh boy oh boy oh yeah [Music] do you dip it Nikita [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] hopefully calm [Music] every day I spent with the Baba he would say to me tomorrow I give you an an Indian name I give you a spiritual name tomorrow and then tomorrow would come and he goes your nam tomorrow tomorrow at one point I was joking with him I was like okay Baba my spiritual name is tomorrow but after we were exploring around climbed to the top of this temple and just you know got my adventure fix the Baba sat us all down there's a group of us here he sits us down he's sharing stories and he is just talking and randomly he looks at my friend Michael and he goes your name hottie das and then he looks at me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this is the data Guinness is the giver of all the cities even poverty son this is the data he gives all the cities he distributes [Music] so he gave me the name Ganesh Das Ganesh Ganesh like the elephant god Ganesh Dossett and he also gave me the name Kali das and he said you choose ganesh does Kali Joss and I think I'm not choosing Bob well this isn't my choice this isn't for me to choose I don't get to pick my spiritual name the whole this is you know and he's he's sat there for a second and he goes Ganesh is a good name Ganesh das is a good name okay Ganesh das it is but I want you to give me your favorite name of Ganesh because these gods have tons of different names like Krishna has Krishna Govinda Mohan Gopala there's a bunch of different names that represent the one so he gave me the name gudgeon none gudgeon none das gudgeon done means the one with the elephant head who holds the entire universe inside of him and das means like servant of servants of Ganesh Ganesh is the the remover of obstacles my mom is going through a rough time right now just going through a divorce she just lost her mom my grandma just passed away my grandpa is not doing so well and so my mom is in this sort of tidal wave of truth she's really experiencing reality the the grips that reality has on us you know we so much and so often live in this realm of illusion that were attached to this illusion of permanence that things are going to stay you know we link our moments up in a chain and don't realize that you know at any second this there is no chain we're not really connected to anything and any second anything can happen so naturally I was like mom what do you I'm gonna bring you home from India I'll get you a gift whatever you want and she goes oh you just bring me home a little Ganesh and I told the Baba this and he just looked at me and smiled and then at this point I'm just sitting with the Baba just me and him and a couple of other sad news and Indian people all the other everyone else is getting ready to leave and I'm just kind of sitting there you know maybe looking through the photos I take in and he goes my gudgeon and us you throw a party for because he gave me a name like I'm gonna throw a party now because I'm you know finally on the path or whatever reason you know and yeah Bob I'll throw a party sure I'll get home I throw a party he goes no no no we don't throw a party now and then all the Indians in the place just started cheering and clapping and it was a real it was really special it was really special time so we left the ancient temple and went back to the normal temple that the jungle Baba stays at shops under dusty is that and we just did this sort of routine of singing songs doing kirtan singing to Rama and Sita or Shiva or Krishna and we're just talking about philosophy what happens when we die is does the individual soul exist I asked all sorts of questions to him and I'll upload some more footage of me asking him questions and just other footage in general in a comming video but then he would just feed us we would just go eat food and then we would take a nap it was like a yogi daycare [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] and your name down [Music] that's not hygienic get out in the Sun falaqa origin the occasional appearance [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] so I hope you

on everybody so today i just wanted to be doing a really quick review i just got in the mail this afternoon the lock and load chillum here it's a very discreet tiny chilum uh you know basically made to take it with you to go it has a cap on there so you can just load up the bowl take it with you it's very discreet very tiny i just picked this up i ordered this from the grow shop.cz so big up to those guys for hooking me up and uh i got the bowl loaded already here today i'm gonna be just vaping or i should say smoking uh some cbd herb it's a seven percent from the brand zelena uh so they're a czech brand here this is where i get my cbd and i'll just give you a quick demonstration here i already got the bowl loaded so you just take off the top there you can see i got the bowl loaded i've already taken uh about two two bowls i've you know tried this out about two or three times so you can tell it's already getting dirty pretty quick but uh it hits like it hits pretty hard man it hits really really good let me see if i can get closer to the camera uh the chamber tends to fill up and get really milky let's see if i can show you [Music] here [Music] so there you go the lock and load chilling not a bad piece at all this came in for me at about 99 crowns which is about four bucks so if you're looking for something cheap easy discrete definitely check it out all alright see you next time peace", "DaA7YjfcAb0": "what's up people jabo ic1 gamer here and today I have a special something I know in some of my past segments I talked about you know finding pieces that are relatively cheap that are efficient and I haven't showed another piece in a while well today we have the og Chilam now I was looking these up online I got these down a muggles store down the street from here but they just got these end these are dope as [ __ ] it's a one-hitter got a packed up I'll show you what does dude this thing conserves usually get about ten eleven hits off of something like this so you got that oh gee or went on it works awesome but you can actually find these online just type in ojii-chan women's you can get them those it simply anywhere from 99 cents to five bucks now I'm not gonna lie spend five bucks online but like I said it was at the store so but you know if you got a 99 cent piece after shipping and everything it might come close to five bucks so yeah the thing actually fits it'll fit once in it too so we had once like this my brooch from yesterday so yeah go get this work ya know you give one say a different high but it's not real intense you kind of

won't get ashes in your mouth unless you guys try to power in it but these things are perfect very no grab-and-go pieces for those that like to be discreet these are very discreet so I highly recommend OG gems it's actually pretty decent glass like it's pretty big probably being flat bucks so I do have another piece I'm going to show tomorrow but yeah it's really cool actually it's another

"[Music] today I will be making what is called a one-hitter backhoe pipe slash cigarette holder it's going to be wouldn't that's what I'm making today here we go ready ready all right let's go [Music] [Music] [Music] so obviously I mean maybe it's not so obvious but I don't I don't really know what I'm doing and what I have done up to this point I think is pretty self-explanatory but so basically I got a branch and I cut a piece off and I thinned it out and I drilled a hole through it and then I and that's about as far as I've gotten here so then I started carving it down to like a thinner shape that I wanted it to be in and then I drilled a wider hole at the top you know where the cigarette would fit in or or whatever tobacco you put in it or whatever you know whatever and that's that's just how you make it I'm not great at explaining how to make things but that is how you make it yeah so enjoy the rest of the video I'm probably not gonna I might well you know just yeah that totally made sense all right I'll see you in a bit [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah so to put a finish on it I just used olive oil you can really use literally like pretty much any oil I vegetable oil will work fine or linseed oil is what I believe is usually used it just some sort of oil you can honestly probably use baby oil if you wanted to just just got to make sure you

"hNhlAV7NJOA": "[Music] good morning friends welcome to vlogmas day nine oh my gosh wait how many more do we have four i think there's four days left of vlogmas because we end up doing 13 of them but i'm gonna take a little hit with you and then i guess i probably need to go outside soon and start shoveling it snowed like all overnight so it's not like i don't know usually when it's no slot you can kind of keep up with it and like go out halfway through but since halfway through was like four in the morning it's just a foot of snow that needs to be shoveled now oh my gosh so my friend evelyn evil evelyn she's been in like content over the years but she got me at this like laser pointer thing for the cats and i've talked about this on probably more so live streams but like arya just when she wants attention she wants attention and she will mess she messes with lights a lot that's kind of what she does she'll mess with my little string lights that are back here and try and like pull them down and then another thing that she does is she like puts her front paws on top of my lamp in my front window and knocks it over when brendan's playing video games because she just wants someone to play with her even though we like we make sure we play with her a little bit every single day because she's a kitten she's a year old but she's a kitten and she has energy to get rid of but um so evelyn got this thing that's like a laser pointer but it's like electronic so you like set it up and it moves by itself on the floor even brennan said it we've never had a toy that's actually like successfully distracted them so much and it's only day two they could definitely get sick of it but even just he said it last night he was like yeah she would like get over it for a second but then i would turn it off and turn it back on and she just like absolutely loved it oh wait i showed a clip of this literally beginning of the videos you guys saw it um but yay successful i'm very happy where is oh i should do day four of the advent calendar while we're over here oh i got some sleepy eyes i opened up day three on stream last night and it was a bunch of cbd honey and some tea and then day four is ooh dab yes all right i definitely have to dab with you guys on the stream on stream well yes on stream and on the vlog i haven't been dabbing as much lately i don't know why maybe i'll use the terp pen just because it's so easy i just opened up this window so sansa can see the snow what's that oh not a fan of the wind don't blame you it's pretty cold oh she's like tucking from it i like this is on the inside this stuff like it was much further away than i thought oh my god she is so spooked right now okay i'm gonna go outside i'm probably gonna vlog on my phone because it is still snowing and i don't want to get my camera wet i don't know how much footage i'll be able to get out here because it's so windy but we were like stuck inside we had to like slam the door open because the snow like pushed us in i have another entrance if it like i brought my bong outside this nose actually it's got like like a crunchy top layer that makes sense oh my god i'm so happy i put leggings underneath my sweats because i'm still freezing but i would have been more freezing if i didn't i feel like it gets deeper as i get away from the house oh my goodness oh i'm gonna fall it's like so bright out okay i guess i'll do my snow bong and then i'll start shoveling i look so funny right now oh my god my hands okay i'm literally just gonna sit in the snow oh no i think i just got snow in my bowl oh uh not really all right where's my lighter oh this is so funny i'm sure my neighbors are watching me that's fine i guess okay cheers oh this is like frosty on the top now just took it so my mom and brendan are still outside and i feel so guilty but like i had to come inside because my back was just starting to like it like really really hurts right now and even my rib i had to like shovel right handedly because like my i have like a rib on the left side that's been messed up since competitive cheerleading in high school and i mean that's when i met my back i pulled my back up for the first time when i was 14 years old and even before that i remember pulling my neck out when i was in like seventh grade so what's that like 11 or 12. um and we had to like call the hospital because i was like paralyzed and stuck in my bed because i had pulled a muscle in my neck um and it ended up all being fine and everything but i'm just like a little old lady and i had to shovel like on the right side which was harder for me because it was hurting my rib but then like it hurt my back four in the right side and i just feel so guilty not shoveling when everyone else is out there shoveling but i already know even just the short time i was out there is like i'm going to be in pain tonight i'm like i'm in pain right now so that sucks but my dad's gonna be home soon and he has a snowblower my dad every like ever since i grew up he's just gone when it snows because he does plowing and um he we couldn't get the snowblower going i don't know it was weird it looks like the little rotator thing the spinner was trying to move but it wasn't moving but it looks like my mom was doing everything right so he's gonna come home soon i think like i said 30 minutes or so and then he'll be able to get that going and then finish up the driveway it really isn't like that that bad but like there's a foot of snow out there you know so yeah i feel guilty but i got my little snow bong so that's nice it got so dirty and rezzy i'm just one freaking hit so i think i am going to clean out the bong and then do another hit for an instagram post i'm just watching people walking down the street everyone's outside shoveling i wish my back didn't hurt i like don't mind shoveling it's a good workout you always like see your neighbors and like say what's up and stuff but yeah i'm i'm struggling right now i'm wearing this cute little hooded infinity scarf that my mom made me like five years ago i feel like it looks better when it's just hair whoa i forgot my hair was folded up into my hat i was like where the heck did that come from oh my god this cat keeps dropping her little string wanting me to play with her but she just i feel like i've said this before but she just doesn't know how to play she just grabs the string with her claw and then doesn't let it go and like that's the extent of our playing like that's it but she still she like drags it around the house and tries to get me and anyone else that's in this house holds to hold the string i am now just a string holder that's all i'm good for but look how cute this thing is isn't that adorable so nice my hair's freaking i'm just a mess right now but it's okay come here do you want to say hi to the vlog oh yes i love when i pick her up from her underarms she does like a little stretch actually this isn't going to last long but she's already trying to get on the counter oh you poor thing let me put you down i think she tries to just like dive out on my arms we are going to enjoy some of the dabs from my little advent calendar that little one that said indica and i'm gonna use the terp pen ah cool i love weed i think i'm gonna make some texas toast basically what i do is i have my little toaster oven on 4 25 now and i turn it up to 10 minutes to just like get it going get it all heated up while i'm doing this and then this is what i got from the grocery store and yeah just been having like one piece at a time and it's so delicious i'm sorry my face like this one is i just dropped it i have so many random snacks in my freezer right now i have toaster strudels in there that i bought a couple weeks ago and just haven't had yet all right let me put this in now do you ever just watch your own instagram story because same but my text is toast he's ready so excited follow me on instagram if you're not i'm silence tippy and i post to my story all the time we are making lunch i got chicken tenders fries and then i have these veggie fry things in there they're zucchini fries i think um i'm really excited to try those it kind of looks just like tempura zucchini if you can see in the bottom right over there but i'll show you when they're done it's like screaming at me i burnt them a little bit but i don't mind burnt things so they look delicious wow it's always the paint looks a little blotchy huh i guess when it's next to the the snow not really too bad i'm so mad at myself i didn't show you guys the beer that i just brought my dad but i came out here to just take a little video of the sunset it looks so pretty with all the snow but yeah i i i didn't even tell you guys i got like a bunch of beer sent to me by this company um i'll show you some of them when i go inside all right i'm gonna attempt this with my gloves on which may be a struggle we'll see but i have the little tart pen and then i have a little jar of dabs i should have grabbed the other one that had more dabs in it but this should work it's just hard to open you can't really see the sunset but that's okay not too bad success even when it's 24 degrees out all right let's get the cap back on there lid this is so difficult i feel like i have all thumbs whoa come on you can do it it's so nice out when you're like i think i was mentioning this in another vlog but like when you're dressed for the cold the cold air can just be so refreshing okay um i guess i have no other reason to be out here so i'm gonna go inside okay my fridge is pretty packed and messy but actually here let me take a second and get a bunch of them out to show you okay i don't know if this if i'm allowed to share my discount code for this service i guess i'll do some research maybe put it on screen if i can but this is a company that like legally ships alcohol to people um it's only in certain states where it is allowed because they have like a license to be able to ship alcohol but it is a thing that supports independent breweries and has all different types of beer you get like a little variety pack like this one is a tropical fruit sour that has pink guava pineapple and passion fruit in it and then there's like an allagash one i've heard of that before vienna lager oh this one i might try on stream tonight it's concord grape fruit tart one of my friends actually rachel cross she has done a couple photo shoots with me in the past like four months and yeah she really recommended this brewery and then i got two different types of hard cider from this place excuse me get out of my fridge and then i'll quickly show you the rest this one is like a coffee vanilla cream ale mango milkshake uh american sour ale smoothie mango coconut banana bourbon barrel peach cider coconut cream pie um the unthinkable whoa and then another one of those ciders so i'll definitely be like sharing a bunch of these because i'm not a huge drinker but some of them i want to try out for sure but okay i'm gonna put these mine close my fridge now all right i did my makeup and then i also cleaned the little grav labs bong and then i uh just rinsed this one out it is kind of like i don't know if you can see it but it's gross on the sides because of the snow it's like kind of disgusting i actually might want to rinse this one out if i'm going to do it on stream i just noticed that right now let me see if i can show you guys oh yeah you can see it now but yeah that's just because of the snow and all like the resin that sticks to it and then stays on the side of the glass okay i'm gonna go clean this really quickly and then i'm gonna go live oh live um ma'am why are you crying oh my goodness wow [Laughter] i love you so much guys i'm drinking a beer for the first time and i don't know how long but it's urban artifact which is out of ohio and this is called concord grape midwest fruit tart and where is it 8.2 alcohol and has like a cool little almost looks like an ornament on the back drink fresh all right people wanted to say hello they were saying hello already even though i wasn't showing you guys the chat so i had to come over and yeah here they are we have 460 people in the chat right now that's crazy thank you guys so much for joining i love people redeeming their highlighted messages for a better chance to catch it when you're watching the vlog woohoo okay we're gonna oh wait we have to smoke the snow bong with the vlog they got a clip of me smoking outside in the snow earlier but we just it was so funny actually um zoom out oh i zoomed in so we have snow in the bong over here but i actually had the camera like facing outwards then i had a second camera that was facing onto my deck and uh everyone got to watch me outside packing the bong because my window wouldn't open the screen was like frozen so that i couldn't unlock it someone just subbed huh nikki just resubbed for 29 months okay let's have our bong rip snow bong cheers i opened up the window and she immediately hopped up in here i was gonna smoke my bong here but i guess i won't because i don't wanna i literally just put that under her belly oh and here's sansa too i've just pretty much been relaxing since i streamed hanging out with the cats watching youtube videos i'm actually not streaming tomorrow oh my god i literally have cat butt in my face um but tomorrow is going to be a big shop day i have a bunch of orders that i'm going to get packed up and sent out and yeah it'll be nice to just kind of take a night off of streaming i'm kind of happy that i ended up streaming um yes yeah yesterday instead of tomorrow because like i said i have a bunch of orders to ship out tomorrow i'll be editing this vlog tomorrow and then my boyfriend brendan also plays video games with his buddies on friday nights around like eight o'clock so it'll just be nice to know that like once i'm off the computer i'm off for the day and yeah i know that he looks forward to that so i'm always more than happy to just kind of like not even i mean kind of adjust my schedule so that he can hang out with them what are you doing the cat was just like freaking out it is so quiet and calm out i know they say that um snow actually absorbs sound so it's kind of nice having the window open and not really hearing too much a car just drove by but even that i feel like it's not as loud as it normally is but all right i guess we're gonna move somewhere else and then i'll come back to get my little incenses moving but i'll come back to get my little bit of fresh air before bed i also need to take my makeup off thank you guys so much for watching this vlog i hope you enjoyed seeing

for humanity uh just as you know for the person that he was big hurt kind soul and uh yeah he he did a lot of work for us um from starting pot tv many years ago and being one of the originals to put out videos about cannabis to the seas that he provided to us all to grow back in the day when uh they were extremely hard to get um yeah i'm gonna keep this kind of short there but uh definitely gotta

big-ass mattress and that thing that bikes 50 to 80 bucks but i just don't know why they put it up there maybe they didn't want people to see it um when they had their door up in here maybe it's stolen and they you know if they had the door open you couldn't be able to see it if you stand back you really can't see it too much i don't know it just blows my mind there's a frame piece of art right here it's so hard to uh film with one hand and i don't really feel like wearing a gopro chest mount or nothing so you guys are gonna have to bear with me i'm gonna attempt to put most of the storage unit in the bed of my truck and then i'm gonna try to start on the other room today also because that room's big and it's gonna probably be two or three trips so i need to save on gas i've came out here so many times already because i bought three rooms out here plus today i bought the storage unit so every time i come out here is 50 bucks in fuel so i'm already out another 200 in gas just on picking these units up so you gotta remember that all right guys if i find anything interesting while just loading this stuff up i'll film it i'll turn the camera back on hey guys check this out i moved uh a couple totes that were sitting in the front right here and look what i found a safe which doesn't mean much i've found so many safes in my life and 99.99 of them are empty or they're filled with paperwork [Music] let's roll this thing around see if it makes noise sometimes you can hear stuff inside of him i'm just going to stand it up on its side and see if we can hear anything move let me get my hand under there all right you ready so it sounds empty it's probably empty but you never know i'll still bust it open you never know guys yeah it sounds empty there's nothing in there this all right guys i've already showed you guys this room before in another video but i'm just here trying to start emptying it i'm just trying to see what i'm in for here there is a lot of trash in here all this furniture to the dump table to the dump a mattress to the dump i'll keep these stereo system there's a kitchen vanity right there looks pretty clean this dresser is huge this refrigerator refrigerator's in horrible condition look at the inside of this thing i doubt it if it even works it looks like someone was just hanging out in here you guys you know having some beers and some champagne i don't know there's some cable i wish it was copper it's just cable for to run cable video i took this stuff back out to make more room right here so i'm gonna start packing it in here guys i don't feel like being here all day so i'm gonna start on this i've got a lot of work ahead of me i don't know guys i don't like this unit it just seems like everything's just beat to hell there's really nothing in here if you i mean it's washing machines in good condition stereo whatever this stuff back here is all trash everything's beat up i mean the refrigerator's pretty much trash i mean who's gonna buy that the stools trash the shelf it wasn't so modified it'd be sellable but that's trash this cabinet's trash i regret this one man i regret this one just the back corner is a whole load of the dump i mean i only paid like 100 something bucks but i'd rather be out buying rooms full of boxes you know not this junk i stacked the trailer wrong so i kind of screwed myself i could have fit a little bit more stuff in the center of the trailer like this thing and uh some other stuff but uh i'm over it i'm pretty much done there's roaches in the cabinets [Music] look at that dead roaches i'm over it i'm done what else is back here i'm pretty much just going to take the whole room to the dump now i'm just over it i'll take a couple things out of here i'm not sure if this cherry picker is complete this dolly's complete these dollies are worthless you guys ever buy a dolly never buy a dolly with inflatable wheels they're garbage throw them away and buy one with solid tires number one rule when buying dolly down look at this you can't even use that thing they're worthless they're not even worth anything i can't stand those dollies so i was doing really well there for a while i was buying some good rooms and i hit this one there's a flat screen i'll get uh 50 bucks for it so you know i'll probably make a tiny bit on this room but i have to remember i'm in this room four trips of 50 each 200 in fuel for these three rooms you have to add to the amount that i paid for all these so i might break even at the at the end of the day this is my dolly so costco solid rubber tires so the best dollies man i'm gonna probably just throw that away too and i'm just gonna throw this away look at the bottom peeling see the bottom peeling right there ain't no i'm gonna buy that like that i mean it's a good looking dresser but with roaches in it and i'm over it i'm done and look at this heap of junk i'm done i'm done this whole room's trash it's over i'm over it here you go here you guys go this is from the first unit that had the bicycles in it that tells you what happened to this guy you mess with this stuff and you pretty much uh lose everything in life it's crazy all right guys i just emptied the trailer from yesterday believe that glass next i'm gonna go to the dump out there and uh here's just some of the trash pile real quick i gotta finish that room today so i can't film too much today this is just one of the dump piles from the last four rooms i've already gone to the dump i think once or twice already but i'll film again once i arrive see ya all right guys i'm gonna finish this room today think about i might save this thing maybe take to the flea market 20 bucks for it or something there's another one back here right there someone just start pulling the stuff out taking to the dump right now i have to finish this room today like there's no no excuses it's got to be done so i'm gonna get to work and i'll start filming again here in a minute all right guys the last two storage units i bought i have found crack pipes in them so that tells you what happens with your life when you start doing this crap i just found this right now in that dresser drawer and then the last unit i bought it's on the film you'll see it on the same video i found one of these in a little box it's crap man  ruined your life all right guys look how long these tables are they're trash though i don't keep stuff like this these tables you can use them for events and flea markets and parties but they're probably no exaggeration 60 to 70 pounds each there's three of them there so they're going straight to the dump no one uses them no more they use plastic the plastic ones weigh about 10 pounds i got a little space right here i'm gonna put those tables if they fit those tables look really long so better double check all right guys everything's rolling along pretty much i'm putting everything on the right side that i'm going to keep i'm not sure if i'm going to keep this dress or not it looks like trash i don't know it's not going to fit anyway so i'd have to do it on round two if there is a round two i might just take all the stuff straight home and deal with it there but i need to go find a dump out here in the coachella valley cathedral city area all right guys i want to show you something i found this was in here uh the other day i think that i took a little video of him i don't really remember but i'm pretty sure this goes on there i found this in the back of the unit just laying there it's like a copper top with copper bronze or brass probably copper the rest of this is just a like an aluminum or a different metal it's a pretty cool bird bath it's probably the coolest thing i found in here these tables won't fit they're too long so uh i threw this vanity in there in this box and some other stuff this dresser would probably sell 20 30 bucks it's real wood i don't know i'm just gonna trash it all right guys i think i got everything loaded in the trailer that needs to go to the dump i'm gonna throw all this stuff back in the room look at the trailer that stuff doesn't fit but uh what i do is i just lift this door and it sandwiches it in there it's pretty cool i'm gonna throw this stuff all back in i'm gonna go to the dump well actually i'm gonna throw these speakers away they're both but there's trash they're all beat up and i ain't messing with it out of sight out of mind out of sight out of mind guys you know we're gonna buy those look at those things even though their bows look like they roll down a cliff trash all right guys i'm going to go to the dump and come back and load all this stuff and just go home i just looked on gps uh dumps about seven miles from here this thing i don't know this cherry picker looks like it's missing all kinds of parts and pieces and looks like might be scrap metal maybe a 20 piece at the swap meet i don't know all right guys got that done go back and finish the room all right guys for those of you who have never seen this area this is a cathedral city it's uh in southern california it's right off the ten freeway going towards arizona from california these these windmills are everywhere out here and another thing for for those of you wondering how much this unit cost me to dump right now it was 42 dollars and i still have more at home probably another 30 or 40 dollar load so uh keep that in mind when you guys buy these this guy just waved to me i don't know why when you guys buy these storage units full of trash i mean it's very very um costly when you're going to the landfill there's going to be probably a hundred dollars in dunphys in this all right guys i'm back here i'll load this up and i'm gone going home i'm so happy for this to finally be over i was so mad at myself for buying the storage unit i want to show you guys something look how nice of a day it is no smog beautiful mountain scenery it's just amazing and how quiet it is one good thing about living in america most areas have the cleanest air and sceneries like this man amazing hey guys check out this mountain bike now that i look at everything's really clean even though it's a cheap bike i mean the thing appears to be almost new it's just the tires are uh flat from being in storage and i was looking at this little kids bike check this out they got the forks mounted backwards look at that they need to spin the forks around i could probably do if i didn't have uh the camera in my hand but uh almost done guys look just these two items and this and uh i'm done i just talked to a local out here he said those mountains are called the san jacinto mountains so now we know there's actually a tram somewhere out here that goes to the top of one of these mountain ranges out here i think it's called the palm springs [Music] tram all right guys this video is over adios until next time i'm sure sure i'll be within a couple days today's monday i'm gonna go home and sort all this stuff out i'm gonna go sell wednesday hopefully just make some of my money back or most of it or all of it and continue on i'm sure i'll do it pretty good i've been buying a lot of storage units lately all right guys later", "ejlAPe8PLco": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys and welcome to today's vlog and it's a brand new vlog and I am coming at you on this

don't my my nails carbs so these are the peppermint meringues the many ones from Trader Joe's and I got like six tubs of them around Christmas time I'm out of my last tub so I'm really really sad I'm either didn't try and make my own or just get the vanilla ones but the vanilla ones are huge like three times one of these so anyways I have three of these before every lift lately I just like a nice way of getting into the next release sugar carbs so anyways I'm going to have I have a speed session who I might arise okay so I have a speed session with bands bench press and stuff all that fun stuff today so you'll see that in the clip coming up next my pre-workout I have redcon we have total war and this flavor by the way is really good it's the tangerine and then I mixed that with big noise so for a nice little pump we've got this one is the Tigers blood and I've noticed what the big noise let me know if you guys have tried this - it sounds like an earthy taste to it so I'm sort of like earthiness like spinach dirt like I don't know it's not bad but it's like it's different I don't really know what that is so I haven't really studied the nutrition label quite yet so let me know if you guys have had the extreme experience so I'm gonna have that and then I have my EAS that I'm gonna drink in my 75 ounces of water during my workout I try and get in my full 75 ounces so there's that and oh the big thing I'm on call today so I'm gonna take you guys with me as a mom calls a flat's hit it I'm on call from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. I have been number one since yesterday alright like 4:30 p.m. when our beds are in for a three day trip so I'm still hanging in there as number one I think people are going aggressive for trips we have like no reserves so they red-flag paying which means they get paid time and a half if you are a line holder which I'm going to reserve this month I'm not a line holder so there's that I'm just waiting for my fate to call me any second so I'm gonna hit to the gym headed to the gym and I'll see you guys there does the beat take you although you just country do you feel your bones start to change do you feel the earthquake do you feel your bones start to shake do you feel it was a candy [Music] [Music] till you see spot [Music] [Applause] [Music] what is this I don't know if you guys going to do this but it is snowing definitely probably can't see it yeah with a black car what the heck alright so update just finished my workout as you guys saw I'd filmed at least one set of the entire workout I do have a trip I got it on my line like on the way to the gym I actually I mean realize where I was going so I did some research and I'm going to Mexico tonight I have a like 15 hour layover in Guadalajara Mexico I've never been there I am a little concerned because I don't think we can bring any food and that's the start of my 3-day trip I get back late Monday night so don't really know what I'm gonna do in regards of food that's great yeah so then anyways tomorrow it's super easy though I deadhead to Dallas so I sit like a passenger and then we just fly to Pittsburgh and then I wear like 16 hour layer in Pittsburgh downtown so Monday is a

dry farmed sunshine Johnson yeah so did the rebel moon for this and then Craig from Alpine glow did the THC bomb these are both regenerative farms which for me and my data topped yield and THC and cannabinoid content so it's a huge proof that you don't need inputs you don't need chemicals and if you just work with nature you can produce the most fire no sorry no commercial synthetic inverts sunshine she is in a very specific place where she can do dry farming it's not the right farming that define quality no she's she's into in osmosis with the place where she is going and she's using that ability to limit totally the water input so that the plants have to kick into a defensive system and produce a lot of regime to protect from dehydration basically third this is the fourth year we're doing on the same exact spot but also to make people kind of understand so it's a flood zone that place floods every 50 years it's under water it's also right in between the Avenue of the Giants which are some of the biggest plants and the biggest respiratory they're breathing all the time and they're blowing they're blowing so much moisture throughout that valley in the morning that yes they're doing your watering for you so it's not like people say oh how can you grow plants without water it's not without what's underneath the ground yes so when you say what's average used for cannabis you're really talking through your head because there's no average juice from that no it all depends depends on the long so she's got redwood air where I grow I have Doug Fir air right Doug for an oak air and so I think that makes a difference so you're gonna I love cold air pilot they're called una caja like Hara Hara Mahadeva Bamboula butene yeah that was the first time it's spirit you have so and this is a brand new chill I'm right down blessings on the children so here we go Thank You Frenchie Wow was a big deal in India because when you did they catch the Chilam to the to the God there is a lot of awareness that comes of what you do like that the panel last night we're talking about making the tea in India when you smoke it's a big deal normally the Chilam always goes right and you pass with you right and you only take with your right hand my friend she had her honor to me passed it this way and then you have to say Kali Chilam which is the feminine energy going to the left side but it's it was all unsaid but he I realized he did it and I realized why he did it to look at that stone children from Funko I don't know the whole lineage of the children thing it was there a Lorenzo - or not know who is that that first guy was Renzo Renzo guy and and does everyone still have a Renzo children no mine was where he was funny because I took only the first year I was in the mountain we were lucky to meet a good friend of my best friend that that spent some time in Colombia thanks guys where we the guy had been 15 years in a mountain and he was buying all the best of the best in toshin act on so for three weeks I saw a lot of ash come in front of my nose and the lesson I took for me you want jungle ocean acting you won't achieve ated Milana so the second year I stand my best friend to get some field as far away from the village as possible in in Milano Valley and and I want to do the jungle in touch and acting for three weeks alone when I came down I'd still night in - in Puglia with an Italian house and that Italian dude was burning chillin was burning chillin in in oven and in the morning and I didn't really understand how special it was to share my own jungle I didn't get his I didn't understand the value people put into the chilly quality of your children and the quality of your regime that defines the respect that you receive so because I cooked up my year jungle all night long with him in the morning if I can give me a Chilam but I didn't know that dude so when arriving Manny Calum and I walk my children with a bunch of Italians they look at me like I had [ __ ] stole the kiss because that guy literally chants totally what Chilam was in India I may you see a different type of clay you see different this is a very important part of any Chilam smoking you want to clean it right because that's another thing they look at your children they pull up the children's this Chilam clean is this dude clean right isn't that right it's part of the ritual and so and also you look out I'll find the polishes inside the children it doesn't to be like a mirror but it's porous so it's going to absorb a lot of the tar from it no it's all clear it's all clear over and over and two three four different type of clay yeah it absorb yeah you want that absorption but see this is the high art this is the high art of chillin making you see because you can get these little throwaway chillings all over the place that are little tiny one to one or two people chill them so that's true that sort of status I suppose it's all about don't give you that to smoke when they look at your ash they don't know you you need maybe it's like when you don't understand that the world respects that you receive it the Chilam you have in your on and the quality of the resin you put in even 15-20 years old people in in India if you have the goods they're going to give you respect doesn't matter how long you've been in India if you don't have it they don't even give you the time of the day I swear it's not very nice actually they are not really welcoming well it's the caste system yeah yeah you got it you got to earn your credits no question about it but how hardcore is it to go up into the mountains like I've got lost there before it's like leaving the cave for months two days walk the closest bus it's today's walk explain and you have to bring all your [ __ ] and it's you have to be crazy crazy crazy about raising quality to put yourselves with that type of [ __ ] then it's at the at before the winter if you get stuck in mulana with the snow and there is one pass at 12,000 feet when you have that pass and you have like a snow up to your your tight and shitty basket or old and plastic bag to stay you know I mean it's your you can kill yourself you have to be now that I think of it with such stepping back so far with like I was insane to do [ __ ] like that but it's the best time in my life in Nepal and I went from pokhara to kathmandu and i had to walk about 2/3 of the way just making the road and at one point is like barefoot you're walking along this thing and you're just out of the village and no one speaks English they were moving from me to take her like the chance my visa I was going to change my sermons visa I was supposed to face shortywood here they wanted see Susan would be I am gonna come back to go now the first time first time I went to Nepal I believe was 70 70 we I was working on a movie called Sun seed and we were filming various teachers around so we went in filmed at the swabue we filmed the rinpoche at swayambhu with the long trumpets like that whoo and they're doing a snapping thing and they're chanting this an amazing chanting and pouring tea it's up on top of the hill there and then I went back a year later but I went over land from from Amsterdam right all the way up to Nepal again and then I had a house in back of swayambhu and I stayed there for about three months there and every day around the temple you know around the hill swayambhu hill right yeah I wasn't really into the hash at the point it was just there I wasn't like you I wasn't seeking out that most rare extreme place I was there just to be sitting in painting and being meditating", "w-pW51LPYkM": "you", "Wl6QNjiD2Lg": "hey y'all trevor here with write of the leaf and today i've got a new lp out here in alberta we've got some simply bear organic we're tapping into some of their bc organic sour cookies i'm really excited and really looking forward to tapping into this you guys know i'm a big fan of the girl scout cookie lineage strange this is gonna be one of them let's tap into it you guys okay welcome back y'all so we've got the bc organic sour cookies from simply bear so this sucker came in with a thc total of 21.6 a cbd total of 0.9 or 0.9 sorry and it was packaged just a day over a month ago on june 23rd 2020 so this bud is fresh you guys it is definitely one of the freshest buds i've tapped into on this review and i'm really really excited to get into it so we've got the simply bear website pulled up for the information uh we're gonna run off what we have here for sour cookies and then we're gonna get into this review you guys i'm really really looking forward to trying this butt out so the sour cookies is a fvopa organic certified sativa dominant high potency cultivar deliver derived from the well-loved girl scout cookies and sour diesel lineages with beautifully bright purple leaves glistening with her crystal trichomes her doughy yet sugary aroma is both sweet and sour growing in living soil hang dried for 14 days packaged in a recyclable glass jar and it is sealed for freshness y'all that is all the info they have right there let's see so this sucker is going to range between 18 to 24 thc that is awesome i'm really really looking forward to tapping into this you guys but that is all the information that simply bear does give us so let's not wait anymore let's get on over into the urban scale and actually start taking a look and trying this butt out you guys see over there [Music] okay guys so we've got the seal right there we're gonna crack that and check out this sour cookies from simply bear we got sealed for your protection nope we're gonna get rid of that and tap into this you guys so let's try it out oh you do get quite a potent aroma coming off of there it's got a touch of that kind of sweet and sour flavor that they were talking about this is the eighth though it does came in a nice bundle of nugs let's pull this one out i can see the little hues of kind of that purple darker color i do get a little sweeter smelling bud but nothing overwhelming you guys it's definitely not um the strongest smelling bud that i've had it's got a really kind of sweet woody smell to it and the best way i could describe it is when i'm like doing woodworking and i'm cutting a really nice fresh cut wood kind of smell where it's almost sweet to it that's really the predominant smell i'm getting through this one right now i do get that really sweet flavor in there too has me interested the buds are still really moist there's not a lot of moisture sucking coming out of glass jars which helps hold these buds uh moisture value and just their quality a little bit longer i'm gonna give this one an eight out of a ten for the looking aroma here i'll let you guys take a quick look while i'm running this off so it's gonna get an eight out of a ten come on nope you're not gonna focus for me there you go eight out of ten for the look and aroma and it's because it's got some interesting pulls to it some interesting notes but i'm not super excited about it at the same time like i'm very much looking forward to trying it out but i don't think i'm like i'm not over the moon excited to try it out you guys so let's bus it up see how it uh is once we have it busted up and uh yeah i'll be on the other side of this uh this joint rolling side of the review you guys when i actually tap it into it with the vaporizer and through the rigs i'll see you guys on the other side hey y'all so i've got it packed up in the vaporizer here the balance vaporizer we're going to get that sucker turned on and running at 175 degrees we're going to start it out at the 175 so we get a very sweet and light lemonade flavor through there and definitely more of the terps on the lower side of the range and then we'll bump it up to the 205 after that where we're gonna get more of the mid-range terpenes and a little bit more of the thc content and then after that we crank it to 220 which is going to give you your highest amount of thc content and the strongest terpene flavors especially that beta core carefully likes to sit around that 220 where you get a little bit more of that spicy woody flavor so we've got the 175 set up let's try out the simply bear organic sour cookies y'all see on the other side really light really mild kind of citrus flavor to it not a whole bunch of power coming from this but it's really light and really sweet at the same time and i'm enjoying it quite a bit puppy's communicating downstairs on recording this but um yeah it's nice light flavor not really anything overwhelming but it's something that i actually enjoy and if we get a stronger part of that flavor as we go through this review um i'm gonna be really excited and really enjoying it you guys so we've got it set to the 205 let's try it out here and see if we get a stronger flavor or a little bit of a different flavor cheers it's kind of going into that woody touch there's a little bit of that diesel flavor in there now too but nothing overwhelming it's nice and light really smooth to pull on again not that overwhelming flavor let's try it one more time see if we keep getting that kind of light diesely flavor and if we do we'll move on to the 220 you guys yeah that nice light diesel flavor that is it bad it's just not top of my list for enjoyment um we've got the 220 ready let's tap into it here and see how it does at this level you guys so you got more the pepper just a really nice and light pepper flavor it does have a hint of that sweet coming back into it now at the end but uh it's really light and enjoyable flavor really more of a hint at kind of flavor than one that sits on your tongue and you know right away that's what you're tasting it's enjoyable it's got it's got something to it that's really really enjoyable you guys it's not too bad i'm going to give it a 7 out of 10 just because it's not anything that really excites me and really gets me looking forward to smoking through the vaporizer but it's got enough enjoyment there that i'm like nah it's me so 7 out of 10 is the best i'm going to give it today you guys now it's time to slide into the glass and start smoking through here i love smoking through my bongs we're going to start out with the nice guys glass and the way we smoke through our rigs is we do it with three different sizes we've got the nice guy glass here we've got the kush rig and then we've got the cyclone tower we're going to finish this sucker off with and what we're going to do is we're going to take these rips with three different forms of ignition as well so we've got the hemp wick we'll go with a straight clipper lighter as well and then we finish it up typically with either a torch lighter or pickle rick mini torch and this just ignites the butt at a little bit of a different temperature gives us a little bit of a different experience when we're smoking this bud through all three of the bongs now that i'm letting it sit here it's got almost kind of that frosted flake kind of sugary taste to it and um we're gonna we're gonna bump that taste from a vape up to an eight you guys whoo letting it sit there on my tongue develop some tasty flavors an eight out of ten for the taste from a vape not a seven let's bump that [ __ ] up before we bump into the bongs let's uh light up this excessively long string of hemp wick pulled out of the 100-yarder so you know we got lots for lots of reviews let's tap into this you guys first rip see you guys on the other side we're having fun with it today [Music] okay let's get into the second rip y'all clip ladder bongs ready let's do it okay guys we got the cyclone tower here get the jet lighter let's get into this i'll stand up and give you a little better view of the function of this beautiful rig cheers okay that one didn't work let's try that there we go let's try it again cheers okay guys so i'm gonna give the taste from a bong an 8 out of a 10. it was relatively enjoyable through all three rigs it definitely had that diesel punch it was 100 a sour sour diesel strain it definitely didn't have as many of the citrus kind of notes that i like to enjoy with my diesel strains that kind of a diesel but this one had a lot more of the earthy tones to it more woody tone and it was enjoyable it had something unique to offer but it wasn't interesting enough to really grab my attention and pull it more in and it was more subtle than i would have honestly expected and i'm a tiny bit disappointed there but still it's a really nice bud to smoke through the bongs not really harsh um when you stack it you definitely get the cough but it's not a bad dry weed cough it's just a good good good heavy hoot kind of a cough so i'm i'm really enjoying smoking my way through uh through the rigs there and i'm definitely excited to smoke some more of this through the glass but we're gonna move on into the straight glass pipe you guys we got the straight pipe from crave here we're going to light up the hemp wick i'm going to light this sucker up and you guys will get to hear the start of the review while i'm smoking my way through it i uh i'm interested to see what kind of flavors are gonna push through the pipe today guys but let's tap into it and i'll see you guys on the other side eight it's a soft eight but it's an eight for sure let's slide in you guys so it's getting an eight strictly because it has again that really nice this one leaning more on the woody side than the diesel side definitely's got a little bit more of that cookies flavor but it's shoot more down the middle than i would like i would like you to get a little bit more into that girl scout cookies kind of rich earthy flavor or into that more diesel flavor because it's a little bit stronger than the bongs and he's getting that point where i can really sit here and enjoy the flavor afterwards but it's not enough to really bump it up the score anymore like this but the one thing i can say about this butt is it's been very consistent like it's got that enjoyment level like [ __ ] yeah i could smoke that or yeah it's pretty good but i'd smoke it again but it's not blowing me out of the water for certain things but the consistency is making it a really nice bud to enjoy and i tend to like the buds that do just well across the board a lot more than the ones that have one thing that i really like um i don't know why that is but i just i do um we're gonna move on to the joint night guys i rolled it up with the vibes blue papers you know that's the uh that's my typical role i love smoking out of the vibes blue we got it rolled up here let you take a little look say oh dropped a little bit of bud there let's not do that again let's take it through a couple dry holes see what we're getting ourselves into today you guys cheers this is gonna sound weird but it's kind of a fishy frosted flakes mix like i've i've smoked a black tuna in the past and that had a very fishy kind of touch to it this very similar very similar kind of fishy and i don't i don't know what i can put point my finger to but it just like it's not a bad fishy like i it's the kind of fishy smell you have like when we go out on the lake and we're fishing and that kind of fresh fish smell so it's a smell that i personally really enjoy and it's more of like um like a fawn memory kind of smell and aroma that just brings me back times like that and it's really something if i smell i'm like whoo or i taste like because if the straw the smell is really strong sometimes you can taste it that's what like out on the lake that's what it's like some days but uh we're just gonna get smoking this you guys i'm i'm having fun memories and smoking a joint not a bad day see on the other side let's tap into this one cheers there okay guys it's got some nice white ash burning on it and i'm uh i'm still not sure what i'm going to rate this i'm just going to kind of talk my way through it and uh i'm sure the rating will come it's out comes out [ __ ] my tongue's not starting to work the high it's gonna be up there you guys i'm thinking so i'm getting kind of that girl scout cookie flavor so i know this one's seven plus easily seven it's honestly it's gonna be an eight plus so eight plus are there any downsides to it the flavor does pass relatively quickly it is a nice change and kind of transition from the girl scout cookies to a touch of diesel it's not relatively sour per se but more kind of i think tart might even be the best way to describe it it's it's not bad whatsoever but how quickly it transitions into a little bit of a milder taste has me a little bit disappointed i am starting to get a good little burn in the back of my throat from the pepper spice so yeah with the combination of that nice little throat burn and the uh spice on the tongue this this bud is doing quite well and then a 9 out of 10 is definitely worth it it is probably the best way i've i've enjoyed this this bud yet so we're going to move on down to the high it's going to end up getting a 9 out of 10 for the high it's got a really nice strong um mental high it's got a a good mental drift to it but you can focus your way through it if you really wanted to it'd be good for video games oh that the puppy is just not having a good day making lots of noise but it's got a really interesting and kind of unique body high to it where i'm finding its wavy and the relaxation to where it helps and then it's not there then it helps and then it's not there for like body ease and relaxation and that's a disappointment for me but it's not a complete turn off like 9 out of a 10 i think is the best she's gonna do so i'm going to finish up this joint tally up our overall you guys and i'll see you guys at the end when we're smoking the last bowl cheers hey yes so last pull off this joint now we're moving on to the bound and uh got a 50 out of 60 you guys it's really good score did really well i was quite pleased with how nice the flavor was through this through this bud from start to finish and the high is really nice and enjoyable i'm do feeling i am feeling a little bit of a headache coming in um but it's not that bad so honestly i'm i'm enjoying it and the 9 out of 10 for the high is pretty solid with the taste from a joint following up with being the only other nine it um was just the most enjoyable way i could uh could smoke this bud and we smoked our way through it and it was really really nice all the way to the end didn't get anything overwhelming it just got a little bit more towards that sour diesel and was really enjoyable there and it had a little bit of that kind of beta carefully that spicy peppery taste burn in the back your throat and uh i enjoyed it that quite a bit but we're uh we're gonna wrap this one up you guys i hope you enjoyed um let me know if you guys have discovered any new lp's

one", "X0xrqAOKjeU": "buddy we are back one of the review and today I got this silicon glass Chellam to share with you so without further ado let's hop right into this review so I was checking out some chillings of some overseas sellers that were offering some new products and this was one of the ones I was checking out I liked the fact that it was glass which was one of the things that I guess attracted me most about it I like smoking out of glass products and not using aluminum or any of the other smoking products that usually come from overseas but this one looked good and I think what the number one thing that really grabbed me was the fact that the hole wasn't too big so basically what you got here is one of those like glass slides I guess you could say you see if I can peel some of this back here you can kind of see let's see if we can get and roll it back for you and you can see what we what we're talking about here so basically it's like a slide bowl that you would have for a normal pipe it just doesn't have a little handle on it but the silicone little wrap around it well it serves multiple purposes obviously one it helps protect the glass it also allows you to have a little bit of grip edge it also stops it from being super hot when you handling it from using maybe if you happen to smoke the entire bowl you basically would have the tip here would be very hot so the silicon tonsil helps that as well but the whole setup here actually is a pretty nice little setup for a Chilam it is a glass one which is a probably the most attractive feature about it and the silicone does help I mean it goes over really where like the mouthpiece is so it does help it from protection on the bottom of that part the top part again I peeled it back but it was I was trying to reset it a little bit maybe I could twist a little bit just to give you an idea of what it should actually look like so basically it fits just like that where the top layer like that is exposed but other than that you have these five notches that are on the side which allows you to kind of get a little bit of a viewing window to see what's inside how dirty is it you know how much how much is this blockage how much is in the way what's going on in there that allows you to kind of get a 360 view of the entire tube itself which is alright and then it's kind of neat it would probably better if it didn't have those but again I don't know how you would be able to peel that off without having to cut it off if you wanted to clean the glass but these are so inexpensive that you pretty much can just kind of toss this and you know get another one because we're talking 105 dollars per unit here I imagine here stateside if you saw these at your local head shop I wouldn't imagine they're charging more than a couple dollars for these I paid under a dollar for this so imagine how much the markup is if you're paying over five on these so keep that in mind when you are out out and about but again you're gonna find something like this at a convenience type place or a little you know in a smoke shop that maybe might sell a lot of silicon products or parts from overseas you might see these in there and just overlooked because you don't even you assume that it's a silicone shell them but it's got glass on the inside so as far as children's go we've we've done a few reviews on this channel of Chilam z-- and when it comes to the ones that aren't made here stateside as far as overseas children's go these are probably the best ones that I've seen out there again the silicones nice because it definitely protects it from the heat when you're using this chillin but again you're not smoking out of the shell the silicone self the chills made of glass which is superb a whole lot itself look at that that's a really nice hole you could put a little mug right there and that's it you don't worry about a lot of plant material getting pulled through into your mouth which i think is extremely important this tattoo bit self is the same size all the way through which is nice again it's once it gets rezoned up its gonna catch a lot of that plant material that might get sucked into the back of your throat and tickle the back here throat even though the hole is kind of tiny if you pack it right you can definitely maneuver around that hole right there but other than that this little silicone Chilam is pretty legit if you've tried one of these let us know in the comments below you like this video give it a thumbs up and you have to want more content like this and subscribe for more I do smoke interviews every single day so be on the lookout for that I have addressed your day [Music]", "qNPef5dlc9E": "hi guys welcome back I'm Kevin here with Dustin and this week we're

great to practice and yeah I can't wait to see what you guys do you can put it up in the reviewer glass gallery on Facebook and coming out with totally check it out absolutely you just got back from Italy I heard that was an awesome trip yeah it was an awesome trip I mean we're gonna land a couple clips for you guys to see right here are some pictures I got to work with Simona Chris Donnie master glassblower he's got work in the Corning Museum and I was really honored to work with the ballerina brothers three brothers that um have over six hundred years uninterrupted you know father-son glassblowing your bridge is named after them in Murano and stuff and now I got invited to go to studio we made this club it's got gold leaf all over the dome and all over the female joint here and the straw really cool technique I think I think it's the first pipe ever to have gold leaf inlay like that it's super cool and we have quite a bit of footage from it so we'll be going in depth with probably you know maybe an Italy inspired project in the future show you guys a whole bunch in that trip yeah I can't wait to show you guys that trip I'm super stoked to have been lucky we invited to several studios now this year to teach so I'm about to head off to Belize so if any you guys are in Belize and go check it out this video send me an email Dustin our view of boss calm and hopefully you can just meet up and check it out that'd be super cool has been so awesome you know I I can't wait to see you on this trip Italy on was awesome and getting to teach all over spread glassblowing spread these pipe making techniques is super cool yeah really lucky you know you guys we can change the world one pipe at a time and you know decriminalization is is realize happening so absolutely yeah it's time for a change what are you smoking on Dustin I got some of that midnight oil pretty cool new stuff I've been trying to Sour Diesel and of course I have my my vat of CBDs from the clear very nice very nice I'm getting a little bit this West Coast Cure over here that trying a little bit of this that's so crazy so nuts just woo yes it's uh it's very proud very know what is that the hardcore a chain yeah that's hardcore og and this is somewhat a Harlequin you had actually this stuff is also very very tasty highs and high in CBD as well but not quite like the CBD wrong and then I have a little bit of what is this over here this is some pure quick I have a little bit cool well and what are we we're taking our dabs on this very close quarter with this built-in car cap thing it's pretty sweet yeah that's made by the dabble Ettore and they're on instagram you can check them out it's got this really cool carb cop built into it so yeah we got the deal hooked up and let's try it out take couple dabs cool well I enjoy the video and I will take some dives and we'll see you guys in a second I'm going in this week on your drop the classic taking the HC pretty clear dab there yeah I love the job is a great little piece lighten up your torch here and you're going to start out on your first one it's just a piece of 12 mil tube yes a 12 mil tube is the same as the blow tube that we normally use so I'm just making a round bottom just a really small round bottom and then going to attach a punny to that making sure it's nice and even as you pull off there and you're going to do a nice hot seal punty here as you shape up making your plane a little bit more precise so you can just heat the very end of that round bottom not to form it as you seal up they're just going to make that connection and then I'm going to go in for a convention so I'm heating that up kind of like I would from Maria but I'm letting the glass fall in on itself and the walls thick enough and maybe pushing slightly just a little that makes sure that your exterior wall diameter stays nice and even as that glass condenses in rolling on your marver to make sure it stays completely parallel if you have an El Marva oh it's a great great time to use it and you can see there that the walls where you did the convention have really closed down restricting that airflow so now we're just heating up the other side and it's going to be kind of similar to making that convention but it's a hollow Maria so I'm just going to heat it up and below kind of a little bit as I push it together and then you use your V blade to condensed down and that's where you will break it off for the mouthpiece later on so now we're just coming to condensing it to the right size and I'm going to remove my punny now that all the work is done and you'll be opening the front here and you know that'll become the bowl of the one-e-and so just heat it up and use one blade of the jacks and flare that open turn your flame up a little bit to heat more of the bowl there go in with one blade again I'm getting it to parallel maybe going a little bit past now I'm going in with my one blade you can see the beeswax burning off of there and it's really important to put beeswax on your jacks when you use them it'll create a smoother gliding along the glass finishing it off with a little two bladed flare and work out any tool marks and they're going to heat it up a little bit before you do some fuming with some silver so now I'm going to grab my silver and I know that we've talked about a few minute basically we're just heating up the silver and it's vaporizing on to the glass bring a nice even coat on there then heating it up a little bit to bake it in with a nice very reducing flame and now I'm just going to put on a few dots and let them melt in so put one on heat it up a little bit and you want to be careful not to melt them too much so you to form the shape or that the you guys burn off the silver now you're going to take your diamond sheers heat up that little area and then cool it down and with a quick tap the one you will pop right off just go into your flame and polish that end off and I'm gonna use my octagonal flaring tool to open that up and there you go that's the first onee that's for you guys you can see that few month a those dots nice colors from the silver with that black background yeah so we're going to make another one now and it's really similar to the last one that we made so we're going to start the same way just with a twelve millimeter blow to remain upon T but rather than just fuming this one you're going to do a little bit of inside-out work on the bowl area so you're going to start by heating up a little more area and flaring it out some gradual steps you can get that inside out technique just playing it open I got two blades there now and jacks are angled downwards to help open that flare up and you're going to grab your gold and do a little bit of gold fuming first using a more oxidizing flame with your gold just getting a thin layer gold on there and then I'm going to try to add some dots little dots that'll kind of implode and make a really cool effect adding just a little heat there being careful not to burn off the gold comes off a little bit easier the silver does and now you're going in to add some dots pull out on your rail always nice to be able to have a little more leeway with your elbow and the other end of the tube yeah the rail is great and you guys can grab that from the blast shield I just tell Tyra that you saw it in the video putting on dots on the inside of the flare there just remember and pattern so now I'm going to go in with the silver and create another layer of fume helps hold it on add some different colors in there now I'm going to go in with my three millimeter rod I just put on some dots in between the gold dots and that's going to give the two different effects in the two different colors kind of just putting them on randomly in there filling in the pattern once you've got all your dots on there you're going to go back in turn your flame up a little bit and start to condense it down heat it up a little bit and then going to marver it out and condense that back down putting heat in there gradually bringing it back to Center bring it back down to the same size as your blow-tube and you're going to close up the end trying to save as many dots as possible heat it up and condensing that back praying it to a really nice termination and I'm trying to leave as many of my dots in there as I can so that the work I do will show heating it up letting it condense and you're going to put some air in there blowing out the walls yeah heated it up and boiling it out a little bit and condensing it back down and that's gonna add depth and muff in the bubbles all the way melt in the clear dots all the way make sure it's nice and even as you work they're rolling back on your marver to help bring it bring the walls in I've heated it up a little bit and now I'm going to be able to attach my punty and condense the ball a little bit so that we have the smaller hole going in for your hot seal on the end there make sure you heat just the end of your fume bubble and now you're going to go in with that nice precise flame and make a convention just heating it up and kind of letting the walls collapse in on himself a little bit and I'm going to condense that hole to about one and a half maybe two millimeters and then you're going to go in and make the mouthpiece Maria just using that same precise flame pushing together with a little puff as you heat up yeah just expanding that a little bit you can see it's I'm holding the air in there a little bit pushing a little bit and that creates that nice mouthpiece once it cools you're going to heat up just next to it and use your V blade to condense down where you taking it off later making sure to go in gradually not just pressing too hard because you can get your whole off center so I'm going to remove my bunny and then I'm going to heat that tip up a little bit and blow out the hole for the very center pulling a little bit to make sure the termination is centered and to thin out the glass on the end to make it easy to blow through opening it up and then you're going to use your jacks to flare it into a bowl and then we're using the back of the jacks Azzam as a pad to even off the wall and now I'm firing it open to the nice taper for the money ball doing it gradually there you can see you have a bit of a gradient heat from the back to the very edge of the bowls it has to move a little bit more flaring there and I love the way those dots look when they're hot in there so cool yeah definitely it's definitely real treat to see what the glass looks like when it's hot now you're going to go and put some silver fume on the rest of the body here using that reducing flame and that all color in really nicely when when it gets smoked out of I don't get blues and reds and purples greens faking it in there is a very reducing flame lots of propane in there and now you're going to add a few dots to the outside just going around the edge doing a little spiral and then make sure when you melt these in that you don't cook off any of your silver fuming or melt in the dots so that it deforms the glass at all working your way around one at a time heating it up letting it cool and then go into the next one so I'm going to show you guys another way how to detach the onee because I know you guys all use different tools so this time I'm going to heat up and pull a small thin piece out of the end and then I'll be able to break that off and make it Hollow and you're using your fancy one you just got from Italy but you can get a similar tool from blast shield or mountain glass yeah I think round glass probably had some holders like that and super starting at this one from Italy from Rana that thin cone just snaps right off to a nice hole heat it up just a little bit open up the hole and there you go making sure it's nice and even you're going to start the opening with your jacks and then finish it with your rear just you know you can use whatever you guys have take it off there of course that's for you guys just comment on the video check out review hourglass gallery and show us your monies pop that in the kiln and of course you got to stay hydrated when you're on the torch for a long time yep for sure you guys definitely drink some water it's really important so that the next one that we're going to do is a fully worked inside out 1e and this one's a little bit like a spoon but a lot of you guys have asked for this for a long time so I want to make two blanks so I have a twelve millimeter blow tube connected to 26 millimeter tubing and I'm going to cut that in half and you'll set one of those aside you can use it later or you know make another one if you're doing a bunch of production yep so now I'm just going to heat it up and start to kind of pre shape the flare that I'm going to do and you're going to open this one up into a little bit bigger of an inside-out flare so you can do a lot of nice work on the inside a couple different kinds of fuming so just take the jacks and the lip is just a little bit hotter than the rest of the piece you see the beeswax burning and then put in some more beeswax make sure it's nice and fluid as you rotate helps you get that nice even flare heating it up and flaring it open all the way rotating a little bit in each direction as you flare help it stay nice and even and finishing in one direction so now I'm going to go in with some gold and put on that first layer of fume so oxidizing flame going in with the gold and you can always take the time to adjust your flame so if you see that it could be a little bit better just take the time to go adjust it you'd see the gold really coming off on the inside there making that nice even layer moving it around so it coats all over the inside now you need to add your first dots so pull that torch out a little bit and go in with a three millimeter just kind of put them on randomly leave enough space for your next dots which are going to be on the silver moving around kind of randomly but evenly filling in and now I'm going to reheat it a little bit since those dots have put stress all over the glass and use some silver so now just fuming with the silver over the gold and over the dots that I just put in and then I'll be able to add some dots of silver that'll give you a really cool pattern in the fume they're two different colors pulling out so you can get that better angle off to the side yeah it's good to adjust your torch and take the time to like get yourself set up in exactly the right position your will definitely come out better making sure it's nice and evenly filled in there and there you're going to go in and reheat and start to condense it down so I'm heating it up and condensing it down going to roll on my marver make sure it stays as even as you can as you bring it back down to a blank size heating a little bit more at the front since once again it needs to move more than the back and then I'll also keep it steady on your blow-tube so now I'm going to pull the side out a little bit because you can see that it was a little uneven and once I have that pretty square I'll heat it up and condense it down to make a round bottom pulling it out right into the center there closing it up so you can start to condense it right down into that nice blank try to save as much your work as possible rolling on your marver putting a little air in to even out the walls and now you're going to hook up your blow-tube and punty up so I'm heating it up and going to condense this down a little bit like we did with the spoon but it's smaller and we're going to make the bowl on the end so just heat it up you can twist a little bit if you want to add in a cool effect and kind of let it condense and those dots that you put on will kind of come to come up into the glass and look like little bubble almost kind of 3d you know implosion almost effect going on pulling a little bit as it's hot therefore that shaping and now you're going to go in and condense like a nice big thick Maria on the mouth yeah so you want that Maria to be thick like Kevin said because you want that 3d effect for the fuming that you put in on the inside walls now just like the other ones you're heating just past that mouthpiece Maria and condensing with your feet blade now I'm going to take off my Ponte and this is going to be similar to the spoon so what we're going to do is blow a very small up bubble smaller than we would for like a head of a spoon so just going to heat it up a little bit but you can see I'm expanding it getting it nice and hot floppy on your blow-tube you'll let it condense back for a second and then put some air in to make it a nice even bubble you just pull out a little bit of the end and you can bring that hole all the way to the end and also makes a nice centered termination there makes sure your pattern comes right to your bowl hole in the center there and now I'm going to get that ready to push my ball find a little bit with the back of the jacks like a paddle and use a reamer if you want to adjust the size then you're going to push in with your bowl push as you rotate pushing right on axis there you can see that kind of looks like a little pipe but um or chill them but see another way to make a one E and now you're going to put some dots around the side they're similar to the other ones since this one's a little bit thicker you can put out a little bit bigger dots a little bit harder to deform this one yeah absolutely and adding the dots on this adds another layer of magnification so you can kind of choose where you want to put them if you want something to look bigger you know distorted evening out the heat and then you're going to go in and heat that convention area and cool it off with your diamond Cheers a little tap and it'll pop right off yeah I'd love to take the pieces off this way I feel like it's really precise if you want to adjust the size of your hole at all you can grab a piece of three mil kind of get it around a little bit and then use your reamer to open that up and make it an even hole using your jacks at first it's a real little there and then flaring with your reamer and of course that one's for you guys too you can see those really nice dots in there in that little bit of a spiral pattern yeah definitely comment on the video let us know what you're up to if you have any Chin's will totally answer them there you can see the three different ones first one the third one and then that second one in the back there yeah they're all going to change color um when you guys use them because the silver creates patterns and different things that will come out when there's a dark background behind them you can see there's that second one the silver right there a little it's just yellow right now and then the gold and silver those different color dots up front it looks like a honeycomb pattern from the inside there yeah kind of and then what's really cool is on this one where you get to see the the magnification over the bubbles and I don't know I think straight inside out looks really cool you guys should show me that I'm show Kevin them put them in the reviewer glass gallery and we'll totally take a look and even this little simple one here will look really awesome once it's used fills in with all those colors and super quick to make yeah it's great practice for you guys just starting out and it's a good item for sure hey guys welcome back thanks for watching and checking out these 1yz I hope that you guys get something out of it learn a trick or two maybe some of you guys can use in your own work this is them yeah they'll say this is an awesome thing to just practice a lot of really give those good techniques down really perfected I mean all the techniques that we use are right here and those one easier is dotting everything so it's just great way to build your skill set and of course you could do all kinds of other work on the one each of you do color work you can think about a line tubing you know practice on other techniques these are just some different shaping techniques and a couple of color techniques but yeah you guys could go Bob with the post-it in Revere glass gallery and will totally look at it and check it out absolutely so I had some questions for you Destin sure first up from a salika glass who'd you like to know he's starting out how do you price your work but he's really just starting to work the on glass full-time I mean that's the question that's a pretty pretty big question great how do you price your work well I mean I think ultimately it's what the market demands you know so it depends where you are and how much demand is in your work but um you know I would say if you just started out you know try to cover the cost of your the glass that is made with great you know the supplies that you use to make it so that it has you work more full-time you know you have to take into consideration the time you put into each piece lengths like that yeah I mean as you get better they'll be people who know about your work and know know where they contact you and you'll be able to you know sell it for Kotori marketing is a huge part of our glass industry now having that online presence is you know undeniably a big part of having a following or in a lot of places yeah I mean we just got an email last week about somebody who's in a school studying blast porn and heart and yes for a resume yes do we look at resumes and the answer is no we look at Instagram so if you want to if you want to put your work up put it up on Instagram and start building your gallery and you'll increase your sales absolutely next up a lot of people were asking you know what other gemstones could you in case because these are borojevic carved out of a piece of aura right you know could you do like an emerald maybe or something like that there's a lot of that up for experimentation um maybe some cubic zirconium could work to tektite multiply will definitely work zinc guy but you guys should test them out and I think that we talked about this in an earlier video great but if you find any gemstones that work write them down in the comments and we'd love to share that with people and let them know what you know what works absolutely yeah I think maybe like higher end synthetic ones maybe I think might have a better chances of working if you're going experiment has opposed to natural things with moisture yeah one thing is created under heat and pressure will probably things without moisture in it you know I don't know do it a shot Erica Southworth would like to know so you know desta we sent out some collab pieces a while ago have we ever gotten anything back no we guys we haven't ever gotten anything back I wish we had some pictures to show you Erica of some cloud pieces we have this collab piece it was given to us from some students yeah we really love this piece he I mean he he went of his own accord and purchased those Marinis and and made some colored tubing to match and then send it back and it's so awesome to do glass if you guys are watching and you have some of our cloud pieces it's cool man you know it's sometimes things take time we know but we love to get of it you know show the audience you know what was make people want to see it wouldn't IRA just to do some more on the torch glass absolutely and Erica also asked you know about online classes if you have kind of specific questions about that totally shoot them over to info or beer glass calm or Kevin our viewer glass talk honestly and for online classes if I get maybe six people together will run one so if you know some other people who want one totally get together and shoot an email over all right well cool guys thanks for watching we appreciate Oh giveaway giveaway and we also have a new piece on the table that's true we do we didn't even talk about these these are the other your gloves yeah but you guys saw some footage of that and here's a couple the other ones so I mean help DePalma stoked we have to give away these rings that Fichman glass made last week these are awesome you guys don't even know how many rings we got to see last time and how many people love the idea so

"9ZCP1Dgqzi0": "[Music] what's up fellow cannabis growers and welcome back for another episode of greenbox grown my name is Dylan and as promised I'm gonna be reviewing two of the products that I picked up last weekend at grow ex up in San Jose California and again for those of you who didn't see the last video grow ex is a cultivation based cannabis convention there's a few locations that happens out throughout the year just a happened last weekend it was up in San Jose which is near where I live so I went checked it out so the two products I'm gonna be reviewing are the Lock and Load Chellam and this is by biohazard Inc incorporated but it's just basically they sell all kinds of glass smoking accessories like grinders everything from bubblers to bait pens to concentrate containers and everything in between so definitely check their site out they have a lot of good products I already smoked one of these as you can see this one's all dirty but they're really cool for a few reasons one of them is the screw on cap but I'll get into more details on that later the other company I would be reviewing is ona and they are an odor neutralization company whether that be for your grow rooms or just for smoking indoors or in certain areas of the house alright so now that you guys know which companies I'll be reviewing I'm gonna do each review individually for the specific product and so the first one I want to do is the Lock and Load chil'en by biohazard glass and the first thing I want to mention on this thing which is really cool is it has this screw on cap over the bowl so you can pack the bowl before you go wherever you're going to smoke if it's outdoors put this in your pocket that worrying if it's gonna spill out and you're good to go the other thing is it's a really strong glass that it's made out of I mean you can drop it from I mean relatively high I dropped it on the cement while we were walking nothing happened the cap was on to you so he didn't even lose the ball so very portable don't obviously be throwing it on the ground trying to break it but it is durable also which is great right now I'm grinding up some Northern Lights from my recent auto flower grow which I'll be using to test out the Lock and Load one-hitter one thing I did notice using it before though it's kind of sucks is because this hole is so fat where the bull piece is if you suck too hard you will be getting a lot of Scooby Snacks in your mouth or just essentially pulling through pieces of the weed so you don't need to hit it very hard to get a good hit just a slight pull will do alright so now the bowl is packs and now I'm gonna take a hit I'll show you guys how it goes Cheers it's a pretty fat bullet to you so you can get a couple hits if you are just taking like medium-size ribs don't want the house to stink up too much yeah really smooth the rib like I said really portable and durable which is nice and the cap is a huge bonus for pre packing the ball so definitely recommend checking out biohazard inks page and all their glass all right so now that you guys saw the Lock and Load Chilam I'm going to talk about the ona odor neutralization company basically they sell a few different products ranging from these big filled odor gel containers I mean what these are for is for neutralizing grow rooms and stuff liqueur just like if you just harvested you can open one of these up near that room or inside the room and it'll eliminate that odor pretty quickly I recommend putting these outside or near the grow room because you don't want the smell to actually get on the canvas itself but you don't want the outer lip escaping from that room so you know just kind of surrounding the borders of the room with this stuff is really helpful it does come in different size containers and different scents but the pro scent is what's recommended for cannabis odor neutralization just because of how strong it is and then they have these credit card sprayers they call them which you saw me actually using a little bit earlier in the video when I was smoking but just great for if you're smoking in a room inside we're just somewhere where you don't want to leave the cannabis odor behind honestly it just takes like one of these little spritzes and the whole room the smell within the whole room will be gone within a minute at most so when it comes to ona I actually use their product several different products buy them for my grow rooms eliminating smells whether that's my indoor grow rooms or my outdoor greenhouses because you still don't want it to smell up in your yard for your neighbors to have to deal with if they're not into that so I use their products out there and inside with my grow rooms for that and then I also use what I was just talking about the credit card sprayer for if I'm smoking inside or if I forget my smoke so I'll just have one of these lying around usually or in my car or something and I can just spritz it and eliminate the odor right there so so not only are those two great individual products but those two brands are also really reputable and offer other great products like I was saying that you may or may not need to use at some point in your growing career but that is all I have for now in terms of reviewing these two products you guys enjoyed the video please subscribe and give us the thumbs up also don't forget to comment below with your feedback or any other requests for other product reviews and as always thank you for watching and happy growing you", "LBNDCyQgr7I": "hey what's up get to this pool I'm back at it again um I went to my local dispensary it's crazy because you know they're not they're not actually list around leave maps I just drove across there okay and I seen a great crossing she and I just seen a whole bunch of people there not and I think that's myself it's a great cause you know it's gotta be Medical Marijuana never you need it so anyways I did a walking in and I showed them my ID my Reiki sure enough it was it was uh it was a good smoke shop it's called uh the g-spot you see this you know I love that now well I don't really know me but for the they has so many varieties of herb all the sativa all the indigo or the hybrid they even have edibles they have nice pieces they had a little little vape and you know they have everything anything that has to do with cannabis related they had it you know their customer service was off the hook there's this beautiful part a budtender attending me so you know I kind of like you know I got the best out of this spa I had a beautiful girl charging me um tell me a little bit about her stuff so you know I I went in there with a budget of $35 and I kind of pretty pretty cool pretty fluffy how can I say fluffy crystallized but you know so so right now we're gonna be smoking out of this chillin chillin I've been having this for a very long time and I just don't ever use the I've been having this for over six years I think over six years I never use as you can include guys to chow he's fast by email see so it's a few uh Chilam it's very a changes color and time when I like when it gets resonated a cheese cut it so yeah we're gonna be smoking out of this channel I remember what we got here is a slim Muskaan Kochi I got eight and I'm gonna show you guys to close you but so now they just pack a ball the

look at this chillin pretty nice it's nice and just that ah honestly I really thought my opinion is gonna change this I have a smoke gonna chill for like six years but you know why I'm getting the same experience that I had when I was young which was the hitting process they're hitting it just doesn't give me enough function for me to get a nice little hit uh it does hit but it hits four little hits basically like if you're trying to hide something for somebody this is something that you just buzz doubted it you know that's it but I mean personally my purse my perfect personal opinion I like I like pieces that have carbs knowing that I'm gonna get a nice decent hand knowing that it's gonna go straight into my nose all nice um this it's just like smoking a cigarette nothing really to it that huh matter of fact gates like a blunt I like blunts me personally I do smoker but not occasionally so I'm more of a bomb person like I said if you guys if you guys want to chill if you guys want

great but it's pretty cool so anyways shout out to them my chillin official review - I recommend it yes to somebody that wants a quick eight and then put it away real quick I recommend it for you to get nice glasses hmm nice hits no but you know there's a piece for everybody out there and I'm I'm guessing there's a piece this is a piece for someone out there you know til next time YouTube lumpy so state if to go", "VjsJCbDwPKI": "[Music] so what's the objective today we have ourselves a double helix chillin and that's it right there it seems pretty straightforward everybody primarily I guess knows what a Chilam is I think of a challenge is something a real simple smoking device that you would just put between your fingers and smoke like this and I mean that's my belief and that and it's pretty basic it's there's not there's not much to it other than that and until I met TK I didn't I had no idea the intricacies and the details and you know the thicknesses and whole philosophies and ideals behind the Chilam except we're grinding up the yeah I just ruined I just ground up a little piece of the Kim 91 and Sour Diesel oh nice twenty point eight six percent THC yeah very low on the CBD got a CBD heavy strain we're in Oregon so we just walk down the street and there's dispensaries all around we can you can pretty much turn to Amsterdam yeah you can pretty much trip over them here yeah pretty pretty much six gram limit per visit first perk for day per store and I buy grams at a time so I go to and get seven flavors and every place I visit so for recreational weekend you can do up to how much at one time up to seven grams per store per day so you know you can get a lot if you hit up a lot of different stores but we're trying to buy big amounts you know obviously the biggest and once you can find a time as a quarter so you can get a quarter of a single thing from a place or you know two eighths or seven you know individual grams can't you just go to different stores though yeah absolutely go to the for sure hmm or go back to the same one you know day after day I mean you're looking at pain anywhere from seven or eight at the low end up to 13 14 15 grams dollars a gram at the high okay so I just loaded helix not cleanest at the moment very very thick and heavy glass very well made hand-blown bought from a head shop in Dallas Texas that has a very very very amazing stuff as you can see the double helix and lookit you know and that is a point oh seven grand Bowl so very very very small amount so if you're getting you know Graham from a place for you know say ten bucks yeah you know you're looking at about fifteen fourteen fifteen helix bowls and for a lightweight this is more than enough I mean you and I share this only that's plenty that's plenty we're about to go throw some discs after this at the park little disc action and this is more than enough for that so so why helix I mean I mean I think the whole purpose of me asking you is because I was fascinated by your passion and your understanding behind it and that's that's what I think well there for people to know you know at most shops that you'll go do to buy glass it's thin glass more import glass almost all import glass is the thin style of glass and anyone who knows anything about smoking will know what I'm talking about and I don't know if you can tell but helix is like solid glass through it's very very thick yeah very very heavy I have personally never seen this kind of work at least for this kind of piece Brian war so often time do you drop a piece it breaks because of the thinness of the glass but he looks has been dropped many many times even on concrete and never never broken it has a very small chip at the mouth and but besides that it survived the last five years Wow Wow yeah this is extremely thick and it's helix it's because the artwork in it is that what it is well the heat I mean helix is the style of fuming and it's inside out fuming so the way it's made or the way the actual the smoke funnels when it's lilt has nothing to do it and has nothing to do with that I think you smoke nope it's just it's just the style of fuming that they did for coloring it is created a it's a it's a helix tile pattern mm it could have done you know whatever pattern they wanted and they did a spiral yeah I like it and it's got the knobby which I think it's pretty common yeah and then it has these like divot so I guess you can yep the again yep then yeah the nub keeps it from rolling off of a table or roll it off of a surface right and then the teeth marks allow you to hold it if you learn I hate it like all right without having you know if you're driving or you know whatever you also wanted to cover grinding because very few people grind you don't get an even burn when you don't grind also you have trouble getting it all or having to hit it more times than you ought to and then you're just you know smoking extra you know butane right from the lighter whereas if you grind it you get a very even clean burn also a trickle burn also less of it trails off as you're smoking and you have less waste less runoff less hot box effect that makes more into the lungs more more more more more effective smoking and also much easier to clean out you can blow it out very easily once it's turned to ash whereas if it's in clumps I mean even the other day I forgot my grinder at home and I was just breaking up in my hand but it's still not the same right and it didn't hit the same right so you don't want to just throw it in there can I see that grinder yes absolutely that's awesome it's just fascinating to me and that's what that's what they call a four piece grinder so that's a key shredder most expensive grinder on the market pretty much you know what what I found interesting about this was oh like this oh yeah as when you grind it it gets what is it Keefe yep all the THC trichomes that are on the bud that fall off in the process of grinding fall through the screen and then go down into the bottom into the key compartment we look at them track homes that's all Keith having a deliciously add that to a bowl and spike it by despite your ball not against it but it can be intense because I mean for me I have a hundred varieties in my collection yeah and so there's a lot of varieties contained down in the bottom of this little guy no that's why that's really that's like you could call that your Long Island iced tea of smoking and cocktail of everything it's nice it's fancy it's very fancy I'm excited shall we demonstrate is he smoking oh you're gonna let me take green so absolute little all right that's very that's very generous [Music] sun's out it's been Portland foam very excited behind here in Portland [Music] see very little runoff I mean our and if you noticed I didn't even have a lighter it was already still burning from Bruce's head let spank me yeah yeah and we've we've barely gotten into it I had an entire bowl of this I'm on my way home this morning oh yeah yeah it was great now this is a good one there so this is a sativa that's the other thing a lot of people don't understand the differences between sativa indica sativa is mental hi Ryan mentally stimulating once often times can make you want to get stuff done so I've been cleaning up my room sweeping and rearranging I talked to you about actually getting one of these and you're like this is the one I can't believe how inexpensive it is awesome right right and but you don't even know where to get it here I mean I got it from retro Revolution in Dallas Texas that's a shop it's a shop they have clothing and apparel and accessories and insane retro retro revolution I was working a website - how's work I don't know I won the State Fair and this girl had these cool gauge earrings and I said where'd you get those shoes I got him at my work I've retro revolution so I went there and they had some of the most amazing glass art I've ever seen that's what brought you in I mean well I mean the earrings robbed me and actually need to bind a lot of get earrings from them hmm but I mean but they also had a section half of their if you have digital so I do alright first straight to a four and I'm up - I've been to a two so I have everything from two four six eight and twelve I have like a different earrings and Veitch size really sometimes they only have one now but so you've found that to be a great shop it's the best headshot that I've ever been to evolution in Dallas Texas I'd love to go back but this particular glassblower an entire shelf dedicated to his work and he had a whole bunch of ones that ass come through yep yep yep so that's the end of the bowl you can actually even see through it it's done it's good for about three or four hits for a burro for like a medium casual smoker for some you know heavy hitters maybe just a couple or for some light weights and you saw that one hit drop me drop me oh yeah or you get a one hitter that's a point usually a round of 0.05 grand balls right go by a gram for twenty four ten bucks you're looking at 20 bowls of that and if you're a lightweight and you know that'll have your sets where you know come Lauer's anyway what is it again how so by what a one-hitter right and it's got a hundredth of a gram scale yeah and then get a grinder get a grinder yeah for sure and I think it'll get a little chilling that's a small bowl I mean even it's bigger point 1/2 grams considerably bigger than this and grinding up you know 0.12 grams at a time is a lot so I recommend shooting for 0.05 0.07 ramble which is very small for fur starters yeah I think what I really like is because I've definitely always had a different viewpoint on Jones I've always just thought get keeps bud throw it in there a bit in there about most people do I'm Malou I'm just doing and I never even considered myself to be you know just to care enough about like it like a fine wine that you you've made it sound where I described it and actually it is I mean it's kind of interesting when you do go into dispensaries and you smell like like OG and then you nope and or all these different strains they have a very distinct smell to them oh sure what is it dog it smell like oh yeah I think smoking it tastes like dog a like just dog hair or wet dog or something it's yeah disgusting yeah for sure whatnot mm-hmm which if you're knew nothing about positive things you know can make for an intense experience but yeah like I said just you know treat it like a pharmaceutical where you just got a great medication and so that's why if you can go into a place you know get a variety you know get seven if I tell them specifically tell the people at the shop what what you're there for what are you there for depression either for anxiety there for physical pain are you there you need something to wake you up in the morning do you want something that makes you talkative wake up in the morning there are ones you know that are that are helpful for that but really be functional though if you smoke in the morning some people yes I have met people who are but they look like I said you have you smoking the right stuff if you're not talking the right stuff then it's a vineyard then you're gonna you know who then it's uh even you don't know what's gonna happen you know what I mean and so it's like you got a trying medication you know if you like it yeah you got a right on it what is this good for is it's good for lazy nabo is it good for sleeping is it good for getting the dishes done is it good for you know taking the trash out you know is it good for taking a nap you know whatever you need help with like that's what having a medication for and if you like it so much that you use it all the time and you need more well good thing you know the place down the street has you know more of it and ability and Mitch's everything like multitasking you know totally gives your body and your mind I got something like forty something kills way more double what I normally get I was just like on fire more so I was a lot more I was making more like cognitive functions per minute you know and being able to correspondingly you know control you know my unit you know my champion in that game I think you're in a flow state right exactly that's otherwise right and so I mean so it's a bit of actually challenging yeah enjoyment yeah but I put I mean but also it's really like you said where is your mind is your mind I've taken a nap you're right dad rocking at the booty game is your mind [Music]", "4LykEQ4y7lY": "what's going on everybody it's your boy the Loki legend now the [ __ ] y'all doing today I'm doing all right today I got a brand new video here for you guys and we are back with a brand new episode of STONER tips this has this is going to be episode 104 of the STONER tips series today's topic we're going to be covering one-hitters so with that being said if you guys do enjoy be sure to smash that thumbs up button it does go a long way and with that I guess let's just dive right on into it bro bucket so one-hitters brothers a lot I could talk about on one-hitters number one thing they are definitely underrated all right I'm sure maybe not a lot of you guys have hit an actual one hitter or you know maybe they hit a you hit a piece a small little steamroller like piece but if you guys get your hands on a one-hitter a regular one hitter they come in a lot of different not a lot they're all made pretty much the same it's just maybe the size of a jewel alright I'm holding my jewel in my I would say what is that maybe like four or five inches and if when you have a one-hitter dude normally the one hitters they come in they look like a cigarette I the exact little color of a cigarette the mouthpiece will be orange and the entire rest of the one-hitter will be white they do work okay one hitters are definitely it one of the most underrated things in smoking weed I know a lot of you guys probably would prefer to go straight to a bong or a bowl even you know there or just roll a blunt I'm sure a lot of you guys would rather do that but if you guys need a good way to conserve weed man one hitters are the way to go okay one hitters definitely the most underrated piece I believe because when you go out and smoke with your friends not a lot of them bust out of one hitter but here's a good idea to do with your friends I'm gonna go I'm gonna say this first one hitters really are meant to be smoked alone it's not really something gonna bust out in a rotation but if you guys do manage to bust out in a rotation here's what I could recommend to do so if you have a grinder grind up the amount of weed that you'd maybe roll in a blunt or however much weed you want to preferably smoke with your squad or you know your friends or whatever and then pass that in the entire grinder around with the one hitter alright yeah obviously when you're smoking this thing you got to be in an environment preferably not outdoors because if you drop that grinder you're [ __ ] alright and and you're passing the grinder and the one-hitter around okay so you pack the one-hitter here's the thing with one-hitters though alright you pack it all the way you pack it as much as you can and when I say pack all you got to do is dump the one-hitter into the grinder or into whatever grinded weeds you want twist it a couple times and then come out with it and that should be one solid hit alright you might have to do it a couple times if you don't think that it's enough go into another little pile weed twist it a little bit come back up until you know there's no more weed that it can actually fit now one-hitters really can't fit a lot of weed but here's the thing they live up to their name so one-hitters should be able to be cleared in one hit and now that one hit you guys take should be fat as [ __ ] I've been in rotations where guys that I've passed it to they'll take 2-3 hits out of the one hitter because they didn't clear it in one hit now that's perfectly fine as well but in a rotation you you clear whatever you pack pretty much alright and here's that here's the you know the better perk of it if you clear that thing in one hit obviously it's gonna be a good amount of weed to clear in one hit alright and if you do manage to do it it's gonna be a very strong hit and it's gonna get you a lot more [ __ ] up okay and it's gonna be a very little amount of weed as well another perk would be everybody gets greens alright after you're done with it you blow it out pass a pass the grinder and the one-hitter to the next person and vice and they do the same thing they pack up a full nice green hit and when they hit that [ __ ] it's all green all right there's no ash there's no you know [ __ ] weed in there you know burnt weed is what I'm trying to get it there's none of that you get a fresh clean hit after every time you packet that is the one of the most dope things about one-hitters because it's always green everyone who gets to hit it hits greens and that's dope as hell so keep that into consideration as well one hitters are super cheap you can get them for like [ __ ] 10 bucks probably less than that I don't know ten fifteen bucks I'm sure if you get into tobacco so they're gonna be taxed a little bit there's another thing about one-hitters I want to talk about I don't know if I should cover it in this video but they're called dugout boxes I believe and it's a one-hitter in a box and on the other side of the little box there's spots you can put weed you could put grind it up weed in I'm gonna talk about that and another episode of stoner tips in the future very shortly but I'm glad you guys have been dropping ideas for me in the comments be sure to drop any comments that you guys want me to hit on of stoner tips so I can get to that of surely one-hitters was another requested one by somebody very dope idea and I'm glad that they said that so because I never did a one-hitter one yet and one hitters like I said there's a lot to cover on one hitters but I feel like I did a good job doing there I feel like I gave you guys a lot information I'm not sure if there's a lot else to talk about to be honest I go over the prices different colors you know there's different Sun not really different sizes they're all relatively the same and that is just for your you know own personal use so it's easier to hide you can do a lot of [ __ ] with it pretty much do you can hide it very easily it's very transportable all you got to do is you know find a little [ __ ] very little spot to throw that [ __ ] in and it's it's very low-key all right you can give you can smoke one-hitters [ __ ] anywhere you want you can smoke on you know in the middle of Park if you really want to just you just gotta be low-key about it you know and just take one hit at a time obviously and going to you know low-key spot where you could pack this [ __ ] but in the end it is what it is man you guys could do whatever you want with it but if you guys have not smoked out of a one-hitter if you don't own a one-hitter that is definitely going to be a stoner accessory how would a piece of stoner equipment that I would recommend you guys to get your hands on again very very easy to save weed like this you go in there you know you go wherever you can pack that thing up take one maybe two hits and you know one out when you pack it make sure you try to clear it in one hit because when you do that you will get a lot more [ __ ] up don't try to ghost you know don't do any tricks when they don't do I mean you can do a friend's you nail if you want but if you want to get the most high just zero and that don't zero it but just as soon as you're done hitting it just take that second breath in when it gets into your lungs and that's it that's all you gotta do is just inhale again you don't have to do any tricks so that way you know for a fact you're not gonna waste any smoke I know some of you guys might out might always do a ghost out there or always do a French inhale it's just habit it has become a habit with me as well when I do smoke even you know my drool it's like sometimes I'll just bust out a ghost or a random [ __ ] French inhale not as often but I know when you're smoking weed it gets like that bro you just have to ghost do a small little even if it's small but if you guys are trying to do some tricks with it just put yourself in a situation where it's like alright if I don't catch this whole ghost it's all good but but one-hitters really aren't meant for that dude if you want to do something like that do smoke tricks smoke a blunt one-hitters are supposed to be for that maybe you know last half gram of weed and you want to drag it out for a day or two you know because you could definitely do it with a one-hitter and they're just super underrated you never see anybody really hit one-hitters and it's it's definitely something I'd recommend you guys to try to get your hands on yeah it's it's one of those things bro it's like you got to have it and your stoner accessories but even if you don't smoke it a lot it's cool - a chi comes in handy a lot more than you guys would think very easy to clean as well if you guys have any what are they called pipe cleaners just slide it right through the entire thing one time and it's cleared you're gonna have a lot of resin built up in it after a short amount of time simply because they it just sits in there after every hit and after every time you clear a one-hitter not all the weed 100% will get out sometimes you'll be in situations where there's a little tiny nug stuck all the way in the back of the one-hitter and you kind of got to keep roasting it so you keep trying to hit it and eventually you'll get to a point where that nugs so loose in there you could just blow it out or just keep clearing it until you clear the entire thing but keep in mind you don't want it to get any shooters down your you know into your mouth and [ __ ] that's [ __ ] nasty I hate that [ __ ] but it happens to the best of us so anyways men that's really all I got to say about one-hitters try to calm them if you can online I'm sure there'll be a lot cheaper than in the tobacco stores but even in the tobacco stores they're not taxing that much I want hitters because not a lot of people enjoy smoking on one-hitters as much as they do a bong or a blunt which is very understandable I agree with that as well I'd much rather smoke a blunt or rip a bong then smoke a one-hitter but if you want to pack that you know either pack a bong one time with your last grandma weed pack a nice little bowl or manage that weed out for another couple days using a one-hitter definitely possible definitely definitely possible and I just recommend you guys to try it out if you haven't already definitely something you should do anyways men that's really all I got for you guys in this episode of stone or tips talking about one-hitters I think I covered all everything I need to cover on one-hitters if you guys have any other questions drop them in the comment section below if you guys think I might have missed anything about one-hitters also drop them in the comments section help everybody out out there and really that is everything I wanted to say in this episode of stoner tips this has been episode 104 of the stoner tip series I uploaded a video yesterday if you guys have not seen it it was called xanax and lean and I talked about you know my experience with that and gave a little story behind it my first time trying both of them at the same time I [ __ ] up on the editing all right I got some gameplay through it and I forgot to turn the gameplay volume down so that's I know that's probably annoying for a lot of people but I still do appreciate the positive feedback that I got on the video and I watched it back on my own too it's kind of hard to understand me at certain parts I was really thinking about removing it but I don't really want to re-edit the entire thing I actually deleted the audio for it so I really don't have that either but I'm just gonna keep it up I might have to remake that in the future though but I think that a lot of you guys got the understanding and managed to make it through that video so I wanna thank you guys for the support on that one man it was not my best edited video I just kind of [ __ ] up a little bit but yeah either way man glad you guys enjoyed and hopefully you guys did enjoy this episode of stoner tip so you guys have any other suggestions drop them in the comment section below I will get to them very shortly thanks so much for watching again

"x7EFyUsdlaI": "[Music] hi there buds i'm so excited for this video for multiple reasons one one of my favorite things to do on my channel is chris and new pieces like you guys have seen over the years that i definitely have an addiction to pipes bongs like i just i love collecting them i love looking at them i can't wait to get into a space where i can have them all set up and another one of my favorite things to do is to give small artists promotion i feel like particularly in the cannabis community there are so many artists out there creating such neat handcrafted pieces that just do not get the recognition that they deserve before the pandemic i was looking through hashtags looking at pipes like i normally do and i stumbled upon an artist named carly and she created a shop called shop contraband she creates handcrafted ceramic pipes that are so aesthetic like they're so cute they look like they just belong in like a magazine or something so she sent over two pieces and i thought i would unbox them with you guys today i absolutely love the packaging this is what the pipes actually look like and then on the bottom it has shop contraband right there the instagram handle name i'll actually leave it linked down here as well if you guys want to support carly um please do please support small artists out there artists who are actually creating things like this i cannot imagine how much time it comes into like just coming up with the concept for the designs let alone coming up with like the packaging and just like all of the designs that she puts on her pipes i can tell that she puts a lot of time and effort into her work and it shows so without further ado let's open up the pieces one is just a tiny little black circle that looks like this it has three air holes on the inside of the bowl which i really liked because i feel like pipes that only have one hole inside it gets clogged occasionally and then you have to like clean it out a bunch where it has three maybe you won't have to clean it as often there's also a hole on the top of the pipe i feel like you guys can't really see anything from this pipe because it's black so that there's a hole right there at the top which i love as you guys know i prefer the hole for the pipe at the top versus on the side i feel like you get a better hit that way but that's how it looks just a little it almost looks like a little ufo or a little stone super tiny super sleek you wouldn't really even know that this is a pipe i haven't tried it out yet it seems kind of short but we'll christen it and then we'll open up the other one all right i have the little pod set up let's try it out cheers you guys [Music] that's actually farther away than i thought i was kind of scared lighting it because i thought it was so close to like my beard and my nose but it's actually a good distance [Music] and i feel like normally small pipes or pipes that just have like less room for the smoke to travel are normally really harsh but this one's not harsh at all [Music] so oh my gosh i kicked my lighting out of place i actually like this little pod more than i thought i would mainly because it's just so tiny could you imagine taking this in your pocket like i wish i could do a size comparison i guess i could like compare to my eye it's not big you guys this is like the tiniest pipe that i own for sure so this would be super nice to like slip in your pocket ooh this will be a nice to go pipe and it honestly is kind of aesthetic because it is like super duper like sleek there's not much to it just a circle i kind of really like it grew on me this one was like out of the two this one wasn't the one that caught my eye when i saw this artist but like now i actually really like it now to open up this one which is the one that i was really excited about she had to send me this one twice because the first time she sent it to me it was broken and i was so sad oh but this one is intact oh my gosh it's a little steamroller it has one two i think five holes yeah one two three four five holes in the bowl a hole on the top and then these little hand painted dots on the side that have this like gold luster in the center of them this was sent to me before the pandemic well the first one was and legitimately when i got it because i opened it up like last week which you know it's after everything went down i was like oh my god it looks like little coronaviruses it's super cute though like this is like an adorable one hitter super duper aesthetic i could see this in like an anthropology magazine or something like that like you know what i mean like kind of looks like it would be in like an ant throw store or something super aesthetic i really really like the way it looks let me load this up and then we'll try it out as well oh my gosh loading it was so weird because the bowl is like such a weird shape it's so long i don't think i've ever seen a pipe with a bowl this long it's like a trough like a weed drop all right time to christen her i grabbed some pimp wick just because the bowl for this one is a little bit skinnier than it is wider i just feel like i won't burn myself with this or have less of a chance you know cheers that was a weird experience like i mean like not bad like it was good but like just seeing how it lit just in that one little spot carly i think you're on to something with the shape of this bowl i really like the shape of this bowl [Music] i feel like it's easier than cornering a circle bowl that makes any sense because like with the circle bowl you have to like hit every single little corner with this you can just kind of go down the line and get a fresh hit every single time cheers [Music] for one hitter it definitely packs a few hits in it i really like that that's super neat you get a fresh hit every single time i just like the way it looked when you let it too because you like i don't know this longer than wider bowl is something i've never seen before in a pipe and i really think that you're on to something here because this functions better and for it having a hole in every single one of the spots along the line like it it hits very well as well i really like this this is the one that i thought i was gonna like the best just the way that it looked i didn't pick it out or anything like she just sent me what was in her heart to send me but like this is like adorable and i absolutely love the function like one of my favorite things is pieces that are not only aesthetic but that are functional as well yeah

carrot is really perfect for bold piece material and what we're gonna make today is a carrot chilling when you're selecting a carrot you want to make sure that it's decently thick and that you can yeah I mean actually that's the only consideration so the first step is I'm gonna take this little paring knife and just cut off the end and the bold piece is gonna go on this end and in fact I'm gonna just gonna mark that right now by putting my knife right in the middle there and starting to just drill a little bit of a hole there and then we're gonna cut it to about where we want to hit it from let's say right there so let's just cut that off and what we want to do is create another mark right there this is our mouth piece we're gonna Whittle it down a little bit more so that's something that fits a little better on your mouth and what I'm gonna do is take this bamboo skewer and I'm gonna stick it into one end of the carrot and I'm gonna drill all the way through and out the other end just hammer this guy down a little bit just push it in and it pulls all the way through and we've got our bolt beast drilled in right there what I'm gonna do now is whittle down this end just a little bit and that way it's gonna fit a little nicer here we go you can like carve your initials into it like in a tree now everybody knows that this is my carrot chillin right here so what I'm gonna do is take some weed there we go [Music] it's perfectly a carrot makes for a great reusable vegetable pipe give it a try", "CBW0e7DM1Xo": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

pipe guy live from rochester new york and um i had uh several of my subscribers that said they absolutely love the two for tuesday uh videos that we've put out over the past few weeks and uh i had uh one subscriber actually ask me tony if you're listening uh and watching uh he says can't we have two for tuesday like two times a week can you like do a two for tuesday on thursday and i said no he says you can't do a two for tuesday on a thursday but i do like where you're going because i do enjoy making these little rant videos you know uh and i try to incorporate a little lesson in life uh so grab your pipe and smoke with me we're gonna call this thirsty thursday yeah what do you guys think about that thirsty thursday paul the pipe guy live here and we're about ready to kick off our first thirsty thursday so grab your favorite pipe your favorite blend load up a couple of bowls grab your favorite adult beverage if that's what you prefer i personally like bush but then again who doesn't like bush it's a great beer so anyways yeah grab grab your pipe in an adult beverage and if you don't drink uh if you don't grab a pint of beer uh maybe grab a scotch or a bourbon or a whiskey cognac whatever you prefer coffee whatever so anyway so um i uh did a review and uh you've seen my uh peterson tankard pipe and uh i was thinking today i'd really like to smoke this one on our thirsty thursday but i've smoked this every day for like three or four days in a row and i just want to let it rest yeah you can't smoke a pipe every single day the same pipe uh it just gets wet inside uh you know even if you clean it out uh tobacco smoke has or tobacco uh has a lot of pipe tobacco has a lot of moisture in it and so you really should if you're going to do an all-day smoke or whatever or an all-night smoke you should let it rest after a day or so and let it rest for a few days uh a week is uh the best so uh that's my tankered peterson pipe and i was looking through my collection and i thought wait a minute i have a couple of other ones and so the first one and i do have one of my subscribers that loves gbds this is a vintage estate gbd it's got the little gbd silver medallion in the sign uh in the side and it's a gbd 1008 bowl i don't know how old this pipe is but i suspect it might be and it's very similar to my brand new tankard pipe so would this be considered a tankered pipe i hope i'm saying that right so that's the first one the gbd 1008 ball with a little silver gbd medallion in the side the second one again very similar to my tankard pipe almost the same almost identical to the gbd really if you look at it in comparison you know uh so would that be considered tankard and this one is a commoys the everyman it says on the side bowl number 588 yeah so uh inside of the gbd i have some wonderful vanilla custard oh i love that stuff it's so sweet and inside the comboys no i take that back inside the convoys i have some wonderful vanilla custard and inside the gbd i have some marvelous hazelnut yeah both are light aromatics and they will not give you a lot of tongue bite the worst tongue bite i think i ever had was uh when my girlfriend uh no we won't go there never mind uh the worst tongue bite i think i've ever had uh was i think i smoked like four bowls of the captain black cherry aromatic which is really really that stuff is strong and ma'am i was smoking it every day and i was like holy smokes it felt like my tongue was peeling off ah so let's rest and have a point together or whatever you want to have ah yeah thirsty's thursday is going good so far but it just can't get any better without letting up some vanilla custard in my comoise bowl number five every 588 the everyman i suspect by the design on the side there was probably from the 60s or 70s but i don't know i don't know how to date these pipes so here we go i packed that one a little tight um so how's everybody's week going mine's going good they've had me doing a lot of different things at work and uh they have me training a new guy they finally said after two and a half years of being in the sheet metal business doing mostly uh work for the military they're like hey we're gonna give you a guy and we want you to train him i'm like all right i'm all on i can do it um oh god this vanilla custard is so good and if you'll notice in this video you don't hear the drone of my air purifier going in the background i cannot turn that off you know because all you hear is white noise in the background going you know i gotta loosen this up a little bit paul gilson you should be able to pack a bowl better than this in fact my trainee i told him i says uh when i get out of here i'm gonna go home and have a beer and i'm gonna smoke a couple of bowls and he's probably about 18 19 years old and he's like really you're gonna go home smoke a couple bowls i said yeah but not uh marijuana bowls i said i uh collect uh antique uh pipes and new pipes and i smoke i smoke a pipe so i'm gonna go home and smoke a pipe a bowl of uh tobacco pipe tobacco but the look i got it was priceless oh this stuff is so good um well so i have a new sponsor for my youtube channel and um we're going to take a short break and uh pause for uh a commercial here and uh i'll be uh right back i hope you uh like my new sponsor uh paul the pipe guy we'll be right back after this station

anyways i'm dr gerbau talk to your doctor today about make some sense and ask him if it's gonna work for you and buy my damn pipes oh lord what what the heck what what kind of a commercial is that i had to light up a cigarette after seeing that one and uh the sponsor uh contacted me and uh on my way home from work and uh said they wanted to sponsor my youtube channel and uh of course i didn't see that video all right put the side effects oh my god well anyways uh that's the only sponsor i could find for my channel guys and girls all right and i can't help the side effects maybe i'll try it i have had the sudden urge to bitch-slap stupid people lately and yes i am smoking a cigarette so uh other than our uh sponsor on our little break there how's everybody's week going uh yeah mine was going great um ah lord paul what have you gotten yourself into so pipe smoking has drastically reduced my cigarette consumption but i still enjoy smoking my cigarettes but uh i love smoking my pipes too and i don't inhale those so it's actually cut my cigarette smoking in half yeah that's pretty good right i don't know if you can see it but check out this i can't dump these ashes all over you gotta i'll show it to you another time all right it's a bronze ashtray which is uh actually uh probably from the 1920s it's very art deco and i bought it many years ago probably about 30 years ago from uh an antique shop and it's it's pretty cool yeah it's got like these cool little arches that go over there and actually it was probably like a promotional type of thing it says canton stoker corporation canton ohio and canton stoker corporation that would be like would that be like a boilermaker or something like that i think so uh i used to have an ashtray and i don't know where it went uh it was probably from the 1940s or 50s and it said house of representatives united states of america had the eagle and everything on it and stars around the eagle beautiful crystal ashtray and uh somehow it came up missing and over the years i've had things that have come up missing i had uh i had sons that needed money for things that we didn't want them to do i'm just gonna leave it at that and i think a lot of my stuff went to the pawn shop yeah well anyways aren't drugs wonderful yeah so uh this week's been a good week i've been really happy i've been sleeping very well uh training this new kid and that's funny i'm 56 years old so technically in six years i could retire although i'll probably work instead until 62 probably work till 67 because the difference in our social security between 62 and 67 is a pretty big difference i mean i could survive on my social security at 62. we'll just have to wait and see how i feel i mean you know if i'm not feeling the work thing i mean i'll always work i'll always do something you always have to have a purpose in life even if i retired even volunteering at an old folks home or something like that you know would be cool going in there with my guitar doing karaoke singing to old ladies yeah uh actually uh when i was a young teenager i took up a morning paper route and one of my customers i uh well actually i had several in this building it was an assisted living home and it was a large very large home uh that was converted into an assisted living home in the village of spencer port where i grew up not far from where i live now it's a really nice little village uh and uh so it was this big white house there were i don't know between four and six residents and uh most of them were actually wives that were founders and uh had husbands that owned businesses and so forth uh you know around the turn of the century and in the early 1900s 1920s 30s 40s 50s their husbands owned very successful businesses and so they would go there uh when they became old and their kids thought they couldn't live in their house anymore but i used to enjoy going in and uh i'd go in there to collect for the newspaper on a saturday uh every saturday and i would go room to room i would talk to every resident there and it was wonderful they were like books of knowledge just history just unbelievable and i really loved it a lot i'd go in there and play checkers and dominoes with them and they loved it when i came around uh i don't know how often they were visited by family or whatever but they kind of became my family there was one guy and this was 1980. he was 96 years old his name was bill and bill used to have a huge like one gallon folger's coffee can sit next to his uh recliner in his room he had a black and white tv and he chewed uh what was it uh red man chewing tobacco which has got to be the most rotten gut stuff ever and i'd go in there and be like hey bill it's paul i'm here to see you man and he'd have a whole mouthful and juice would be like dripping down either side you know tobacco juice chewing tobacco juice and he'd be like lean over this recliner and be like coughing up along spitting out this whole gob of red man chewing tobacco that he had in his mouth and uh hand me the money for the paper i'd sit there and i'd i'd talk to him for a while well one day i went in there this spittoon that he had i don't think it been emptied and god knows how long you know the big coffee cans the real big ones the biggest ones you can get this thing was full and as he's reaching over to get some money for me tips the thing over and it tips over and it's like syrup just running across the floor was like disgusting so anyways i'm going to open my second beer yeah for thirsty thursday thanks buddy for suggesting that uh and yes i am thirsty so i have work tomorrow and tomorrow is friday and then i have saturday and sunday off which weekends are always nice i never had a job where ever since i was 12 years old where i had weekends off i always worked in the restaurant business or the car business or i had a paper route which is seven days a week or i worked in retail where you just never got

demonstration of an alternative to the bong this is what we call a chilled um more commonly known as the pipe so the way this would work is you would need some you would need to put the stuff over here then you would need to make a fist put it here bring him out here then light it on fire and inhale just the way you would do with the bomb but the only difference is you don't need to release anything you just need to inhale like you would now small joint that's it", "SMYga91qnGE": "[Music] [Music] [Music] hey guys I just wanted to share today a little pie pack again this is something that's pretty inconspicuous something pretty cheap simple and you know you can you can use this and just toss it in your toolbox or throw it in a drawer somewhere and really no one would pay much attention to it so it's kind of a stealth factor and really it's just a simple fitting and all it is this is like the hardware store Chilam or one-hitter or something it's a quarter inch hose barb and it goes to 1/2 inch and he's actually come in several different sizes they got like bigger ones and smaller ones but this one's pretty much cool for me you know it it goes down probably I don't know maybe 3/4 of an inch or so if I can get close here it's got an eighth inch inner diameter so it's got a little bit of a bowl in there to where it won't want to just suck straight through so I mean this this works pretty good by itself it's solid brass you know so it's good that way but there are some things you can do to it there are actually several things but one thing is like this right here this is just quarter inch inner diameter tubing three eighths outer and I've already got this piece cut and everything but what you can do if you want is you get some of this tubing and the tubing is pretty cheap it's like I don't know like three bucks for ten feet of it but the thing is you know once you put this on here you want to be tight you're not really gonna be able to pull it off oh sorry I was out of the camera there you're not really gonna be able to pull it off you're gonna have to cut it off but as cheap as the tubing is you know you can you can live with that so there's a nice little Chilam it's pretty sweet-looking really I love making these things man I'm I'm always looking for [ __ ] that I can [ __ ] turn into a pipe that's crazy but yeah I'm gonna keep making these videos and actually my next video is gonna be pretty pretty badass you know I think because I got this bubbler I've already made it but I'm gonna make the video tomorrow I'm going to make another one it's a I call it the hillbilly bubbler it's pretty sweet so but yeah back to this um yeah pretty nice little pipe and you could make this as long or short as you want you could cut it right off at the end there but I think it's about right just like that and you can get got a good little Bowl sighs so smoke on it for a while but I think I'm gonna make another video I always wanted to throw this video out there I don't know I thought it was kind of a neat little thing here you can just pick up this piece at almost any hardware store if you're in a pinch you know or something like that and you can use it directly as it is or like you said you can throw this this vinyl tubing on here and make you a little heat shield plus a mouthpiece but I'm gonna make something else out of one of these and I'm gonna make another video and I'm just gonna keep on figuring out [ __ ] that I can make and make videos of it so alright guys that's all I wanted to show today just this little DIY Chilam again

day we've been having and I found this spot that I've never even made a video at it's a beautiful spot so I thought why not post up load a bowl I have the Snodgrass here so I hope wherever you are we it is legal you're smoking along and even if weed is illegal I hope you're still out there smoking along for those who can't we're smoking for you let's fire it up it's been a little bit windy today and this pipe is perfect for windy days because usually it just keeps on going I hope you guys are all having a wonderful day I actually have some new weed from what I showed you guys last time so I am enjoying my day check that out guys that's some Tahoe right there and I also picked up a really dope rolling tray I love beavis and butthead so I saw this I had to get this that's Beavis and Butthead just smoking up right there honestly I wish they had some episodes I wish they did more of that kind of stuff in those types of cartoons I'm glad South Park is finally doing more weed related stuff I love the Tegrity farms honestly think they pretty much saved South Park by doing that stuff this stuff is flushed really nice too which is something I look for helps with potency a lot and just overall makes the weed a lot better let me know what you guys are smoking on out there and this spot is actually really cool because technically I'm standing above water but there's a layer of ice and then another layer of snow but normally during the summer where I'm at there would be water right here where I'm at so I wouldn't even be able to come out here during the summer but during the summer I have my other spot that's by the same River but just way down like this River goes for miles it goes all across town shout-out to Bob Snodgrass he makes wonderful pipes it's a pretty expensive pipe for a pipe but when you really smoke out of it you understand why it was so much and this has some history behind it this keeps not going I just really can't get enough of this strain and it smells really good too I mean most of the stuff around Colorado is like this for the most part you'll have dispensaries a few of them you need to watch out for that just have horrible stuff but if you find the right place like this whatever you buy when you just open the jar the smell just jumps out at you and if you have any of this kind of stuff on you and you go to any kind of public place everyone can smell it around you and I'm sure even people in illegal places can get that because a lot of homegrown stuff can actually smell a lot more for some reason I've noticed I have no clue why but that's just what I found whenever I bought weed from a dealer who had really good weed that's the smelliest stuff I've ever had and who knows that could be the best stuff I've ever had cheers guys hit me hard now if you like what you saw make sure to give a hit to that thumbs up button something like this subscribe if you wanna see boo if you want to see more I needed that cop right there leave any questions concerns anything else in the comments I'll see you guys next time", "mDH4KTc5Dwk": "getting the White Glove treatment today is the wig wag lined Chilam by blazing blue glass blazing blue glass is the company that created the first glass screen and if you look inside this Chilam it has the glass screen installed in there built in to the Chilam really neat another another really cool thing about smokin J's is I'm friends with the the company and I begged them about once a year to make me some of these they don't like making them anymore they're so busy making their screens and some of their more simple pipes that smoke and Jase is the only place will you'll find the blazing blue glass wig wag lined Chilam with the built-in screen and they're full color we'll be doing a white glove video on their full color Chilam another time but right now look at this beauty love that built-in screen really blocks a lot of the Scooby Snacks from getting in your mouth just a really nice pipe", "m_eNUDztXsg": "this is like a one-hitter but it's pretty big actually and the Bulls pretty big they call them oh gee Chilam I have big hands but this thing is deep like that thing is nearly an inch deep you could take ten heads out of your a girl and five heads out if you're a hard hitter but we have these these are super clean here in Los Angeles I got this for two dollars two dollars even most places some for like four or five dollars but this place was advertising it when I went in there for two dollars right on the counter and they're very classy and very nice and they hit very clean just crazy two bucks so I just cleaned i'ma try it out well let you know the two dollars Oh G chillin", "DZA-4Csi3lo": "better be our back another review and today we are checking out this graph labs Chilam so without further ado let's hop right into the review so we got this graph labs Chilam here and the one thing that i did like about this particular thing right off the bat was what it was made of it's made with Baro glass the for us to look at Pyrex glass so you don't have to worry about this basically shattering under extreme temperatures so we did want to hit this with a torch or something you wouldn't have to worry about that so that is one thing you get right off the bat that is nice about this is what's made with and grabbed labs makes about medium medium grade glass I'd say not high-end not low-end for sure but probably medium grade glass it's more of an industrial type of look to it which is something similar to this which is kind of more scientific or industrial in regards to the way the chilla is not heavy at all and it does have a very industrial look to it not much fanciness on it which is nice sometimes it's nice to get a nice plain glass piece we have here grav labs is etched in there as you can see right here and it's basically the inverse edging which allows you to have the smoother part be the actual logo and the etched part be the background and then on the inside here we can see our nice little double pinch all the way through and see it goes to like a nice little hourglass right there this is going to be the end where you're gonna put your material that you're smoking right here and you do have a nice long straw part from where the actual Bowl is so where the mouthpiece is you don't to worry about that getting too hot so you can definitely use this for multiple uses but I haven't worried about it getting too hot again your you're dealing with burro glass here so it's gonna be really easy to clean it's not gonna stain that's another big thing to at the borer glasses it doesn't stain a lot of the times you'll get resin buildup especially on something like this which probably wouldn't get cleaned that off then you get resin buildup on it and it eventually will discolor the glass this will look like the day that you bought it as long as you clean it with some like isopropanol or some kind of a solvent that's going to get anything this after class should make it look exactly like this so that's a little plus in this and this was on the economical side we're talking ten bucks here for a nice little chillin like this that's retail that's how much you would pay if you were to look this up on the internet and go find it yourself but you have about ten bucks pretty nice little chillin here definitely something that's a nice price point for a throwaway piece or something that you might want to keep in your arsenal for daily use or even occasional use so I like this if you like chums let us know in the comments below if you like grab labs as a glass maker or glass blower let us know in the comments below as well if you've had any other products just shoot us up so comments down there and let us know how your experience was with them like this video give it a thumbs up what more content like this subscribe for more we do smoking reviews every single Monday so be on the lookout for that and have a great rest your day", "a4JgvU1BNXg": "I've already taken three hits out of it it's still probably half full hey I said he's only $2 but that's some god Bless America [ __ ] we live like this and we think nothing of it when you travel you'll see how bad it gets because people are living in a dream like I said this is something like this if you could find it in Canada would be 20 or 25 bucks they easily get 25 for this maybe 30 trying to come up with good ways to hold the phone so I can get video it's a learning curve like I said it doesn't even matter cuz no one's watching my [ __

didn't pack it tight five hitter one hitter five hitter Chilam was a guy go Eagles Cheers imagine you're smoking weed but you look like a dope fiend pale Tweaker then don't get me wrong not everyone who smokes meth or does speed is a Tweaker but 99% of them are tweeters and they look like [ __ ] and they're a mess their whole life is a mess and there's lots of mothers and fathers that are in that position I feel sorry for them in a way", "gleWTcMMSGU": "hey guys so I Dennis just had to close the toilet lay this so that like the seat set my phone would fall into it while I was filming because it almost happened so that's how my name's going that was very close today's video I'm going to be doing a little kind of a review I've used it before so it's not like my first time using it or anything but it's the best one I've ever used for sure it's my favorite so it's a spring pastry bat by riot and it looks like that just ignore my greasy fingernails as usual and this one is the one made in bamboo so they come in a bunch of different wood finishes and colors they also come in different like types in general so the one I got is like the spring day strap because it has this little spring right there so that makes it a lot easier to like pop out the leftovers after you hit it and stuff like I'm going to dig it out with a funkier whatever you just bobby pin you know you feel it's just a lot easier you know and it's just really quick especially if you're like on the go that's why I [ __ ] love it okay because let me tell you if you're about personally me and you want to hit it quick at work or something or but like if you want to be super handy if you're at like a concert or something that was one of their little selling points when I bought it honestly if you're anywhere in public it goes in your purse so [ __ ] easy and you can use the tube that it comes with to put your busted weed into so if you it comes with like I read it usable cap and everything so it just pops back into a rubber lid and it's like a hard plastic cap so or to my mat I'm kind of stunned so you can keep your weed in there and then when you're ready to pack it on the go you just go like that the lead will be packed you know so I just really love this thing I bought it for seventeen dollars where I live I liked it on my mind though it looks like it's a lot cheaper if you buy it online so you can get it right from their site I don't know if it's on the bottle nope it is wrong yeah so it says Bryant right there it's like engraved into it and then the piece that you smoking of his metal it's a metal spring but the rest of it is bamboo so you only live it up and show you guys how she goes Stephanie my favorite one-hitter of you because it's just so small and like convenient and I'm gonna all 100 small obviously but I like the whole spring-loaded idea it's just really easy to use on the go and they also have another version that you can can wear it comes with a cute little box type thing that slides this into one little hole and the other side has a thing for weed in it so you can pack it through there super easily but like honestly if you want to save your money it's not really worth getting the case like the case is just kind of for show so if you just get one of these guys in the plastic tubing it's a lot cheaper and yeah I just don't see the point in having like a fancy case for this I don't know Cheers she gets heavy she gets real heavy see it's a one-hitter but I always get a good like - it's off then sometimes three so it definitely don't look like they get them out of weed and really get to be high like a lot more high than a playboy I don't know why that's like strange Ciavarella and regarding my last video where I mention that there's putting card problems and I [ __ ] pretty much broke and trying to find an apartment could be homeless my car broke down again once I thought it was fixed at work so got fixed again but I don't want to say it's good because that feels like [ __ ] bad karma or some [ __ ] to say because every time I say it's fixed something goes wrong so hopefully we're good to go down and then what else did I say oh we have the whole apartment thing I did say that I could be on this and I went to this viewing and the people that I met there with the viewing were really really nice it's like a professional apartment building so when you put my money down on it they really preserve it for you and stop all viewings so that it's basically yours but then they have to accept your application still so there's still a bit of like it's not 100 percent sure that you have it so basically we winter over that I put the money down on it and now we're just waiting to hear back to see it's actually ours so reality of being a millennial is I'm moving you a shitty apartment it wastes moment and it's gonna cost me $100 more a month $120 a month to live in I've shaded your smaller apartment and then in the summer it's like $180 for to use an air conditioner of your own for the season or something she is so like she was free with all the like it's it's actually really depressing like I'm not gonna let me get to me I'll make the apartment cute and stuff but honestly like cut down like the fact that I'm paying so much money to live in not the nicest apartment and going to be not biggest apartment it's just kind of like a closed mind because I've been a really nice place now and the fact that I'm gonna be downgrading for the more money you just kind of like hurts the [ __ ] soul I will be a good fine seriously look on the bright side I'll make this apartment super homey and I already got super cozy I have this room that when I walked in it was full of somebody else's boxes so I mean that's a good thing and how to keep a little bar in the kitchen so I can like decorate that don't you I don't know like I was just looking at I'm already mentally thinking of how I can like set it up to make it all at home in mind but hope I'm just really hoping they accept the application because it's gonna be so hard to get the like money transferred whatever the [ __ ] I got back cuz I'm we have to like our whole thing isn't fun okay I love this little video also was this him wearing lipstick and it doesn't stain yet but that's because my lipsticks dry not because lipstick goes to stain it yikes oh my god I took the cap off and then when you put it back on I hope you guys enjoyed that little riot review it wasn't even our video I don't know what it is I just wanna show it to you guys because it's mine a little way to pick it up besides money bomb [Music] I'm so okay well help you guys are having a little lovely evening morning whatever the [ __ ] time it is where you are oh you so much thank you if

video", "FaPB0kwfHtQ": "hello everybody and welcome back to the restart CBD channel my name is shade I'm one of the cofounders of restart CBD and today's video is a how-to or tutorial on cleaning your pipe so I have a nice dirty pipe for you guys that we're going to clean today with some simple household ingredients to clean your pipe you need three things four things if you count your pipe but to clean actually you're gonna start with a plastic baggie because this is what you're going to place your pipe into you're going to need some salts and then you're gonna need some rubbing alcohol and that's pretty much it I hope you guys tune along and learn something new about how to keep your pieces nice and clean okay we're gonna get started and I'm going to start by opening the bag up okay giving it a little bit of a lip I'm gonna place on my pipe inside and then I'm gonna also caveat this with I am NOT a scientist I am also not a professional cleaner so this is all very anecdotal it's a little bit of like you know chooser an adventure I realize I'm probably not gonna have the vegetables because musing of course it's all you do think of this all just kind of breaking up that debris in your pipe but you know what we're gonna go with it cuz salt is salt but what I'm gonna do is pour the salt directly into the bag I'm gonna try to pour directly into the bowl for those of you who maybe don't have a pipe in front of you that's dirty I encourage you to go grab something just folks so you can make a pipe dirty I'm sad we've been using this pipe for a little bit you can tell just share the colors change it's got some discharge in there and so that's really what I'm trying to clean and ulcers from a sanitation perspective if you're putting your mouth on are you putting your hands on it so I was good just to keep your pipe clean so I'm gonna put that back in the bag and then again scientifically some stuff on the internet says a teaspoon of salts use your eyes go crazy trying to kind of pour some salts in there again focusing directly on that like Bowl piece and then I'm gonna take the alcohol and I'm gonna port enough just to kind of cover the pipe so it can fit and break down that salt and then I'm gonna shake everything in the bag so yeah we're just gonna pour that right over there and he wanted to be able to cover the pipe get inside of the mouth and you can already kind of see some of the debris is moving all I'm gonna do now is wrap this air out and basically all you're gonna do is just like start shaking the pipe that's all that salt in there you can do this for a couple of minutes you might start seeing the water is changing color that debris is coming out I can definitely see that part of the pipe is already getting cleaner just from me letting it fit in this rubbing alcohol for a couple seconds depending on how dirty your piece is you might want to let it sit in this overnight or for a couple hours just kind of gauge and see obviously shouldn't have the size of your piece it might take longer more salt getting into those nooks and crannies I know some of the pipes I have have you know kind of interesting shapes and so sometimes things can get stuck and clogged in interesting places but yeah I mean you can kind of tell like I said the water is changing if I just keep shaking this up I'm gonna go ahead and let my pipe sit for a couple of minutes and movie magic I actually have been shaking my pipe for about the past five to six minutes I can already tell that it's working its magic the pipe is looking clean the water is not so what I'm going to do is go rinse my pipe out make sure all the salt is gone just give it a nice little water bath and I will check right back in with you guys and see how we did and that is a pretty dang clean pipe I think there's a little speck of something in there if I would have left it longer or shaking it some of the stuff on the internet recommends getting a q-tip with alcohol and kind of going in depending on again your piece you're going to want to take a little bit different care cleaning it but for your basic pipes I'd say that's a pretty job well done and took just a couple of household ingredients and a little bit of time and now my piece is sanitized and clean and ready for my next smoking adventure so thanks for joining the research CVD YouTube channel

"alright guys today is 4/20 so I thought I'd show you guys how to make some pipes today alright so to get started I'm making some pipes we're gonna need a few things to get started first you're gonna want your handy dandy needle tool you're gonna need your wooden knife you're gonna want some slip and your paintbrush to apply the slip with you need a sponge in water some clay and you're also gonna want um a chopstick if you don't have a chopstick you could do something like a pencil or a wooden skewer or something preferably something wouldn't know because we're going to be sculpting our pipes around this and it tends to not stick to the clay as much so when we go to pull off our piece at the end it does come off pretty easily so the first pipe that I'm going to show you guys is just a basic little chill so we're gonna get some clay out to get started I'm gonna grab this is probably even too much maybe not that much um and this is already wedged clay I'm not gonna wedge it right now but if you clays knowledge you definitely want to wedge it before you get started with this so first off I'm just gonna roll out a little coil kind of a fat little coil flatten the ends a little bit probably something like that it's pretty good to get started with and now I'm going to take that handy Dayton chopstick I was talking about and this is basically gonna create the tunnel that the swamp travels through in our pipe so what you're gonna want to do find this find the center of that coil and gently just push there you can twist it and push through at the same time to kind of get it to go evenly and you definitely want to make sure you're pushing this in straight because obviously if you start going in an angle might pop through out the side rather than out here just take your time with this gently push it through until it pops out let me other side alright I'm just gonna roll this out a little bit so I did and I messed up the shape a little bit as I was doing that here we have our coil on a stick right doesn't look like much right now but we're going to say this into a chillin I promise so we even wanna do is grow another little piece of clay probably about you know quarter of the size that you pulled out for your coil about that big you're just gonna roll it out and then we're going to make this into a tiny little pinch pot essentially so I'm gonna use my little pinky to kind of press kinda press in that hole then I'm slowly gonna open it up that the edges are cracking go ahead and take some water and just sponge it out right so something like that small cute little baby pinch pot and what we're going to do is attach it here so before we touch we're going to need to slip and score take your needle tool scratch all around here you score it really nice and both directions you're gonna do the same on the bottom of this guy here scratch little pinch pot grab paint brush get that both sides oh so what we're gonna do you can push this down a little bit because we're going to use the tip of this to go through our little pinch pot so take the tip find the center of the little pinch pot and again just twist and push through and once you get to this point you can twist it in to get that to attach really nicely and then once we are done with that we can go ahead and take our wooden knife and start smoothing that in now if you want this to look like one tube rather than a little pinch pot attached to the coil you can go ahead and do a couple things one you take a little more clay a little small little coil like that and put it in put it over the spot where we attached a baby pinch pot and then smooth that in press it in and then smooth it in that's all smooth then you can even roll this out a little bit like if you'd like to add any texture you can totally go ahead and do that right now before we take this guy off okay we've got our nice little tube I'm gonna use this pen to add a little bit of texture all over this guy protection you can seriously use anything at all or if you don't want any texture at all that's also an option [Music] all right so now I'm pretty much done with this guy so what I'm gonna do to take it off is just hold it nice and firm and slowly twist and pull this out should come out pretty easy and if you have any clay clogging the hole in there you can totally just take your needle tool grab those little chunks and then you can also even take your finger to just smooth out the roughness down in there and there you have a cute little Chum all right for our next pipe we're gonna do a little bit more of a classic shape but essentially using the same methods we did perch on so once again I'm going grab some clay you're gonna a little bit more clay than last time you want a ball up your clay and once again we're gonna make a fat coil just trying to start rolling one out I would say this thickness is pretty good I definitely would not go any thicker than an inch I'm just because I could lead to you know crocks or even explosions in the firing a little less than an inch thick here I'm gonna cut off the ends just so I have a nice flat surface to work with for this one I'm gonna do more like a rectangular shape but you can feel free to leave it like this I'm gonna go ahead and just flatten out one side flip it over and do the other side so I kind of get this like rectangular shape kind of going on here this is a little bit long for me so I am going to cut off and alright so we've got this thick almost 1 inch size coil that we're working with for you could be any shape you want I'm kind of doing a rectangle shape for this one so again I'm going to take my handy dandy chopstick and now what we're gonna do here is push this through however we're going to be impressing a little divot here afterwards and that's gonna be our bold chamber so we need to leave enough width here to leave space for the indent for the bowl so for it for pushing this hole I would go slightly like if this if this were halfway right here I would go slightly a step down so then that'll leave more space here for a divot for a bowl so what I'm gonna do find that little spire there and just start twisting and pushing through again you want to kind of do this as straight as possible might help to just have it laying on your table and keeping your chopstick parallel at the table or you can hold it in your hand whatever feels most comfortable is what you should do just keep going until you finally get through to that other side so we're through do this a little bit once you put this chopstick through your piece you will notice that your your the shape of your coil will kind of stretch out a little bit because you are putting something through it so go ahead and just reshape it a little bit you'd like so now I'm going to kind of mark this little spot right here right now what you can do you can literally just push in here be bike however that will start stretching out your shape a little bit because that clay has to go somewhere if you'd like you can also take a ribbon tool a little loop tool like this guy and kind of scoop some of it out be careful here because you don't want to go too deep and hit that chopstick go ahead open this up and remember this is gonna shrink so make sure you're happy with the bowl size all right smooth that out a little bit now what we can do guys we've got our bowl set what we can do is take another handy dandy chopstick and press down in the very center of that bowl until you are touching the chopstick right here so basically you just go straight down until you start hitting your chopstick and that's how you know through now when you do this you will be able to see how much space you have left before hitting this so the bottom of my bowl is still pretty thick which means I can dig this out a little bit more and I mean if you're like me you're gonna want a bigger bowl for more weed all right so again this guy is going straight down and hitting it my first chopstick right I was pretty good again if you would like to apply any texture you can totally go ahead and feel free to do that right now I'm just gonna leave this one as it is but feel free to add whatever you would like once again to pull this out I'm just going to slowly twist and pull taking my time all right and again if you have any small clay chunks clogging the hole feel free to take your needle tool and just gently [Music] kind of pull them out looks good there looks good I'm just gonna smooth this out a little bit and just like that we have a pipe with a carb ready all right guys we're gonna do one last pipe so you're gonna get about same amount of cleaning hot pickle lasts one hour something like that go ahead and ball it up and just like before we're gonna make this into a quill just a little bit long for what I need so I'm gonna go ahead and cut it off about there cut this off so we've got a flattening to work with so that is good to go gonna take our handy-dandy chopstick or for this one I don't want to poke all the way through because I don't want a car over here I want to I want to put my carb on the side of this pipe so what I'm gonna do before I stick it into the coil I'm going to kind of just measure it all the way to the end and just take either a needle tool and make some little scratch marks oh you can take a pencil or mark or whatever and just mark the end of there so that when we poke the top stick through we know where to stop before pushing through the end of our coil so I'm gonna go ahead find the center point or coil and just start twisting down again you want to make sure that you're twisting this in as straight as possible and then you're going to want to just make sure that you stop once you get to those marks that we made earlier so right there is where I'm gonna stop and for this one I'm gonna do a little bit of sculpting on here so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna kind of do a more classic pipe shape so for me I'm going to kind of pinch around here to kind of separate the bowl area from the handle of the pipe I'm just pinching and turn kind of make that bowl pronounced and then for the handle I'm gonna keep on squeezing your clay start to get a little dry I feel free to just add some water so we got those cracks I'm kinda gonna round out this whole area here instead of having a sharp edge I'm just gonna smooth out some of these bumps with my finger this is a little bit long so I'm gonna go ahead and cut it off about there then down here I'm also got around this now I feel free to just kind of take chunks off if it's something we got too much there I'm just kind of start to see that classic phallic pipe shape coming just tapping this to kind of round it out a little bit more in my poem and I'm also just gonna I'm just going to wipe my finger and just kind of smooth out some of these bumps and ridges alright I'm also just going to pick a side that I want to be the bottom and just kind of tap it so that it's flat and not rolling around I hate pipes that just roll it all over the table alright now we can take a note chopstick and what we're gonna do is find the center of our bowl right here we're just going to press that chopstick in until we meet with that first chopstick once you feel it pressing against another chopstick go ahead and take it out and then what we can do here you can either start opening this up with your fingers or again you can take your loop tool and just start carving it out a little bit we're gonna while I was doing that I accidentally killed in my coal so I'm just gonna take my chopstick again press through until I feel that bottom chopstick and after I did that I can see that the base of my bowl can still be dug out a little bit more so I'm gonna go ahead and just scoop a little bit more clay out take my finger and dip it in some water just to kind of smooth this out a little bit chopstick and again just kind of spread space out that clay all right now if you want to add a carb we're gonna do that you don't have to add a car but I personally like to have one additionally just for smoking purposes I'm gonna put it on the left-hand side because I prefer to hold the lighter in my right hand and then hit the car with this hand but if you're left-handed and you want it on this side until you do it on this side does not matter I'm gonna take my pipe and I'm kind of gonna eyeball where my chopstick is at so it looks like it's about right there so I'm gonna go ahead press this down and just twist and press and I'm just gonna twist and press down until I feel it meeting with that chopstick again which I do I'm gonna pull that guy out where is that right so now we've got our carb and our Bowl now you can feel free to add any sort of textural design you like I'm gonna apply some little balls onto here so I'm just gonna roll out a couple of little tiny balls so normally when you're attaching two pieces of clay together you do want to slip in score because these balls are so small I'm just gonna add a little bit of slip and press them in pretty good come on but if you are worried about them falling off or anything like that Rafi you're using larger pieces different you know bigger attachments I would recommend swine I'm just going to flip these guys kind of press them on alright guys so once you are done applying your texture you can go ahead and pull it off that chopstick just carefully grab it and twist and pull out and again if any of your poles are clogged it all feel free to just grab your needle tool and get any chunks that are out of the way make sure that both your bowl hole and your car bowl are cleared and you're good to go alright guys so a couple last things first before you fire these you definitely want to make sure these get completely bone dry because they are a little bit thick I'd recommend keeping them covered in plastic for a day or two and then I'm covering them and leaving them out to dry for about five days or so secondly you can totally feel free to combine any of these methods to make your own awesome creation hope you guys enjoyed and happy 4/20", "RH3X8ePmfS0": "[Applause] [Music] what's up everybody its wispy hemp today I want to show you guys a little pipe hack here for making a one-hitter this is a zebra f30 one pin and a lot of people don't know but when the Chinese were developing this they actually intended it to be a one-hitter I don't know if that's true or not but yes you can make a pretty awesome little one header out of this so just going to show you guys how I do this here so take the pin apart take out all the little pieces here this is important part here this is the bowl the pin cap and this is all metal I don't know it's steel I don't know if it's stainless steel I doubt it but it's an all steel construction so really no plastic now the only tricky part with this is this piece right here sometimes it doesn't just slide out like that there's little tabs and sometimes you'll have to use a pair of pliers or something to yank that out but on if you can see here there's a little like where that black thing is there's a little divot right there and sometimes it can be a pain to pull out so if you have to just use pliers so basically there is all of that then you got your steel tube here and you got your bowl so now what you want to do and I usually put the bowl on this end here I don't know why I just used to do it that way basically you stick it in here this is the fun part so if you can see actually it's just hard for my camera to focus on this thing right here but it doesn't go all the way in now this is what makes this so neat so once it's in that far get your handy dandy little hammer out and basically what you're gonna do is you're gonna pound this in and just pressure fit it in there and it doesn't take a whole lot so let me get this there and just kind of tap it a little bit that time you can see it went in a little bit and basically what you want to do is just tap it in until I'm sorry I wish this would focus I don't know if I can get it to or not come on there we go you can see the where the where the two meet there you just want it to be perfectly flush so so keep it uh keep it going there's a couple taps that should do it I'm kind of stuck into the coffee table there now if you see here and zoom this in again you can see it's kind of just flared out a little bit well it's pressure fit in there and this thing will have a really hard time coming out so you got this little inverted pin cap here and it's a perfect bowl and you got your in there now what you can do and I have one this one's really old but so basically that's all it is I mean there there's your little one hitter and if you want you can take apart another pin if you have one and take the grip of it off and you can make it like this because this thing will heat up real quick it'll get hot so yep wispy him DIY one-hitter peace out [Music] lotta [ __ ] in there man YouTube that [ __ ] that's coach Eric agenda 9/11 lies September Clues stand for man don't get caught in a [ __ ] cage", "ym04xI95t7k": "this pipe is very interesting too because you know literally it just has the bowl right here which you can for your tobacco product and there is no carburetor on this particular one and just a mouthpiece as you can see it's a very stylized very artsy and really easy to hold because it has this little indentation right here for you to hold it nice and simply you can literally push this into your tobacco product so it fills up there and then put your mouth right on here and there's no need for a screen because as you can see the hole right there will prevent anything from going into the chamber again a very simple design very discreet and good for both novice and experienced smokers", "3Y_J3wJnhGM": "welcome to this episode Fernand learn like to give a shout-out to Bo J Donnell and Scott glad you guys enjoy the show like to introduce Brian today he's going to be on the torch after I demonstrate how to make a one-hitter and all the practice device we have a practice device to show you this will up build up your strength and your dexterity what I did is I take a piece of seven mill taped a piece of string on there and then hung a weight on it maybe like a double-a batteries but to get size weight and this will help you a whole bunch and then notice how it lines up in my hand here and I spin it see how this rod is lined up with your knuckles you should stay just like that and then this is your pivot point between here and here is where the rod should be pivoting in there and use this as your power and this is your pivot okay you got that roll it down and don't let it just fall down you got to let it down with your fingers try to use all your fingers let down use all your fingers bring it back up and then try to go a couple rolls down a couple of rules up a couple rolls down a couple of rolls up nice little exercise device you'll love it but cats make the one we already did this one typically ever done okay so let's pull this part off to here mean it anymore honey up I'm going to show you the parts that mattered about a one-hitter which is the constriction and opening the front so come in here all you have to do is heat the glass push in slightly when it gets real molten and it'll gather up just like that give a little puff that is perfect okay open the front pick the front open now before it gets don't melt the whole bunch you stuff in here just barely melt it and flare it at the same time if you let too much material melt it'll make this big molten down it on there and it'll get all crazy on you says heat it up slightly flare it heat it up slightly again flare it heat it up slightly again all this gathering the glass here to make it thick make a nice controlled little thick donut there on the end not one that's all out of control and that's it that's all there really is to making a one you guys know how to take it off the to pick the hole and all that stuff so let's introduce try it and let him get some parts time hello Brian what's going on guys how you guys doing this to that viewers I'm sure they're all doing good once you get there on the torch you know where everything's at right sorta got some four mil there and you were gonna pick that big tube there yeah man I'm gonna do this for my first day yes oh that's right yeah you're gonna look at that that's right well you know it's getting ahead of myself I appreciate you guys there on the Internet it's cool to have people that are interested in the same things pull thin but strange thing happens Rodgers toss and oh and he would catches my paper on fire yeah that's good that's good okay well you know what teachers do that once you pick a hole forget about that give up then reattaching all that here's some formula there he's ready to pick the hole he's gonna do this the first time he I gave him up wait about five minutes worth of lessons or something on that we're gonna spin both up when you get it in the flip it really the most crucial thing to pick in the hole it's getting the angles right it needs to be at a 45 degree angle okay don't remember when you get to us to turn up oh he's gonna try and pull it off let's get up close get close okay try another piece of four mil I think if the cameras gonna die if it does just have a good heart bet or not oh look how thin you got you can pull that little cap off there so close you got the can you up you learned when I taught you though sure Stan and Stan's have to pull it out don't heat anymore if it up heat as little as you can to the to hit it with the formula spin it off quick you're gonna run out of tube yeah here let me oh I guess when you guys are picking a hole try a smaller flame more of a pin or flame you might be able to get it we'll see if that helps pray okay try that one right so close hitting you made a little bit of stringer there get rid of that thing okay busted blob off there come on people at home man they've already like changed the channel by now I can't answer they have you gotta get this [ __ ] this time you did it hey but you made a [ __ ] stringer get rid of that damn stringer damn it well he did it anyway okay folks that's it this mi hope you guys have fun see you again um help us out spread the word you know we need ya this [ __ ] we're giving it to you for free you know at least just tell people about it oh that's i1o where you get your supplies where you get the front mention my name tell them you know you should give that guys some free supplies or some [ __ ] and he'll mention your name and he'll show us how to use it and

our basic glass pipe video you're gonna love it so we've got a couple different types of glass pipes right here this is our basic spoon pipe and this is a basic fancier spoon pipe that's loaded up so you can see exactly how this is supposed to work it has a carb on the side so does this one and it's called a spoon pipe because it looks like a spoon and in fact if you had a bowl of weed you could just scoop it in there and come out and pack it just that easy some people suggest you use a screen on these i've got a video for that this is a sherlock pipe because it looks like a sherlock holmes pipe and it's kind of fancy it's super cool they're fun to smoke out of this is called a chilum the chillum is is just that you can either stick a joint in there or blunt or something like that and smoke it that way or you could load it with just like you could the rest of them this one here is a little fancier this is a bubbler and it's got a glass tube that runs down inside of there you fill this up with water to about there and you load it up it's got a carb on the side and you the carb is your air release in case you don't know and then you uh you have a nice water pipe that it's a beautiful bubbler that is your basic pipe selection they get fancier from here but this is where it all starts guys if you enjoyed this little basics glass pipes video let us know by hitting the thumbs up or sharing it with your friends you can find more videos like this on wn420tv on youtube or facebook and if you gain some knowledge out of this video great if you didn't go back and watch it again guys stay beautiful stay positive have a wonderful day thank you for hanging out with cannabis basics", "NmUcnJecRis": "hey what's going on guys it's Tim Walker thank you very much for joining me today we're just gonna do a quick video on how to make a Sherlock pipe out of a carrot stuff so let's get right to it first thing you're gonna need is a carrot obviously I have this carrot stuff that I have in the fridge so I'm just gonna use that I'm gonna try to build it in the top part of the carrot cuz I'm not sure if I'm gonna need to restart you the bottom stuff so I'm just gonna get right to it and start hollowing out this carrot light bulb I mean any typical vegetable peeler you're gonna have a end that's used to take out the eyes of potatoes or gouge stuff out of slightly rock vegetables I'm just gonna get started with that so I've got a nice little gouge started right there that's gonna pretty much be the entire size of the bowl I want to make sure that the walls of the pipe are still pretty thick because I'm going to use the og Chilam for my coke : don't use plastic or a pen or a marker or anything like that unless the pen is metal if you use something that's not metal that's probably gonna melt and you apply the heat to it and then you'll be inhaling plastic fumes which nobody wants so anyways I'm just gonna take these scissors and kind of even out the ball here just like I did in the last carrot quick video Millie if one of the walls a little bit thicker it's just going to give me a little bit of extra room when I go to put the OT Chilam in as the toko so we've done this carrot bowl going on right there now I'm just gonna try to insert this at an angle probably right about right about there somewhere it's probably where it's gonna be best you're gonna want to make sure you start high enough up by the time the stem gets into the bowl apart it's not too far down into the care they dig way down because it's gonna be hard to hit with a lighter in that case we're gonna do a really vague hole just a little bit smaller than the actual diameter of the chilla hopefully that'll give us a pretty nice seal be really careful here or you're probably gonna have to start over this is uh seems to be pretty delicate work I should probably do it you know something that looks just a little bit like that not too bad and the moment of truth I'm gonna take this over each other I'm gonna stick it in that hole of nice angle there you have it it's a nice carry play now this was obviously a really fast and easy version of the carrot fight you're not gonna need to do too much work if you luck out and you happen to have something like this Oh be chillin here or some other kind of metal stem body airway so anyways um let's jimsonweed in there and see how she works now I'm not gonna break it this week too much because some action will screen on the Chilam so I'm just gonna break it up a little bit just enough so it burns nicely and I guess we'll just give it a shot they have guys the carrot pipe part to Sherlock style I'd say quite a little bit easier than the original carrot fight but let's just see how she smokes before we make any quick judgment calls here yeah I don't want to say guys this is version of the carrot pipe really kicks the other ones ass this is definitely the way to go yeah this is pretty awesome I could definitely see making this like if I was out camping if I didn't have a pipe on hand even if you didn't have the Chilam on hand you can always use like like I was saying you could always use a reed that you find in the woods a lot of a lot of plants have a hollow stem you can just crack off and use that as a stick and you'd be good to go although I don't know why you'd have a bag of weed and not have any means to smoke it but this is always an option for you if that ever comes up now again the one drawback with a carrot pipe is because the carrots so watery inside a lot of the weed gets kind of wet and doesn't really burn properly so it actually is a little bit more difficult to like finish off the bowl properly gross you know what this quite reminds me of this sort of level of Stella no part you know what they look like you know this pipe reminds the other it's like one of those old-school corncob pipes see see old men smoking or sitting on the rocking chair it's got kind of a nice feel to it to be honest unfortunately it's a carrot so it's not like you can take this with you and use it more than once but but it's pretty nice alternative to smoking a joint or something like that if you just wanted to throw it down to some friends so I guess let's throw a little bit more reasonable [Music] all right ready guys let's see if I can get this all done in one pull here the bottom of the bowl is getting kind of wet and gnarly in there so we'll see what happens but I'm thinking it'll work out here it's really nice I'm starting to get a little bit of blowback here some chunks flying through the tube but not that many to be honest I'm a little surprised there weren't more so anyways I guess we'll just close it off with a review of the Sherlock style carrot stuff fight I'd say probably the content out of 10 I mean it's really easy to make obviously and as long as you have this here oh gee Chilam you can just whip one up in a matter of seconds really the one drawback I was talking about where your weed gets kind of wet because the carrot juice really salt itself once you start to apply fire to it it really dries it out obviously so that's not really a problem at all you guys want to know a little bit more about the OG Chilam you can check out my review of that right here I'll post a link I guess that's it don't forget to Like comment share subscribe send it to a friend each of vegetables all that good [ __ ] and I guess I'll see you guys later [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "jqFvshjPOL4": "all right what's going on everyone this is jr back another video before we get into this make sure you guys check out my instagram and twitter it'll be on the screen link in the description below as always so definitely check out my twitter because it's not popping i actually want to start posting a lot more on twitter so make sure you guys check it out but in today's video i'm going to be teaching y'all how to make a little pipe out of a zebra pen just a little one-hitter honestly use one of these for probably like almost a year total of just one hitters all right so basically you're just going to take everything apart all right so this is what you'll get and then peely hall as you can see what it'll do is put this inside flip it and then bam you have a perfect one hitter with a nice little bowl i personally like smoking keith out of these works perfectly fine as you can see got a little bit packed up all right so now we gotta hit it wow wow so yeah these things definitely clap definitely use literally they're like a couple bucks a dollar general and get them one hitter forever hope you guys all enjoyed this quick little tutorial if you guys try this out make sure you guys tell me what you guys think or if you have any tips or ideas put it in the comments below i'll definitely have more tutorials coming soon i want to start posting a lot more let me know what you think of this see y'all in the next one peace", "veB-TkKZ9H0": "hey guys I have an unusual sort of unboxing today because it is a smoking tool but it's from Etsy so it's the first ever smoking to it ever bought from Etsy so I'm looking forward to seeing the quality of it and how it's made because it's not like Etsy to smoke shop or anything so I'm going to take off my address here you can see right there says Etsy okay so I'm going on box it now if you guys I'm excited to see what it looks like I mean I know what I ordered but stuff doesn't always look like how it shows on this to Google+ first I'm holding there a green slip that says thanks for shopping at my store and have a good day with the heart oh that's nice I was like to get little handmade stuff shows they really care really are happy that you supported their business and in there is my one hit it rocks in some nice little bubble wrap and there it is really nice size really tiny it's about the same size as my finger here so it's really discreet really easy to have people say it's also pretty much a glass blunt except you don't have to roll it because it's glass and you just use it repeatedly so you see there's a little curve right there that is Raya put your bud or tobacco lap then you light it up put it to your mouth smoke will shoot through and it's really cool because you can see the smoke and then you just inhale and blow out and also it has a silver tin um it can change colors because of the silver on the glass so I'm glad to see that I saw some pictures of people that had them and they turn blue or pinkish or purpley or orange so that should be cool I'll probably do a review on this later but this is my one hitter or chill them they're also known as cigarette holders I believe don't quote me on that so I'm not 100% sure but I'm pretty sure that's what it's called so here's my tongue that I surprisingly got at Etsy so I hope you guys like my video hopefully I'll do a review on this later and happy smoking and remember it's 4:20 somewhere bye", "fiXLb8ctLIc":

review you know what i'm saying this one i'm saying we're doing a little pipe review as usual i'm saying this is uh one of one hitter one hit of chilums you know what i'm saying and uh it was real freaky you know what i'm telling my i like to call it the i'll see you now i'm saying oh [Music] saying so god you know most people just you know i mean load it up you know take a pull but uh i invested in these little screens you can also your man load a screen in any boat you know i mean not just these one hitters you can put these screens in in any bowl and this is actually my first time was putting the screen in the bowl so y'all want to grab with me on this you know i mean this is a experience for me too so i mean y'all more than welcome to experiment what you want you want somebody it's your boyzilla you know what i'm saying but uh you know i'm saying here's the screen screen right here and uh somehow you're gonna have to pack that screen and um i know i i know some people probably will usually cut it but i ain't gonna cut it man i'm gonna i'm gonna try something with this packet use this right here this paintbrush or a little pen or something to pack it oh i didn't messed up y'all hold on so you gotta take your time because if not you'll mess something up smoky ground you'll mess some up like your boy doing how long so let me get it right let me get this right small surprise mean i guess i should cut it cuz with me not cutting it i'm struggling to like pack it evenly in there yeah i think i did messed up a screen or okay you could just kind of use your hand to like mold it mold the shape of the screen you know and see i'm using the screen because you know most of my pipes you know after a while they get they get filled up with with with ashes and scooby snacks you know what i'm saying and i'd rather be messing around taking a pull one one good pull one hard pulling hit that scooby snack that scooby snack hit the back of that neck might you know yeah might cough up a long or something what i'm saying so yeah i'm trying this out with the screen and it look like i got it in pretty good this time i got it in though so now for the load the load this

see what it do wow [Music] [Music] business oh i'm out", "-z7y4vKbYO0": "I mmm", "eOAGQEdfIrc": "[Music] they're going to show you how to clean your one-hitter chill them or other glassware so as you can see they get gummed up after many uses and are not very pleasant to smoke through so start will together our ingredients need to gather some pipe cleaners and these are the time to have the hard bristle to them some q-tips some paper towels a ziplock or other storage container some 91% isopropyl alcohol and some epsom salts once you gather all those together let's mix them into a little baggie and as you see I've already done this here that's assault and the 91% isopropyl alcohol together next we want to take our one-hitter and simply drop it in there well do the same with the channel we want to make sure that there's nothing inside the Chilam are your one-hitter before you insert it into the bag and I'm going to be trying to be careful here so I don't bang the two up two gifts each other and possibly break the chilla and finally we're gonna put one more one-hitter in here one note of caution as you can see this one-hitter has a little bit different coloration this one-hitter used it's 100 used to have markings on it emitted like a cigarette rubbing alcohol or 91% isopropyl alcohol may discolor your one-hitter if it has that on it as also a side note karma suta khals or its affiliates are not responsible for any damage to your glassware after you put it on here let's shake it around a little bit carefully and gently if you have more than one item in here and as you see the water is already starting to turn nasty so i'm gonna sit it down and i'm going to want to try to make sure everything is still completely covered as much as possible and now we're gonna let this sit for at least fifteen to thirty minutes if not longer it would help to zip zip lock so it doesn't spill [Music] as you can see as I moved the bag so in the brown stuff from the gunk pill top starts to come off it's been about 45 minutes or so and now let's take it out of the bag and just run run a little clean water through it help get rid of that excess Epsom salt and isopropyl alcohol okay we have just rinsed our Chilam and one-hitters off next we're gonna take our paper towel and we're just gonna wipe I'm gonna ball it up just a little bit I'm sticking in here and just try to wipe some of this off glass normally cleans very very easily and as you can see just all the gunk on the paper towel there next I'm with a q-tip and just try to get some of the other gunk out of here and you're going to want to keep working on it till you get to your desired level of cleanliness this is also time you take your pipe cleaner and if you look you see some of the gunk built up here and just take it to help clean it some so we'll continue to do this until it's clean now as you can see I've spent a couple minutes just cleaning it with a q-tip and a um pipe cleaner and as you can see it is much much cleaner now and suitable for use next to clean your one-hitter it's a little more difficult because you don't have as much space just where I highly recommend q-tips and just gonna turn them around there and after letting it soak for a while you see how much gunk comes off [Music] if you need to take a little cup of rubbing alcohol or even what's already in your bag the q-tip in it just to help give it a little more moisture and cleaning power to the q-tip while still containing some gunk inside it is much easier to smoke from now question is about what level do you want to stop cleaning in that's all personal preference you can clean it to looks like it's brand-new again but that will take some elbow grease with a little rubbing alcohol q-tips again the longer you soak it the easier it is to clean these have been soaking for about 45 minutes I've left some metal one-hitters which this is inside the solution for overnight and it was much easier to clean it's really personal preference now as you can see after a little bit of elbow grease we have some very clean one-hitters and a chill I'm ready to smoke so I'm gonna take a little alien OG from karma suta khals load it right into my one-hitter and it's time to take the puff [Music] [Music] [Music]", "SS-STxI8K6g": "alright guys today we're going to talk about smoke kits this here is actually a dugout to call it the dugout on steroids I'm gonna open it up right now let's check it out kind of a new product it's been in the market for probably like a week and a half or two at the most I want to say I thought I'd do a video on this just to show you guys what's kind of new out there in the smoke world it's not your average like vape product or so but I just figured like this is a new product I've you know me my all my employees we kind of liked it so like let's do a video on this and let's check it out here so this is the dugout on steroids so basically what it is it it holds your bat and your poker you see that there alright so it's it's a digger tip also so it's easier to cut your herbs with a little poker in there and it also opens up the second chamber that's where your herbs are gonna come out I'm gonna show you how this work is a built-in grater grinder so let's take a look here if you open up the top chamber okay this is where you're going to grate your herbs it's gonna fall into this chamber here so that way you're going to open it up and get your stuff from here or you can actually use your dugout so you get your stuff down here okay so if you see that this is how you're gonna get your herbs close that back up so this is what they call the dugout on steroids okay kind of kind of lives up to its name but not quite I guess there's missing maybe one thing I don't know what I would do with it next now I'm gonna get to the material side it is that matte filled material so I already know what problems are gonna occur based on the products we sell here and that things that are made of this material here I'm not sure exactly what you call it but it is that matte material so over a period of time this product here it will actually wear and tear much quicker than then you assume so just one of us you guys know that as well and one more thing I'm almost missing here is that the grater grinder actually comes apart for cleaning so you can actually pull this piece out all the way out take your pieces out here and actually clean everything pretty thoroughly okay see one more little compartment here Oh beautiful one more compartment here this is actually it looks like it's for the wax so you can put your wax in here take a look at that it's enough it's enclosed in here but you can actually get your wax put your wax in there that make which makes sense now because I do see that it's a poker with an actual dabber okay it's a poker with an actual you use this side to poke and then this side will be your dabs open up your chamber here there's a little silicone area here that they made functional because the digger actually only reaches that far which is smart because they made that into a silicone wax compartment okay so I'm going to show you how the grater goes back in BAM okay obviously this is going to be closed and that goes here this is its home for the for the bat and this is where the poker and wax dabber end goes so boom there you go comes with the traveling case when she probably won't need his magnetic as well smoke it's calm you can get it there it's not available in our site yet but just wanted to share this with you all pretty neat product if you're if you like dugouts this might be a good collection to have in your home so check it out man comment below let me know what you guys think and you have any comments or any questions what will get you there okay you have a great day", "W3qdwk_XMck": "okay okay ready yes okay today's product is the Chung's choice dugout this is a demo because it's magnetic to see

since I've been in there really I just come in here I got some edibles over there I probably head up to today I'm just gonna probably smoke last night I was watching a Bob Marley videos and good making videos and stuff like that I know this how Bob Marley smoked album day and I noticed what I didn't like Shaun's was because it always gave you Scooby Snacks oh it's cooked on you except I'm going to go over here and grab my showing right now and I'm going to attempt for the first time ever to try smoke it like Marley did like that like where it's out of your hair let's try it man all right well I got this to pick helps me clear up my bowls got this fumes a little dirty okay I dig a new poster board just for the can a quest a nice boat it's a wider green poster board I plan on doing the exact same thing as why I did up there for the three-day event that's going on it only costs fifty five dollars to get in so I recommend you guys to go and hope to see you there all right I'm smoking guns in the blue widow I got from buds are us the local dispensary I love to go to here in Lansing Michigan I'm going to bring out I only got a few little buds left so trying to conserve trying to say still trying to stay medicated if you guys want to know more about money in my life just watch previous videos and I say truthful open and honest the duck it smells really strong really ten of these you get ten of these you get a free cream of your choice from buds or us I'm going to go with the Khalifa Kush I did not get to try it I'm excited just gotta get ten those I might end up buying it before it even collects and who knows I want that I mean I don't plan these things out these videos I mean I tried to plan ahead a little bit but it actually just I guess go with it and it happens you know it's really sweet man like I said before it reminds me of Sour Diesel like if it is a cross between something I'll have to say probably so our days in blue widow or blue green blue drink Saturdays and blue because it helps me sleep it calms me down I gots that sour D type of a taste to it really sweet very pungent very strong so all right I got that loaded right now the whole idea I'm going to try this video on this basically smoking like that closing my fist up and basically get enough air flow like that so I don't get skinny snacks in right now so let's tempt us I'm going to use a liner because I imagine a wick could be hard to be put out I don't see that does work I did get a little bitty Scooby Snack but it's not like straight into my mouth so um thank you Bob Marley for teaching me something oh you're still teaching people from beyond the grave so awesome I got a little bit of Scooby Snack in my mouth though I'm not going to lie but is a better way I wasn't even see users kill me when I use a few times from roaches and stuff like that that's about it but now I figured out there's a better useful how to that's a little weird and it's a little strange yes I know but you're doing once you're only a type of Bowl or anything least you know now how to use it properly I don't know Scooby Snacks in your mouth all right well my bubbly now the reason why I don't like this bubbler and I don't use it too much try not to is cool and on occasion but it tends to the water tends to get sucked up sometimes if you get too much water in you that's basically the only reason why I don't like this piece I'm going to sum it up at this time let's hope it doesn't do that hopefully doesn't act like a straw all right I got that all cleared out I can't turn it sideways because it's a web water in but it's pretty cool pretty nice little piece all right we're at six minutes and what do you said in a second Sam got it back I'm going to freak out my

are staying at k2 but I'm stone comes own until next time no peace out", "iZJQZeCThns": "welcome to the simple accessories simple one hitter and dugout instructional video I'm going to walk you through how to use the simple one hitter and dugout what comes in the package is two different items the first one is the manual that gives you a step-by-step on best uses you can always check simple dot AC / one-hitter for more details second item that comes in the package is the actual one hitter and dugout you can see the one hitter is an innovative knotch different design with a tapered edge and the white ring you have an adjustable slider that tells you how big your hit will be just also have your little convenient poker that is multifaceted now we're gonna show you how to use the product simply take off the cap you put in this tee position you need to put on either side then you take out the one hitter you know which side to load based off of the tapered edge and then also the little edgings the smaller etchings point which side to load you know what's n to smoke out of based off the white ring the simple one hitter is adjustable look at the adjusting slider on the top and you can have between one to four notches this would be a one notch er you could tell by the edge of the slider or you can pull it all the way back for four notch are at point two grams or the one notch are at point o 8 grams to load your product you can do one of two ways you have the stab and twist we just go in and twist the product around that's it or you can do the scrape and drag where you going at a 45 degree angle scrape along the bottom as well after loading your product put your mouth on the blecch with the white ring and then light from this end inhale with the flame over on this side and then when you're done you can simply push the slider all the way to the edge or you can see it coming out and you can use the included poker to ripe off the edge lastly when you need to clean the product maybe you're having a little restricted airflow issue you can just bring the poker in here and make sure to drag it out make sure not to push it in now we're going to show you some of the best tips and tricks to ensure you get the best use after repeated use the slider can sometimes be hard to move the best way to loosen it up simply use the flame heat it up and it will now make the slider way easier to move but that indicates they should probably give it a deep clean and we'll show you later in the video how to do that for different air flows you can load it with a smaller loading size and after you can simply make the size bigger and you'll have more air for the product to flow through for the dugout instead of holding the cap in your hands you can actually use it put it in this T position to ensure that it's a safe and stored in either side and that still allows you to pull out the one header if you find that some of your product gets too stuck down on the bottom you can always loosen it up and stir it up using the included poker if you're in a pinch you don't have a grinder you can put unground product into the little storage container and just chop it up with either the poker or you can even use one header or deep clean you can disassemble the one-hitter all you do is you use the included poker it's actually a screwdriver you put it in to where the slider is and then you just rotate nice and easy along it you just want to make sure you get all the rotations out and you just simply take out the little screw and then metal adjuster piece then what you do from here is you just push out on the bottom see that there's two different pieces now all four of these pieces you now soak in isopropyl alcohol to reassemble the one-hitter you want to make sure to put the ball bearing side this won't put that ball bearing side to match up with where you put your mouth so you push it through you also want to make sure this lighter opening is available for you to put the little slider piece in and after you did make sure you set it down put the screw in and then just screw it back in righty tighty lefty loosey then you're good to go put it back in the dugout you're good to go", "pzG2jwYBZGA": "Hello, Welcome back to Shopdop My name is Saurabh and today I have brought a very popular hookah for you. I am going to present a hookah which is being sold indiscriminately on Amazon and Flipkart and in fact still sells. Name of this hookah is Tozzo Hookah which is a very popular model in India. This medium-range model is very high demanding item. This hookah looks quite amazing and looks cute. I will show you this hookah, its setup, its smoke density and smoke flow. With it, I will use this bowl whose name is Dual Fun Bowl. You can enjoy the taste of two flavors simultaneously by using this bowl. I will also tell you about it. Let's start with its unboxing and see what are the components inside it Then we will tell you about this hookah after proper setup. Let's open it and find out the things inside it. So this is Alshan's Tozzo Hookah. We get various things from this box like its coal tray which is made of metal. This whole hookah is made of acrylic material. It is quite amazing hookah. You can see its side nozzles. They are of high quality nozzles. Their looks also have proper finishing. With it, you get this pipe which is made of PVC material and you get this tong, German clay bowl, and a very amazing thing i.e. LED light and remote which you get free with it. This remote has on/off option in it and you can also adjust its effect with it. I will also use it to show you. First of all, let's assemble this hookah and show you its complete look. So finally, my Tozzo hookah is ready now. I have replaced its German bowl and will use this Dual Fun hookah ceramic bowl. I have added the water already. Let's prepare the bowl now. In this bowl, I am using these two flavors which are of Mayo. Mayo has sent us samples to test and review them. I have also reviewed them before. Both are amazing flavor and we are receiving a lot of demand and queries for these Mayo flavors. I am adding 50-50% of both flavors in dual fun bowl. As I have told in my previous video that Twingo flavor has green color content whereas Khabib has pink color content So friends, my bowl is ready now. I have added both flavors of Mayo that are Khabib and Twingo flavor in dual fun bowl. I have set up the whole hookah and attached its pipe too. Now I am going to add Shisha3sixty's coconut coal As you have seen the partition on the bowl So I am adding one coal for Khabib and other coal for Twingo. It is a dual fun bowl. So the fun will be double too. To make it more fun, let's add the impact with LED lights So my hookah is ready with LED lights. I have set up the LED lights in its base. It will be fun with LED light impact and dual fun bowl. Let the flavor heat up for some time. Till then, I can tell you about its hookah. This hookah is made of acrylic material. Its special thing is that its pipe is also of quite good quality and is not very expensive. It is quite cheap. Its pipe can be cleaned very easily. I have recently noticed a very amazing thing is that its side pressure knob. You can open it like this and take it off. There is an extension which looks like this. Attach it like this. Here you can attach another pipe or hose. Let me show you. So friends, this is the Tozzo Hookah. Its smoke flow was quite amazing. This hookah is of very good quality. Everything was perfect in it. It totally justifies the price range in which it comes. Its diameter is also good. You can also use it in car and carry it while traveling. You get an LED light with it. This hookah is compatible with dual hose. You also get a german clay bowl with it. Many things are included in this small package. If you wanna purchase this hookah, then follow the description box.

Thank you so much for watching this video.", "cqoKzr-RC2I": "hello everybody my name is forest and you're watching the honest review today i will be talking about this silicone pipe by flextrong flextrong it has a glass bowl it's decent size the glass bold protrudes out so it can break if it gets smashed directly on something but you know when a pipe falls it's you know it's hitting it's bouncing it's at least going to absorb some of the shock into the silicone as opposed to just being one fragile piece it comes with a little tool in the back i guess for scraping out your bowl and that thing pops out every once in a while because the holder that it's in is silicone so if you you know if your pipe moves a little bit it falls up so how useful is this not really that useful it also has this little cool pouch in the back or a container where you could put some extra bud so you can maybe fit like half a gram in there maybe compacted like it's it's a very small compartment but you know two different types of wheat or something like that and you're good it's also got a choke on the side and the hole that you inhale from is actually quite large and the hole in the bowl is actually quite large so you might want to put a screen in something like this because if you don't you're going to pull through and pull back hot embers or fresh weed and either way it sucks so you might want to put a little screen in there and or just sort of build up a little bit of resin um i think every time it's going to be real fresh and clean it's going to be a bit harder not to pull through and just kind of inhale a bunch of stuff so i got a couple different types of weed here i got a white berry and blue diesel i'm going to review those on this channel as well so you guys can check that out if you're interested i also have this sharp stone grinder i'm going to review but right now what i'm doing is i'm going to grind up a little bit of wheat and toss it in the uh toss it in the old flex tone and there is there are different colors of this i picked the kind of rosta color because i'm such a rastafarian i'm going with the blue diesel today look at that blue diesel's got such an interesting smell reminds me of being a teenager all right plug that in there let's grind this thing up here so yeah even right there some of my weed actually fell right through some of the fresh herb so um kind of a bummer not having a screen and that also means that you're going to just have to inhale really lightly while you light um at least until some resin builds up like i said so it's it's a nice distance there are smaller ones but it's like you're going to burn your nose hair light in those things and your face and everything so this one's got a nice little distance and that also helps cool down the smoke just like a tiny little bit so you're not just hitting like flames right away you know so that's what i like about a pipe just doing that sort of it's um it hits like a pipe you know it's you really get the full flavor of everything you get the um you get a lot of the heat from a pipe it's it's not going through water it doesn't water just has a way of just instantly cooling but it's nice and durable i mean that's why you want one of these thing popped out again is uh you know i take this on trips with me i'll throw it in my pocket uh it's gonna get tossed around and beaten around and that's why you pay the extra for something like this over glass pipes that you're just constantly gonna break and then you don't have when you need so i'd rather like it's not so much about breaking one it's about having to go get another one and in the meantime you don't have this little pipe so this pipe i i want to buy something i don't care if i have to pay more for it i want to buy something that's not just disposable the idea here is to buy something quality that's not going to break so that you don't have to keep replacing stuff and keep sort of wasting things if you buy one item and it replaces three of your items and you've just bought in something that is useful to you fundamentally functional you know and i strive for that with with the items that i buy i don't like buying just don't like buying cheap [ __ ] that is made to be disposable that feels really bad too there's there's part of our consumerism culture where we know we're buying disposable things and and what and but we know the consequences of something being disposed of it's going into a landfill it's being recycled improperly it's landing in the ocean it's like i don't want to contribute to any of that so if i buy responsibly that is a huge thing that you can do so anyway that's uh uh that's why i bought this and i'm now going to do a review on this weed so thanks guys for watching i will link this below if i can find it if not i will link something very comparable there's not a lot of options from the affiliate site that i use which i don't know why i'm trying to be code about it is amazon yeah maybe i'll try to find it on different website even and still link to amazon and if you guys shop on amazon for anything click that link and i'll get an affiliate whatever who cares i'm not going to make any money from this guys i don't know why i'm pretty so preoccupied with that [Music] i'll see you guys in the next video what am i talking about i'm talking to a camera this is weird", "um-DpemfUPo": "I mmm", "nnb3Cva0pfc": "I mmm", "AVUH0pj1t1E": "hey welcome to roughhouse Studios product reviews this is Matt and today we're going to be reviewing the pipe tune pair this is a wooden pipe for smoking marijuana okay the pipe tune pair is available from NIMH boom bap it cost about $30 and this is what we received in the package of course there was the wooden pipe itself which is a two-piece pipe we receive a nice little pouch that's cloth pouch for sharing in there is also an instruction manual and some other information this was not an English Senora able to read it but there is some nice diagrams of some of the other products that are available and then there is also some additional activated charcoal charcoal filters which is the main feature that sets this pipe apart from other standard wooden pipes the clean smoking system so we had three additional filters which makes for including new one now let's take a closer look at the pipe toon pair one thing you'll notice is that it's a really high quality wood it's made of pear wood which is not a tropical wood they boast on their website that they never use endangered tropical woods for their pipes pear wood is used cuz it has a mutual flavor one issue with the pear wood is you know I've used it about a dozen times it's got a pretty good bit of burn marks are ready pear wood is not as heat resistant as some of the other hardwoods out there such as olive briar but they do have those options available on their website for a forty nine dollars so for twenty dollars differentiy to get the hardwood pipes that would be able to more heat resistant not that there's a really a problem with this one at all it's a real nice shape and design it's very simple it would look like a normal one piece wooden pipe at first glance but notice there's a seam there that's kind of part and this is what they call it a smoking system a clean smoking system and inside there are activated charcoal filters these little filters are about the size of a cigarette filter they're filled with activated charcoal and this is from their website they claim about the activated charcoal that when smoke passes through an activated carbon filter a large portion of their harmless or the harmful tars and the smoke sticks to the activated carbon this makes the smoke pleasantly smooth without affecting the quality amount of device by quality of the buzz they saying that the lower the ratio of Tartu to age of THC and this moment so there's less tar and therefore your smoke has more THC my my ratio so I guess they're saying that's the stronger hit I have noticed that the hits are very smooth there is never any particulates you don't get any ashes you don't get any sticky gum at the end of your time thank you wooden pipe especially as I've used this dozen the 15 times not even looks likes it it turned me down this end you can see the filter that I've actually had in there for most of the heads that I've taken I removed it just to show but it's it's not clogged at all it was still working fine I just want to show you in there for the demonstration but yeah I really does help keep the pipe clean and also it keeps that tar out of your lungs so I don't have an issue with that at all and on the back when you reinsert the pipe there is a couple of notches there so that you can realigned the pipe to make sure you have a good seal it's got a nice little logo on the end it's a well-designed pipe and now let's give it a shot obviously you see I've used it quite a few times but when I pack it up and show you how simple it is [Music] now let's look a little marijuana with a pipe compare just like any pipe you want to grab your marijuana first [Music] and I had had really good luck packing this pipe as tight as I want so I'm gonna put that whole little bit in there just pack it in there and I've noticed a lot of pipes that you use you really can't do this with this one has a screen in the bottom of this of the bowl here there is a metal screen mesh screen and I've been able to pack it really tight I'm putting it pretty good with a firm pressure with my finger there when I pack that and there you go you pack it just like you would any other pilot and then you light it just like you would any other pie [Music] as I've said the hits are really smooth they say they claim that the charcoal filter cools the smoke off sound but it definitely gets out all the little pieces of anything that you would get and like I said it gave me this sticky stuff that you get when your tongue on the wooden pipes that's gone very clean smooth heads it's excellent and also because of the deep and cylindrical state bowl it stays burning pretty good too so once you get it lit you can keep hitting it usually pretty good it's launching all right or less let it rest too long between heads so as far as hitting goes there's no problems here this is a good hidden pipe here my pros for the pipe team pair one is it cost $30 for a wooden pipe that says quality it might seem a little high but the whole smoking system the filtration system all that I think it's a good fair price the smooth hits the fact that there's no ashes or any particulates coming through the fact that you don't have any tar or gum building up on the end of a pipe which is kind of a drawback to a wooden pipe to me normally it's not there on this one it stays nice and dry and clean super clean hits so yeah thumbs up there and also because of the same reason the filters system it keeps it cleaner longer and so not only is it easier to clean because you can just break it apart and you know bounce often through each side very easily but it also needs clean to less often the cosmic it just doesn't build up most of the build-up stays inside of the other dirty filters now here are the cons for the pipe campaign one thing it's not really a con so much is that just because it's a wooden pipe and also because it's the softer pair wood it burns pretty fast and so it kind of ages quickly and it already looks you know like it's a little bit older than it is and also they it gathers a lot of ash and oil and a lot of things stick to the pipe so it's a little bit harder to keep clean on the outside of the pipe the appearance just ages kind of fast but yeah that's kind of the charm of a wooden pipe but this cleaner system it seems like at the outside was a little smoother or polished so that you can keep it might be a good option also there is a little bit of an extended cost in this this pipe system it's a great system but these little filters are not free you get four they come with it they're gonna last a good while I've like I said I have one in there for like at least 20 or so bowls and there was never any real need to change and other than that I just wanted to look clean it that the review so they last a good while each and they are available for packs of a hundred of them for $12 so that's 12 cents apiece when you buy them in bulk from nimbin babs website overall i would have to say that i highly recommend the pipe tune pair from men bent back it's a good blend of old-school wooden pipe it meets new school improvements to the way we smoke if this filtration system removes the tar as its intended to do and leaves the THC which it apparently does because i get really high just like it would off this pipe then why not do that and I think that's a great advancement and so oh yeah highly recommended I want to thank mmm that for sending this out to us and turning us on to this product and also want to tell you to stay tuned because we're going to be reviewing this set that they also said racing which is their hitter pipes which has the same type of Jason system Bogart will be bringing you that review very soon as they came to that and as always thank you for watching row of house studios please subscribe comment share

bag of pieces and we're gonna do a review so yeah let me just find one here uh actually i think i'll do i'll do the Chilam first so yeah i got a chill them in a bowl um probably I want to say like a week ago week or so ago I don't really remember uh anyway here it is a pretty big ass chillum you can see how big that bowl is it goes all the way down to like right there you feel all that up and then just chief man this thing gets [ __ ] ripped this thing like it fills up and hits so smooth like you hit it like you can just barely hit it and then you get a big-ass hit you don't even know it it's so smooth I love this thing I really do you can see the designs and [ __ ] on it it's just basically a clear glass with a you know it's got the get little red squirrels in it it's the glass itself is almost almost has a green a green tint to it I mean it just came right here she you guys can see that all so i don't have to uh excuse me so i don't have to hold the piece up really high and [ __ ] so yeah there it is it looks really nice it smokes really nice i paid about four dollars for this i think i got it at the arab store down the street so yeah i mean i wish i had sub to smoke out of it but I'd oh I'm not only going to be doing glass pieces i'll be doing hitters bongs all kinds of [ __ ] so I'm just letting you guys know that now i'll probably be saying all this [ __ ] in all the other videos too so we'll see so yeah i really like this if you find one like this you can see it's got the the flat part where you hit that's actually really nice makes it really nice to hit really easy to uh to what am I trying to say really easy to uh okay I need to reward that it's ergonomic when you're trying to hit it that flat piece is really nice it's really economic it's it's easy it's comfortable and I mean it just feels good when you hit it it's great if you if you find one of these it doesn't even have to be like this if you find a chillum like like say it's just a chillum that's just like a solid like straight tube get one I recommend you get one no I don't recommend it I'm telling you to get one go buy one go buy one of these go buy a chillum anything any kind of chilling because they are [ __ ] awesome they hit so smooth and make it read tastes so good because of glass and since it is glass it's a lot easier to clean all you're really going to do is a stick a pipe cleaner through there something you can see it's really clean right now I've been smoking out of it very much haven't anything to smoke really so uh yeah there's that like I said in the last video I'm recording that one or this one right after that when it's about six thirty in the morning I haven't been to bed I woke up at about eleven thirty this morning no I like nine something this morning it's great was Christmas well yesterday morning it was about Christmas it was Christmas yesterday as most of you us residents know well all of us residents know if you celebrate Christmas uh

one day with a buddy of mine we filled it up with dro oh my god the smoothest hitting piece I ever have I like God you can tell I'm tired I've ever had this thing is awesome so yeah I know I've said that like six times already but I can't get over how freakin awesome this thing is it's it's just a beautiful piece it really is there's no carb it's just the solid like Chief and fill it up with smoke I wish I could show you how it smokes but I don't have any smoke so can't really do that I might make a video later today with my actual camera meanwhile buddy you're going to be smoking so if i don't use this i'll probably either use my bowl or one of my hitters so yeah i'll be making videos on those two fairly shortly excuse me uh so yeah if you if you enjoyed the video don't forget to like

"kpG6OuQ-6Dc": "hey guys I'm gonna be showing you how to make a one-hitter slash chillin with a sharpie yeah alright so for this all you're gonna need is aluminum foil some tape obviously a sharpie lighter and a toothpick or safety pin alright so first of all the sharpie will have an end like right there I already taped off everything and but you're gonna have to pull the piece off yeah so it's gonna leave you with like an open space right here and so after that you take the aluminum foil and cut it to where like it hangs off like right there on all the sides and then this is how you put it in so make sure it's like flat and it's hanging off like that and then this is how I put it in you take your finger and push on it and then push in make sure to not rip it though and then just go like this and just turn it but make sure you're not pushing that hard and then after that take your no don't do that yet and then fold all your pieces down like that and make sure they're all folded down and then take your tape and fold like a little sheet make sure it's not too big though around it and the only reason I do this is because some people if they blow out they'll blow the aluminum foil out like my friend and lose all their weed so yeah so that's why I put tape and after that you need to cut a small hole I don't know if you can see that and the bottom of it with oh yeah you also need a knife so you can cut the hole and yeah and then use their lighter and burn like a hole like right there so you can put your finger and use it as a carb I mean some people put the aluminum foil and their actual carb and just suck out of that end but I think this way is better because you can actually use it like a rod and yeah so it's called a one-hitter but you can actually use this multiple times but it's also a Chilam cuz you have to load a lot in there but yeah is to use it just put your finger on it and then suck in in that hole while you're lighting it with your lighter so it's gonna be like this and then suck in yeah alright guys I'll be posting more videos of stuff like this yeah stay for a 20-piece", "b0N96npLTXc": "show me that both show me the green", "iJL-HOD_B54": "with

down alright so with that aside I'm gonna make another [ __ ] one-hitter and this is another cool little hack here big pin and this is a five millimeter socket you don't need to zoom in on that trust me it's a five millimeter socket so you're not gonna use the pin though you're gonna use the cap what you want to do is take this piece right here and just break it off it's kind of slick how these things just mesh up take that insert it into there push it there and it's pressure fitted in there just like my other zebra f30 one one-hitter you know this is just like two pieces that go together perfectly and if you check out the end of this thing you see how it's got that kind of grille in it that's nice because like if you know you load it up and you get some ash coming through it'll kind of stop the ash from going down the back of your throat so so yeah dude that's it that's another video here for wispy him five millimeter socket and a bic this is actually a big Ultra round grips stick grip uh yeah so the caps from these in a five millimeter socket worked great to make you a nice little one hitter all right dudes peace out [Music] [Music]", "8T8ILe9mOas": "I'll ride flower

classroom without further ado I'm going to show you what I got know something old something new okay there's the package I got here just came in something simple so let's see what it is oh nice okay you got a worried there because there's supposed to be three things they didn't give me no packing slip but this is what it was I wish I did have a packing slip so I could show you guys well it was just basically a little traveling case for your piece they put in two pieces for me and it looks like two different complete opposite pieces it's not exactly what I ordered for him happy with it because it's different I ordered two of these this foot isn't this won't even seem like what I ordered I ordered a inside-out Chilam it looks exactly like this is how it looks in the on the website I actually ordered a Gandalf they ended up being out of stock they told me that I had to choose something else and these were three dollars apiece Gandalf for six there's a Gandalf twisted to loom you guys chill them you guys should go check that out on their website is like one of the best chills down there in my opinion I have unboxing videos of that go check on the check out my channel watch some boxing videos I also got all videos of me smoking out of it so go check that out yeah this is what I got now I didn't have any facts while replacing with this two E's and then they gave it to me I told these buzz obviously as you see is not - it's two different kind you stand side by side one's a little bit bigger than the other not so much of a difference though basically almost the same the bow pieces I'm like where you stuff your product right here it's about the same radius almost the same death I want to say but see this one's just a little more narrow on the tip it's this one seems a little more thicker this one here supposed to be inside out show them don't look inside out to me but I think it's still a good deal I still got a rocky pieces for sure it's supposed to be a hard

ahead and just our session on it and it's time to get to talking man so as March twenty twenty men least this year has so far it brought me a lot of things that have been like you know really learning about myself really having to assess what I do in my life how I do think how I follow through with things man and I see I've just been getting a lot more motivated to be a better me not only on YouTube but you know overall last because I've been hitting the gym a lot harder I've been following my diet a lot more I've been trying to be a better person you know in terms of my how I act about Who I am of what my actions are and I feel like you know I'm progressing without a doubt I am progressing as an individual and I'm happy about that man this one right here was the Maui the Maui stick or Maui wowie some [ __ ] like that I believe it's a sativa you guys know I'm not too much of a fan of sativa but the taste is actually pretty good let's see how long we can keep the ash going alright

things take hard work and people just don't know [Music] hmm RC I feel like this is so excessive having to use a bubbler bride rather just smoked the joining self but it is what it is we're gonna go ahead and keep session for you guys man yeah I don't know if it's the way that I'm hitting it because I'm basically like letting it build up and then I'm inhaling comp like a bomb but these hits are just way too harsh man you're starting to get hot in here about it place this down for a little slight second CES you can see right here this is how it looks - dude I'm sweating I've actually been I don't know why recently I've been sweating a lot more than usual which is very very strange damn it's gonna take me forever to kill this but we're gonna do it for you guys it makes it taste weird like that hold on I want to see if it tastes any different I don't know if it's just the bubbler if it's this [ __ ] this pre-roll it tastes kind of like me you know it's not bad it's just a very very very acquired taste and [ __ ] I just burnt off the cherry please just stay on it like at first it was good but now that I'm getting a little deeper into it I start tasting a sativa man I'm starting to taste this a tea with a lot more if he has no sativas in general or just like they have such a unique taste to them and they don't taste like Dai Li some ones that I've tried I think the only sativa that I've ever tried that was actually good with a mimosa - mimosa other than that I don't think I've ever tried any sativa that I actually like look at that little [ __ ] chamber of smoke juggernaut 1 if I can smoke that [ __ ] looks like ass oh what a [ __ ] fail bro oh my gosh I get the biggest bell of 2020 by doing that yo oh my goodness dude I was trying to blow the smoke out of there and I ended up [ __ ] blowing all the ash that was on the ashtray that it has to be the biggest fell over it tastes like ass bro hold on guys I'm gonna go ahead and step out for a second and just go ahead and [ __ ] clean myself up I started to hit me though I like I said I really usually don't like the TVs but I'm pretty sure if you smoke a whole J to the face it definitely is gonna do something to you yeah but the taste it's like a stale bong rip that's the thing it doesn't it really so filtered out at least for me doesn't me it's cool it's cool I like the function of it but honestly overall I feel like I would probably never end up using this again [Music] either way thank you I'm jr. arsenal for this these pieces that you get me I'm gonna go ahead and out this video out here man like I

chose this one because it was on sale for a really good price um the glass is thick the hole in the bottom of this bowl is rather small so you don't have to worry about getting tobacco in your mouth when you're smoking out of this one and the mouthpiece is a decent size the only problem it's not really a problem I like it but the only flaw I would say of this one is the shape it's a weird design and it's kind of awkward to get used to but once you've had it for a minute you smoke out of it and get used to it it's not that awkward it's just different um it was another thing oh yeah and it's again a really small piece it I can conceal it entirely in my hand so it's small and portable and discreet except for you know the giant baubles but yeah that is the Rasta pop chillum from WWE quality glass calm go buy some good quality glass for a fairly decent price", "BffYqvjOosU": "all rights I off one's for you buddy here is my bulk see-through clean it out for ya I may be so let's talk to other people so it depends advisor first right but this one I don't have any people on it's more of a chillum it's really good like a straight shooter man buck wild this one's 10 this one's 15 and I see then 15", "XOId0gociFU": "I'd like to tell everybody tonight about a little item I found that the local dispensary and it's called Chilam oh gee it's a glass tube that's pinched a little bit and see pinched a little at one end then just continues out in a straight line to exit and what I discovered by hit-and-miss is if you take a filter that you can find these very commonly anywhere on the Internet this is the size I found and I'll take a little and cut it so that there's a cut it like maybe two-thirds through the diameter this is difficult I've never done this before and then you can shape it into a cone I'll try to do that and stay in focus maybe fold it a quarter of the way over and give it some disciplining pinches here and there doesn't have to be perfect and you can actually take this if you want and you can take a like the tip of a paintbrush I'm using and you can force this down into the notch and it fits well enough to stay there I don't and if you can see that it's forming a little cup a little Sybil's and what this does it allows a consumer to consume a very small amount of cannabis very quickly and usually with a very good effect I wanted to get to the back end of things and the diameter of this is such that you can take again a commonly obtained cigarette filter and you can insert the cigarette filter on the other side so you've got your cigarette filter there and I'll just turn this over and you've got a screen there as far as the type of metal and whatever arises from the keep that is given to the screen and the cannabis that that's kind of up to your own decision-making and comfort zone okay so there you have it and you can I'm sure everybody out there has got a better way of loading up here and I just wanted to show that this I've never done this before so I can't really get me in the picture here but I'm putting them you can just barely see putting the and so on and then you can pack it in again with I've got some you can see how little I kind of wanted to get everybody's attention to see how little actual cannabis that you you know pull it back that you're actually taking in you're that's that's not a really great amount I would roughly estimate it's about half of a conventional bowl but I'm not a really long time user so don't take that one too seriously okay and so you probably", "aHPct1M9sfw": "and what's up YouTube mr. crazy one back in his mother [ __ ] business um got some package today how to open it already this like kind of take three first [ __ ] recorder on battery died out try to let that charge up and then I started it again and remember you got filled so this is take three um have you know just give you guys against the theory of the boxing I guess sort of feeling whatever you want to call it so first things first you can tell ivory practice without [ __ ] [ __ ] I can't make it as nice as the smoke showers but first piece first um is this egg Oh Gandalf chillum it's about like 3.5 inches very nice i love the color and love the swirls on it I love the weight weighs pretty nice got a nice decent size the the size of the arm or you put your material is perfect size is not too big and is not small it's just perk fur like mm-hmm just for a one person then I usually just put like some roaches in here from leftover smoke of my roll-ups whatever i roll up i just put back in here the perfect size hit perfect size perfect size i love this piece i love the colors is exactly what i wanted and noted and the description that but not youtube description but i like to know um my shipping order when they received it then I wanted this color so yeah I can't wait to smoke that very happy with SAT right there nothing's wrong with it no cracks or nothing exactly what I ordered alright next piece is this one here well I don't know what to make of it it's definitely a nice piece definitely got some nice weight to it's definitely super thick I don't know if you guys could see that but if you look at it you can see the thickness by the world well the world of the glass you can see the thickness right there that's the thickness all the way around up to the top of the filling is another perfect size filling right here perfect got its built-in downstem you fill it up with water I'm very nice piece very nice i love it exactly what I wanted but not the color I'm kind of pissed off about the color causing the other pictures didn't they did have something similar to this color but it didn't have this much orange and you see all this orange it didn't have that in their pictures it was you know I was doing this piece to match this piece cuz uh in the picture they look [ __ ] the light identical see you gotta swirl right there this gotta swirl that's identical to this piece well it didn't come out like that son I definitely don't want to set it back but what's going on with the review of it of the product it's definitely a nice piece look how thick that glasses in the neck you can see it and you can see that it's like mmm definitely worth it was this was like 14 99 definitely worth I got free shipping with it actually I think I hey guy I got free shipping they gave me a compound of free shipping for my last order so i redeemed out with this one so yeah love this piece can't wait to smoke from it so that's basically i'm very satisfied with if there's no cracks or nothing new the only thing that I liked was the color I did it put I don't know that I wanted the blue because I just assumed that they just made like all blues like a dark blue light blue and blue I guess but I'm still happy with the piece I'm I could return it I don't want to go to all that I got some more glass coming in from them next week next couple days matter of fact so yeah definitely love this good let's fill it up water do another review of what I'm smoking out of it this is my two new pieces for today from thick quality glass calm they definitely hooked me up this is both like only twenty dollars or something so definitely go check them out got two new pieces for like twenty bucks with shipping and everything out okay don't hold me on that but this is a true Oh crisis right now uh okay so here we go this is exactly what it was you see the hammer was a 5-inch hammer for 1499 the Chilam was six dollars and then the shipping was about 750 buy a gun and coupon for free shipping so they took that off that's 150 off and it becomes twenty dollars and ninety-nine cents so they're feeling happy with that go check them out do business with them they'll give you coupons free shipping coupon ten-dollar coupons stuff like that so definitely check out the quality class I know I bought a lot of stuff from them already am still got a lot more stuff planned ahead to buy from them I'm still doing other online shopping from other places but my main set pieces that I might be smoking from my getting stuff is definitely gonna be from state quality class comp just cuz no one really ever beat their prices yeah I haven't noticed anything yet so the quality glass that come check them out take quality class calm I peace out you to do another video later on of me

inches and it's kind of arrow yeah but inside it's got little rivets in the glass right here that cool down the smoke and it's got quite a large chamber so it's easy just take a q-tip up in there and clean it out I recommend cleaning any pipe [ __ ] once every other Bowl because if you don't you're gonna get lazy and then you end up with the pipe that's gunked-up and the drawer full of twins triplets quadruplets and so on of pipes that are all clogged but that's just my two cents but I picked this up on a gravel labs website and I just got it today and I said oh [ __ ] I haven't done a

India. It was invented in\nIndia. The culture of owning and smoking in a chillum has spread from India to\nthe rest of the world since the mid-1960s.\nChillum Stone When smoking a chillum a chillum stone\nis often inserted in the pipe to keep from directly inhaling debris much like\na screen or filter is used in other pipes. They are generally tight fitting,\nconical with a flat top and usually have a small hole drilled down through the\ncentre and slits down the sides to allow smoke to pass freely. Before they were\ncommercially available people would search for the right sized pebble off\nthe ground to fit their pipes. Some still do.\nAccording to Alfred Dunhill, Africans have long employed chillum-style pipes\nfor smoking cannabis and later tobacco. Gourds and various horns were often\nemployed while conical bowls were common in Uganda. One of the more famous pipes\nis an ivory cone pipe once belonging to \"Waganda\" monarch King Mtesa.\nMore recently, it has also seen use in sacraments by Rastafari.\nSince the 1960s the embellished bamboo chillum has become an American folk art\nform. These pipes are handmade and often sold by the artists on street corners in\nplaces like the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco and the Greenwich\nVillage area of New York City. As designs these contemporary smoking pipes\nrecall traditional decorated bamboo pipes from Borneo, however, the American\ncarved bamboo design often employs a brass lighting fixture for a bowl. Since\nthe 1970s, street artist Darrel \"Pipeman\" Mortimer of San Francisco has\nmade nearly 10,000 such pipes, each signed, numbered and sold personally.\nRastafari ceremony In \"reasoning sessions\" and grounations,\nthe ritual chillum used is made of a cow's horn or conical wood piece, fitted\nwith a long drawtube giving the smoke time to cool before inhalation.\nA bong-like chillum equipped with a water filtration chamber is sometimes\nreferred to as a chalice, based on a quote from the Biblical book of\nDeuteronomy. Thanks and praises are offered to Jah before smoking the\nchillum.

because this this chunks gonna be [ __ ] man [ __ ] yeah the Bulls hold quite a bit yeah oh yeah they do and honestly I think the bond bowls like this they hold more resin than like the the bowls like this like because yeah you got this part too but you know it's very hard in my opinion to try and scrape all this residue here so I prefer to scrape the bond the bond ones cuz they just hold so much more resin you get so much more resin and it's and in my opinion it's a lot easier to scrape a bond bowl than it is an actual bowl so I'm gonna take this hit of resin pray for me yeah I have green green grass cards I actually have a couple different silicone pipes this one this bog ball came out of a silicone bong and then I have a little silicone Bowl and then I also have a little silicone like what do you call those pipes they're they're like shaped almost like a check mark kind of the Sherlock Holmes type pipe but it's silicone oh wow yeah yeah mine is uh I'd say mine's probably small then smaller medium I don't smoke it but it's crazy yeah yeah I bet honestly like I said I mean I have not scraped or smoked resin and I mean over a month now so it's like it's it's I only [ __ ] do it when I'm completely dry so hopefully I won't have to do this very much off you know after this 17 year old me it was like Joe I know right oh my god I remember being a [ __ ] teenager and like me and my friends would have scraping parties of like alright let's scrape as much [ __ ] resin as we can and then we're just gonna smoke it all you know nowhere as if I thought I'd be doing the same thing yeah that's the shitty part but honestly you know it's it's all good like I'm reopen tomorrow afternoon I can't remember how it tastes been a minute since I smoked resin I got a golf ball-sized resin ball I saved a more add to it Wow honestly organic Ombuds I ain't gonna lie to you this [ __ ] tastes nasty resin tastes [ __ ] nasty to me it tastes like just straight [ __ ] I don't know but yeah it's definitely good for when you guys are like out and like don't have a way to get more until whatever day luckily I'm only have to do this for today because if I had to do this for multiple days I just died so Cheers hopefully you guys are smoking uh it's a better [ __ ] and resen smoke is so light like I just blew that whole [ __ ] cloud out it looked pretty decent but when I was watching it like I'm the camera like didn't maybe sprinkle some key from the grinder on that [ __ ] lol yeah that's what I did that night oh [ __ ] that's what I did last night because me and my girlfriend smoked a little bit of resin out of a bowl I scraped and the steamroller and that was fine like I even took I even scraped like in the jar like this is just one but I have my big jar you guys have seen but like honestly I'll go through here and I'll [ __ ] scrape the key in the jar get the Keef in the jar and then I'll pour it onto the resin now that that's nice definitely definitely if you're scraping runs and put some [ __ ] Keef on it I'll make it even better yeah yeah as a teenager that's all the time and it's crazy because think about when we were all [ __ ] teenagers like we didn't [ __ ] say that we didn't we didn't we weren't [ __ ] in high school sitting there saying oh I'm gonna smoke this just one Bowl and call it good now man we were in high school smoke we bought a bag we smoked that whole bag before we went home you know have I have a roach jar oh man see roaches are nice too I do like roaches kiss like if you get a good collection you can either roll over on road Roach joint or you know you can break it up and you know put it in a bowl or a bong or something but honestly I'm not even gonna lie to you guys I cannot [ __ ] roll a joint to save my [ __ ] life if I could I'd probably have roaches too but [ __ ] I cannot [ __ ] roll a joint now I could roll a Blanc okay it's not good but it's okay I like to think I wrote it's to get anyone hurt yeah exactly or you ever done I like to when I have like half a wood I have like half a half a joy or like half a blunt left I'll put it in a bong bowl and make a time bomb out of it time bombs are nice too mason jar of half J's and roaches damn organic home buds man you lucky [ __ ] yeah man uh half Jays and roaches that'd be dope I even like tried to get some wax out of this some reclaim because what my friend gave it to me you know it was it was like this but it had a little bit more reclaim in it so I like scraped it and did a couple dabs but my tolerance is just too high that you know you can't just do one of them little tiny things and be fine I dab more days and less friends step over than the green come out they don't dab oh damn see I got a friend who doesn't dab on a rig but loves these wax cartridges and then I've got you know I've got friends who don't even don't like to dab either but I like today I'm I really do I love to dab but I just wish my lungs I wish my lungs just wouldn't give out on me sometimes cuz man I'll tell you what I'm - [ __ ] you up and now views closer to me I smoke I'm a good or dad yeah exactly exactly we still would definitely got a plan something now and we'll have a smoke sesh for sure every dope if we could get like a smoke sesh with like all the youtubers who are in like in like the clothes who are able to like meet up that'd be pretty sweet legit dabs yeah green grass grows where are you where are you from where are you from June get in the dispenser in June Missouri okay see I mean there's I found a couple of those Penn juries that they just charged out the house I mean it's unreal it is on real I mean oh my god so it's like I would love to buy some wax straight from the dispensary you know and sometimes what up Devo the dude another one from Missouri what's up what's up how is the weather in Missouri is it uh you guys get snow in Missouri I've never actually been in Missouri I don't think I'm in Detroit every Saturday most the time okay yeah we can definitely figure something out cuz I'm only like 40 minutes maybe from Detroit yeah I'm not that far from Detroit plus me and my girlfriend are actually trying to find a house and move so we're hoping to stay in Michigan honestly but we're also looking in Toledo man I was wrong oh wait I missed something okay yeah my lungs hate me sometimes I've tried glob all day or night yeah man oh my god and I got asthma so it's like oh I'll sit there and if I'm doing like a nice-sized dab or something I will straight up hit my inhaler first cuz I'm like all my lungs are not gonna like this at all I went for my cultivator license right away when it became illegal because I thought it would be 36 months our program oh yeah I took Michigan like it legalized and it took Michigan almost like a year to get a recreational dispensary up at least where I'm at I don't know about uh elsewhere but I'm pretty sure it was all the same that they had to wait until about a year I feel you brother only thing I got is resin what's up Rick T oh man now I know it did sucks don't it really sucks luckily I only got to smoke this until tomorrow but it [ __ ] sucks oh man you and get yourself some closet yeah yeah I actually honestly and I know I don't really I don't care but like you know I don't I don't buy from the dispensary all the time because you know most of the time you know I've got people that I know who grow their own and all that [ __ ] and you know I I would much rather go through a friend of mine to get you know the same good [ __ ] you know it's coming straight from the dispensary still it's just I'm getting a better deal on so it's like that's why you know there would be some times I don't really know you know like I don't know like my girlfriend want to go to the dispensary to is the one this weekend but we were looking at the menu and it was like $80 for [ __ ] gram of wax and I was like nah I'm golden on that I'm really golden on all that let's see did I miss anything else [ __ ] No okay we're golden yeah and honestly the bomb is coming on when I might not have smoked when it comes oh man Rick oh that sucks man that sucks when I start growing I see I want to start growing I have it yeah I got my med and caregiver card so not that high for me see that's the thing too is I could at any point I could literally go get my head card I try I did before I went to Ann Arbor that's where I went to do it but I didn't have the paper that said I had post-traumatic stress disorder so they tried to call my therapist because the lady was like if I can just get her on the phone to say yes you have PTSD then they woulda gave me that gave me my card right then and there but they didn't [ __ ] answer so she must have been busy so I don't know and now it's legal so who knows I might try and get my med card again because I know I can I've already been told that I'm I can I just I don't know I guess it would just depend all to see you know if it would be worth it for me if you've never really grown it's really not that hard even when you're messing up don't use bag seeds yeah green grass grows I actually was talking to somebody I can't remember oh who was it somebody on YouTube who grows and they told me to check out OTO flowers because those I guess will be the easiest to grow with for a first-time grower so I don't know if you know anything about Auto flowers or anything like that but if you have any input on that then definitely cuz I was gonna go with the clones but I get the dude was saying that with the clones you still can't tell you know with the auto flowers I guess like you can actually like you'll know that it's a female plant instead of a male plant I'm going autos right now and I kind of disagree okay you disagree I'm curious to see I'm curious to see why you disagree because again I don't really know but I've photopigments and autobots okay okay I mean I'd still like to get your input on it because I have never grown yet I have seedsman White Widow and Otto's going on my channel right now okay I'm definitely I have my computer right here I'm about to go check that out Oh green grass grows I feel like I've definitely checked out your channel I feel like I've seen some of your videos for sure it would be cool to see you grow manic yeah yeah and I would definitely do it on YouTube because like I definitely want input and [ __ ] and also all you fellow stoners like I'm I would love after I do my first grow I would love to send you guys a gram or something so that I send you guys a little bud of the stuff that I've grown so that way you guys can try and almost review it for me and kind of like give me your input on it see what I can do differently cuz you know my friends can obviously do it but you know I want somebody who's you know who grows and like stuff like that so I disagree Otto's are not the easiest thing to grow most new growers I'm missing so much okay I'll get back right with you so low life I'm pretty sure yeah solar life Organic how much that's why it's so much legal prices you pay six yeah tax was ten yeah exactly it's all about [ __ ] taxes so that's exactly why but that's also why that I don't because again you know I have I have a good good buddy who you know I trust and he goes you know he goes right for me and he does everything you know he just he grows his own [ __ ] he makes his own wax so it's like you know go right there instead of ya doing whatever let's see what else okay I've saw their eyes so that also solar life you know cheers what's up man thanks for talking stopping in awesome Rick T I'm glad you tuned in for updates I disagree okay here's where I were most new grower overdo it in autos don't like that just start small if you're worried about it get a good light for ten sighs it will be worth the extra cars could get it'll be worth the cost they're temperamental okay see I only plan on growing one or two plants to start off I am getting a tent on Amazon the one I looked at was uh what was it somebody else asked me with ten sighs let me see if I can pull it up real quick so over water or feed Otto's okay so with the over watering and over feeding is it are you saying that it would be like easier to over water and over feed on Otto's compared to a clone or to a seed let's see what else am I missing if you're worried about the smell get a carbon filter on Amazon and an inline fan snow gone if the tents closed um I'm not really worried about though I'm not really gonna be worried about the smell but that is a good I will definitely keep that in mind just in case I mean it's all just gonna depend - cuz if we get a house you know if we get a house then I'll have no problem with the smell whatever if we're an apartment building or an apartment you know complex something like that triplex duplex where we have like somebody close in the building then I probably will go ahead and get a carbon filter on Amazon an inline fan just that way you know the smell won't be let's see I'm on Instagram now Grammys if you want to see a flower and check out diva the dude - an Instagram oh hell yeah diva the dude I'm definitely gonna get you on Instagram I don't know if you can do it from the actual computer Instagram because I'm using my phone to stream but I will most definitely yeah I can definitely search

notification button because I want to see this White Widow grow cuz yeah white widows are my favorite strains would you say white widow is easy to grow or you know what what would you say I've been trying to find people's opinions on strains for first-time burns cuz I know some strains you know are harder to grow or some take longer and stuff like that so far people have said Northern Lights is a real easy one to grow when you're starting off gorilla grew number four is my favorite yeah I love gorillas grew number four too as well definitely definitely a very very good strength no Fox Fox demon Shippo do you grow yourself I'm about to go check out your channel after this - it's been very easy and I've had super light and - flower oh all right awesome I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to keep that in mind then cuz ya white widows were my favorite strains for sativas that's for sure but then I grilled your number for its good - but then you got granddaddy purp granddaddy perks really good and train wreck I like train wreck - you always pick an old spoon that's been around a long time if you're looking at that started rowing alright an old strength okay I wonder what would happen

marijuana like I do I love to follow the people that do we tubes and stuff and even the people that you know they they watch or you can tell that there could you ever get people that they don't smoke weed and you know it's just kind of awkward for them to be on your channel but like so that's why yeah I do I like to go through the comments so I probably saw you either in a livestream that's what I'll do is I'll get people I'll subscribe to them when I see them in a livestream or if I saw you comment on somebody's video so that's probably why I found your channel I have UK cheese UK cheese

do they think autos are better med talk 101 what's up man thank you so much appreciate it and in tendo 64 got a rep it pill gar is the no-till King haha take a huge Ripper hell yeah I'm going to if you do the problem you're gonna have with autos is if you mess up hard and bad your yield is probably going to suffer okay now would you say veg is the hardest part or is it the flowering process yeah pilgrim pilgrim knows his stuff oh yeah you can tell he yeah you can tell he does the clocks in my latest video okay so the feeding twice is awesome let's see this Oh what the [ __ ] you guys gotta see this [ __ ] on his dope [Music] that was the clock now I gotta waiting see the cake yeah that's that's like that's a sweet pocket clock man all right let's see what did I miss now okay let's see depends on the strain with autos they can be great for beginners as no flip excetera but they can be temperamental they can be temperamental especially nutrients best addicted notice of something organic awesome awesome stealth car okay so no tell actual living organic for autos okay make sure we hit the like armies please and thank you oh hell yeah Devo the dude I appreciate that yeah I appreciate that guys you guys are awesome if you do photoperiod they can handle a lot more training and you can decide when to flip meaning more control of how you grow per one okay okay photo period it I have honestly I've never heard of that term before so the definition of it says a period of time each day during which an organism receives illumination day length so I'm sorry if I'm dumb but yeah so what exactly is the photo period photos a pretty safe bet all around making is that like a clown I'm very confused I'm sorry guys they can take the mistake so you can make sure they're healthy before you flip okay okay that an older new hoodie I it's an older one I've had it for over a year now yeah I've had it for oh no no I don't think so I don't think it's that old I got it from my girlfriend gave it to me so I don't know where she got it from my first run was autos lit and living organ was okay that just pretty forgiving but Otto flowers give you about a month before they start flower okay okay so if you mess up and don't get the chance to let the plant recover when you create the problem okay let me know which you decide out and I'll send you some music oh hell yeah man I would really appreciate that I will I'll definitely let you know like it so I'm going to look more into it and see you know who knows maybe I'll do one of each if I do decide to do two plants maybe maybe do one auto and one one of the others photo periods are plants is twelve and twelve to flip okay okay that makes more sense because yeah I knew I had something to do with light just based off the definition or whatever but uh means eighteen hours late on in six hours light off okay and they grow in bed they don't flower until each change lights to twelve twelve okay reacts to light it will remain a veg and definitely as long as it's getting less than 12 hours darkness once you flip in twelve twelve for flower they'll judge for a couple weeks and butt out okay okay good to know good to know autos were flower regardless of the amount of light they get okay all right that that's kind of nice about autos then that's definitely pretty nice about autos delecia Casper skimpy Limpy Skippy lippy I'm sorry I hope I said that right but what's up thank you for John stopping in thank you um and I know we have I'm pretty sure we've got some new people in here I need to make sure you guys are

so I'll keep that in mind I'll keep that in mind stealth grower thank you wrench gang yep wrench gang mod squad Mod Squad like that Rick T I'm blue of addy daba da yeah yeah [ __ ] yeah an IG if you

will man I will definitely hit you up peace out peace out thanks for stopping in I really appreciate that peace out together don't shake ass soon I'm right oh this is like oh wow it's like weird okay yeah guys [ __ ] well I've been taking a hit off this in a minute I was gonna try and do a reclaim a reclaimed AB but I don't know if I'll be able to get to get any out of it I was doing them yesterday ultimately it comes down to how fast you want the harvest if you're gonna put put the effort in and make sure everything is checked on all the time it cetera zan audits are you're way too fast buds in your hand okay yeah I'm probably gonna do the autos up because I am gonna be I'm definitely gonna have the time to be able to you know do what I need to do take care of them check on them I also have a question cheeks I do have quite a few growers in here now I have noticed in some of your guys's videos you will play like bird music like bird chirping and like nature sounds when you're in your grow now is that like would you say that you know playing that kind of like relaxing calm music to your plants will actually help them I would pop autos and normal ones the way you can veg photos out for 3-4 weeks and flip them so finish in the same time so no but there won't be as big as Auto this grow faster and faster photos too I would pop autos and normal ones honestly I think I'm going to I think I'm going to Rick I definitely think I'm gonna do one of each because I'm probably gonna do one one plant I mean I mean two plants so it would be it would be definitely fine yeah it's just some long flowering stew Tevas for your first grow your our veins will populate I should finish hell yeah hell yeah yeah honestly I fried check out some white widow because I like how yours is looking and like I said it's one of my favorite strains so so while you're waiting for your veg finish you can have the autos finished awesome awesome if you don't mind waiting the extra month four to six weeks then photo period will yield you way more so now all right stuff RF I do one auto and one photo period now I mean could that would that work if I do one of each I've seen people do that I play music I like and jam out while I'm doing my work in there awesome awesome yeah I'd probably do that too the more you're hanging out in there singing and talking whatever the extra co2 is yeah yeah I've heard people I've heard people talk about doing that too you know going in there and talking to your plants and singing and stuff like that I did hear that that's good for your plants to pop one of each grow or tap one of each grow the Otto out fully I'm 24 yeah I'm gonna do that I'll do pop I'll just pop one of each then grow the Otto out first and while I beds the photo and then I'll harvest the Otto and flip the photo to flower yeah and that'll be perfect cuz then I'll have one plant already harvested while I'm still waiting for that photo so that'll be Dobby did it good ambience in the garden is more natural like wind but I don't care if they respond if it can hurt that okay what size 10 am I gonna go with see I'm getting it off Amazon let me look up the let's see it is a 24 by 24 by 48 or I I'm pretty sure I can go bigger and this one too I could go bigger but I am only I am only doing yeah they I can with the 10 I'm getting they have it up to the biggest tent they have is looks like 120 by 16 by 78 washing sucks oh man I've heard I'm not excited be really aware of the height of the tent you buy okay okay okay especially because everybody knows Otto's man they get big it will surprise you by either how short it is or how way too tall it is okay all right so what would be a good size then because I've got like I said they have seating well the one I was looking at was 24 by 24 by 48 but they also got a 32 by 32 by 63 and the 36 by 20 by 63 and so forth what would you guys say let's see and Devo the dude is flushing right now oh man that sucks we feel for you it will surprise you I would I already buy that plants respond to vibration and subsonic baths based it makes them grow faster apparently lots of wheat research to say music helps them grow though yeah wow that's interesting yeah I mean like I said I'd obviously be playing music in there anyway would I be in there but yeah that's pretty nice I built my own box four by four by 7.5 Wow nice nice so you're going for a two foot two foot that's four foot high I mean again if that would work yeah if a two foot two by two that's four foot high if that would work then yeah probably four feet isn't much and that was what that was the 24 by 24 right so I need higher what's the 63 what's the 32 by 32 63 by 63 let's see what that would be mm it depends on the area you need a tall tent so your lights don't get too close if they grow tall oh that's true that's true okay so maybe one of the 63s maybe uh 36 36 by 20 by 63 maybe less the frequency for the plants is 432 Hertz okay I'm not to look music there we go that way I got this already saved for 32 Hertz alright thank you now G let's see less than $100 for your box nice nice yeah the 10 I'm looking at I don't know and so it's like this one does not say how much the 36 by 20 is let's try the 36 I said I can't I can't tell how much it is but the the one I was looking at was 52 bucks I think oh let's see you consider pot high probably want a tent that's tall as you or higher probably higher Rick T cuz I'm not even gonna lie to you I'm only 5'4 so I'm pretty [ __ ] short when you consider pot height extra height to get spot off the floor hang tight of lights okay check out sonic boom bloom online for playing to the plants all right definitely will do now G and then light to plant separation that's fine for two plants bro yeah it's a bit short but would work still depends on the light use okay and that's another thing I'm not even sure what the light because the light I was originally gonna use somebody said don't get it cuz it's just cheap you know I mean it was like a twenty dollar light I'm an Amazon a twenty dollar girl like I don't know what the wattage on it was let me see oh wait actually no no wait well these are kids if you go with a short end just make sure you flip your photo periods and flower after a few weeks okay okay will do if you don't it's going to outgrow your stuff in flower okay I have also have a two point five by three four five bedroom oh nice nice Steve oh nice marijuana botany is a good book too okay I'll have to check that out I'll check that out in IG can't go wrong with a two by four tent allows a few different setup options awesome keep that in mind unless a strain just isn't a stretcher I don't know if that's a thing I don't know who excuse me I don't know either I mean everyone I watch on YouTube it I mean it definitely seems like your plants grow you know your plants definitely get some height on you look at all these cool people spreading the good word haha some information is spreading soon you all know how to grow monster plants exactly that's what it's all about man that's that it's all about helping people out and you know I love watching people grow because it's so it's it's great to see the different you know the processes and watch these plants grow you know so that's definitely awesome I really appreciate all the advice to guys five foot or higher is preferable all right I'll keep that in mind I'll definitely get one that's five foot or above if you want to just save some bucks and learn starting with a two by two won't hurt but just expect you're going to like it and want to get a bigger tent in no time yeah and at that point if I'm gonna want to buy a bigger of ten anyway I might as well just a [ __ ] and buy a bigger tent what's up Mac eats let me make you blue my dude alright you are now part of the the wrench gang and the Mod Squad cheap Amazon onblur balls will still grow you some decent weed bro they just have [ __ ] so they burn out and don't last but if it's only your first run to save cash and it'll be fine all right thank you thank you self girl I appreciate that I really do because I really I really don't have you know I really don't have a whole lot to spend but I definitely I even been looking at that the kits the Amazon kits that come with the light the tent I think I found one whole kit came with everything for like 279 and that's not too bad cuz the tunnel owns 50 bucks I hope you're having a wonderful day Mac eats especially in a small town okay a lot of Amazon lights a 1500 watt 2000 watt stuff like that it's misleading they do not in any way pull that much power okay all right good morning Dedra good morning let's make you blue Deidre you are now blue you are now part of the wrench the wrench gang and the Mod Squad no point buying a big-ass expensive fancy light for a tiny tent that is true that is true now if I had you know if I was doing like I know a lot more plants if I was having a bigger space yeah I definitely go with the more expensive light the more the more powerful light for sure for sure see Mars hydro TS 600 watt LED will juice for a small time perfect and online for $75 oh and honestly Mars hydro is a very very good brand I know a lot of people use Mars hydro and those are those are nice that's actually not bad either I'll check that out perfect for a first grow in a 2x2 or 3x3 awesome wrench gang a yeah that one was green grass grows came up with wrench gang and then Rick tee said Mod Squad so see I bought of blurple for my first one because I didn't know better it works well though I just hate the color okay what uh what color is if you don't mind me ask I had to Google did see I'll email you some links for stuff some stuff bro I can point

mind me asking their customer service is absolutely horrific though like the worst company ever in the world to deal with oh man I hope I never need to deal with their customer service then cuz I oh man I can't do that no problem Dedra no problem you're now part of the the wrench gang in the Mod Squad I got to watch my dog so I'll keep you on but I'll be pizza y'all peace out Rick T I really appreciate you stopping - peace out man organic home buds I got their first 300 watt - there's TS 1,000 light okay okay now how much did you spend on that if you don't mind me asking um drop Mars an email see if they'll send you the light yeah I will yeah I have to do that I'll have to do that I tried to get him to sponsor me but I only have 60 set I'm selling they said not now oh that's that's so disappointing green grass grows that's disappointing I mean I don't have I only have like three 43 43 so I'm proud they'd probably be like get out of here but I mean it's worth a shot who knows maybe I will maybe I will what's up bad boy always good haven't you in the chat what's up man how you been another customer service representative she's into my facebook groups oh that's funny that's funny it's a bluish purple colour sucks for making videos but it is important for making resins and terpenes flavonoids and makes a smell better in my opinion that is ok ok yeah yeah yeah I guess that would that would suck for making videos but as long as it works I mean heck yeah that's that's nice yeah a thousand was like a little over a hundred that's I mean that's not too bad I mean I've seen people pay hundreds of dollars for these lights I run to Mars hydros in my 2x4 they're great lights for the price especially the SP series but just pray you don't ever need to contact them for anything a little absolute waste of time trying to heck yeah oh yeah yeah I'm definitely gonna check out the Mars hydro lights and see what I can do with that Organic home buds paid Creed breath Rose

also because you can't see the plant it's color without", "GRzGU94h6Yw": "[Music] hi it's mad at roughhouse studios today we're going to unbox and review the King golden fish glass blunt from Atman [Music] first things first let's unbox to admin gold and fish and see what it's all about how first we have the golden fish unit itself there's some sort of a cleaning rod we have a card an instruction card there's a brush a cleaning brush and then we have some sort of silicon tip and we'll get to the uses of that later [Music] okay now let's take a close look at the king golden fish unit and what we have is a metal tube it's about the size of a small cigar and then we have a glass and on the other end which has a plunger like tip that goes up and down sort of like a lipstick plunger where you turn the tip and it it moves it rotates it upwards and then at the very tip of the glass you see there's a line and that's the maximum fill line and you don't want to unscrew it any further than that if you do you'll have some problems and then you can adjust the amount of cannabis that you have put inside of it by screwing the tip up or down and at full capacity it holds easily a gram of cannabis and then we have our cleaning tool which is used to clean the air pad and you have several holes on the mouthpiece in that create an air path through the center shaft and then that air path comes out at the bottom of the chamber where there's some more air holes that you can clean there and that's how you keep it clean and I would recommend cleaning it pretty often okay so now we had a close look at this the next thing and the best thing about doing a review of these kinds of things is to test it out with some weed so now we're going to go ahead and test and a king golden fish and see how it smokes you don't really need to use a grinder for this you can easily just break it up by hand because you can put pretty good size snugs inside of there much like any kind of blunt and then at full capacity it easily holds a gram of cannabis which is really nice and it's it's super easy to load you can put your finger right into the end of it and unlike a blunt you don't have to worry about breaking the paper apart or anything like that so you can pack it pretty tight and we've got about a gram in there now but you could easily pack your heart if you want and get probably a gram and a half maybe in there but we're gonna load it up here to a full capacity and give it a shot one thing I noticed about it right away is that it gives you massive hits it seems like every single time you get a huge hit it has a nice even pull it's got a nice draw it stays pretty cool down by the metal part but of course if you touch the glass you're going to get burned but that's the case with any kind of blunt if you touch the tip of a blunt you're going to get burned one thing I like about it is that it doesn't stay lit so you have to light it each time which some people may find to be a hassle but I really like it because it keeps your cannabis from just smoking away ok now so what about that funky little silicon tip that we had before maybe it's to keep the mouthpiece cool well it's not really for that because it's not really necessary maybe it's a funnel to funnel cannabis down into it perhaps you could use it for that but again it's pretty easy to pack so that's not necessary either so here's what it's really for it's actually an adapter so that you can put it on a 14 millimeter or 18 or 19 millimeter bong and hit it right out of your glass pipe so that's a really cool feature and of course we're going to test it out using that too Jr's gonna load it up this time and test it out with our glass pipe here and it's made so that you can insert it into the top and it holds it in good but it's got kind of a fluted top that you stick it into which makes it really easy to be able to pull it right out and carve it so again massive hits filtered right through the water and that was really cool I really like that feature in fact I really liked almost everything about the King golden fish I'm gonna give it four and a half stars I'm taking off a half a star because the suggested retail price is 69.95 is a little high but you could actually find them for about twenty nine thirty five dollars which i think is a good fair price for a really cool device so I'd really like to thank the guys at admin for sending out the King golden fish if you'd like to learn more or to purchase one please check out Atman market.com and you can also find those at other retailers online I hope you enjoyed this review of the Atman King golden fish if you did please hit the thumbs up and also please subscribe to roughout Studios for more cannabis culture

No mess, no bags, no microwave, no boiling on the stove, nothing like that. Very simple, very effective. I really like this method. uh... First you want to seal off the bowl, and any other holes that might be on the pipe like carbs, or anything like that. I'm using electrical\ntape. You don't have to but it works very well, it doesn't leak if you wrap it correctly, and most people have it laying around... but I've used plastic wrap in the past and other things... but anyway, you want to completely seal off the\npipe like i'm doing here. I'm going to speed it up just a bit here... and next we're going to grab some kosher salt. (just press that in and make sure\neverything is all sealed off) I'm going to use kosher salt here, you don't have to. If you just have regular salt you can use that too, but kosher salt is a more effective scrubbing agent. You don't want it completely\npacked full, you want room for your solvent as well, which we'll add in a second... If you end up with too much salt in there just knock a bit of it back out. I'm using 100% pure acetone.\nYou can also use nail polish remover or rubbing alcohol, but pure acetone is the best, it work like magic. As with the salt, you don't want it completely full of acetone. You want some air in there, maybe about twenty percent. You want your cleaning solution to be able to move freely and move around... so leave a little air in there. We're going to finish sealing off the pipe. Make sure it's completely sealed up, and tight. And then you're going to shake, shake, shake, shake! If you clean your pipe on a regular basis you can get away with two or three minutes, and it will be clean. If it's REALLY funky, I've had to shake up to ten minutes. It just depends on how much use the pipe has gotten. Shake shake shake! also I just want to make a little note: I've seen a lot of videos here on YouTube where people are putting alcohol and salt into a bag and they're kind of missing the point. The\npoint of the salt is that it doesn't dissolve in the solvent and remains a good scrubbing agent. You want that on the inside of the pipe That's why I like to sealing it off like I do in this method. ... also you'll notice I already had the water running before I rinse it out, because you want it to be nice and hot when you use it first, you don't want to wait for it to heat up. I'm going to manually scrub out the bowl here because you'll usually have a couple little bits and pieces left in there, it doesn't get a lot of flow... but the insides are already perfect. I'm going to give it one little quick rinse here with acetone, one more time, just to get rid of anything that may have redeposited on the inside of the pipe when I put the water in there. Give it one more hot water rinse, make sure you have all the residue out and it is just clean water. Dry it off. I'm going to bring it back over to the light source so you can see how we did... BOOM! Clean pipe, like the day it was blown.", "H2ubBxoLelI": "vehicle to be me hey Stan boilin strikingly touching committing us to take the pressure of Shiva Larry I fish not me I also know how do you say

don't use on videos too often but we usually use it with like a bigger group of people because it's a bit of a bigger pipe Alabang yeah it's a pipe now if you guys have heard of it like helix pipes they have these little vents right here that are built in on quite an angle it allows the smoke to go through the air to go through into the pipe making the smoke spin quite drastically inside the big drop shaped chamber here that's my big ass he looks pipe it's probably about 30 millimeters thick in here [ __ ] and a nice big bowl see compared to my thumb fits right in there and there's still space nice big bowl so I'll drop he's the Swede in there I'll show you guys how that works you already know or whatever [ __ ] it here's the time to load your bowl and have a pull with me I got some of the same crushes that was smoking on yesterday check out yesterday's videos got the bigger buds here the light in this room is not the best for the camera especially yeah some of the good coach left anyway the trustee bit early eonni well kapa quite the upset stomach I think I got a little bit of maybe minor food poisoning or something from that some of that but anyways chilling out here today or on Wednesday and yeah I'll show you guys how this works [Applause] was one of the only reasons people don't like using this blade as the chamber here's actually hard to clear the Russia's rate built on the very end of the pole and so when you go to clear it you actually have to use your your palm cover the bowl and then you didn't bleed it open otherwise that's quite the task and if you fill that big helix part in here with a bunch of smoke and try to clear it without covering the bowl it just allows more smoke to come in so you're not clear nothing they're just gonna choke

you [ __ ] idiot [ __ ] idiot you're the [ __ ] stupid one for thinking oh my god away with me oh no it came back to bite just stupid ass and ass stupid ass [ __ ] anyways really dirty though percent me is this her vaporizer it's currently how we all do I'm doing just [ __ ] now that I said that fake-ass [ __ ] right here what's this because I don't need that in my life I don't oh [ __ ] so it's heated up now and this I'm gonna be honest I don't really like it that much like it's cool it's like I'll hit it I'll still keep it but like I wouldn't go by it you see you sucked for a long time you don't really get anything I've tried this before I didn't really work what for the second video sucks I try it out it was working so good at first also it does get really hot up here and it also turns off like in the middle and after four minutes [Music] you see there's like barely me it's like nothing it's all my eyes in conclusion don't buy the herb vaporizer kind of disappointed", "q-Ywutn1eTw": "alright so there's gonna be actually the third time I tried filming this video because my pipe was really dirty and all this resin was making it really hard for me to take a DAB so I am [ __ ] cleaning it with hot water and a pipe cleaner napkins water and there's probably another video up on Matt finally cleaned it so let's take a DAB off my grab nail my grab nail and here's my little dab container it's a little dirty but it'll do the job and then a little torch perfect and you're just gonna heat it up on the bottom here until it gets red you're also gonna just turn it around so that way it doesn't just only get one side hot you want me all the sides hot and you want to think red red hot so that we your whole dad can be heated up not ain't working I'm moving around careful with these here though that's a much cleaning much much cleaning it works much better but I bet you right after this it's gonna get clogged you see how it's starting to get red I'm Chilean in my car part and then I'm gonna go back I'm not driving fYI I just want somewhere quiet to film so I'm filming in my car so I'm get bothered anywhere else but as you can see it's starting to get red and I think we're almost ready to take our dad whoa who's ready who is ready okay and here we go here's my little thing ready to go and you're gonna hold on that like this for a bit well.alright mean that that ladies and gentlemen it's how you take a dab off this you know I mean it's not to dab to nail but if you're interested in one of these little grass damn nails for on-the-go EDC Las Vegas little things like that they're about like 15 to 20 dollars very convenient very portable all you pretty much need is a dab tool unless you use crumble and a little torch was like five six dollars angry wax of choice so I'm gonna put this down on in description and then you guys can [ __ ] buy one I never know how you guys like it yay or nay and then what other videos I should record again more weed or dated I think my next one might be a review of bait pens and edibles stick around bye", "6Sp8ybtP--0": "[Music] [Music]", "ra_g1tOb2qY": "what's up y'all for all my smokers out there just want to show y'all something when y'all got your little uh smoke pipes or whatever the case be you know you definitely got to clean them but a lot of that grunt draw stuff and certain other type smoking cleaning accessories they cost the arm and a leg right so you got to find a way to you know keep your stuff clean so basically as you see see right there that little house kind of white all up in there and salt eating up the uh tar that's on the pipe or whatever the case be but just to show you an example get out the light see all that right there and it's all tar particles man that's the stuff that get you know sticks on your lungs man and you see how kind of uh well let's get out the light a little bit more see how kind of it's like almost like a milky white looking color man and just a little little shake as you see see all that [ __ ] floating around up in there man hold up but let's get a piece of paper towel real quick let's get a piece of paper towel let's go over here to the sink real fast hold on one second one second hold up try that out let's ride that out real quick put this piece of paper towel right there and let's open it up as you see let me just pour it out real slow too and as you see how that the law of particles sticking to the paper that's the stuff that sticks to your lungs man so you know gotta smoke healthy nowadays man you know a lot of this stuff wasn't taught to us growing up smoke a tree you know what i mean and as you see right there the pipe that got hold up see if we could go back the pipe they got like the little white on there there's salt right there man that got stuck to the pipe because that little piece right here is metal or whatever the case be and the other one is just a plain porcelain one or whatever but the metal one as you see as soon as i put uh a q-tip or whatever up in there and you know put the uh little cleaning pipe stick that has the little um the little needle brushes on the side of it just gonna scrape that stuff right on out and then you know it's always good to clean your products man so that way you get that clean smoke but let's talk about how what i use to actually clean this with considering the fact that i said you know stuff like grunge off all that other stuff is costly man so basically what i did was this that's it some plain dawn but i cut it with a couple other materials too but dawn is the main thing i use so basically what i do with the dawn i'll pour some of it up inside of it first that's the first thing and this is any smoking pipe it could be anything it ain't got to be the two little cigarette fake porcelain cigarette joints like i got because all i use these for is to smoke my little roaches up when i ain't got no treat you know my name so basically just some dawn a plain old water bottle you know my name put some dawn inside of it first so it drips all the way down to the bottom right here and just keep doing it and before you uh throw the uh the filter cigarettes inside of the water bottle place salt inside of it or whatever the case being try to you know tap it down so the salt will go down and preferably use kosher salt kosher sea salt because it works the best because kosher sea salt is like an abrasive it's almost like sandpaper in a way so it's definitely going to clean up the little gunk that's on the side as you see definitely going to get the thing to clean that out so basically dawn soap specifically dawn water bottle very very very very hot water salt a little bit of bleach and you know if you want to add something to it like say some mouthwash that'll work too just to get the uh the bleach smell off of it so once you do that and like i said very very very hot water as hot as the bottle could get without it melting once you do that don't fill it up all the way either just to fill it up maybe about right up in there somewhere you know maybe a little bit above the green tape line right there because which what you're going to do once it's filled up you're going to shake the crap out of it man and then that's how you see the little particles as you see it's still on there a whole lot of it man still you can fold that out oh my flash turned off as you see man see all the little specs right there i don't know why my camera's zoomed in anyway see all the little specs right there man that's the stuff that stick to your lungs bro and let's look at the bottle again even though it's mainly cleared out you can still see a lot of it stuck in there so basically let's throw that out the water bottle pick that top up in a second and you know just take the little thin cleaning pipe sticks and just keep going down inside of it until it's all gone so i'm going to do that right now before it dries out but just an alternative to get your pipes clean any smoke pipe it ain't got to be these it could be your regular stuff you stuff bud in and hit it like that it cleans it the same way but unfortunately you know the bigger pipes won't hold or won't fit inside of a water bottle so you have to find an alternative man but again dawn antibacterial or any type dawn it don't matter the flavor because i use uh orange and pineapple and all these other flavors it's all do the same thing and like i said just like a little bit my new bleach to do like a disinfectant more and uh very very hot water water bottle and sea salt kosher see-saw has to be that specifically because again kosher sea salt is you know it's nuggety and it's acts like an abrasive and uh i should have did a video to show you how the salt was interacting with the uh the tar because it was uh it was literally eating the tar up man you should you know you'll see it as you do your own little uh experiment with it and it gets everything clean man so i'm gonna go clean these again right now before they completely dry out and yeah highlight your boy segway", "DIOKNWOI64M": "I mmm", "mC8Z994mLJc": "oh hey guys what's up its mar 6 and this is the hot box two or three depending on if the first two that really could not my to delete that might have been the largely difference so let me catch this real quick before I get started so um actually I'm just gonna close out [ __ ] I'm feeling joking one second nice a clean play this one week [ __ ] is already getting dirty filthy what the [ __ ] Oh cleaner out so this is the hot box blog for just the hot box um this weekend I got some special guests showing up sorry I I was looking at that but the cameras right there so I got some special guests coming up and my special guess I just need some of my friends but and i'm assuming just right now by talking there's someone that will see this eventually I'm not I know right now on youtube I got a bunch of videos and like [ __ ] novias but whatever you know maybe he'll catch on I'm just doing this for fun just doing this for me just cuz I feel like it oh yeah get that oh my god just just get all you get a little bit ball ah no don't spill dude god damn it alright so this is the only problem with me and packing weed and the reason I can't roll I had cancer when I was 16 bone cancer Ewing sarcoma bad [ __ ] um better now next year I'll be in my 10 years it's all be cured but uh my right dominant hand I mean look at this [ __ ] look I can't close my fingers like okay you see this like they want and yeah so it leads to pot everywhere just everywhere but the good part about that is when I'm running low on bud I can I just brushed off in the car and I keep my car relatively clean so I brush it off we'll find it later sometimes they can find it not that's the best feeling in the world when you're looking for it and you're like God I don't got any money until next week but I just gotta do something to get through today [ __ ] find a nug in your garden what's our [ __ ] out of it alright so oh pardon me so what bi smoking on today well oh the reason was being a video I said all I had a have YouTube red and I have music on it and it plays in the background but apparently doesn't play when you're recording by the way super convenient um if you have a dog or whatever surest oh by the way sir esto works [ __ ] fantast months that's not a product placement so this is what we'd be smoking on oh oh this is some Alabama dream I think which is some blue dream and alabama kush but it leans more towards the alabama kush side blue dream is a lot more dense than that but um unfortunately right now i have it on the front facing camera so i can't really give you that much detail of it but it is a co focus if I put my hand focus on some good [ __ ] it's really crystally it's got like little yeah they're just everywhere huh here's a piece hopefully you guys can see this now this is white the stem is white on this one but that's all the crystals so if you guys can kindan sorry dark anyways but it's pretty [ __ ] good at you my uh it's ridiculous not some of the best i've had but a pretty [ __ ] good tasting and i'm pretty sure this is Earth grow although most earth groans Tim have like darker colors excuse me while I huh stroke while trying to put this cap back on this airtight container oh yeah by the way this container is automatically sealed because it is by a bigger people that make aspirin so keeps smelling very useful especially if you have to spend eighty dollars on that or in my case I got it on sale at petsmart shout at petsmart for 65 bucks but that's for eight months so less than ten bucks a month and I can reuse the case alright well cheers guys oh that first hit morning god damn every [ __ ] time I'm not actually hotboxing this morning so in my car down beautiful park if the other video hasn't come out in this is this will be hot box two instead of three I was here same place for that one but um yeah no one comes down here really and it's just it's down out of the way off the road it was a little dirt road going to it and it's really I love this time of year because all the leaves have fallen off and it just it looks like fall you know with all the like the gray looking like leafless trees it's really cool but um so something weird to happen yesterday oh I went to a gas station yeah I guess okay so this is gonna sound even more suspicious but you know I was like [ __ ] I'll give it a try because where I live it isn't technically illegal for everybody it but uh if any of you guys know what this is it is Oh focus just chill CBD oil and it comes in little piggy by with it even after this is jungle juice flavor but I came I picked it up at a gas station and it says it's CBD oil it says the only ingredients are CBD oil VG which is vegetable glycerin which is used in any bait it's just a thickener into the filler for it to get it to bait and artificial flavoring for the suppose it blueberries raspberries apples pine apples oranges yeah I honestly it doesn't taste me but my mouth might just be and gone to [ __ ] and not be able to pick that up because I smoke so often but um ya know before um there was no one else in there and it was just me and this guy talking and I'm like dude is that actual CBD oil and he was a yam and it is no Mike I've always wanted to try that because you know from the cancer I have an amputation which this last October I just had to have my leg shortened another four and a half inches so I'm basically just almost a year out of out of that and by last October yeah not this previous October but the one before that and so it's just been a year first year when you get a new mutation is just [ __ ] awful but I'm doing good can't complain you know I could be dead or you know I could actually be crippled or something but anyways we were talking I told him you know I got that knee pain even when I smoke it doesn't really take care of it it just kind of how do I say this it doesn't so much take care of it it just makes you ignore it whereas something like tram at all which is an SSRI and reliever that helps me amazingly come on neurontin which is gabapentin for nerve pain so if you got nerve pain that's perfect for that I mean advil we just doesn't do the same thing as those do for me and it never has and it's kind of disappointed me but you know I'm not gonna knock that it has medicinal properties it helps with my it helps so much more with my anxiety than anything they've given me helps more than you know One Bowl of this helps more than xanax or ativan or klonopin clonazepam whatever you want to call it but um so I saw a CBD oil and I was like [ __ ] everybody says that's like supposed to be the [ __ ] well he says he has to leave he has to let you try it and you have to wait like five minutes before you um can really feel it because that'll be heading towards the peak of it at 10 minutes I think so about two minutes you started feeling 10 minutes you should be a peek but um yes it's just it's just a vape pen um didn't taste like anything didn't feel anything in my lungs it felt like 0 mg they blew it which is a vaporizer or e-cig fluid without any nicotine the nicotine for people like me who don't smoke or have like radiated my lungs at radiation so I have sensitive lungs which makes smoking a problem but interesting side story real quick the more i smoke the less i cough once i've smoked one bowl and I've like cough my lungs up and [ __ ] I like stop coughing it's it's the greatest [ __ ] thing ever so after I get after i get baked i can just smoke as much as I want and just not even give a [ __ ] anymore but uh I always feel like an like a little [ __ ] cuz people pass me the blood and i'll hit it and i'll get a big hit but you know I'll choke for like five minutes but then after that if I just you know chill and drink something and cool off my throat I come back and they're like what the [ __ ] but anyways so yeah it didn't taste like anything it was there was no burn there was no feeling to it it was just paper um so I got my bottle water in my beef jerky and I went out and I just sat in the car you know just having a parking lot with the windows down just chilled and five minutes rolls around and I realized my me and my hip weren't hurting and I was like what the [ __ ] it was amazing so I was like okay so I go back in there and I you know we talk about it some more and i buy it it's stupid expensive for the pen just for the one ml of fluid of CBD oil it's 65 bucks so I was like [ __ ] whatever it helped me and um I get home and you know I look it up online it's just chill products and I look at the graph they have of what it contains and by then I'm starting to feel like a little like lightheaded so I'm like what the [ __ ] that's not more you shouldn't feel a CBD I ever and I was like there's something else in here so i will just say right now I'm not allegedly according to me I might just be sensitive or my anxiety might just be so bad that when I smoke CBD oil that it relaxes me enough to the point where it seems like I'm high because it felt very much like an ativan or a clonazepam for me so that might have just been me I wasn't eat and that's the thing about the placebo effect which is the effect where you give someone you know a pill full of sugar and you tell them that it will you know make their hips up her even they're like oh my god it my hip stopped hurting it's amazing it's just a fake effect but I went into it not expecting it to work I went I expected it to be fake I was like all right this is [ __ ] you know regular weed doesn't help so how is this can help but I'll give it a shot you know it was a free try and it helped but yeah I don't know man I I don't think that graph on their website is very accurate I'll just say that right now I personally got what felt like a pretty heavy buzz from two puffs on when I got home and I had my friend my brother's girlfriend come over and had her try it and she did three puffs on it and she said she didn't feel anything at first but then she said she felt kind of lightheaded weird so I I don't know anyways Cheers Oh whoo sorry I'm just trying to take that in [ __ ] this thing well where are you put in my mom no no that's weird I'll find it but um sorry I was looking for my little quartz crystal one-hitter that looks like cigarette I was gonna say well those types of one hairs or small bowls work great for me personally it's a hot and harsh but and I don't really get a good hit but with this style of chillin pipe whatever you want to call it um I haven't had anybody be very disappointed with this has cost me ten bucks and I was like well you know it's okay it worked it's small enough where I can hide it but it's also very it's very thick as you can see it's very thick all the way around and then this part I don't know if you'd be able to see it the bowl is right here above my finger and then it kind of our glasses and then it goes bigger here but all of this around it that little space in our glass is solid glass so I've dropped this a couple times and nothing's happened and it doesn't get hot the end gets hot the ballpark it's hot but has a really deep Bowl um the only downside is did I just [ __ ] like no I do it was my lighter goddamn I am I out of it already downside of this is it gets dirty very easily very quickly once you see isn't it it's great it looks a lot through before you season it which is you know to be expected of smooth glass or any glass in general metal tends to do a better job because the metal will heat up and kind of melt it together so that that takes care of that I didn't really have to season the quartz crystal one because again it's like the metal it heated up and kind of melted all the residue to it so you don't really get that but this was gross um but this thing hits so [ __ ] hard I don't know how and I don't know why I nobody's been disappointed with it that's for sure so I don't know what it is but just enjoy it and i think i [ __ ] up a little bit because i am totally [ __ ] baked off of two hits because i'm an [ __ ] and decided oh yeah well I'm just gonna I'm gonna take this ad D medication focalin this morning and I'm gonna get up and I'm gonna be productive without the buck but and then I'm like oh yeah I can you know smoke bowl while I'm on my vocal in because you know keeps you awake and you get to experience a lot i sorry I was just staring at the cars going by see how I'm [ __ ] out of it but uh if you want an intense experience take a focal in wait an hour smoke oh oh if you have hard issues I wouldn't try it because focalin speeds up your heart rate interesting fact just because I'm full of useless information and love to hear myself talk um focalin is like dimethyl een something well adderall and Ritalin are impediment salts so this is what I found out in my research of it when he prescribed when my doctor prescribed consuming which it helps it is absolute godsend my burden is so [ __ ] up after all the drugs and buy drugs I mean actual drugs that the hospital had me on like all the chemo all the you know the [ __ ] they inject in you all the painkillers I was on I was 16 and 17 and 18 on 80 milligrams of MS contin which is the hawk oxycontin kind of similar thing but it's morphine morphine sulfate cotton and I was on 80 milligrams twice a day and taking eight milligrams of dilaudid every four hours and taking advil and tylenol at regular intervals to deal with the bone bang and yeah I suffered withdrawal from that because I missed once it'd be one single dose of that ms cotton and I thought I was dying we're stomach pain I've ever felt shaking this is it 17 so keep that in mind I'm already bald and you know fighting cancer and sick from that and then all of a sudden I miss a dose and then the next day I'm just like sweaty and vomiting and throwing it vomiting I was [ __ ] myself too I was throwing up so hard that I started throwing up blood because my stomach lining was coming up and anyways that that tripping that ended in a trip to the hospital where they had to inject me with the lot in every two hours for about Oh half a day and then they kept me and pump me full of fluids because I got dehydrated but uh yeah so all that [ __ ] and then they and I had to go on methadone you know [ __ ] thing but oh yeah so all that [ __ ] kind of [ __ ] with my brain because it turns out when you're going through puberty and you give kids chemo and pain medications even though they need it and it helped and it did what it was supposed to do I don't blame him I don't blame the medicine it worked it's just I wish there had been something better so but um it turns out when you're going through puberty in your brains developing fastest when that [ __ ] happens it [ __ ] with you and I was a straight-a student you know I read a lot after chemo I couldn't focus long enough to read a book I couldn't remember stuff in five minutes ago I it literally felt like I had to mention but um focalin I tried strattera vyvanse Ritalin Adderall and none of it worked and then this one guy this one doctor prescribed me I'm focalin and it worked but uh I don't work for everybody but that's just my story but that's why I researched and turns it up focalin reacts with your body like cocaine does while all the other a TD medications made with amphetamine salts are basically just meth and minerals that's it that's all they are it's just methamphetamine and minerals go figure just all you crack is just just a matter how [ __ ] get the salt out of it they catch him up don't [ __ ] do that I might believe that chemically that I'm [ __ ] stoned I still got a bowl you know feel kind of stupid sitting here talking to this not known if anybody's ever gonna even see this but you know what I've kept myself isolated I've kept myself closed off because I was so afraid of what everybody thought and you know what [ __ ] it this is going out there this is this is me I'm putting myself out there and even if nobody sees this it'll be for me so yeah I'm gonna take one more hit and then close it out if you watch this I appreciate it like dislike you know call me a [ __ ] fat ass you know whatever I understand we all have bad days you need event on somebody you know vent on me I it won't bother me seriously so you know if that makes you feel better call me a [ __ ] fat ass or cry baby or call me if I get whatever if that helps you go ahead but uh yeah guys I think this is not so much for an audience as it is for me but you know if it turns into an audience that would be amazing because maybe I could help somebody that's gone through some [ __ ] you know helping one person would be worth it so I'm gonna keep uploading these hot box videos I'm going to get some friends in here we're gonna be you know doing it chatting it up and see where it goes you know I can even use this as an opportunity just to be like hey man would you like to us sit in my car and you know I can play your face out in post but you know just sit here and talk and want real quick I mean I could just make friends like that right I like that yeah that's what I'm gonna do it'll be friends and I know and it'll be new people that I don't know and we'll just uh a great equalizer this we'll use the peace pipe smoking big popped sorry that was racist I apologize Native Americans for that one but uh so unfortunately my phone cuts off at 30 minutes of video and it's a 29 18 so I'm going to hit this one last time Cheers alright guys anyways this has been hot box with mar 6 um like dislike share it if you you know if you liked it and you want your friends to check it out um comment you know like i said if you want to vent i understand we all have bad days [ __ ] call me a fat ass if it makes you

to like best buy or wherever to get it fixed and i just didn't like doing that so i'm recording this on my phone this is an exciting video but before i get into it i'm still doing my ear stretching journey it's just i had a little i had issues with this ear and i had to downsize all the way back to the beginning so 14 gauge that's what this ears at right now and this ears at 10 gauge and it's pretty sure it's healed all the way up it like got swollen and everything so yeah it was a hotness sorry my hair does not look the best i just tried a little puff i just did some eyebrows or whatever um the balloons in the back i just had a birthday so ignore those but we're gonna jump into the video this is gonna be an unboxing video of a brand that i found on instagram um they're called the dart and pretty much it's just like oh they specialize in like the best one hitters and if you don't know what a one hitter is it's when you pack your weed into like a little pipe thing you can maybe like one or two hits off of it so just like you know a little quick fix that's pretty much what one hitters are for or like if you're trying to be discreet and smoke somewhere one hitters are perfect i actually have a one hitter that looks like a cigarette so that actually comes in clutch because i live in a state where you just can't smoke in public because it's illegal so we gotta find ways to be discreet about it so before i keep rambling on because this video is almost four minutes already uh i'm gonna go ahead and start the unboxing so this is the package that it came in and like i said the brand they're called the dart you can follow them on instagram so we're gonna open it up oh this is so cute so this is what it looks like i ordered the um the pink haze set i think that's what it's called and so it comes in like this little black carrying case it's so cute so this is what it looks like the dart it's very nice quality pouch so we're gonna open her up so when you open it up i have not opened this so i don't know what it looks like this is my first time so we're going to open it together so when you first open it oh i can already see it this of course when i open it this is what is in there so in the top they have their little business card and like how to use it so it comes with this set uh this set in particular comes with two one hitters or two pipes whatever you want to call them and so that's what they look like right here this is like the actual like dart so it comes with a pink and a purple one i had to get this set because i'm such a girly girl these are so nice oh yeah okay so it comes with that and then it comes with i mainly got this because it came with a really cute clipper lighter so it comes with this clipper lighter this is like some heavy qualities some heavy duty stuff like this is cute as and it's like heavy this is my new favorite lighter oh yeah this is my new favorite lighter and then it comes with a little container to put your medicine in so you can take it on the go you just grind up your stuff and then you put it in there so that's what this set comes with and it was i think i got it on sale for like 40 bucks but you can buy like you can buy just this individually for like i will um look on the website and put on the screen how much this set was and then how much you can get these for individually so all your stuff just fits in there perfect so like you can just close this up throw it in your purse on the go you don't want to worry about bringing like you know everything with you especially if you're in a state where it's not legal yet so i saw on their instagram pretty much how you use it and stuff which i might insert like a little clip of me using it for the first time i might not you'll see if it's in the video then obviously i did it so i'm going to show you how it's supposed to work so you have your stuff in the container and then you take the one hitter and you like do like this and you twist and it's supposed to pack it doing it like that it packs it into like there and then you just take it light it hit it and to ash it you just push down on that and it pushes it it ashes it for you so this is really cute really convenient i definitely think it's worth the money this is like great quality stuff and this is just a really cute set i definitely recommend getting this little set it's so cute so yeah that was just like a quick little um clip of me using it by more from them to be honest just because they have a bunch of different colors they have a rose gold set that i want so and i'm just extra like that and i think they sell their clipper lighters individually as well so check out the website i will have it linked down below and i hope you guys enjoyed this video i'll talk to you my next one the jeep i'm about to do like a little demo of this because i can't suck my house so once again this is what it looks like i already grinded some up and put it in the little canister people

you for your honey badger cleaned out honey badger dab of the day today is wednesday hello everybody what are some good reasons to go into therapy i want to talk about that because there are so many people that i see out there who are really not getting the therapy getting the help they need there are people in trouble people in mental trouble people in challenging situations people need to talk to people and i think they in most cases people think therapy is really only for very sick people it's not so what i want to talk about is the fact that therapy is much more than just sitting on a couch many many misconceptions are out there about what it means to talk to a mental health professional the need to talk about our emotions is not something to poke fun at or be told that you're weak or be shamed the stigma is a stigma from the past that really is gone so here's the reality about therapy therapy is an incredible tool very useful and it helps with a tremendous range of issues anywhere from anxiety to sleep issues relationships to trauma therapy is incredibly helpful with people managing mental health issues i'm going to try to convince you but i'm going to give you reasons why you should give the practice of therapy a try really it's because i've been so successful with it i have had so much therapy over the years and it's helped me a great deal i know there are tremendous amount of people out there hurting hopefully you'll be able to seek out and get help for yourselves too let's discuss some of the reasons why you might want to go talk to someone are you experiencing unexpected mood swings are you taking on more negativity than usual is it persistent maybe it's worth talking to somebody professional you know unfortunately it's typically a sign that something's wrong and a good therapist can get to the root of the cause you'll have an opportunity to open up about your feelings circumstances in a confidential environment what if you're undergoing a big change in life well you certainly need someone to talk to then this could be a career a family change moving to a new neighborhood a multitude of different things new ventures are challenging and it's normal to seek assistance with that think about it you can work with someone with a neutral perspective to identify goals help you peel back the situation and develop a plan to achieve them therapy often involves the development of skills and strategies that you may not have had you see today with tele telemedicine you can sit on your iphone and have a video chat with a therapist and work through many of your issues god forbid you're having harmful thoughts call 9-1-1 if you are they're completely preventable situations self-harm you need to be in front of a licensed professional please call a hotline if you have an issue like that what have you withdrawn from things what if you've withdrawn from things that used to bring you joy what if there's a loss of motivation you know what that's a signal if you were a social butterfly and suddenly you're pulling away from everything you could be experiencing something deeper a professional therapist is trained to help you uncover what might be occurring the truth is therapy can be very helpful for many people and often it helps individuals sustain positive good mental health what if you're feeling isolated or alone many people deal with this with loneliness with isolation especially now well guess what you're not alone and when you enter therapy you get an immediate sense of relief that you're not alone that problem is extremely well understood and shared by others and can bring a sense of true comfort and hope to both people involved if you have a severe substance abuse problem you need to talk to somebody professional think about it if you find yourself god forbid an alcohol situation or a hard drug situation please there are tremendous breakthroughs in giving care to people suffering from these problems don't sit by the wayside and think there's no help out there for you you can be helped what if you think you have a serious mental condition i've gone through life many times thinking that well guess what you're not alone if you've been feeling off for a long time reach out whether you have an inkling that you're bipolar whether you think you have something else now is the time don't ignore the situation these things are treatable don't let it get out of hand so you become an uncomfortable person in your own skin what if you feel like you've lost control that's a common feeling with people either in substance abuse situations unemployment situations that lack of control keeps people in a circle they call it the circle the cycle of addiction and unfortunately it's not just addiction to to drugs or to alcohol is addiction to bad behaviors so please if you've lost control poke your head up and let's talk to someone what if your relationships feel strained well you know what relationships no matter what type are very hard work we're not expected to have all the answers so if you're with a partner therapy can help both of you have better ways to communicate couples therapy you see even if one partner is hesitant it's still an important thing to think about because a therapist a good therapist can help you pinpoint how to help your partner interpret a misunderstanding think about it what if you've been going through life and everything you've been saying has been twisted just a little bit to left by your partner maybe you can have somebody help that impression be straightened the key thing for everybody to remember here is that therapy is good don't fear it there's no stigma anymore what if you don't sleep right go to the therapist what if you just need to talk to somebody find a therapist and i am not an advertising agent for therapists but therapy is perfectly normal and valuable you know why because it's an experiential thing and it really works there's proof that therapy works well if you enjoy today's discussion about therapy please subscribe to my channel send me your comments i reply to every one of them thanks for watching the real senior stoner here we go with a fingertip dab cheers everybody [Music] wow wow that was a lung buster dab is what that was hope you enjoyed today's session talking about sessions this is a

day or so it's ago inaugural smoke in it i'm smoking some cnd founding fathers um i thought about thought about doing about reading sherlock holmes and then i realized one chapter take nearly 30 minutes to read and that's that's an awful long video for someone to sit listen to somebody else read um i know i would probably be bored and i i tend to do videos that that i would want to try that i would want to watch really i wouldn't want to set for 27 minutes and watch somebody else read unless you know if i have to be in the mood for it but i posted a video yesterday is near it's close to 23 minutes i believe so today we're just gonna return to old faithful at ground po and uh we'll just flip through and read different things i'll try to keep it close probably to 15 minutes or so let's

he did till his eyes were sore or rather laugh with him that queer philosopher democritus of thrace who used to toss over the page of life and grin at the dog ears as though he'd say why who the devil

lay it on the table and take the matter up when i'm more able and in the meantime to prevent all bother i'll neither laugh with one nor cry with other an ordeal in flat tree or aspersions foul but taking one by each hand merely growl thing keeps going out on me the wind's blowing today ah growl say you my friend and pray at what why really sir i had almost had forgotten but damn it sir i deem it a disgrace that thing should stare us boldly in the face and daily strut the street with bows and scrapes who would be men by imitating apes i beg your pardon reader for the oath the monkeys make

cursing and i hope you forgive me for that let's uh here we go i'll have to relax this thing again i'm gonna have to figure out a different way to pack a pipe because apparently my way is not cutting there we go let's read this one it's called dreams oh that my young life were a lasting dream my spirit not awakening till the beam of an eternity should bring tomorrow yes though that long dream were of hopeless sorrow for better than the cold reality of waking life to him whose heart must be and hath been still upon the lovely earth a chaos of deep passion from his birth but should it be that dream eternally continuing as dreams have been to me in my young boyhood should it thus be given to her folly still to hope for higher heaven for i have reveled when the sun was bright in this in the summer sky and dreams of living light and loveliness have left my very heart and climbs with my imagining apart from my own home with beings that have been of mine own thought what more could i have seen it was once and only once and the wild hour from my remembrance shall not pass some power or spell had bound me towards the chilly wind came more me in the night than left behind shown in my slumbers in her lofty noon to coldly or the stars however it was that dream was as that night wind let it pass i have been happy though but in a dream i've been happy and i love the theme dreams in their vivid coloring of life as in that fleeting shadowy misty strife of semblance with reality which brings to the delirious eye more lovely things of paradise and love and all our own then young hope in his sunniest hour hath known edgar allen poe i've noticed i guess i don't need to say his whole name mr poe seems to me was a very a very dark he he explored the dark reality of things according to his according to his poetry i don't know if that's just the way i see it or if it's he was just writing about his experience he had a very descriptive way of explaining things i noticed very descriptive you want to know what i like about poetry i like the rhymes the philosophy i could take it or leave it but the rhymes is where it's at for me just seeing how these people came up with such such rhyming words i guess i don't know how you would say that been looking into getting me a robert frost robert frost book uh my ex-fiance had robert frost's book and um yeah i liked it sean's in my me and my leather hat got a very safari look today don't i anyway uh yeah i'm kind of awkward i don't know i guess i'll just get used to that over time get used to being on camera but anyway i'll uh i'll be back next week with another video hopefully showing off my new pipes after they've been cleaned i have decided that that hilson pipe that i that was really badly burned out if you watch my one of my earlier videos i talked about it i shut it off it's just going to be a it's it's going to be a shelf it's going to be a wall hanger i'm going to leave it alone because you know if the mirror shone's going out of it it's going to be fairly expensive to get a new to have them refurbish it and i have it refurbished or get a new mirror strong insert or whatever i need to do it's going to be fairly expensive to do that and i ain't got that kind of puns know what i mean so it's just going to be a wall hanger or a shelf piece rather sun is bright holy cow all right well i'm gonna get off here and i'm gonna enjoy the rest of this pipe and then i'm gonna i don't know i'll see you guys on the next video", "b0BIm9RIMkQ": "hi and welcome to my second video on medical marijuana accessories now as I mentioned in the last review the one on the elder Mays Wow I recently quit smoking tobacco hence the vape sitting here and that was a bit of a problem for me because I used to like to sit back in the evening relaxed have a joint in the beer and just chill out and smoke joints so no tobacco hmm slight problem so I've already started looking at some electronic vaporizers however they have to be recharged they're bigger than everything else so I thought I'd take a look at some classic old-school pipes now I've owned all of these types of pipes myself over the years I haven't been using pipes for quite a while but I think I'm going to get back into it now so I went hunting and looked for combination of factors of good quality and low price now obviously I don't know what the quality is going to be like on these I haven't opened them yet but all the reviews and that that I could find and judging by the pictures and everything else they looked pretty decent now all of these pipes can be bought for much much higher price I paid between seven and eight euros for these two that we're looking at we're gonna look at in the moment now the other criteria I looked at because there's so many different types of plates was I wanted to break it down and do this video on small discreet plates now these are the sort of thing that you can put in your pocket to go to the park those will walk at the countryside go to a festival or friend's house whatever these are small pocket pipes we're not talking big bonds or anything else like that here so I wanted something that was fairly discrete convenient and each of these has their advantages and disadvantages so let's open up the first packet and see what I got Jesus tough blue okay this is what we used to call the I've got some papers in there some screens in there as well it was a free gift these are what we use to call a sneak attack I've also heard them called back pipes and various other things now what makes these kind of different from what they look like is here you have your chamber where you put your herb or your hash in what makes these cool Detroit as well as figuratively is this when you take a drag on it the smoke because this spiral fits in quite quite nicely and tightly and that's actually pretty decent machining it does fit quite nicely the smoke has to go up through this spiral and that works really well let's get this out the way so that camera focuses on me and on that okay so that really helps to cool it down you're it's fairly short you got a flame in this end so you need something to cool the smoke down and that's what this spiral is for it's a little bit like the theory behind I don't know if you've ever seen the silver leaf silver palm leaf types they were popular about 20 years ago they were a flat one and they had uh sort of the zigzag pattern going up through it so anyway the great thing about this is you can load it up preload it stick it in your pocket and maybe you're sitting there waiting for the bus or a train or something you can just get out here later and have a quick hit off of it you know you're not gonna see very much it's all you really need to have out that and a little bit the end most people just think you were lighting a cigarette so nice and portable it's got a little lanyard hole in here if you want to put something in and hang it around your neck as well which is quite a nice touch quality on this does seem pretty darn good actually I'm quite impressed the finish is good I'm not sure if this is stainless steel or if it's chrome prick plated brass it's got a nice weight to it but everything goes together very nicely as you can see this there's hardly any visible seam there when it's threaded together the top pretty pretty nice smooth thick so these are also nice and easy to clean out because you can get everything apart and even this part unscrews here so that you can run a pipe cleaner or something right through there so all in all I'm very pleased and impressed with my first purchase this was seven years fifty-five I mean basically a euro dollar pound it they're close enough at the moment that it doesn't make any difference now I have seen these for sale from American or European companies and I've seen them going for up to 60 70 euros and I think that is grossly overpriced especially with modern machine tools so anyway that was choice number one choice number two I used to have one of these I originally got one back in about 1979 1980 and I'm asked to keep it for over 20 years until I either had it nicked or left it at a party I don't know if someone nabbed it or I just had a bit too much to drink or smoke and forgot about again got a pack of screens now I'm really curious to see this I really missed mine and there we go this is the famous prototype and this was developed back in the 60s and it's got some really cool features on it it's a little bit more complicated looking than most pipes that you'll see now this one was 850 the original prototype can still be purchased the the guy who used to make them went out of business he sold the business they were made for a while then fold it then now someone else is making them they have a pee-pee on the cover be careful there are fakes you can get ones very similar to this that have got the peepee stamped in it and there they're not the original ones the original ones are about 80 90 yeah about 80 $80 80 years and this one was 850 and it's almost identical now the way these things work if you haven't ever seen one of these before you've got your bowl up here now they they say and they say oh it's got a permanent filter in it now you want to put some filter mesh in there otherwise you're gonna have a real nightmare keeping it clean and everything now long you've got your nice little cap you can put over stops you getting ash in your pocket also means you can immediately shut off the smoke then stick it in your pocket if someone's coming along now the other thing that's pretty obvious is you've got this big tube in the middle and this is what's really cool about now this is a bit fiddly Innis done this in years okay you pull this little thing out this is actually a cleaning and disassembly tool now I'll just put that down here for now now this just unlocks and this is your stash stash box so you can put some hash weed whatever you want in there and take it with you and the rest of it is just a plain pipe with one more trick now one thing if you do buy one and don't use the links that I'll provide below make sure that it has this cut in it okay you see that diagonal cut here okay the other ones have got a thread on them and they are useless the way this is designed is it all holds itself together it's integrated unit if you get the ones the way it screws on what happens is they just unscrews in your pocket and the whole lock just falls apart and you lose it now with this you lock that in place then you put this in and this spring here that you see there locks onto that and then the whole thing is now this can't come out because of the spring tension and this can't rotate because of the cleaning tool so cool one last thing I'll one thing I'll mention one problem with these is you tend to lose these tips yeah now you can't actually buy them provided the the ones for the original types will fit however what you want to do is get a small piece of plastic tubing like fishtank tubing or silicon tubing and just stick that over there I mean you can get a foot of it 30 centimeters of it for a bit you know 20 cents or something 20 pounds so it's enough to make loads of these in case you lose it now one problem people have with these you don't if they didn't know what they were doing and is that they complain that they clog up and they're useless well that's because they didn't read the instructions now this cleaning tool what you do with it is you put it through there and then you tap yeah and you tap it against the table and this comes out and this is a resin trap and it gets all the tar and everything in here which makes it easier to clean and to put it back together again you line up the two dots you have to have it lined up because they're I don't know if you can see it that right there is where the tube that you're drawing food comes in and it needs to connect with that hole in here so you have to line up the dots and this one's this one's really good and it just pops back into place like that there's a little rubber gasket around or silicon overing around here that holds it into place and that is very very nice it's much nicer than I expected and pop that off again see what's inside there okay I don't know whether this is an Lea I think this is actually solid brass it looks like it alright I have got a nail here I didn't want to do this on the top where it was visible so I just must scratch in here okay as far as I can tell this actually is this actually is brass I was wondering if it was possibly just plated bra sort of some kind of alloy with some brass plating on it but it does actually appear and feel by the weight as if it's genuinely solid brass so all in all I would rate that as a very good bike it's exactly the same as my old prototype when I but over 20 years with it so I head over 20 years experience with my old pro fighter so excellent excellent little pipe I'm very pleased with it it's solidly made it's exactly identical to my my old one so excellent now last of all over here last of all this one's mine I didn't buy it just now I've had this for quite a long time and this is your classic spoon pipe this one's particularly nice when it's made of Murano glass and I bought it to sort of kill the pain of my losing my prototype and it's a absolutely work of art now glass pipes have got quite a following some people say that they have a cleaner taste I can't tell any difference between them but one thing about glass pipes is that they you can get them anywhere from just a few euros cheapo one or you can get absolute works of art like this or even more elaborate than this so which you don't get with with metal pipes now the advantage to this is it feels very nice in the hand it's got a bigger bowl than the others you've got your carburetor on the side the way that work is you inhale light it and when it's going well and you're just about to finish taking your hit you take your thumb off and all the smoke that's inside the pipe comes out in one one go so the these this isn't something I'd really carry around for one thing this was really really expensive bought it in Venice and it cost a lot of money and glass pipes are kind of fragile which is why I concentrated mainly on this section on on this type of pipe here so anyway you've got your session pipe for the taking to a festival or something at your friend's house keeps your stash from getting nicked by somebody if you leave it on the table you've got this for for a really sneaky quick toke and then you've got this for something with a little more class and style okay I have field tested all of these and very good results this little guy did a sterling job and it's it gets pretty toasty up to about here it's not something you'd want to pass around but then here in because of the capacity you're not gonna be passing it around and the smoke was cooler than I expected or remembered from my old one so very nice and the finish held up nicely could polish with probably a bit of alcohol to take that off and no problem the prototype prototype did a very nice job as well very nice cool smoke for the size of the pipe and I did do some testing back at the house and scratched into some bits that you can't see quite deeply with a with a knife point and it does appear to be solid brass it looks a bit gaudy and goldy but I think that's just because it's been brightly polished and then it's been coated with lacquer which will eventually wear off or you could probably remove it yourself at which point it will take up the sort of patina and more natural brass color than this and the glass pipe of course it had the coolest smoke I'd rate these as both four out of five and that is five out of five but then again you've got a much bigger area the whole inside of this pipe is in contact with the smoked glass is a good conductor so it draws the the heat out very nicely and that's going to give you a cool smoke however they are fragile if you get a nice one like this they are expensive so it's not really something you want to carry around and take to many places this is more of a stay-at-home pipe so if you want a convenient pipe for taking out I'd really recommend these two I'll post some links at the end of the description on where to get them and get very pleased with them so until next video happy smoking and good luck", "-eFAeHuGaG4": "There are a number of ways of making glass tubing without glassblowing. This is one. A gather of glass has been made \non the end of a metal rod. The edge is being pincered, and at a certain point, the pincered edge is pulled outward, and this begins to draw glass tubing from the reservoir at the end of the metal rod. If it\u2019s pulled quickly, the diameter is small; if it\u2019s pulled slowly, the diameter is greater. When the glass is stiff, the ends are cut. After the tube has cooled, one end is heated in a flame. As the glass softens and becomes less viscous, surface tension causes the edge to round, and eventually the hole closes. When the end has closed, air is blown in the other end and the bulge forms. In at least one example, the heating was stopped too soon, and a tiny hole was left. Here, the hole is almost closed, but not quite. Blowing begins. There\u2019s enough pressure to inflate the glass, but a tiny hole remains on the end.", "JOrVFYxJi9o": "okay my my 420 and looks as you guys can see my girlfriend named Kiki you'll beautiful dog my

"-Hljg_4ZfzQ": "I mmm you", "i1QsZMslnUo": "[Music] so I'm a glass blower originally you know now I design a lot more things but this was the first silicon was the first time that somebody came to me and said yeah you needed to design something that's not glass it's flexible and you know nothing about myself go there was a lot of time there was a lot of silicon pipes coming in on the market and like something about smoking out of a bong that was silicon with like a little glass bowls didn't feel right but using silicon for its strengths instead of its cost-effective nature it's kind of what we we started to talk about like how do you use silicon with glass we specialize in glass we do glass really well how do we use silicon in a way that balances with that and a way to like protect glass using it like your phone for your phone case you know if you drop your phone just right no case is gonna protect it that nine times out of ten it's gonna do the job so we were decided that we needed to start designing thinking about silicon in that way that still allowed you to use the glass and experience the glass in the same way but protected it first thing we have this glass blunt and we changed the grommet we used to have these little weird little shrink tube kind of things on there so we made a silicone grommet for our blunt and we kind of use this little detail this little aesthetic recess here as kind of a in a design element that kind of transitioned from from one design to the next that kind of transition to tasters and a way to protect your little taste or you little hitter cap it off so you can put it in your pocket anything that's in the bowl doesn't fall out into your pocket the way to load it load it up and take it with you before you leave the house in a way to smoke it without the flame actually hitting the silicone that was really important to us was making sure that the silicone was out of the way you work in a smoke of silicone you should look in your glass and you're smoking your product then we moved on to a couple other pipes we decided to see what we could adapt that to so we we looked at our steam roller as an obvious candidate because it's just a straight piece of tubing which is a easy way to kind of reverse engineer a piece of silicone to to go over that but also in a way that will protect it you know as much as possible it's just like your phone you dropped it if you drop that on the corner of a table and hits that screen might pop but nine times out of 10 it's hit the back is hit the sides and you're protected and then we also took our little rocker here we made a really slick little cover for it but also you know another chance to protect protect the piece give a little bit of relief also you know make sure that just the glass is exposed and that you're smoking the glass instead of the silicone you know the challenges of learning a whole new material we're at the beginning we're overwhelming but slowly but surely we learned more and more and more we did a lot of prototyping a lot of taking the pipes and working with clay around those and trying to get the best feel for a you know a lot of on-site prototyping because we're so insecure about the silicone we really wanted to make things we could hold on to before we sent them out to be made out of silicone and in the you know and now feel like I know my way around it a little bit I'm not quite as terrified of it it's still I'm still not as comfortable as I am with glass but but um we did really well I think that's the beautiful part of glasses there's nothing quite like smoking out of a piece of glass but there's nothing quite like that feeling when you hear that sound when you drop your piece and you know it you know it just broke so when we when we first got these samples back we just took them out in the parking lot and just start throw him around it was it was actually pretty fun to realize like oh we maybe our job security is just going out the window if we don't for now we're making glass pipes that don't break maybe that's not a good thing because they worked really well so yeah this is another one that anybody that's ever have broken a lot of pipes and you clumsy mofos out there this is for you you", "WL3lq7Ohj-k": "[Music] hey again this is callum from turmoil's chester and i'm carrying on taste testing the new tobaccos from chicom um this is the number six and if you saw my videos on number five i explained the sort of background of these how they released the range of four last year which i thought i videoed but hadn't so keep an eye out for actual video reviews of the original range coming soon as i mentioned the original range is quite nice and balanced with a mix of traditional aromatics and cased aromatics so the two new ones number five was a traditional english style so this one balances out by being a cased aromatic one thing i really appreciated about this range really have appreciated is when they've done cased aromatics they've chosen to go a little bit different especially for new brand this is really interesting because rather than just going for more sort of common uh flavors like cherry they've decided to go for things like one of them had vanilla bourbon in it another one had yellow plum as a flavoring which just aren't quite as frequently used as a lot of other ones so i always appreciate that in the tobacco they carried this on nicely with the number six going for a casing of rum which compared to things like highland whiskey much less common you do say occasionally but not that often uh espresso specifically espresso which i like the detail um and caramel which is cool like um coffee always surprises me that it's not more common as a flavoring considering like tobacco and coffee are just such an amazingly natural combination even just like basic cigarettes go amazingly with coffee uh right up to like the nicest havana cigars so it baffles me you don't see coffee flavor more often this one really piqued my interest as well because one of my favorite aromatic blends generally is coffee caramel again partly because it's less common but that's an american style blend from gareth hoggarth now known as cc and it's just incredible so i had high hopes for this one and actually having it it did surprise me slightly uh the coffee and sorry the espresso and the caramel is very very subtle especially in aroma it's really the rum that hits you the hardest when you open it and smell it and it's a very distinctive dark sweet rum which works really nice in tandem with coffee caramel and when you smoke it the caramel comes forward a lot more as well but you do get this very like potent taste of sweet rum with the coffee with the caramel it almost reminds me of um like rum and raisin fudge it's got that kind of carrots going on which is amazing and yeah i know i've said it already just the fact is very distinctively rum is cool because sometimes i've seen with a few where it's just like a generally kind of boozy taste but this is very distinctively wrong um it's also surprised me a little bit with some of the other flavors that i don't know it's just the combination of the casing seems to bring out some interesting character like i got a little hint of something a bit floral on one puff which i wasn't expecting and then there is just this nice general sort of like sugary sweetness as well which has somebody with a massive sweet tooth guys that's really appreciated um i've just realized i haven't actually told you about the tobacco itself so try and get that on camera properly so it's quite an interesting mix there's different cuts different thicknesses and it's a mixture of virginia's black cavendish and some burly just to enhance the casing we've got the tease because he basically just works as a big sponge for aromatics so it's always a good base for flavoring tobacco um as you probably tell by my slightly over excited rambling on this one i'm really enjoying it as i said on my previous video i am so impressed with to come in general how they've just taken to uh making pipe tobacco with incredible ease and it seems very very natural for them and i'm hoping to see more from them in the future because i think they'll continue to do themselves justice so if my rambling has uh got you intrigued on this i definitely recommend trying it and if you'd like to do so it's available as always at turbos.com if you do try it hope you like it don't forget to let us know what you think as always if you enjoyed this video don't forget to like share and subscribe for more in future until next time thanks for watching and i'll see you soon [Music] cheers you", "MoLm6x5M6EQ": "I mmm you", "-NbJaVySjR4": "Hello, Internet User! My name is Gary of\n\"Gary's Wares\" & I make wooden pipes out of exotic hardwoods & today I'm going to be going over the basics of pipe making. Some of you people on YouTube are not\ndoing the right thing. Like, some of you people are not just making bad pipes,\nyou're making pipes that are, like, toxic and, like, that have glue in the bowl. You\ndon't do that. You don't do that. There's things you do, things you don't do. I'm going to be going over that. The physics of pipes and that sort of thing aaaaaaand here we go. This is a pipe. Well, this is a picture of a pipe. As you can see and here's the bowl here's\nmaterial the flame and the the air passage. The way that it works quite\nobviously is you inhale, that draws the flame into the material, the material combusts, then you inhale the smoke. This is a Chilum and you'll see that you see the\nonly difference is there's a bend in a pipe and there's not one in the Chillum.\nThat's the only difference. Now, when you make your bowl you want the hole to be\nconcave or convex depending on how you look at it. And to do that, you're going\nto need to drill with a Core Box Bit and you don't want to use, like,\na Forstner bit because that stuff gets caught this side this is not the way\nthat you want to do a pipe it's wasteful prove it\nI have put together this I made a series of half inch holes one with a regular\nbit one with a brad point bit low to the Forstner bit one of the spade bit and\none with the core box but I'm gonna load each of these holes up with tobacco and\nrun it through my shop vac and see what I come up with ah here are the holes and you can see that\na lot of material was left behind by the first three which were regular bit Brad\npoint bit and a Forstner bit that's because they each have a ledge the spade\nbit didn't have much left behind but it's not a very good design for a pipe\nfor a number of reasons and I think a lot of the reason that there's not much\nleft is because I had a shot back attached to it here's the core box bit\nand there's nothing left but ash it all fell out on the table so this is the\nbest choice clearly the type of wood that you use is\nvery important because some woods have chemicals in them that when heated get\nreleased like zebrawood one time I tried to make a pipe out of zebra wood that\nwas a mistake one time I tried to make a out of orange agate that was a bigger\nmistake so there's some ones that you can use the sub was that you can't\ntobacco pipes the most popular wood to use is briar but the thing with Breyer\nis that briar blanks cost about 20 bucks of blank so I use point B D org which\nisn't necessarily an authority on the subject but these guys clearly know more\nand have thought about pipe making more than I have um they put together an\nalternative list for woods as opposed to using Pryor since it's so expensive\num this is a pretty good list there's a lot of good domestic choices maple\ncherry walnut oak you know things like that things that you could find pretty\neasily but by far the most popular choice is cherry cherry is very good\nit's got a lot of good qualities it's not as good as briar but it's not nearly\nas expensive here are some ebony pipes that I made\nthis one's an unfinished pipe this one's a Chilam with some hemp wick wrapped\naround it so you can use different stuff and it won't make you sick like zebra\nwood or orange agate wood this is a briar pipe that I bought and briar is\nvery good but you can abuse it I smoked too much too fast and it got too hot and\nit burned out which is a which is one of the concerns when picking your wood you\ndon't want to pick up what that's going to burn out or make you sick\nwell first make you second you don't want this going to burn out\nvery quickly and so even with briar it could burn out if you abuse it this pipe\nis mine I've been using it for about six months and it started off looking about\nlike this but over time over about six months of daily use it's kind of\ncorroded on the inside and it's not much of a bowl and if it wasn't for a screen\nit wouldn't be working at all so I'm going to have to replace it eventually\nbut choosing your wood is very important next I'm going to show you how to make a\npill bottle pipe out of some cherry and final products going to look like this\nand you want to start off with a blank that is 2 or 1 by 1 by 2 and so I\nstarted off with a blank that was 2 by 2 by 6 and cut it down to size from there\nnow the problem with with wieck's is that they're not they don't come square\nnecessarily and if you think they're square you better check because they\nprobably aren't this one it was way off as you can see and so as such the blanks\nare going to have to be shaped before I could drop them and start work on them\nand this is going to come in handy later you absolutely have to square them I\npick the outside edge and I'm going to count that as straight and I'm going to\nuse that to square this side and I'm going to use the same edge to square the\nother side as opposed to using this side square could be a real pain sometimes\nanyway so I'm going to square these two come back the bikes have been squared\nand I have marked them and what I did is I measured each side and I drew halfway\npoint and connected that then I took my stencil and I marked a inch and I use\nthe lines to find to mark the center now what I'm going to do is I'm going to\ndrill a hole right where they intersect with my Brad point bit and that's going\nto be the pilot hole for the bowl the bottles have been drilled at this\npoint the bowl location is pretty well locked in so if you didn't nail you're\ngonna have to go back and start over next I'm going to drill the bowl with\nthis bit and this is its eye tech technically it's not a core box bit\nbecause this is the core box bit core box but just makes a concave hole but it\ndoesn't have a thing on the bottom this has the thing on the bottom and I don't\nknow what to call this thing but this thing is very handy for beginning\npipemakers because it gives you a start on the air passage and it gives you\nsomething to shoot for it's pretty wide as far as echoes and that will certainly\nhelp you out later that weren't there it would be a little trickier but I'll get\ninto doing that later next I'm going to drill the bowl the ball has been drilled now it's time\nto drill the air passage and this is where you're squaring really matters\nbecause the drill press the drill bit just comes straight down at a 90 degree\nangle so if your blank is a bit off one way or the other it's still going to go\nstraight down and you're going to end up missing it even if it's all just a\nlittle that's going to make a difference so the way that I determine the depth is\nI take it all and I stick it into the ball as deep as it'll go just like that\nwithout you know actually making a new hole and then I use my figures and\ndetermine the depth like that now this seems like a crude method of doing this\nbut I've yet to miss doing it this way knock on wood so you're going to want to\nstart with a brad point bit but you're going to want to finish with a regular\nbit because a regular bit has a more forgiving tip it's not as sort of\ndestructive and you're going to want that when you get down to here because\nit well you have to drill to a very specific depth that if you go much\nfarther than that you can screw the pipe up so here we go ear passages have been drilled ad as you\ncan hear it's clear so this point it is a pipe but it's not very pretty look so\nnext comes a bit more drafting what I did is I drew a circle around the air\npassage hole and I drew a line marking the edge of that stem and also what I\ndid is I put a mark marking the edge of the bowl and on this side I drew a line\nconnecting these two and this is going to be cut off with my scroll saw after\nthat I'm going to take my oscillating spindle sander to it and I will go shave\nit here are the pipes at various stages of\nshaping first thing you want to do is cut the excess off like we were talking\nabout then you want to shape it down and get the get a nice curve going on the\ntop then draw lines that will show you how thick the stem is then you cut this\nexcess away and you're left with this from there you shape around the lines\ntry to get as close as you can you'll get something like this then you go to\nthe the circle de jure around the air passage and shape that and that will\ngive you a basic diameter for the stem and you can continue on shaping it\nproperly like that and at at this point and you want to kind of make it look a\nlittle better and make it look a bit more like a pipe now the thing that\nmakes these pill bottle pipes is that they can fit inside of pill bottles this\nis a little snug but we still got some sanding to go and that's okay because\nyou can always take more away but you can't add more so this is basically how\nyou do it and now it needs is final sanding and submission this particular\npipe is ready to go I still have these two left to shape and now we're\nsomething slightly different next I'm going to show you how to make one of\nthese what I call a minicar pipe before I do let me go quickly over the physics\nof carb pipes now this is my my pipe which is a chambered pipe and I've had\nit for a while like I said before and the way that it is internally is\nlike this and you'll see that with with all chambered pipes they have basically\nthe same three components you have a bowl a chamber and a stem and of course\nan air passage leading between all of these this is how all carburetor part\npipes work here's my glass pipe and you can see that all of the components are\nbasically there you've got the bowl right here you've got the chamber which\nis the whole hollow part of the inside of the pipe and you've got the stem\nwhich is part of the chamber which is a really elegant sort of solution to how\nto do this sort of design and the carb which I haven't mentioned yet now the\nway that the carb works is what happens is sort of stage one is you put your\nfinger over the carb and that means that all air flow comes through the bowl and\nwhat happens is when you inhale the chamber fills up with smoke and it kind\nof cools it and collects it and Stage two is sort of you taking your finger\noff the carb and then that all that smoke comes at once through the stem\nwhat I'm making is one of these and I like I said I call it a mini carb pipe\nand it's going to be about three inches long so it's gonna be about an inch\nlonger than the pipe we made before and this internally is how it works you know\nyou've got the bowl here and you've got the chamber here and the stem over here\nthe carb will be drilled later it's not very it doesn't matter that much where\nit goes just so long as it goes towards this side of it so that it clears it it\neffectively clears it better so go so the first step is milling in square now\nbefore when I was talking about wood selection I was specifically talking\nabout the bowl that you use stem can be anything tobacco pipes use like some\nkind of acrylic rubber stuff it doesn't really matter about the stem what\nmatters is where all the heat happens and so therefore the bulb matters and\nthat matter a whole lot with our last pipe because it's all one piece\nlike so the stem is going for this one it's going to be made of black and white\nevany so after you mill it and square it and I've gone over how important all\nthat is drafting a draw an inch wide circle on the bowl and then then draw an\ninch wide circle on this and then a 3/4 hole for the Forster bit which we're\ngoing to drill later and an inch wide is circle on the other side and off we go\nthe bow holes have been drilled as I showed you before without a make the\npill bottle pipe you start with the pilot hole and then you drill with that\nbit and then you drill the air passage like that next comes the UM chamber now\nas shown here I'm going to drill down to one 3/8 inch with a Forstner bit and\nthat's going to give me a big wide chamber in here and so that is the next\nstep the chamber hole has been drilled and this is where drafting carefully\nreally pays off when you bring your Forster bit down just bring it down just\na little bit just to make sure that you're lining up with the line that you\nalready drew if you're not repositioned your piece and directly because if you\ndon't you could drill through the side that's no fun\nI've also drilled the air passage hole next I'm going to shape the stem slash\nchamber and I'm going to do it on my oscillating spindle sander and I would\ndo it using this bit of what do you call one of these things we hang up clothes\nour clothes hanger there you go at what you do what I'm going to do is I'm going\nto put this up to like the sanding belt and it's going to be able I'm going to\nshape according to that circle and that circle and it's going to come out round here's the chamber after it's been\nshaped and now it's ready to be glued now if you're going to make a pipe that\nis going to use glue in some way you want to make sure that it is as far away\nfrom where the heat takes place as possibly as you can get it would act\nreacts in a very predictable way when exposed to heat glue on the other hand\nmay not who knows what sort of toxic nonsense it would release and you don't\nwant to be smoking that so you want to keep wood well away from the bowl I you\nknow and I saw a YouTube video of this guy who wanted to make a pipe by cutting\nit right in half and then gluing it back together don't do that keep glue away\nfrom from the heat as far as possible this is good enough that that works just\nfine so I'm going to glue this part on and clamp it and come back what it's\ndone the glue is dried and now it's ready to be shaped and now what I'm\ngoing to do is I'm going to shape this corner in this corner on the edging\nattachment of the oscillating spindle sander but I'm going to use the actual\nspent oscillating spindle sander to shape the mouthpiece and this line is\n3/8 of an inch and the inside this should come to I don't know somewhere in\nhere there something like that I don't know but this is plenty of room it won't\ncut into the the chamber and mess up the fight because I would mess it up and\nthere would be no good um yeah so I'm going to go shape that here's something fun um the sharp-eyed\nout there might notice the problem right away\nI made the mouthpiece on the wrong side the mouthpiece is meant to go like this\nso this is actually something I can recover from pretty easily I'm going to\ntake it back the oscillating sander it's sort of round this up man this is what\nhappens when you don't pay attention it may come out even looking cooler but you\ndon't do that could have been worse so I'm gonna go take care of that Edie\nQuebec alright now that I've somewhat recovered\nfrom that and it's not too bad and it kind of looks cool with the the grain\nand everything so that didn't turn out to be too bad I've got some lines to\nhelp me shape it and this is a 3/4 inch line or around a circle around the bowl\nthat's going to help me shape it and next I'm going to go to work on it with\na rotary tool so I've shaped the pipe with the rotary\ntool and I've taken them all the way to fine grit and now I'm going to take put\nsome actual actually sand it by hand I've drilled the the carb up here and\nand that's about the right place you want to do it and so now I'll come back\nwith it's edited finished and Aran is finished sanded and ready to go you see\nit's about an inch longer than the pipe that we made before now one of the\nthings about these two pipes is that these projects are specific to this bit\nor this bit is specific to this project depending on where you won't look at it\nnow this is a part of the dremel 692 six piece router set and I highly recommend\npicking that up considering the price and apparently the core box bit is part\n617 so that is that you definitely need to make these with and the thing about\nthis bit that makes some that makes it so much easier is this little part right\nhere now this is meant to go on the edge of something and not meant to cut\nanything at all and it's meant to be like a sort of a buffer between\nand what you want to cut what you don't want to cut but when you're making a\npipe almost fun on the hole when you're making a pipe this little part right\nhere is very handy for drilling the air passage and hitting it and nailing it\nwhen you're making a tobacco pipe that's somewhat more difficult which is what\nI'm going to show you next and it's the last thing the both tobacco pipe is much\na much wider and is capable holding a lot more than the other pipes that I\nmade and so it you should be able to get to you should be able to get your finger\nin there I use a 5/8 inch cord box but to do it this I think is about 7/8 or\nmaybe about an inch I think it's a bit less than an inch so it's probably not\n7/8 and the reason for this is tobacco pipes work a bit differently than other\npipes because they what happens in its backhoe pipe is that the tobacco\nsmoulders and so it smolders it basically it's like a little hot coal\nthat the tobacco bowl has to handle and so it's constant heat and that's why\nbriar is such a good choice cherry is also a good choice but the so that's why\nbowl the thickness of your bowl wall matters with my pipe I should have this\nthis is on my on the real pipe it's like just less than an inch and I should have\nmade the ball about an inch in it and a half maybe an inch in a corner too\nconsidering how much I use it and considering how much heat it has to take\nbecause when you subject it to large amounts of heat this part right in here\ntakes a lot of abuse and it sort of becomes a funnel which is not exactly\nthe best it's not exactly the best so you want to start off with a thick Bowl\nwall so here we go so I've this piece of cherry with us\nreally gnarly knot in it I've been wanting to make a bowl out of it forever\nand this video is a good reason to do it so I'm going to just drill the bowl and\nI'm not going to make the entire pipe because I don't know exact\nwhat I want to do with this but it will be a tobacco type bowl the bowl I think\nis about an inch and a half and the the bowl the bowl thickness the total\ndiameter the bowl is about an inch and a half and the bowl interior is five\neighths of an inch which is the size of my core box but and I'm going to drill\ndown about a inch and a quarter and this is the real trick this is where squaring\nreally matters because if you're off just a little bit then this connection\nisn't made and then you have a piece of scrap wood and I hope I don't make us\ngrease and scrap wood out of this because this is a really cool piece of\nwood so I paid extra careful attention to the squaring and what I found out was\nthis edge was not exactly square but that's okay because this is square this\nis square the bottom square when it's drilled it's going to be like this and\nso this little bit of error is it going to matter that much\nbecause it's going to be square on the bottom and square on the sides and it's\ngoing to work that way so next up is the next thing the next thing you want to do\nis drill a starter hole for the bowl using a Forstner bit the reason you do\nthis is because phenomenon known as walking where you'll take a bit like\ncore box bit that doesn't have a brad point tip on it and you'll drill into\nthe wood and it will sort of go wherever at once you want to avoid that\nespecially when drilling the bowl now if I haven't mentioned it before you always\nwant to align your bowl with the end grain of the wood that's very important\nbecause the in grain is tough stuff and you want your bowl to be tough should've\nmentioned that earlier but I didn't so first thing you do is you drill a\nstarter hole and it doesn't matter got a quarter of an inch whatever then you\ndrill the bowl when you're drilling the bowl you want to position the wood as\ncarefully as you can the first thing you want to do is get your wood so that it's\njust light up so it's just above the level of the of the bowl that you\nif you have a laser sight on your laser sight you've got lasers on your drill\npress this would be helpful to to line the point up with the very center point\nof the of the Forstner bit but if you don't have that that's alright what you\nwant to do is you want to take the bit and take it down and rotate the bit and\nmake sure that it doesn't touch any of the sides and make sure it's as centered\nas you can like that and after that then you're clear to drill the bowl the bowl\nhas been drilled now if you notice there's a little ledge right toward the\ntop that's where the Forstner bit stopped and the core box bit started\nthat can be taken away with a loop with some very careful sanding you don't want\nto mess with the inside of the bowl too much though and you see down toward the\nbottom there's some like scoring a bit of charring that happened because the\ncore box bit got a whole bunch of sawdust caught in the middle of it and\nit it started like scorching the inside of it you want to avoid doing that if at\nall possible other pipe makers make their bowls with specialized Spade bits\nthat have been grounded very specific like angle up I don't have that and you\ncan't really buy one of those and so this is the best option when you use a\ncore box but you want to make sure that you go slowly and you clear away as much\nsawdust as you can otherwise it'll get compacted in there and things will start\nto burn and that's no good the next step is drilling the air passage and you're\nreally going to have to count on your drafting so make sure that it's good you\nwant to start off with a brad point bit but you definitely want to finish with a\nregular bit because the regular bit is going to go into the inside of the bowl\nand if it's too if it's a brad point bit it's going to take away too much and\nit's not going to work with the aerodynamics of the pipe that's going to\nmake it not work is good so start with a brad point bit end with a regular bit\nhere it is happening the air passage has been drilled and as you can see the way\nit works this actually was a very near miss the air passage came in just under\nthe bowl and it was just close enough to where I could poke my all through there\nand it came out just they came actually a lot better than I\ncould have managed it so so that works so yeah that is how you do it at this\npoint the bowl can be shaped into whatever pipe you want to make it into\nI'm not totally sure what I want to do with this this bowl just yet so I'm\ngoing to wait no love on that but I hope this video has been helpful and showing\nyou how to make pipes and give you the basics and well my name is Gary a please\nsubscribe to my channel please if you like my stuff check me out on Facebook\nmy name is Gary and I'm out",

silicon bowl by a company called ice yeah this come this bow is completely made up of silicone all the way through the bowl itself though is made up of glass quartz glass if I'm not mistaken and it's a cool little piece of glass really nicely made and it snaps right in there see that percent right back in there [Music] all of it is completely made of silicone is so soft and nice and it's completely machine washable so you could throw it in the dishwasher and I have to worry about it damaging or anything like that and it'll come out nice and clean so yeah that's pretty cool and underneath comes installed in there it's this little poker tool for cleaning out your bowl I need resin or anything gets stuck in there on one side is the poker and the other side is like a packer tool it's like a nice little hammer your jam can pack all your product right in there and nice and tight you hear that that's glass snaps right back in for easy safekeeping now you don't have to lose it or worry about where did I put it you put it right there right there it's right there pothead and under here is one of the coolest features that it has check this out in here we pull this little tab right here revealing what inner chamber for safekeeping of your product they take that little silicon well let's do this let's take out a nice little piece from in our little chamber nice little piece we removed and we're gonna save the rest for later safekeeping so we're gonna put our little lid back on snaps right in place Oh see that how cool is that [Music] all right now we're gonna take our little piece we're gonna sprinkle it right inside our little glass bow it's sitting inside this silicone body a nice little press down see that now let's see how it functions okay let's give it a nice hit remember it is a silicone body so you want to not you want to not let the flame hit the body directly because it will damage it so try your best just keep that on there [Music] a little bit of butter by about but oh my god did you see that hit I didn't put a screen on it but I should what an amazing hit from that little pipe let's do that one more time wow that's insane I was not expecting that Wow let's do that again oh [ __ ] [Music] yeah let's just bail out I don't know where is the silicone spoon by ice oh my god check it out get yourself one get your hands on this [Music] wow that's insane and intense oh my god so yeah silicone spoon or buh-bye ice check them out online get yourself one of these it's super compatible you see the little compartment on the bottom the glass take the glass out cleans right up a little alcohol white underneath little compartment little poker tool silicone body goes right in the dishwasher it killed it with this one this is insane

Ricky wore the pr paper from what the Rico oh sorry Ricky I don't know what happened there so we did a trade and you have tamper / tamper gave him a couple tamper he sent me a couple dampers made of bamboo I think it's just too cool man all the way from Puerto Rico that is awesome that is cool I like it like the simplicity of it I like how it's bent oh let's work my wrist that's gonna do tamping that tobacco and then it's got you know your angled piece for digging her out and he calls this one the ice pick he said you know case things get dirty get hairy could use it as a shank i Ricky's funny pretty cool David man had some problems with the mail getting it here he was both checking the track in and it was seem to not want to get here said that it was going to arrive one day Saturday and it never did and then it finally did and here we go Ricky thank you so much brother thank you for the trade these are awesome I will cherish these love love homemade things even you know I mean they're from your kids but the homemade cards you know that your kids make at a construction paper folding that happy birthday daddy or you know whatever but those are from your kids you're gonna love anything they do but I love the thought that somebody puts into making something homemade especially if it's personalized you know if if I don't I don't know it Ricky had you know a bunch of these hanging around and he just grabbed some out of the pile and threw them in you know an envelope shipped them to me but a lot of times I know that when I'm doing a trade with somebody or if I'm making a tamper for somebody I have that person in mind while I'm turning the tamper and and I'd like to think that the same things going on well I mean obviously they're thinking about you because they're getting things ready putting it you know in a package and shipping it off so amazing fantastic and if you don't have the skills or the resources to do things homemade well you always do I mean there's always something that you can do but it it's not the end of the world for sure I mean you know there are things that we have that we give because we want to be a blessing to others you know if I can't make something or I can't buy something and something that I have I can give it to plus others you know it's not like broken back you you know that's good let's just get rid of trash but I think thank you guys know what I'm saying Thank You Ricky war man thank you for the trade it's been awesome been great getting to know you buddy so for the first time ever in my life been wanting to try this haven't been able to get it been on the waiting list call me back list never been able to get it my man Petey Daley hooked me up he said what you know we did a trade what kind of tobacco's are you looking for and for whatever reason I never said this before I said Scottish cake I've never been able to get it heard it's delicious I've tried um oh right here I tried the Scottish blend but it's not Scottish cake this is an English I wrote a stout English at that delicious tobacco loved it wanted to try this and the dude said I've got it send it your way I was blown away I thought I was just gonna get a sample I guys sent me a 10 PT daily you're the man thank you very much and you guessed it cracked er open that's got a delicious hang out to it it is a it's of Virginia I don't know what you call it not I don't know if it's a vapor it's got Kentucky in that but it's a dark Virginia dark Virginia and Kentucky with a peach of per week so this this was my I never had it but my unicorn tobacco and this is my very first homemade pipe got a hobby block last weekend and I stared at it for a week I drew on the side of it and I like the 673 the 7l is 673 you know these these I'll have hundred dollars to go spin on a pipe you know whenever I want a pipe so this was $24 you know with shipping and everything it was more than that but I decided to go I really like the some of the near up shapes that they have out but we just kind of show you I mean the either grain it's it's pretty cool you know it's nothing fancy kind of looks like a spiderweb right right in there I got no complaints for me I messed up you can see you can see it I'll show you if you can't but where it's flat right here I messed up on the band saw cutting it I know I don't want to take any more off I wanted you know I wanted a big I don't even know what you call a big brandy shape but and then the stem did that to the stem you know it's Tim it's huge and then I kind of old you know this out a bit I'm I'm impressed I mean I I see the flaws in it I know the flaws in it and I am highly impressed though how well it just it came together just kind of you know almost just just fell together and there's only one right there yeah you can see that one sandpit in the briar so and I don't know what this is character but it's just a dark spot in the writer it's not a bird you know I didn't I didn't put a tool on it for too long to make a burn but but everything man came together and then put it on the sand or the the sand and we'll the buffing will well it looked long I mean it is it is fairly long but but I'm gonna smoke out of my first pipe that I ever made some Scottish cake and been wanting to do both of these since I started smoking a pipe nothing Scottish cake when I first found out about this guy when I first heard about the Scottish cake I wanted to do it so let's do it well char light was delicious give it a little little pack I don't want I don't want tamp too much it's you know obviously it unfinished the bowl on the inside I'll show you the tobacco's here looks like it's a broken flake wow that's pretty good this is really good man Thank You Petey so the only issue with this Pike you know it's a hobby block so it comes with the bowl drilled and the airway drilled you know and it's it's kind of partially you know made you know what the mortise and Tenon's drilled and and the stem is fitted to about you know right here and it's the stem was huge all the way around it was like this big all the way around about the size of a I don't know maybe way wasn't the size of a nickel I was gonna say nickel but that's not true what again the only issue that I had is that when they drilled you know cuz it's a it's a half bent when they drilled it they drilled it twice they drilled it down like this and then they came in and drilled it like that so when you run a pipe cleaner through it it doesn't go all the way through and I thought about getting in there with a dremel and trying to clean that up a little bit but I mean they came in they came in perfect in a bowl I mean perfect in the bowl couldn't have asked for a better better hit on the bowl right in the center and I mean right at the bottom perfect but ya can't run a pipe cleaner through I might be able to like bend the tip and twist it and get it in there but so this pipe will never get cleaned I packed it loose to really lose Thank You Ricky for the tamper so uh my first time working with Briarwood it was surprisingly easy to work with easy to mold mold you know shape but it was hard to cut on the bandsaw I don't I have a 10 inch bandsaw and I have a pretty aggressive blade on it but it would sit was still kind of hard to cut on the bandsaw no I say hard to cut it just kept longer to get through mmm this tobacco it's really really good it is tasting like a like a vapor a fake bake / they cover virginia kentucky Parikh the vacant bur they get tried this last time with Burley with Virginia and Burley Bertha vapor I don't remember what I said I'm sure it was spot-on and everybody really liked it yeah you dance gosh cake you guys never get the opportunity to smoke it grab it stuff it light it smoke it man this thing fits so we have my wife I showed my wife she just rubbed oh yeah so I didn't stain it or anything I just buffed it on the on the wheel with some Tripoli you know but put some Tripoli buffing compound on it and then hit it with the with the white diamond yeah the color I like that I do that with a lot of my pipes a lot of the pipes that I that I get and I clean up I've actually got some here well this one this is one that I just recently bought it was I got 2 of them for $10 you know it's got some char and up top but $5 for this thing that smokes like a champ $5 trying to think of what you can buy for $5 not much not much anymore maybe 2 gallons of gas here in the Ozarks now I think it's gasses at 229 man I don't know if it's because I've wanted it for so long but this tobacco is really good really good it's it that you know the sweetness from the Virginia it's got that that nice spicy know from the Parikh and then the Kentucky comes in with that you know mmm good strong bold flavor got some gurgle gurgle burble I don't think I will be able to run this through but wonder if I can get now far enough to get that girl out where she stopped really quick yeah it's pretty dry well maybe that's something I'll have to remedy anyway we're getting on 20 minutes here it's gonna take three days to upload I don't have very good service out here can't get I don't have the internet at the house the only kind of internet that we can get is through the satellite dish and that an internet is not very good and I don't want to pay the price for the good internet so we just do smartphones out here I know three miles out of town and it's you know there's fiber just up the road if I ever hot day I don't know what the deal is we got the technology I got copper wire it comes to the house you know just a regular phone but I can't get no high-speed Internet anyway I'm rambling not doing anything all right I just I wanted to show

hilarious his last video was man crack me up I'm still laughing I'm probably gonna watch it again actually all right I'm out of here take care", "PZ1dbZWzds4": "- [Evan] Hi, it's Evan\nhere from \"Plain Jane.\" And today, I wanted to show you guys the right way to clean out your pipe. This is my pipe. It is a protopipe, kind\nof old school, brass. It comes with this little\nthing that fits in. Pretty disgusting right now. Hemp flour has a lot of resin, that CBD resin. It builds up, it gunks stuff up.. Let me see if you can really see that. Oh that's nasty. You will already see\nthat I kind of scraped around the sides. Poke stuff through. But I mean.. Oh this is..this needs some help. I mean you can just..you can just see here at the end. That's..that's nothing\nyou want to deal with. If this is going into your lungs, you want this to be as clean as possible. I'm going to show you how to clean it. It's really really simple. Soap and water, it will not work. You will frustrate yourself, absolutely endlessly, if you try to use soap and\nwater to clear off this. Why is that? It's because CBD is not water soluble. It's oil. It literally will not dissolve in water. Soap has a really tough time removing oil. Instead of cleaning this\nwith soap and water, the right way to clean it, is isopropanol. Let me see if I can fit this in here. Isopropanol that you can't drink. Won't get you drunk. Probably will blind or kill you. For \"Plain Jane,\" we get it really pure. We get this uh.. This 99% stuff. We use it to clean out facility. Most people don't get it by the gallon. You can probably find it in your Wal-Mart, Walgreens, hardware stores. Even with COVID-19 happening, it's still pretty widely available. I'm here in southern Oregon, and absolutely no trouble finding alcohol. When you're stuck with\nsomething like this, there's two things you got to do. Oh my God, you can eve\nsee it's like falling out. Look at that. That's nasty. So, when you're cleaning this, you got to use isopropanol. The higher the percentage, the better. And the second thing you want to use, is salt. The point of the salt actually. A lot of people don't use the salt, they just use the isopropanol. And they wonder why its so\nhard to clean out their pipe, or their bong, or whatever. The reason it gets really really hard, is because, like.. How are you going to clean in there? What are you going to\ndo to clean in there? But the salt, it'll act as an abrasive. It'll actually, you know, make it really really easy to get those hard to reach areas. So lets go ahead and do this. For the glass, I just cleaned out an old spaghetti jar. You know, anything you want to use, you can find in the house. That'll work just fine. I lost the lid for this, so my hand is going to\nbe the lid right now. Lots and lots of salt. Notice the salt doesn't really dissolve. You can kind of, you know, there's plenty of salt. See it shaking up in there. Yeah, that's not going\nto be a problem at all. Lets toss things in. All right, we'll give this a good shake. I'm trying to.. Trying to keep my hand all around it. (shaking) Don't want it to shake out.. too much. (shaking continues) Look at that. Okay I want to take a break for a second. You see how dirty that alcohol is getting? Look at that. That's like incredible right there. (shaking continues) Okay, lets pull this out, and see how it looks. You know, its never going to be perfect. But look at all this crap, that I took out. I did spill a little bit right here. You know the good thing about alcohol, is it evaporates pretty quickly. But look at all of that. And that, that's pretty much brand new. See how the salt really gets in there? And it rubs against everything. There we go. And that, that's about as clean\nas it's going to get. Last step, really simple. Just rinse this off with some water. The water will remove any of the salt, any of the alcohol. Make this ready to go. Maybe blow on, blow out a few times. That can help. This is really the only\nway I've ever seen, that has actually worked. So, hey give it a go. Let me know if you guys have a better way. I'm always trying to get smarter. Look at this difference. It's all dry now. Finger in there, twist around. Nothing right, nothing. That's.. That's amazing. Use alcohol to clean your piece. Clean your pipe, clean your bong. This actually works way better on glass. Try it out. My bongs at the office. Look how much cleaner that is now. All I did was dry it\noff with a paper towel. Nothing, look at that. Oh my gosh, so much better. This is the way to clean your pipe. It's not sticky. It's not a mess. Not breathing in old ash from how.. God knows how long ago. It's ready to go. Yeah, I hope you learn\nsomething and take care.

smoke you", "UPPQ05oTAjg": "well Aloha brothers and sisters to friend keep a welcoming you back to the channel we're gonna do another review today for all you cannabis enthusiasts and connoisseurs out there got a little bit of a unique product in the Canadian market for you today this comes to you from Missouri which is a can Mart brand we got sage in sour and this product is called a glass taster as you can see on the back here yeah hopefully it's coming through clear there's 0.25 grams cannabis in here so it's a really tiny small little unit I was really curious to buy this at the store goes for about 6 bucks so it's not a lot to check it out um it's really a neat product I'm gonna show you what's inside here so we're just gonna open it up I'll let you know here we're hitting total THC fifty nine point ninety milligrams as you can see on there so it is 0.25 grams so you multiply that by four it's gonna be about twenty twenty-one percent THC so it should be a pretty heavy hitting strain restrain Sage and sour yeah we'll get into that as we open this up here so I'll show you we're just gonna break the seal tried one of these already it's pretty unique so open up the package and this is a completely useless packaging because inside we have the actual package so there is literally no use for this box I don't know why it's in there so what you get is you get this nice little package I say they can just sell it like this I don't know why it's in a box but looks like a pre-roll package you go ahead and pop the top just like that and what you get inside is this funky little unit this is what they call glass taster so as you can see got your herb in there right you got a nice little glass one-hitter that you get with this it's kind of cool you know you get the little reusable glass one-hitter afterwards so it's kind of neat and what I like about it is you can see the flour in there it's it's you know some pretty good but it's not too bad it's not a lot of shaking stems like you might get in pre rolls it's pretty good only 0.25 grams in there comes with this little plastic plug the end you just sorta take it out and as you can see well acting they're nice and good and yeah that's a unit so without further ado actually you know what I'm going to tell you a little bit about the strain if you're not familiar with this age and sour it's a combination of two strains what is called sage it actually stands for si GE I believe it's sativa Afghani genetic equilibrium I believe it's a 50:50 hybrid strain it was engineered to be the perfect hybrid absolutely even in the corset Eva nice hybrid hi what sage and sour is is that stream crossed with what are your favorites hopefully it's definitely one of my Sour Diesel so you know let's see kind of creates a bit of an earthy smell kind of an aroma I guess the seed stream kind of has a small mild hint of sage to it and of course you know Sour Diesel has that sort of lemony gas smell definitely can kind of smell a little bit of Sour Diesel I'd say mostly coming through is just sort of a herbal e earthy smell it's really hard to discern what the smell is yeah it's definitely like you know a classic cannabis scent but it's a little bit undiscernible just kind of earthy herbal kind of smell smells good I can't wait to rip into it so what you're gonna need for one of these is I'm later in your unit and you just kiddin want to go for it so much giver [Music] Bill's up there it's tasty yeah you got kind of a herbal earthy flavor on the smoke not really catching a lot of the hints of the Sour Diesel strain I'm very familiar with that strain it's got kind of a lemony sort of diesel e taste that's where it comes from we also get a lot of flavor on the exhale you know we're all Pleasant earthy sort of her belief kind of taste not a lot of notes that are like discernible that are coming through that it's like oh that's it you're sir oh that's pine it's just kind of a hodgepodge of cannabis flavor that's really not too bad it's a good tasting stream it's pretty good so as I said I did have one of these yesterday and I really enjoyed it the effects you get off this bad boy is definitely a hard-hitting sativa it's it's super sativa in this little bad boy super energetic really focused feeling creative feeling very sociable very conversational it's this is a fantastic daytime strain smoked this in the morning and be full of energy for like a couple hours you're gonna get everything done I'm fine and I really like this strain haven't seen it in flour or pre-rolls I've only seen it in the glass taster so far definitely it would be interested in purchasing this you know if I could find it in 1/8 or quarter in one of these stores or even in pre-rolls because a little glass taster I use it's only point to 5 grams but it really gets the job done point to 5 grams in here not a lot in there but it goes a long way so the screen I really like the product I really like to you know you get this glass little one-hitter completely reusable over and over again just for the price of the unit right so just for the price of the package so I was like six something 650 something like that so just about seven bucks you get a little glass one header that comes with some weed in it that's the way I see it and the way that's in there is we're really good you're gonna smoke this and you're gonna be pretty alertly baked for you know a couple hours you're just gonna be wired it's it's pretty good if you're beginner I would probably not go ahead and smoke this whole thing because you're just gonna be just wired experience users you're gonna really like this strain I really like this tray like I said I would buy it again in a heartbeat if I seen it not in the glass taster the product itself like I said I gotta say it's pretty cool I would recommend it because like I said you get a little one hitter that you can use over and over again really only thing I don't like about it other than the packaging is really excessive and wasteful is you know it kind of looks like a crack pipe I'm not gonna lie you know so I don't really like the optics of it right you know so if you're out and about you know and you just pull this out you know I won't look like crackhead so that's kind of like you know a bit of a downside does look like a little crack pipe but whatever brothers/sisters you know what I mean whatever floats your boat you know if you don't care what other people think who cares you got some good weed in here they're gonna smell the weed anyway to me that's the only really downside is the optics of it other than that I really like this strain I really really like this string I think any cannabis enthusiasts out there would really like this stream the effects are really good really heady like I said if you're after a really super sistema stream for during the day just an all-day strain great wake-and-bake strain I wholeheartedly recommend stage this hour the strain itself is great the product itself it's great it's a great value like six bucks and you get a little glass one-hitter too got some weed in there it's not too shabby at all you know you're gonna pay sometimes you pay half that print or double that price for you know like a little half Grand Prix roll and all you got left with that is a little Roach that you throw away so value wise it's pretty cool you know I'd say you know might not buy a lot of these cuz I don't want a lot of these little blasts one hitter sitting around but once in a while this is pretty cool it's a very unique product that's kind of neat like I say they call it a glass taster it's a taster there's only 0.25 grams in there kind of like a sampler but you know it's I didn't think it was gonna be a lot but I find that after this little ball they're really good for a couple hours of course does get a little hot so you can't just keep ripping ripping ripping ripping ripping you got to give it a little time to cool down cuz the glass does get hot and it gets a little hot on your lips hot on your fingers so you know you got to pace yourself a little bit but overall I was really satisfied with this I guess I never heard of Mazzara before this is the first product I seen from them really impressed I gotta say this was a really unique product it was really interesting had to take a shot on it and I came away impressed would probably buy it again like I said if I seen the screen I don't know how many of these I'm gonna buy because I don't want to pile up a whole bunch of these things hanging around because then we're getting into some wasteful territory but yeah you know six bucks you get this nice little glass one-hitter you get some good strain of weed to check out and yeah it's a winner Lazzaro sage and sour if you see this in the store I'd say take a fire on it six seven bucks cat loose check it out I really think you're gonna enjoy this strain I like the concept of the little glass taste there to text the stray notes see if you want to buy it yeah there's a winner really unique product I just wanted to show you guys today I don't know if any of you have had a chance to see these out there but if you do you can pretty much I'm gonna give you my word that you can take a shot on it and I think you're gonna be satisfied so that's my review

needed for our purpose yes ours purpose was here and it works I certainly want to use it above [Music] oh nice hey so smooth you could taste it too none of that do you take it how sweet taste because that's so smooth some reasons why I really like this because you can kind of get in there move stuff around and kind of touch edges that haven't been burnt yet mmm nice thick rich sound drum gives the herb iron five happy beats now there are a couple of uses put the herb iron one of my one of my favorite things to do with remove the bowl now take a chunk of your favorite concentrate in this case it's hash ha ha make sure the chunks a little bit bigger than the down stem side so it doesn't fall in the bottom water pail watch this [Applause] oh my oh my yes [Music] there is one last use I have found for the turbine and I don't suggest anybody does this in fact I don't even suggest that I do it but I'm gonna do it in anyway are you sick and tired of people taking your lighters every time someone comes over to my house they snag my lighter yeah you can explode doing this so I would not suggest it well big explosive spark with lightning speed writing your name on a lighter with a hot iron and permanently put your name in the light so now you can bust people for stealing your lighter hey Xena it's a sound you see no mistaking that's my lighter so her gadgety guy like I weigh am i would heavily suggest getting these herb irons they were kick-ass the guys over there way cool and uh I think they know what was in the box [Music] [Music]", "49c9CiY0T-Q": "alrighty one up guys and welcome back to curse cause TV this 18 and over channel does of people of marijuana music and sports and today we're going to be smoking out of our homemade water pipe here Sophie I saw the last episode of kuch khaas TV I showed you guys how to make your own homemade rubber garment water pipe or bong here in real quickly two things i forgot to tar should say two things i forgot to mention in the last episode on how to make a water pipe real quickly also after you're done making your water got your rubber garment water bong here or water fight I forgot to tell you guys um also because you know the water pipe here is not a pull carb obviously you guys need to make a carp here so as you guys can see there go halfway up your bottle and you know put a little hole in there for your carb so then you can clear it and then also as you guys can see here I made a little mouthpiece so we happen to have I don't know if you guys can see that prime time it's just a cigar case here as you guys can see I don't know if it says cigar somewhere but little primetime cigar SAT there cut the bottom off of it and then put a hole into the 2-liter bottle bottle cap here and then essentially kind of made a mouthpiece for it so just two things I forgot to mention in the last episode on how to make your rubber garment water piece here so obviously a carb so we can actually clear out this water pipe here because it's not a pole carb and then of course a little mouthpiece just you know I guess for you know a better draw as well as just kind of I guess little cool functionality or whatever but like I said like I told you guys on last episode we SAT there and showed you guys how to make one and then of course on this episode we're going to be smoking out of it today so hopefully you guys at home Piper smoking device little hope he hasn't rejoin your herb your Honeywell your watcher hash or keep whatever you're smoking on cannabis wise hope you guys are we joining with me and as always the hit for it challenge every time I take a hit of weed i want you guys at home to go ahead and take a hit with me so we happen to have 0 sitting there dropping water off the carbon stuff i don't know if you guys can see that but we have a little bit of purple my while we in here as our base because i do not have any screens at all tomorrow Matt's probably pick up some screens but we have a little bit preoccupied while here and we also have some easy rider left as you guys can see there so I want to take a little bit of Easy Rider and put that on top or purple my eyes kind of be are going to be our base in our screen and they'll put some easy rider up top here and we'll go ahead and throw our little fancy mouthpiece attachment or whatever you want to call it here so we got our smoking devices loaded up hopefully you guys have your smoking devices loaded up at home as well and if you got our should say hopefully you guys are having a good day or night and if you guys aren't go ahead and load up a bowl and smoke one with me and we'll make the day a little bit better or night so enough talking let's get the smoke in here little smoke sesh smoking out of our homemade bong here that I showed you guys how to make on the last episode pretty tasty but enough talking toast guys smoking out of our homemade water painting it's going there we go nope there yep come on there we go all right toast guys think it might actually work better without the mobile mouthpiece like I said this here is just kind of for looks but we'll take that awesome gosh you get some real function get some bigger hits try to get a close up shot here right about there I guess holy buckets oh yeah the Ripper oh oh man get that still smoke out so as you guys can see there a homemade water pipe works just as good as just as any other regular you know rubber garment bong rather be plastic rather be you know glass or whatever when I mean by plastic I mean like actually like you know big strong [ __ ] plastic and [ __ ] of course last right there but this here is just as good as any one of these here and you can make it you know yourself well like I said all you need really is you know some kind of a bull piece and obviously some kind of a rubber garment attachment or just some tape and you know the other should I show you but enough talking let's keep on smoking out of this thing here we still got some more weed in here so let's go keep on smoking you guys at home gonna keep on smoke along and toast Oh God you build up a smoke so [ __ ] fast hoes be back holy [ __ ] whoa whoa holy [ __ ] but this thing is such a [ __ ] cloud monster he just gets like such [ __ ] big thick milky [ __ ] hits and when he go to clear it it's his [ __ ] shotguns are right into your lungs so she's [ __ ] instant high holy [ __ ] guys you got stoned yet I'm kind of stone but let's go ahead and actually get fully stone here let's take couple more hits you guys home going to pick up more hits and tough I definitely have to say over the years all the water ball or all the water pipes are all the bongs that I've made that we're home made this is probably the best one I've ever made the functionality on this [ __ ] is perfect just airtight perfectly oh yeah honest with you guys are probably using this on the show I could you know if I won't be using it as a daily driver but definitely don't be surprised if you guys see this again I if you like this here this is really good well besides that part where I just got nasty boiling water over my clothes but as you guys can see there we don't smoke the whole damn bolshe double is Gandhi is cached full week I got pretty stolen I wouldn't say I'm [ __ ] baked but I'm pretty damn stone so how are we doing on time here we got eight minutes or some [ __ ] whoo-whee [ __ ] sweating and everything but yeah like I said last episode we showed you guys how to make this and of course real quickly the two things I forgot of course once you're done making your water piece don't forget to go out put a carbonate and of course if you want to make a cool little mouthpiece attachment sit there put a hole in the bottle cap here and get some kind of a tube or something you know like i said this here is a prime-time little cigar case so we use that there and it does work but i think personally without this here you you get a essentially kind of a I don't know a better draw I guess it used to say are essentially a better bigger milkier head it milks it up quicker when you don't use that we but yeah obviously just wants to smoke out of this always like smoking out a little homemade pieces like this and I'm always surprised on how [ __ ] while they work because they literally like a told you guys or you know showed you there it works just as well as any other rubber garment bong that you get you know anywhere else rather be you know spending 20 30 bucks on a glass one a plastic one metal one whatever it is you could just make one yourself that's just as good and of course I told you next week or within the next week or so I'll show you guys how to make a glass on glass essentially homemade water pipe as well but enough to that

bowl is dirty because this is amazing bro i took a one gram dab out of this already on instagram took a hell of fat ribs this long is a beast it breaks down the smoke so much like it makes the head so much smoother that it's just like you know a game changer at this point it's just a freaking game changer fam freeze pipe bombs let's take the box out should we leave it up here let's put it down here look you already know what this is free spike bomb from that to the right right here all right so we're grinding up some bud from the homie guy indoors in our santa cruz shredder i already know the vibes i'm not sponsored by santa cruz maybe one day i like your boy you really look good all right so now as y'all know the bowl is very good and it's um it has a screen on it so the good thing about it is you won't dirty your bone always keep it nice and clean no dirtiness goes in like dirtiness will still go in but not no weed so you know it's gonna be easy to clean because as y'all can tell i keep mine brand new and i already used it like a [ __ ] fan and it's brand new brand new brand new brand new very easy to clean maybe i'll do a video on how to clean bonks i already have that video up so go check that one might affect maybe i'll redo it but all right so the bong is a 18 millimeter so it is a big monster that's why they call it xl because it's for beasts that's why we got it let's take a [ __ ] favorite by this the strain worth smoking i don't even remember what this is like it's from the homie guy indoors but i don't remember the name of this strange i think it's some old

super cool probably super smooth you don't even feel it you don't even feel and i'm taking fat ribs and i'm telling you like you're not even coughing because of the because of the coldness as well but like this these downstairs right here these perks it just breaks down the smoke so much him like it makes it so much smoother so much smoother i'll do a close-up too of the of the function of this so y'all can tell this brings a clamp for the bowl as well but you know i wouldn't advise on using it because you want to clear it and you want to lift the bowl up so i took that clamp out but yeah bro this is super smooth super smooth i'm both done the bowl is done and you saw me cough what once and you know i cough you know i call when some good bunkers let me get the poker all right we got the poker ram see that's done see you keep all that dirtiness out of your bong that's [ __ ] amazing like you know it still got dirty as y'all can see right there it got a little bit dirty you see but it's nothing that you can clean real quick and it will not get clogged it will not get clogged that's one thing i can guarantee you this down stain right here will not get glowed if you change the bowl piece that's another story but like if you keep everything original bro are y'all hearing the wind leg i'm just gonna show you guys what the [ __ ] we're dealing with over here mess what the [ __

my banger bro my banger is [ __ ] it's like maybe this is like you see that that like scratch on there like this blinger has is like two years or three years like i don't buy a new banger because why

stupid product I'm not all about product placement here mm-hmm you're still bottle you put your marijuana cigarette now I don't really this isn't a real marijuana cigarette of course it's just made out of tobacco for this video because marijuana here is against the law a week a weed is against the law anyway so you put it in put it in upside down because you're going to light that and you're going to stick it up sit down into the bottle you're making yourself a little super poker of course again this is just tobacco if you get any here get any smoke in the air what you want to do is use
