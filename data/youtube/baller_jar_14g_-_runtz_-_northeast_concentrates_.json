is going to be down in the description for you guys hey until next time peace", "AORyULfIRe0": "yo yo yo what's good youtube welcome to another live stream i'm going to raise you up just a bit sweet so gopro updated and um my new wi-fi router is in we're showing signal strength here for the stream decent it didn't show that before so now that's pretty good to see anyways let me go ahead and share the link out to instagram and we're going to go ahead and get started uh all right cool well glad we got that up and running let me go ahead and uh get this stream up on my computer oh you're right let's see i'm sure you guys want to see some of this stuff that i have here before we even get started right let me show you what we got going on first of all we weighed everything out earlier we uh pulled it out of the freeze dryer fresh this morning fat fat nineteen point four percent yield killed it one thousand one hundred and thirty grams of nug went in 220 grams of full spectrum hash came out as well as 19 grams of 25 and 160 micron so this is our test press that we use for edibles and then we'll go ahead and press out the rest of these full spectrum pucks i loaded them by hand into the bags and then after putting them in the bags i pressed them down in a rosin evolution pre-press to make sure that they stayed nice and tight and they are evenly distributed went up from uh the small little four ounce jars and uh upgraded to the six ounce jars i got tired of filling those little small ones to the brim and i said it's time to upgrade baby so we got the jar all weighed out we'll be able to weigh this when we're done tonight and see what our final yield was on this run now i'm a big fan of doing my presses a little bit warmer than what most people would i'm using my stool for you guys today so i'm gonna do this but um yeah you guys that watch me often know i will press anywhere from 200 to 225 depending on the cultivar depending on the hash um not all hash comes out the same um for example we talked about trichome density before right we talked about just because it looks like a lot of hash it may not be a lot of hash because um the oil inside may not be full you know what i'm saying the trichome may just be partially full in that case it's fluffy hash where it looks like a lot but it doesn't weigh a lot that's why this 25 micron and this 160 micron it looks like a large puck but it only weighs 19 grams compared to this puck which is smaller in comparison by about a centimeter right and it's not as fat but it weighs more probably about five to six grams more and that's because this is the full spectrum 45 through the 159 which contains higher density trichomes that are full of milk oil compared to the 25 and 160. so just a little throw that in there for you interior genetics what's going on asteroid farms if you guys aren't following asteroid farms on instagram go follow so old homie of mine platinum grove colorado who used to have a really pimp-ass girl room the nasa lab right um one of the inspirations for me initially stepping up my garden well now it's his turn to come back and he just got a brand new house with a nice ass basement and guess what it's time for a brand new build out so we're gonna help each other out take some ideas off of each other and i'm basically gonna have him record the whole thing and um show you guys how he does his build out you know and he'll give you guys pointers along the way and uh you know show you how to build a grow room so by the time you know he's done with that uh build out i'll be done uploading my video on how when i built out my grow room and uh his will be pretty much part two of a series that i'm going to be doing where it's going to be either build-outs brand new or remodels or upgrades and you guys will be able to pay for each episode um individually and absorb all the information that went into that whole build or remodel so it was actually his idea and we're gonna do his build out as episode two so it's gonna be awesome it's gonna have amazing information in there and it's gonna be great for you guys because instead of just seeing my room all the time and you're like oh that's great but not everybody has your room like yours or not everybody has a layout like yours you'll get to see different layouts different places different um climates right you're gonna get to see it all and you're gonna get to see the different thought process that goes into building these so it's gonna be really cool but anyways go check out his instagram because he's already started posting updates on it and it's not often that you get to jump on board and watch it build out brand new from the start most of the time you hop in and it's like uh the person's halfway done they've already done a bunch of [ __ ] you kind of like feel like the new guy you know what i'm saying in a crowd of old guys that been around for a long time now's your chance to get in on the bottom floor be one of those old guys he's been there forever by the time he gets done finishing you could be like i was there when you were still drawing the blueprints yo whippersnapper some of this blue icy and then i'm going to glove up the press is set to 175. we're going to do a low temp press on our test bag it's not going to be a clear indication of how the full spectrum is going to respond but it's going to give me a good enough idea to know whether or not 175 is going to provide the flow i'm looking for or if i'm going to need to go up to my 204 temperature 202 maybe i will put a link up right now i'm not sure that you guys can do it that's what's up jinder mah what's up dude i haven't seen you in forever holy moly so yeah check out asteroid farms what's going on viper what's up slug upstate what's going on we're just giving everybody a minute to trickle on in taking dabs we're enjoying life i haven't even taken a dab with you guys yet have i ah let's take a dab i'm gonna go in on some of this blue icy first oh let's get in there who wants to get in those guts with me we've got 31 left on this battery oh let's get in there the gopro doesn't focus well close up so you guys are gonna take what you get and be happy all right first time catching a live stream viper you caught a very good live stream for your first live stream this whole live stream i've already prepped all my parchment i prepped all my bags normally i'm not this prepped normally i still have full parchment and [ __ ] i wiped down the plates i'm ready to go baby it's waiting on you guys i mean what do you think we're about to press a half pound of hash a half pound cheers at 413 on the email okay ah that blue icy i swear on the exhale it tastes just like a blue icy it is so crazy every time it never fails what's up easy labs green ranger nashville how you doing freshly pressed what's up annie oh gee what's up hidden creek we got the whole [ __ ] family here i think i'm gonna do a live stream prank and start a live stream pressing hash with the hair straightener so we can get a million people asking oh no what happened did the press break fantastic so huh all righty all righty all righty let's swap out the battery you already know we got it we gotta swap out the battery we don't want it to die it'll be another short live stream i had to find it i couldn't forget i couldn't remember where the [ __ ] i put it down now i can't remember which batteries are charged now let's see lucky number nothing they'd be lying sometimes you got to pull them out and pop them back in they're not lying tonight [ __ ] [ __ ] well one of you's got to be higher than 25 [ __ ] percent let's find out i i don't feel comfortable knowing i've got 25 percent left on the battery i just took a fat ass dab and i'm about to start pressing i'm gonna get excited forget and this is gonna die by the way if the stream does go down unexpectedly please stay tuned because i will bring it right back up this is a non-stop party tonight that battery was at 100 you [ __ ] lying ass charger all right all right so for those of you that are new here i do a [ __ ] ton in a very small space so this is where i'm going to be collecting at when i'm all done here okay we're gonna move some [ __ ] out of the way shout out to roz and inc i want you guys to look at something real close here custom product for who that is who has bags like that who has bags like that do you want to know why he carries these two and a half by four and a half bags hey cuz of me baby who wants some bags i know some of you press and some of you need some bags all right anyways we've got parchment laid out we've got our bags ready to go okay and here you guys are going to go you're going to go right here look at that just for you how's that view yeah you could just chill set you down now is a good time if you got to use the restroom you got to go grab a drink you know what i'm saying whatever you got to do go handle that let me figure out this lighting i don't want it to be too bright for you guys oh [ __ ] that's too bright all right i feel good about this you guys are ordering from rosin inc make sure you guys use my coupon codes they're on my site solventlessbnb.com let's get ready get up there get up there just a little love from my homie right there you know all right remember you guys we're gonna be doing the 160 micron and the 25 micron mixed together as a test press before we move on to the full spectrum presses here we have the uh [ __ ] puck come on turn on screen doesn't recognize my gloves oh well anyways i hope that you guys were able to see that now this uh this is just some uh edibles mix of some uh the last strain that i pressed out which is the grape cosby little dark but it is [ __ ] chirpy and delicious and it will do amazing for edibles because the flavor that it will add is not too over the top but it's definitely like you notice it notice it so we're going to drip this into that edibles jar this is probably not going to flow crazy this is a test press a low temp test press at 175 all right i honestly feel like i should go up a little so so so so oh that looks like it's gonna be good well i think i found the temperature i'm gonna try for the first full spectrum maybe it'll flow a little bit more i'll take it for edibles siezer um don't worry that was just a plate on top of the press jumping around my cold plate up there good extraction well the flow was okay wasn't quite what i want it's kind of a weird flow so all right well not quite what i'm looking for believe it or not 185 that's gonna give me that awkward drip i'm gonna hold pull my audience to see what you guys think the temperature is that i'm gonna go with i already know what i'm going with i'm gonna go with uh my usual all right well we're gonna go ahead and do the first full uh spec press now all the same size that one was at 175. small bag we'll do this one first oh jesus 224 no too high 202 202 202 that's that's where i'm feeling 202 today i can feel it in my huevos rancheros pressing some cool spectrum once cash baby all right the room temperature is 74 degrees i do not believe in running a cold room during the pressing stage now bear with me you guys this is going to be a tad bit awkward as i have to deal with not only the um press this new jar which is larger and doesn't sit on the edge so i have to hold it like this in fact i don't even know what your viewpoint is now does that make sense right there where it's at for you guys i mean all right here we go we're at 191.1 191.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 six that's how slow my press heats up i love it i don't care what anybody says it doesn't overshoot temperatures during pressing because it sleeps it heats up slowly it doesn't like jump up all crazy because it has some overpowered 150 to 200 watt heaters it just has two 100 watt heaters nicely spaced out let's take a dab again next time tomorrow it sounds delicious this [ __ ] is like caramel taffy uh oh uh oh ah excuse me i felt like my nose was gonna run all over camera i didn't want that oh yeah what's up mommy my [ __ ] that'll do good that'll do oh that gets the job done i'll tell you what how you guys feeling about this prize we're at 199.7 199.7.8.9 200. 201 i'm not there and dad just [ __ ] knock me on my ass about let's get ready to remove look at that still plenty of paper towel left to clean bangers with throw that away save that puffing my man it's a good night when my boy puffin comes to visit you're pressing yourself right now huh hell yeah get it dog we are warmed up to 202 degrees let's go this is gonna be a second test press slightly lower than my normal but for some reason i'm feeling this temperature why i saw gonza say 204 and i'm like yeah yeah that's my normal i feel it but then all of a sudden my balls rumbled and spoke to me from deep within and they said no 202 now they're all right [ __ ] it the balls haven't lied yet oh what would you look at that there already me gusta come here come to daddy a little [ __ ] go what i say i knew it i felt it i felt it in my huevos rancheros oh yeah let's get messy somebody's got to make a meme out of the next big bag that squirts all over this jar so i'm feeling good about that that's a fish grab that and we're gonna move this over here i'll turn you right now 202 my [ __ ] i want to know did i get it all did i oh man that was a beautiful extraction 202 good job balls sometimes it's in your brains sometimes it's in your balls tonight it was in my balls oh check your insta i just saw you let me see let's let's see what am i checking your story i don't know maybe i jumped in at the wrong part of that conversation oh elevated uh nah there wasn't a lot on the parchment there was barely anything in here really maybe like two to three grams that was a small piece of uh that was small and that was 19 grams in there and uh [ __ ] dude not a lot left in there it's all over the [ __ ] sides of this jar is where it's at you guys want to see a big squirt huh all right let's get it gotta get off this cyber dream stuff though um all right let's get it big old fatty this one feels like a 27-30-ish somewhere in there all right let's go i don't want to listen to trap sorry i gotta get i gotta get the right music on first this is bothering me put on some good old tj hotto all right let's go i'm gonna fold this one down the center i just pinch it crease it down the center diagonal the other diagonals and that gives you kind of like a good flow right there already and then you just pinch the sides together and it's like let me check my battery here 85 percent go dude i'm all smoking one squeeze okay shout out to my man mysticalgo my official artist on sbnb records back down oh yep bomb extraction on that one let's go cross mountain ranges split cells of tomorrow it flowed so well there's like not even that much on the paper let us go yes uh let's keep this party [ __ ] going good over here peace i think i put some information in the description maybe i didn't add that i guess but 25 micron double bag from rosin inc for the uh for the bags my bad y'all i tried to put some information in there and i left out that one yo if you guys can't catch the live streams sign up for my patreon i upload them there so come to daddy um is i'm the master of my own fate i determine my own yield i grew the flowers this is the source of the single i am my own god excuse you uh is that's why i keep the ends of these parchment pieces wrap them over the parchment paper i wish i could slow this down listen listen did you [ __ ] catch it though my man [ __ ] threw it in putting him on game yo understand he let y'all know i'm putting y'all on game for free i'm gonna i'm gonna take it back one time is it too loud uh um let's go ladies and gentlemen it's time to flow i'm gonna bring you guys back some i feel like i'm not bad hold on you guys don't really need that flashlight i don't think anyways let me take it off and passed wrench squad hold it down here's a pro tip on really fat pucks make sure you leave a little extra space behind the puck so that you don't get a blowout but i can mute it that's fine didn't need that light but i'm not liking how that's lining up on the [ __ ] plates i'm gonna move it over just a tad real quick like uh is i go go go go go real big extraction what is it [ __ ] this one's really done i'm calling it now it's gonna be a dumper is nobody [ __ ] with you you know what as a kid i actually did like origami and [ __ ] you know what was better than origami paper [ __ ] planes god damn it paper planes with a [ __ ] i could fold all types of paper planes you guys when i was a kid not now you know why i can't do it now because i lost the book i didn't look that [ __ ] up read that [ __ ] in the book you know what i mean books are cool as [ __ ] you can learn how to make paper airplanes and [ __ ] who would have thought mm-hmm starting to get good at this [ __ ] so um okay well brown is foreign i until you quit this next one's gonna squirt like a [ __ ] so um okay i have that camera ready i'm gonna record this one on my phone i'm not sure how i'ma do it watch me money money all the time hey money please no worries it's only 200 degrees touch it with your [ __ ] hands that sense sorry i'm trying to align this a little bit differently here safety reasons there it is my press has a ram that can adjust positions so um it's a little bit different than most the ram isn't stationary which means that it can come out of alignment sometimes if i move it or whatever but it's all we're helping to make good taking care of your summer projects is a breeze bam summer savings on all your favorite brands make things even easier so freshen up the deck and fire up the grill summer's here and it's as close as your home yard get more done let's get it i've used this prosper [ __ ] ever you're biking like five years now i just let go of the [ __ ] bar my bad you guys the camera is on a very unsteady amount kinda i don't have the tripod leg spread out very well all right is to the place whoa the puck slit in the plates when i was adjusting it apparently almost popped out of the front no blow out though but i gotta pull it out real quick and readjust it i'm so glad that didn't blow out but somehow that slipped out that's a trip i'm so happy that i didn't blow out that's crazy what the [ __ ] i've never had that happened that's a trip that's a trip son experience saved for real he wouldn't would he he [ __ ] would let's go back on the plates you go you son of a [ __ ] that was a trippy trip trippy trip trip this thing is about i was like why is it not going like it should be leaking way more and then all of a sudden the handle slipped and i was like what the [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] what happened put that back on the plate for a second up a let that so hmm who's your daddy who's your daddy what a safe uh is before oh yeah good extraction i'll take it oh yeah let's power through it two more to go parchment gets added to the jar everything i want everything together mixed together equal even steven the stuff that sticks to the parchment might be different terpenes might be different different [ __ ] you know you don't want to leave it out shop from the comfort of your home at sprint.com that's not a lot of work bro i know i'm saying it's already time to upgrade the jar again i just got this damn jar i'm upset it's not fun i thought for sure it was going to be good enough we knew get a bigger drawer uh bertha it's time to go squirtle what the [ __ ] it did it again something's going on here is it sliding something's happening here there's no blowout but it's sliding off pressure's not being applied evenly to the plates somehow or they're too tight or i pre-packed them at an angle never had this happen okay i know what i'm about to do fix this i'm going to have to increase the pressure even slower every problem there is a solution hmm leaned on him to apply pressure for the pre-press by doing it evenly i had to have been time to upgrade and put my bigger plates on i guess for these bigger presses right inside there i hope you guys are watching this if you guys aren't [ __ ] paying attention i don't know what you're doing right now when i mess up that's when you guys need to pay attention because i don't mess up very often not to sound cocky whatsoever but i don't so if i make a mistake that's resulting in some type of mess up it would benefit everybody around me to pay attention and realize what i'm doing wrong so i got my light that's fine before i make sure i got the jar underneath there i didn't think it was going to squirt like that still this parchment is heavy from the [ __ ] first part of the press but it's still flowing good that's all that matters and no blowout fan dumb strong on the top setting don't you get a damn hum my curl is my rocker maybe i choose you and i don't even have i don't even have um i have a couple theories for what it is lots of adjusts right now it's increasing pressure too fast and also i have the press at a a pretty good angle right now leaning towards the front and i think that the hash is melting and making the puck inside uneven and then it blows out the front like that so i think i'm just going to go ahead oops just hit the table i'm going to go ahead and flatten out the press a little bit more risky with this puck anymore how would i do on the save [ __ ] crazy giving her incredible so okay my battery at 34 okay um check the alignment of the plates one more me come on gloves don't stupid i know it's not that cold in here but then mm-hmm little 74 degrees in here oh missiles contemplating life changes foreign foreign let me grab some parchment hold on i got an idea not so much as an idea that i just want to do something for this press just insurance actually all okay searching for savings on descriptions is so complex it's like getting a documentary unfortunately you just savings period not all patients eligible savings so um me yes i haven't even hit one ton of pressure you guys think i'm kidding look so just hit two and a half oh figured it out right pressure was increasing too fast and the angle probably didn't know so so well aren't you guys glad i got the internet connections really good attraction well wow please so um batteries are charged let's get a battery swap in before we do anything else we'll go from there sound good oh think so okay all right so good job bertha good job baby we're gonna take a dab and then after this dab i'm going to um go ahead and collect what's on the parchment and get it added to the jar while it's still warm man that's heavy that's heavy i mean yield wise i'm thinking it's got to be it's got to be upwards of 80 it has to be you know there's it is no [ __ ] way it's not it's a little harsh didn't it that's okay i'll turn it down i knew there was a little [ __ ] nap thingy in here a little [ __ ] flew right on me else we know there's never a good time to run out of fresh luckily our delivery and free pickup excuse me so whether it's a few extra guns from the back all right i mean you can't help it i got lights on in here when i come in through the garage little [ __ ] just came in with me i guess oh boy oh what are we taking a dab off i mean this is the 160 and 25. this [ __ ] is looking better than some people's like 90s come on man this is my throwaway edibles what's your calling air force reserve af reserve dot com all righty i got the drugs already got a little bit of runs on here i'm gonna grab some more though on the outside of one of these parchments but i smeared i know there's like a bunch

very pleased so let's go in for another happy dab shall we another happy dab little moxie 710 hooking it up like i'm oh i'm i'm just so happy with this purchase i don't like i said i don't buy their products often and it's not because of the quality it's strictly because of the price and i'm a boy on a budget so it is what it is but when you can get it for the right price hundred percent worth it at all cost every time i get their sand whenever i can usually however this time i did pass up the sand because i bought this that's how much i wanted to try this stuff and as good as it is i'm so glad i got three and a half great jar oh yeah it's not very often i can truly stock up so i'm grateful it's so smooth it's truly a unique flavor i don't even know how to really describe it to be honest with you i just really like it it's sweet without being overpowering it's not so mildest to be unnoticeable but not so strong is to be just crazy in your face nice happy medium for flavor very smooth no throat burn not really any tickle i do enjoy that i'm already getting a nice buzz going to dab in and i'm i'm happy now to be fair i did vape a bowl of flour before i did this but that's it that doesn't really affect me like dabs do i don't do flour that often so it's definitely the jesus og kicking in which is sweet i'm glad i did it worth every penny so with that said thank you very much for tuning in for watching i appreciate all the support i've been getting all the feedback it's been awesome uh instagram facebook all of it i hate facebook so i don't get on there don't even

it's just got done prepping for another hash wash damn it getting cold in here too because of that I might have to go grab my jacket but um yeah got the AC cranked to 62 degrees that the ice-cold water in the reservoir I've got a bag of ice for the washer and I've got six more bags ice out in the freezer I need to get a bigger freezer and all the materials well so later tonight after I get the kids down spend some time with the wife I'm gonna come back out here and knock out that bubble hash run uninterrupted probably gonna do somewhere between six to eight runs on it depending on how it looks and how everything is coming out [Music] anyways let's go ahead and get a - go in here I hope you guys are having a good day [Music] that was not clickbait by the way for those of you this joint this is a 104 grant or 100 Ford's a hundred grams now mixed strain hash frothing some cookies some sweet cream some zukie and what else sweet cream cookie sweet cream zoo keys and orange cookies that's what it is [Music] sorry I had someone from work pop-up I don't look out real quick [Music] all right cool [Music] anyways let's go ahead oh it's so good yeah I need to go ahead and fill up a little bit char with that [Music] this was some 60 micron parabola for edibles [Music] this one still has a cush cake in it and this one has on a fish cake so those that's my head - cooks cake in a jar [Music] earth is [ __ ] cold and her alright so I would like you yet in my day did you imagine dabbing that whole thing just like here we feel [ __ ] half the Banger ease and the easily I wouldn't even try it it'd be a waste and a half that's good enough for me enjoy that for the week [Music] the 160 press was man very little in there so that's what that looks like when I end up putting it in the jar and then a lot of people would ask me how did you get that [ __ ] rossington to stick to the bottom of the jar look so neat [Music] here's I take the glove and you're just going to push it down around the edges towards the center you're doing a cold room that's good rosin a clean glove and just like that now it looks like that [Music] with that's hard to see but yeah that's how that comes out when you end up doing that push it down it comes out real nice and clean looking perfect for grams or so it's upload a bird [Music] all right so I gotta move my dad station over now I'm not pressing it back over here well I like it Kiyo is : grab yeah you can do with parchment - I have a little bit more control with the glove I feel like and it rarely gets sticky but parchment works to a more sticky stuff I will use parchment I'm gonna go grab a hoodie real quick [Music] [Music] whoa [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] whoo my tears my eyes [Music] Oh [Music] oh man the big dads always get my nose my eyes [Music] Oh [Music] about three days away from the harvest yeah we're on day 54 honestly I think I could pull them down tomorrow or the next day I want it probably gonna go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] today's Thursday tomorrow's Friday yep I'm go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] five six out of the gate 58 [Music] [Music] I got some pictures of the plants I haven't even posted to Instagram yet pausing to share them with you guys real quick [Music] [Music] turn down the lights already this whole side is just [ __ ] Mileena should be up here these ones dried back a little bit too much almost too much but not too two months still prosti of [ __ ] 12 cars black out there my Spade going over there [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's the current status in the Guardian you know just like oh my flesh for usually you're about seven days it's that but you know [Music] I had issues this run just like Ross Leafs his issues because he's in cocoa they're harder to detect early and so he faced the consequences of the buffering that cal-mag provides in coma cocoa I wasn't in at nursery iam so I was able to turn my issues around a little bit faster but you know basically what I'm saying is you know I had issues this run and the crop is still coming out pretty good so next run you know those issues will be corrected I'll make a video covering the issues that I ran into this grow and how I plan to correct them and I'll throw it up on the patreon hopefully you guys can learn from some of my mistakes you know I talked about on the show doing your own research and shape one of the things I researched if I should have used top-down broward rivers and when I talked to mango tech Abadi he told me to use two gallons per hours to avoid clog and that's what each use is but then I ended up getting water channeling that is too fast on the float and I cost a lot of issues I never really fed high enough of an ECE to have the easy build up nor did I ever push the plants that hard to cause them to have any lockouts it was all because my irrigation was wrong from the get-go with the water swim [Music] are you taking off right now that's one of the changes I'm implementing is not only am I going to get rid of the 2 gallon per hour but I'm going to go all the way down to like a point 3 gallon per hour dripper that could eat drawstring and stuff up here so yeah that'll fix a lot of issues right off to that that I believe uh Charles and pastor [Music] that Daffy got me hired balls rolling in on me now [Music] oh my bad I look here looking up and showers my phone [Music] there's no broad my issues going on in here all it is is either a they were different cuts or they were microclimates right he talked about the water channeling so you know phosphorus deficiency can learn to purpling stems and the plants that express themselves differently also has purple stems where I was the ones that didn't have the red bugs didn't have purple stems so I think it was more of a microclimate issue water channeling issue causing different uptake different nutrients and it just got exacerbated due to the lockout because of the water channeling so next one I'm doing is with wedding cake and I should be getting those clones in about two weeks so I have about two weeks to prep get the plants chopped harvested and everything I'll flip them right in the room that they're in right now I'm basically going to push the tables to one side of the room and then I'll go in and use a light rail for this up against the wall and I'll cut down on the one plant out of time and hang it on a trellis hanging from the ceiling and then I'll just hang all the plants from one light all right [Music] when my moustache hairs on the know it wouldn't happen I got trim my mustache geez so yeah basically just go one light at a time right down hole lights worth of plants hang them go to the next one cut those down hang out on a different trailer that's there the next one so I'll have three trellis nets hanging on the side of the room I'll have to retry this netting on that side of the room so after I cut down the whole left side of the room and those plants are hanging up there on that left side I'm going to disassemble the tables and walk them out of the room and then I can push that whole other table completely over to the middle of the room hang up all those buttons on the back side of the room or wherever in the room right and then basically I'll be good to go I'll get everything hung I'll turn off the shaker fan I'll just keep one of them on probably maybe turn it down to low or something and I'll just have to DEET you and AC going in there I'll be able to scrub down the you the four by twelve that's in there now scrub it down and get it reset and start making my adjustments to the room while I wait on my new 4 by 12 American Girl products they're probably they told me it was going to be issued early June like June 8th or 6 but they might be able to get it in sooner so I mean worst case scenario the room will be down for about three weeks while I wait on the new table but I'll just match all the plants on one table while I'm doing that perfect and then when I get my new table in I'll be able to go ahead and transition the plants over throw up my trellis mats and pretty much switch so you know that's the plan and like I said I'll document all the changes to the room it said of everything that I'd be like want to document the changes and yeah my keeper fee no cuts from honest genetics should be here in the next two to three weeks and solved a whole room full of wedding cake in there veg and flour that while I have a child my keeper he knows from our genetics and my new keeper you know caked up cherries wedding cake crossed with cherry something f3 I'm going to do the three-tiered setup but I'm waiting on him to send me the updated invoice for the new poles and as soon as I get those I'll be able to set it up and I'll have pretty much what I was thinking of doing them what happened to rekey poofy nose and I could basically put all of them on their own tier if I wanted and then have clones next to it or I could just put all the moms on one and then since I'm doing two tables at a time I'll just pick you know I'll have two tiers for clothes you know cherry cookies have three thank you thank you thank you I never remember like my keeper he knows from honest I don't remember what I was are either blue hurricane 27 crossed with white sunrise for the blue lion keeper and then scarlet sure is chocolate frosting crossed with something I think [Music] I trust my man on his genetics he tells me yo this is a [ __ ] you should run for a hash let's fire fire fire legs all right now you got it [Music] like I remembered it enough to purchase it and you know that's all that matters now that's all that matters now I need to show up in the garden [Music] so stoked I have I'll have the blue Hawaiian which is gonna have exotic super crazy unique blue Terps it's gonna be highly sativa dominant as far as the high goes and then the truck not the truck cherry but the cakes of cherries that's gonna be my cherry Fino right there so I'll have a blue of a cherry and then I have the gassy out of scarlet shirt so it's gonna be dope [Music] this is real the kind of light that I use for clowns are right behind either the raging raging kales and I actually got sponsored by science LED yeah so I will be getting now raging candle LEDs probably twice a year during two biggest ways that I do and it couldn't be [ __ ] dope it can really know and then every other month or so I'll be giving away a bunch of science LED swag hats ashtrays shirts things like that all be put on there grower spotlight on their homepage pretty shortly here I have some pictures that I have to take for them and type up some some information and what else asked me to leave to help them do research spectrum tuning and hash production so I'll be doing that so and then also the big thing I'll be an authorized reseller for their lights on my webpage as soon as it's up in a few days so as soon as the page is up I'm going to try and get them on there and I'll be able to resell a life through my page so that way you know they don't do they don't do coupon codes like people in the industry you got to use to coupon codes because of for flex and all that but what that does is it makes it so that you can't sell that product in brick-and-mortar stores anymore and in the hydro industry almost need brick-and-mortar stores still surprisingly to you know expand and survive because still a big commercial facilities go through these hydro stores and you know direct to these manufacturers a lot so they don't do coupon codes they're like let's say they offer a 10% discount code here in California right and somebody purchases a light from you know from me and using my promo code but they're in Oregon or something and or somewhere else where they maybe don't charge sales tax and now not only are they getting the 10% off but they're also getting like seven or eight maybe taking even up to 10% off of that because of no sales tax right whereas if they were to purchase it in the store you know the store would be able to make a profit but in order to compete with that price that they would get you know from using the coupon code the brick-and-mortar store would basically have to not turn a profit so it doesn't work out for them to be able to give people who coupon codes stacked as representatives of the brand so instead I'll be able to be a reseller and then just a very very small portion of the profit that they would make from that light will go towards me instead so I'll be an authorized reseller and then basically helping do research and you know passing that information you guys like I have been this whole time so anyways this is what we're working with they bought this is delicious delicious it's called cookie dough and it's amazing [Music] I don't suspect this is gonna last long you won't need a code to let them know who sent you because you're gonna go through my website to purchase they're working on other programs like referral codes and things like that but [Music] yeah I guess I should keep this on camera so people don't think that I'm like lying and I say I got a grandfather drive here we did well today it's real I wouldn't had a couple more but honestly you guys want to get jars of the grape Cosby and literally all I have left of this [Music] that's it but in this drawer it's maybe maybe seven grams six seven grams of the grape Cosby I think the other jars been scraped empty already yeah scraped empty great cause be gone on that one and then the hell a Koosh cake [Music] there's like maybe two to three grams to scrape out of here [Music] and this one I think is scraped completely empty yeah there's maybe like point two in here it's empty so there was 70 72 grams of the La Push cake and 60 grams of the Cosby [Music] but every time you come in here you [ __ ] promotin be real oh no no no who was it last time it wasn't beaver oh it was your boy the other one that's not good Bernhard that's who it was last time [Music] about your ass sorry yo for real alright here's the funny story that's how you guys are quick so the reason this one got called rape Cosby because [Music] my wife and I dabbed it and she got so [ __ ] high off of it it was like she got roofied like straight roofie I could have done anything I wanted to so I was like mother kali shake great cosby it tastes like grapes and knocks you the [ __ ] out like you did this it was between grape Cosby and roofie colada you know think of work 12 but you guys got to make sure you do it right [Music] it's great cause be like that lowercase G Capital are [Music] all right let's get [Music] a little credit given

a you write for [Music] oh here it is [Music] [Music] that's not it either I have like a lot of different files in here that I have to go through [Music] that's three lighting maybe this is the right here number four [Music] okay yeah here it is and as this little my everybody [Music] alright I'll go ahead and get this uploaded to YouTube right you know [Music] I'm kind of done editing these I'm just gonna start uploading the RAW files and if people don't like it they can kiss my ass I don't have time to edit them together anymore that's why I put the PowerPoint how I did you know if I do the PowerPoint I don't have to worry about putting an intro and all that into the video it's just boom okay boss [Music] alright crap dude my science for plant nutrition are a cool description I'll edit that later now don't care playlist crafted science done no it's not made for kids don't have to restrict [Music] monetization please do [Music] public [Music] boom what is instant premiere oh [ __ ]

Greenjeans was sooo Oberto 11 seconds 8 seconds that's called your video will premiere what's uploading and processing finished as well as the hundred percent uploaded is 95 percent process I have no idea how this is going to look for you guys I don't know how this works I've never done this before it is [ __ ] top-down so we're gonna check it out oh my god dollars people my DM right now [Music] all right you guys let me know what happens on your end when this is done hopefully I mean it doesn't take forever right now it's an remember you two processes videos one definition at a time so the low definition stuff is going to process and then like for whatever and then 720 and 1080 [Music] my phone right now it's just doing the load F [ __ ] the standard definition version we'll see whatever the [ __ ] back [Music] I'm really curious to see what this does though man that was such a good [ __ ] good [ __ ] episode and then episode 5 I'm glad we took a break because we were really [ __ ] burned out both of us and we needed a skip a week we came back and we didn't even have a PowerPoint or anything but it was still an amazing discussion Garrett jumped online from science at levy and he just [ __ ] to talk about what we wanted to talk about which was great just you know [Music] we just talked about troubleshooting it was [ __ ] awesome you know he get his perspective on things like walking into like a huge commercial facility and how you would troubleshoot their [ __ ] to figure out what's going on why certain part of the crop might not be doing its good versus another part things like that so it was really cool to get his perspective because you know as far as lost leaf goes he's a commercial facility but he's a one-man army and it's a small commercial facility it's the size of a house basically a one-story house and so and that's that's no diss whatsoever [ __ ] it's amazing what he's doing I wish I could be at his level but in the realm of commercial grows it's relatively small so you know his perspective is one and then Maya the home grower is another and then Gary brings a whole different perspective being that he's kind of more on the large large scale commercial and so it was really cool you know and go with it so unfortunately during this whole Cove 8:19 thing all of the HD recordings for webinars are being limited and only being allowed standard definition so this is not going to be best of qualities for the uploads that are going on right now from the webinars and there's nothing that we can do about that so you know [Music] check it on the

"zVQruAIpxWk": "[Music] welcome to wheat entertainment and we love talking about grandy flora strains and this bud is something called yada da and it's really a unique looking bud but it was crunchy dry when i got it i opened up this bag and then i set it down and now it's even drier because i think i got this thing i don't know three weeks ago a month ago it just sat in the back i don't know why i didn't review it but i didn't do it so today's the day for yada da and let me load my little scooper into vapor cup straw i've already got two in here we're gonna add the third then we're gonna tamper and we're going to stick this down in the vapor cup then we're going to talk about yadda da yada comes in this bag and i got this at cookies maywood i got this at the apples and bananas drop down there i ran down there they held that for me and there were some comments on wheat entertainment so i grabbed it when i was down there and this flower has 26 thc and people are asking for the package date and uh so i'm going to give it that but to get that date i need a magnifying glass because my eyes aren't so good anymore so this is the package manufactured it is 9 29 20. oh no wonder it's so dry it's been in this bag for months right and you know what's crazy you would think that they're saving money on the jars right so at least they would give us some kind of moisture pack in here so these flowers when they come out of this bag are more fresh so let's say i got this the beginning january was harvested three months before crazy just crazy but anyway it's not about the dryness i don't wait for that so even though i note it that has nothing to do with my ratings my ratings are all about the something something and everyone's got their own something something that they're looking for but what i'm looking for are heavy flowers with focus that could grin me out i have to stay active i have a lot of responsibilities have to take care of i need flowers that can let me do that now i'm also a heavy hitter so a lot of the flowers even though i call them focus flowers they could stone you to the bone but it doesn't necessarily do that for me but certain ones do like the couch lock flowers but this isn't about catch lock i'm not looking for those type of flies this is about focused flowers that can grin me out so today it's jan dada turn to get the review we're looking for the best well let's check it out so you can see that's about amount a time it takes for vapor cup to work you can see that right there that's the terpenes the cannabinoids the water vapor and the oil vapor you can see it condenses right on the straw it takes about a minute and 20 once this cup is hot and also a lot of people have vapor cup so make sure your cup is hot if the cup is hot you need less time in the chamber if it's a fresh you just start it up you're going to need more time in the chamber and that's one of the things when you get vapor cup you got to learn use but i love this thing this thing changed my life but today it's about yada da so let's check it out yada da by grandiflora at 330 degrees out of vapor cup let's do this again so this flower's got a light og taste with a pungent pal but there's much bigger pungent pals than this one but it has it and the pungent pal it's i'm gonna say it's something like the chicken wing you know when you go buy chicken wings you smell it it makes you kind of like the ammonia taste people say ammonia but if you try vapor cup i'm going to tell you it's a pungent pal this flower took me a lot of flour to get stoned actually but it definitely got me stoned this flower's strong enough but not super strong and i thought it was good so what did i rate yada da i'm looking for the best and this flower you know at first i'm saying it's not strong enough but i used a really lot of it i used up half an eighth on the session i mean i really used a lot of it and in the end the feeling was actually kind of good it wasn't heavy it wasn't you had focus or didn't have focus i would say it was like a cruiser a little bit i wish it personally would have been a little heavier this flower gets an 8.65 which means it's a good flower if you're not a super heavyweight yeah it's a try but for someone who's a super heavyweight this flower may be not strong enough for them it was good but there's definitely better out of granny flora if you want to get a vapor cup this item right here and i'm telling you instead of smoking your flour up and joints get one of these things that little bit of flour that i put into this cup can last you 10 minutes and stone you to the bone i love this thing makes so many opportunities for use i love it and you can see it at vaporcup.com if you want to see my favorite picks you can see them on wheat entertainment.com that site's just getting updated right now it's going to have my top 100 strains in la out of 1500 strains i tried this is my journey i'm looking for the best thanks for joining in if you have a tip for me leave it below the video i'm the doctor i post every day but sunday it's my day off party on my friends [Music] you", "8t9CY2PyGK0": "all right peace and riot cannabis academy we are here we're doing a little concentrates 101 vapes and dabs i'm excited about this one you got to kind of put those together because in reality what's inside the little cartridge that you get as there's concentrated you can buy them you know i think in half grams grams at dispensaries and things like that is a concentrate yep i mean we've broken one early on in our and we'll get into that there's a lot of times everything from um is the most basic kind you know make sure that you're subscribed and you have notifications on um by doing that you'll get all the kind of cannabis academy updates at least i mean we've gone over almost all the basics now we'll start getting into guests guest speakers stuff on cbd i mean just all kinds of great things on it um i have to take this down just seeing a little thing on the corner of my eye yeah i'm like oh my eyes [ __ ] it's still bothering me like i could like i've been looking forward to getting into this one since we've been doing yeah academy because i i have a big huge debt so what it is is for everyone that doesn't know because we do forget sometimes it because we do this all the time and it's something we medicate on first of all we're not telling anybody to go and do drugs we're not advocating the sale illegally or anything we're talking about something that is recreational and medical legal here and we both have cards anyways prior to the legality so but we're just saying um this is wax crumble shatter dabs i mean really you can go on and on i'm just trying to associate the names that people might have heard how these things are all made the different levels of them that's that's that's weird [ __ ] man that's i go i'm way more into that one i want the one over there and like which one's strong i want that one yeah yeah how much oh that one's only thirteen yeah no no no no no go up go up higher tier diamonds not yeah you're definitely here i you're definitely a top shelf shopper i'll give you that one i like yeah yeah i like to have once you start really nailing in you know we'll get into that here in just a second the the really terpy profiles you enjoy it's really hard to avoid that and so when you want to get to those specifics you end up having to aim at that time and the terps are for like the land i'll give everyone the layman because i mean yeah i tell you what for everything everything i get into detail-wise you can just jump in with the lavender that is the flavor on the back of your tongue and the nasally like piney look there's a hundred different kinds of terpenes and it's any group of hydrocarbons that produce a certain type of flavor and different different terpenes not only deliver different flavors but different smells different effects and and so you it touches the back your nose some of the famous ones for those of you that are like well what's the term i don't even heard of terpenes before you haven't haven't you didn't even know it sometimes it's in the name of the strain you're smoking if it's lemon og it probably has a lot of the limo lean terpene in it which has that sort of lemon and a citrus flavor and smell to it and that's where you get that that terpene versus taste profile um so concentrate's been around forever yep forever so as far back as as um uh 10 000 bc in china they found um a hash keef mixture which was believed that they would take a bunch of sticky sticky wheat i had a 1990s cali they would take a bunch of sticky sticky weed and they would take a bunch of the keef and they would coat their hands and keef and then they would just rub the sticky sticky buds between their hands like this to all the trichomes would stick with the keef and get this layer of this sticky trichomes um the the trichomes are the sticky little parts and i'll get into that again in a minute too but it's the outside of the bud and that's where you're going to get a lot of the thc content and keef is usually what's in the bottom of a multiple stage grinder it's all the dried parts of that that's fallen off and it's the little crystals that have fallen off and the little hairs that have fallen off of the weed and so that keef is technically a concentrate in and of itself said grinder sorry that keep pretending to concentrate in and of itself but still i wrote it down but they would make that also there and so this this this hashish is is the first you know oldest form of the of concentrates it's been around for a while it's not a new thing but using science and technology we've really sort of perfected it and got into different options with it i actually early on in my years of smoking weed ran into concentrates something called hunting oil back in and so and they often call it co2 oil now they used to just take a normal cigarette and just roll it in this oil and then you would just and it was thc oil that's all it was uh basically they were like making butter for edibles instead using an oil like basically co2 oil is used by using co2 and pressure and and you can then squeeze basically out you can as if you're it's a reverse vacuum you know so instead of going into space where there is no air and then something explodes you're basically using pressure to squeeze out and i remember smoking being like what did he give us and he was like it's just it's just cheese he was like no i would never but but it's pure thc oil and if you're not used to that you're [ __ ] up now i was smoking flower that looked like it came over between rocks now there's too many two main kinds of concentrates and that's solvent and and solvent less or non-solvent solvent means you use you use something or usually a liquid but it can be a gas like co2 you use something to separate the the thc from the weed plant if you use something besides water pressure or heat then it's solvent-based if you use propane butane co2 alcohol like rick sampson oil rsoll super famous been around for a long time it's what they give the the little girls with cancer to give them to stop having seizures if they're epileptic you know it's rso oil we've done we have to be honest you can you can dab our soil you know it will puncture it in the face it will absolutely puncture the face now here's how they do rso oil we're not going to break down into how they do each and every one we'll save that for the more in-depth episodes but just to throw it out there how a solvent one works rso oil is a solvent-based um concentrate and this uh well what they do there usually is you'll get a large mason jar and you'll fill it full of weed an ounce or so and then you put alcohol in there and and the most common one is you do something like everclear and then you close the jar on that you give it about an hour or so and you you a little bit of agitation squeeze and strain and then you take this alcohol mixture that'll be a lot darker in color caramel in color that's dumped out it's evaporated and then what's left over is now your rso oil it's hard to judge exact concentrations amounts is it back bro not only is it back it is solely flying directly into mine just messing with you that one one fly that comes around only when we record and only so the rso oil that's an idea that's an example of solving the fly i am sorry i wanted it was mocking that's all right it was looking at my face most of your solvent-based concentrates are going to be between 60 to 80 percent thc now most of your solvent lists the ones that aren't using that process contrary to popular belief are actually usually equal to or stronger than the solvent-based extracts your solvent-less ones are just the heat water pressure those real real basic ones so like um the most common is when you just take like uh just heat and press you take a little weed put it between parchment paper two hot plates squeeze them together you squeeze hard and out comes the the product right which i want to do like immediately yeah getting that breath um so when you're also looking at these concentrates and you're hearing like the percentages because like i said i i want everyone to be safe and i have to break it down for like the moment by the way if you go and you're getting the vape pens um you're not getting the same the delivery of it isn't the same as if you're superheating it through a any kind of torch or nail or anything like that it's a predetermined electronic temperature coil so you're probably getting in the 30 to 50 range of it's stronger than flour that's why i included it in concentrates you're not getting the same don't think if you are pulling on a pen all the time and that's your way of of you're getting a you're getting a preset dope and then a friend gives you a dab rig that that is going to be the same as this because it's not it's not it's danger it's danger if you think that yeah that's the difference because it's like having a pill and being able to lick the pill every time you want to hit that's your vape pen or taking a pill and crushing it down and being able to snort that sucker all at once which would be the same which would be like would you don't condone in any way shape or form drug use or abuse telling you to smoke weed or concentrate or just given information it's a it's an over exaggeration of the the difference of of extremity between the two classes um oh you got it too so the i might have said extremity oh yeah that moment yeah i didn't i stuck with the extreme no it was good but i would have i could have i saved i might even talk about it i'm just very medicated at this moment so there's the different ways of consuming the concentrates you can either put some on your weed bowl if you're gonna have a pipe that's got flour in it a lot of people will take some of the softer ones like i like like a sugar or a crumble and you can put those down because those have a lower taste so good too does it have a lower uh temperature point tastes so good but usually often even then you won't get the full release of the terpenes in there because you're not reaching that appropriate boiling point or reaching point to release that um each one that whether it's solventless um which is just like i said the heat and water which is your bubble hash your hash your keef your rosin that means you're not using anything but the heat water pressure to get those notes now that's i'm like i need i need to have okay that's okay um um but i like this a lot of the more common ones a lot of the more common ones that are able to produce a desired texture or temperature point or the ones you usually see in the dispensaries a lot more often which is your wax your shatter um your butter your diamonds let me ask you you're gonna get those for a layman like maybe a little advanced layman why is shatter the one thing that's just lesser quality what what is that like just the most basic extract or so and i don't know actually it because it goes through less of a refining process it has more overall plant source material still in there taking up space for what would other be pure thc just the basics yeah it's a really it's a not as refined level of concentration be clear if you don't have don't dab shatter either you will get just a start small and no matter what type you're going to try start with the size of a half of a grain of rice that's that's the tip okay if it's r oil not i suggest you start with the size of half of a grain of rice that's the same that's recommended by uh other people you can check with uh potguide.com i'll put a reference there so it's not me saying it i'm referencing that you according to potguide.com half a grain of rice half a grain of rice of any concentrate type if you're charting it if it's your first time trying it you start with a half a grain of rice size yeah it'll get ripped and that way because you're gonna that's a potent amount no matter what type it is if you haven't tried it yeah us it seems like a half a gram right right because i do i'm thinking about i'm like no no i remember i remember starting off when it was just a tip it could be a little bit just on the end of the tool half a grain of rice would last you three different hitting sessions yeah in the very beginning correct because in the very beginning because we used to i the first way i did it was with um collector collector with a metal chip with a metal tip and it was silicone and so you would just kind of touch it to it yeah no half a grain of rice you're going to be ripped good luck yeah so start with that no matter which way you're doing it you know always start small start safe um start with the flour i honestly would say just from experience you do that little amount but i wouldn't start on shatter you can get pretty ripped that stuff's kind of dirty sometimes i would go like a real low end like crumble batter like get a lower i mean really shatter you can get you got to be careful with crumble because sometimes if it's a really soft crumble and it falls apart really easily huge hit you'll like something like a straw yeah or or the nectar collector is working but if you're stupid inhalation little device and you go to hit that thing like all right so this is it looks like a block let me go ahead and just take this little block and you go and do that and then all of a sudden a little chunk breaks off right up the straw and the whole thing's burning on the way out your necks are collected you can get a much smarter either i would say a scoop into a good i recommend an e-nail yeah but if you especially especially if you're a beginner then hit us up find somebody with an email learn how to use an email the reason being because you preset the temperature in a device and then it it won't burn it because you know for a fact it's going to be at that certain degree it's usually a little digital handheld corded i have one cough because you're not usually burning the dab too much and the reason he says that well not don't cough there's two main types when you're doing dabbing or using a rig which is like a a bong or a water tobacco device um if you're using one of those then you usually have the buckets on the end and you preheat them with a torch or using that e-nail which which electronically you know targets a certain temperature the two ways to do it are hot dabs and cold starts hot dabs usually use titanium nails because you can get them extra hot i mastered those without meaning to master because you just started that way i used to just not knowing everything and just dump everything in get it hot drop it put a spoon or something over the hole and try to survive longer take a second hit before it cools down bubble and lay on the ground like why do people like this like and then be higher than [ __ ] for the next while and then eat a bunch and take a nap and then wake up and do it again yes and i was like this isn't that great but it's so rough on your lungs instead you start by putting the material into the nail or the bucket on the end and then you preheat it slowly from the bottom until you start to reach that desired temperature and then you can hit it just as it starts to reach that temperature and so you're getting it right as it falls in the perfect green zone that has lasers to really to tell temperatures on his bangers i have a terp laser yeah you know how i tell my temperature okay i'll show you a couple different a couple different temperature devices yeah the laser gives you like it's like a rangefinder in golf except for heat here's that one this one right here oh that goes right in the camera i wonder if that [ __ ] with him he has more too i like this one do we have to put up an epileptic warning now at the beginning for the lights and the lasers i did it like 30 times did you i think you had i have used it you absolutely have to put a warning i don't know you have to put it yeah yes think about the other people that watch our stuff for the medication information and then some of them to treat seizures and you're like shining lasers and lights i'm just saying it looks super cool it did look very cool hurt my eyes so for all of you they got to see the warning at the beginning you're welcome uh he's an [ __ ] and that's why peace and right so the other option besides the gun epileptic warnings did you show that uh it's got a i don't know it's it's all lit up there i guess it's too bright it's a laser beam i can't but it shows a digital readout of the temperature you know of of your hand or whatever it is you're shooting uh 93 degrees apparently from here it says it's not supposed to be used on human skin because it's not accurate enough um and that's why but it goes into the plus or minus 10 degrees but you're using this to read in the hundreds and you know 560 640 320. so that's that one the other one here when it plugs in the wall this and plugs into different types of ends or bangers or nails whatever i'm using in that device and this is the email temperature controller this one this one specifically has a timer that will run up and down and then you can preset the temperature and it'll hold that exact temperature for this one particularly up to 90 minutes it'll also increase your medication budget twofold because it's on all the time and you're like oh well done i might as well just put a little bit more in there oh but oh yeah but on the reverse of that i don't think it does i don't think it does much because you waste nothing none at all you get every little bit oh no when it's both of us around you you get that almost every little bit at the exact temperature but i think we're trying to one-up each other all because you can just be like hey let me get a little a little bit more in there yeah yeah no it was it's fun though it's definitely worth the investment it's um so we definitely enjoy having all the support that we've had with the cannabis academy it's important to we always you know safely imbibe because now in the places especially that it's rec legal yeah a lot of people don't know what the [ __ ] they're doing i do want to also add just as a side bonus vaping or dabbing the dabbing vapors versus consuming flour smoke you know uh if you were to smoke a blunt say versus hitting a vape pen the the chemical makeup of of the vapor versus smoke the vapor sticks to your clothing less it it's so that the stink isn't sticky versus when you're smoking out of a bowl smoking flour and sometimes that scent will linger with you um and so you have a fleeting smell it's a very fleeting you'll walk something like cotton candy yeah what who's who had weed candy right now who had chocolate but it's gone and then it's gone yeah well sometimes you'll catch like if especially if you if you can show up right afterwards but no that's so much smelly like and the difference is that it's not a sticky um vapor so it doesn't stick to your clothes and then carry with you like the smoke from you know just no and this is just like a my side for beginners those vapes are just a different beast i don't really think they affect just be careful when judging tolerance just based off hitting those vapes i don't trust a lot of their potencies that you don't know these are hundreds of cartridges made i'm just saying i've smoked just like joints and bowls with people that rip vapes all the time and they get torched because flowers are a little different high or they are always on the vape and they think they do an edible no edibles different than everything don't ever forget that and like the concentrates outside of a vape honestly don't i just think of all the people we've gotten we have absolutely wrecked 20 at least people buy them attempting long-term smokers a lot of them too yeah not we don't ever do it maliciously but people come over we do a lot just don't i consume my normal amounts unless you're with someone that knows what's going on yeah i'm i am a seasoned concentrate user and if you have questions on it i mean if you like concentrates or the vapes obviously hit like and comment on what your strain is through the vape because i like those tasty ones like some of them that actually taste like like sugar cookies and yeah those are so good and that's gone and then we'll get into the specifics of you just sit there how do they make cookies how do they make diamonds birthdays how do they get a white cookie right here batter resin rosin um you know what's live versus not live because you'll see that sometimes it's your adverse lives you know so live is when the the weed itself is actually fresh frozen so it preserves the trichome you can hear that at some point too and one of the bud tenders trichomes are the little white kind of bulbous hair there's actually three different kinds of but think of them as as size small medium large but essentially trichome is greek for the word hair it's the little hairy um collections of thc that hang off the the plant you usually can't see them with the naked eye very much unless the plant is really potent otherwise you zoom in with a camera or something and look at them in a larger picture and some really cool stuff some really cool pictures i love the artwork you'll see out of those trichomes because it just kind of looks like a a whole different alien world when you're zoomed in on those things um they're great but so the the live process stuff is the live process is thought to preserve those trichomes a little bit better and so when you're actually turning it into the the end product you know the better off they start when they go in the more potent it's going to be on when it comes out oh whereas where you're just doing like rosin it still helps making the live rosin which is remember rosin is the one where we're just using heat and pressure to squeeze it together so if you start with the cold frozen wheat that you cured by by freeze for you know freeze drying it then you put that in between the hot plates and squeeze it out then then what you're working with is more potent than the solvent ones which broke it down a little bit to extract it whereas this one didn't get broke down you've preserved it the whole way through the process and so you're gonna get as potent as you can get based off of the flower you started with so if your plant is really potent then a live rosin will get you the most potent concentrate you can get out of processing that down into different forms like a wax which is using it to you know using a co2 or butane to separate it out and then turn that into a material i remember again some stuff years ago years ago the guy was making in his garage wax and it would be on like he drove me off into it probably on the [ __ ] whatever got me high and i would just i would just it would be wax paper you just pull it [ __ ] open and just be the stringiest well before it was garbage he was making it with like his feet or something look before there was but it was [ __ ] stony i'm glad you said that that's to bring up the fact that before they had little glass jars they were super convenient or little silicone jars some people prefer the silicone because you can hit right out of them you don't have to worry about is this glass or just dense plastic plastic one out there like oh this glass or plastic you don't want you don't want it oh no it is oh when you're here yeah i've taken a definite so chemical yeah i usually i usually real good about using glass jars and once i get a good glass jar just kind of scoop everything into that one um instead of using a plastic i don't get out of plastic you know the higher end stuff always comes into them higher stuff comes in a nice splash jars usually a ceramic jar something something nice we're bougie i'm a pain i want you to ever he has one that lights up yeah i do i have some that light up that's not i'm serious local local arizona dispensaries here yeah they have and i like their containers because they have a slightly magnifying lid on the top and then a little led light clicks on the bottom so you get a real good look in the container at the material without having to crack the lid and get a good peek at it you just okay that's looking pretty good i got about that much left you know and i like it that way and so i usually i reuse those often and just you know by the time i wipe them out i just throw another gram of something else in there um but yeah as far as store they didn't always have those so the original the original way to store your concentrate was the wax paper the parchment paper you know it's like a dirty diaper if it gets if it gets warm it'll stick both sides you know um so the benefit for that or the the way they'll say to really manage that is throw it in your little fridge i recommend highly keeping any and all concentrates you get of any form in the fridge the enemy of all concentrates is heat light and air and laying it on keep it sealed keep it dark and keep it cool and so you'll see a lot of mini fridges you can buy that are meant for like dorms that you know they fit six to ten cans of soda perfect mine so tell you it'll fit one case of beer you just well they're perfect little small fridges you know that would fit four or five of these but they're great for stacking your little containers in i have over here like a three-quarter sized actual full fridge that i can just keep like rows and of stuff in but that's because i dab a lot um that's a factual thing it is and with my with my little babies growing over here i plan to expand on my total amount of personal use i'm excited me too we always appreciate everybody jumping into the cannabis academy stuff um man there's so much to take in on all of the two if you have questions on any of the concentrate concentrate stuff definitely you can comment it hit like look forward to our concentrates 102 when we'll get more in depth to each one and beard 710 up on instagram really if you have a question or you know anything in regards to any weed content or the nooch 710 both of us i i have some depth if you want more layman's terms i'm the guy to hit up then if you want like well then you just do that you want to hear more about hydrocarbons then i'm the guy yeah i'm not um i mean no i'm not saying hydrocarbons at any point in conversation right now yeah right now yeah make sure to we'll keep the um cannabis academy stuff coming up uh when you're subscribing you have the notifications on you'll get that in your uh little annoying red thing and then and uh give us some ideas on what else because we're gonna start moving on to more advanced ones and if you think we missed some basics let us know put it in the comments we've had we've had a couple of people put them in there so if you think we missed something drop a line thank you he's been staring at me the whole time the whole time do you want anything you guys should say goodbye say goodbye to the fly everyone say goodbye", "tNKG6YoPU5Q": "the only always good YouTube welcome to another live stream just hanging out taking some dabs tonight and the children really got too much [ __ ] going on waiting on a few parts to come in over the next couple of days so that I can go ahead and finish putting together the irrigation for this veg setup and once that comes in then I'll go ahead and put together the irrigation and get some seeds popped and start to show on the road those of you that saw my Instagram I posted the start of a DIY project to make some mini humidifiers one for each tier in here they're gonna be perfect for you closet growers or if you have a bed rack similar to mine small space you don't want to put a big bulky humidifier in there and like we talked about before there's not a lot of options for just straight power on power off humidifiers that are a small and portable as what I have in mind so anyways we'll get into that later tonight I cleaned up the old sexy gin tree rig I got the broken pieces of the grabbes Labs drop down out of here so all good and this still fits snug in there with no issues even though the you know tiny little bits of the bottom broke off no big deal so got the banger all cleaned up opaque bottom this is the deep dish third email from 710 coils so cake bottom if you guys need a discount code SB and v-love will get you 20 per 12 percent off of $40 or more so before we get fired up tonight though actually gonna go ahead and empty this because like my dad's to taste fresh super fresh so I got a little reclaimed jar here and all I do is take a little heat to it tip it over yeah I don't want to burn it I just want enough heat to facilitate a little bit of flow all it takes once it starts to flow in you can remove the heat just off grip on down it stops flowing you add a little bit more heat and keep the flow going that's it boys ask me how I do that my reclaim or whatever would I do with it this is it looking like dab some of y'all will probably take this reclaim came out very nice very clear it's not ugly and dirty it's more like distillate than reclaim this deep dish really makes it so that you're not sucking down a bunch of nasty reclaim into the neck of the banger you only get like vapor so I'm getting what I'm getting out of this is like [ __ ] almost like true distillate not the black nasty [ __ ] that's left at the body of your banger that people suck up from hitting it too hard and then that's it and then it's nice and ugly looking for a second and voila now this just now seeing you guys popping up in the comics what's going on guys and he switch over to live chat so I'm not getting trolled yeah I'm glad I did not break that [ __ ] I was thinking about oh I've got cuts on his hand okay rinses alcohol off oh Jesus [ __ ] that hurt I just did that inside - ah big well [ __ ] like cut right here like a paper cut from earlier she's five and I ain't gonna switch huh got my ass Kavi slipping right now bueno I don't need it to be alcohol doubt and all that I could if I was being super super picky but now that's good like that and we got a bunch of you claim in here and we'll keep collecting it until it's almost full and then I'll deep carb it and all and people say you don't have to deke our brief claim that's not entirely true we claim is not only a 100 percent d card sometimes you still have to hit it for like 10 or 15 minutes walk around a club which is dumb in your mouth stick map and take your tongue out see if I can't go switch see I wanna [ __ ] tell me what where do you see my where do you see my a girl beat at the max when you see man let's see if he burns himself ladies and gentlemen I usually don't so that means now would be a perfect time for it to happen now would be the perfect nope not today [Music] and I did it all safe like that because it's on the coils on right now that could have been bad so get my left [ __ ] hand clean real quick right now [Music] good enough for now all right yes chronic ale from Pizza port baby this is an amber ale it's delicious [Music] got my kuzey from la couleur saying people have made my reservoir chillers or my reservoir covers I'm such an [ __ ] I know you want to see this delicious pour don't you shout out to my man CV pouring it up on IG with an super super craft beers yeah buddy is it all fit in this [ __ ] little cup almost almost there's like a little cut horn cut hair left in here [Music] not my [ __ ] delicious let's go cheers you guys thanks for hanging out tonight you guys up to how was your weekend what did you do what's up Netflix you recommended [ __ ] I don't care about right now this jar shall we get it shall we Wow so I found out this run's changed on me over time so when I'm smoking this about three or four days ago it had a very nice sweet candy taste to it with a slight slight sour taste to it today I hid this [ __ ] not 405 I changed my temp up a little bit it tasted like I just got done eating a whole bag of lunch when I exhaled it blew my [ __ ] mind how much the temperature change and a few days was able to change what happens to the flavor profile [Music] you're already a DAB in oh my god you stop [ __ ] around [Music] [Music] [Music] look at how clean that is [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] the other runs it seemed like they got a little bit more of a intense candy flavor it was more of a just like a sweet taste with a slight candy you know but now it's like just straight bag of candy [Music] [Music] Wego somebody said they were already on their second dad I'll catch up don't worry I always do man what a great year whoa [Music] [Music] good well you guys I guess I'll fill you in on the projects I got going on yeah that's how I am dog I got that but I can't be any heightened ads I like them nice and low temp no I'm saying I can come back and hit it in 30 seconds if I need to yeah dad sneezes getting me to man it just depends on the Turks right all right so this all right we pull up Amazon right quick so the first project is the irrigation in here I got the pump in I showed that last time it's a share flow pump with the filter built in we're not building but there's a pre-filter on it so we're gonna be running this sure flow pump nice and small less than a hundred dollars and it kicks enough psi to run pressure compensating drippers like in my flower room with my big leader pump I could even run that room off of one of these isn't that crazy less than a hundred bucks if that liter pump fails I'm just gonna pick up another one of these and throw it in there it'll do the job so the rest of the connector pieces that I need to put this together are coming tomorrow and it's basically just a bunch of elbows in random fittings did I get into caps I got in caps yeah what I need to get now is more irrigation stuff for the big room so I guess I'll pull out the whiteboard I know I don't need it basically right now on each tray I have one irrigation line that runs down the center of the tray right and at the end of that I have my flush valve slash pressure gauge setup this was at the end of every line right what I'm going to be changing for the flower room now is instead of running the single line down the center of the tray I'm going to run a big u basically or a big circle all the way around the tray right so the line is going to come to the the table or someone drop from the ceiling down to the center of the tray it's going to go to a tee and it's going to basically go out to the sides of the trays elbow run down the length of the tray and it'll have the drippers along the length right for the plants on its respective side and then at the end instead of each line just coming to an end right it'll come back to Center and that's where I'll put this so what all I have to end up doing is I'm going to get across and basically what will happen is with the cross it'll be like this right so at the end of the tre imagine down there is the end of the tre this is the lateral flush valve it's going to be right in the very middle so I think here guys this view you can see this whole thing right imagine this is the end of the tre that's over there this is the end right so it'll sit like this boom right in the middle Wow this pressure gauge and then I'll have this lateral flush valve so that way every time that the system pressurizes it will pressurize all the way around faster more evenly and it just works that better way as a manifold and you have drippers and then i'll still be able to have the function of flushing the entire system out by having this in between and at the the lowest and so everything will flush down here and get fresh newts at the very beginning and it's also air relief so when the system fire is on any air that might have gotten into the system will escape from here too at the end of the line but I have air relief valves in various places in the plumbing in there that is one thing that's going to change that I should definitely show you guys shout out first off Roz rosin ink alright that's the homie Miami mango because I I learned a [ __ ] ton just from following his pages and going through and reading every post reading every comment every [ __ ] response like you have to read the comments you guys are so much gold hidden in the comments woodsheds my dude he does a lot of custom 3d printing stuff for me like my driver coolers science LED of course for my lights glob mob I'm actually wearing their shirt right now more rosin ink and hydro racks that is root riser you guys that is the company that does this vedric anyways nothing with that so here's my system in here all of this is going to stay the same I don't need to do anything in here this is a net afem disk filter that I have pre pump I'm going to throw in an additional filter post pump that'll be probably a leader filter and I'll throw that somewhere in here that way I have that I got this project box and I I just realized when I brought it in here I don't know how all that's gonna fit to be really really real like what I might end up doing is I might end up putting this and this on the outside and then putting everything else inside if I can fit these on there I will but I don't know it's gonna be tight maybe this these two and these two we'll see I might be able to pull it off but it's cool it's got space inside so those will be mounted on the outside and then I still have all this space inside so those will easily be able to fit and I'll be able to fit at least one power strip so we'll get all that taken care of I'm gonna go ahead and clean up some of the plumbing in here I don't really need to do any real design modifications other than I have different style air bleed valves for up there right now you can see I have like the Jane right there the ball ball type air relief valves kind of like the floor flex ones and then I run a hose down here in case they get stuck open it just goes back into the reservoir those suck ass I'm gonna switch those out for the plunger style which I'm gonna have to put into a bushing to fit into that top piece up there so that whole black piece will come out and I'll screw a bushing into the adapter and then I'll put the plunger into the adapter and it's a way better error relief valve I won't have to run hoses back they don't fail I got a reinforced put some more strut up and run all the clean lines and all that once I mount all this troll master [ __ ] in this box I have wire covers that I'm going to put up and shorten all the wires but I got all the [ __ ] new irrigation pretty much ready to go right there and the cubes floors been cleaned everything is pretty much ready to go I'm gonna go ahead and change the orientation of these lights tomorrow so I have like basically three continuous bars running the whole length of the room and those also are going to get their orientation change better spread Schaeffer fans are gonna get moved down about a foot and a half each that way they can put their main airflow underneath the fam instead of above and the canopy it will get all the airflow just you know basic [ __ ] cable maintenance type stuff that I'm gonna get to button up and create you know the control panel and [ __ ] for now and then I'm just waiting on the other four by twelve from American Grill products should be about a week or two now and then I'll go down there and pick that up come back up put it together it takes like 20-30 minutes to put together by myself and then we'll be ready to rock but first the beans are going to be going in here and I'm just waiting probably by Wednesday or Thursday I should have this entire thing done and I'll be able to go ahead and clean and sanitize do some IPM work prep these rooms to make sure that we're not gonna have any issues and then I'll pop beans probably over the weekend I'll germinate and we'll be good to go and then that way the following week I can just pretty much watch him you know do-do-do-do-do-do oh man I gotta catch up to these [ __ ] comments now all the 35 Pablo 31 I'm not a towel you are can of this way holy [ __ ] three grand a month four bills do you think he need all them lights oh yeah I mean all those lights why have the side lights when there's what kind of question is that that's like asking why have a girl suck your dick plan you could have two girls once I can dig in one second your boss oh oh [ __ ] mmm I think I'll take both please the sidelights they give you so much more like direct light to so much more surface area and canopy and it increases your yield significantly with very little wattage it's not hard to get too much light I just agree with you there you can you can you can get too much light real easy especially with LEDs which is why it's so important to measure your par or your ppfd right that's why I got the troll master part of me here which is integrated with those lights so it can automatically dim them down to the specific ppfd that i've said to please that's fun it beefs up the lowers the meds and the uppers and depending on your growing style how much you do foliate how tall you grow your plants etc etc they can really really be beneficial because some of that stuff that you maybe would consider chopping before will actually give you the same size knows is what you're getting up top and really I don't use it to concentrate on the lowers I use it to concentrate on the mid-to hires that way if you're getting in that side light they're not going to stretch as much anyways right and then also you're hitting the majority of the the bulk of the canopy that you want to hit alright than eating the potatoes you don't want to beef up the green beans you want to beef up the meat and potatoes you know I'm saying you know larf just depends on how you how you grow really right and know you don't get too much heat before you get too much light if you're growing with LEDs it's very easy to have light burn before you have heat stress any advice about your little tips during a soil grow so it depends I mean yellow tips could be a bunch of different things top of the plant or bottom of the plan so I'm watching the chat over here I realized we had 45 people in here cheers you guys if you if the tip sir yellow like at the end of the leaf just the end of the leaf if it's a light pale yellow that's usually a sign of a little bit of burn coming on or or it's the whole leaf is like looking pale it could be a deficiency but if your leaf is not like pale then it's most likely that the start of nutrient burn it's at the top of a very young plant then it's most likely a nitrogen deficiency that's starting as your plant is requiring more than it's getting older sounds like you're getting an immobile nutrient deficiency so I would start increasing well what is your ppm or sure EC you know whatever you're measuring it in right [ __ ] it let's do [ __ ] troubleshooting night we should just start doing that because people ask me questions anyways we might as well have a dedicated night or I come on here pour myself a beer have couple dabs and we'll just go through the questions and I'll just ask one person to help me queue up the questions we'll do it through zoom webinar actually you guys can put it in the Q&A boom our third of the Leafs are yellow then that sounds like it's probably I'd have to see a picture let's just put it that way you could post a picture to the chat right now with the Google photos link if you'd like and I can check it out and I could tell you what I think it is it's really hard to diagnose based off of people's innate descriptions so every light in that room is an LED oh [ __ ] warns in here sup Lauren gabs you know what we're gonna take it down because mr. Warren is it two times [ __ ] SB and he giveaway winner lucky month guess where he's got like a [ __ ] Lucky Charms guy shoved up his ass or something oh [ __ ] kill it [Music] [Music] but I forgot what I was about to pull up on my phone oh nothing I'll take down laptop this runs is wrong so strong straight up so oh you guys are talking about topping I am super excited for this next girl one of the first ways that were the first way I grew was from seed and I had the pleasure of learning how to manifold train and oh [ __ ] man I can bonsai [ __ ] out of my plants you want to talk about [ __ ] vegging for a while I used to veg my indoor plants for minimum three months in deep water culture my plants were [ __ ] monsters but I would just veg him in spirals I would top him I would end up with like an eight headed manifold and I would spiral all the heads if you go back on my youtube videos you could see when I used to run HP s with an LED in the center I had two plants that took up a 4x4 and one of them was a c99 that I just spiraled the [ __ ] that [ __ ] was dope but yeah I'm excited to be popping all these beans because beans give you the the word is escaping me the equal growth on both sides right your nodes are gonna be nice why my brain farting on that simple word what's the word sub DC shoes I appreciate the donation my man hashtag DC shoes everybody gabs up for DC and woman on this one oh yeah you guys see how hard I'm ripping those globs and I'm not getting anything down the neck but pure vapor look at that nice ass reclaim / distillate vapor we're getting down there yes it is delicious you renounce your mad dabber crown to me [Music] you know a lot of the times what makes me have to call mid DAP is the fact that my saliva or mucus starts accumulating mid dab due to all the Turks and that post nasal drip just instantly makes me want to like gag and cough [Music] [Music] fool wiggle bigger [Music] clear my turf caves using all that [ __ ] out of there you do it put a Terps I ain't gonna do it do put Turks I ain't gonna do it so when did I start Spanky Pablo for the compliment on the rig I said gingery recycling the taste profile is like sweet candy runs and depending on you know what temp you hear that what your ramp up is on how he eats up all that [ __ ] yeah that's what's in my Amber glass here this is what I always use first is dark crystal I only use a little bit alight so right now to see if I can get a little mark off network the glitter the drip drip yeah I like all my little opals there's opals everywhere and then I haven't even pulled out the bad weather the dabber I use you made this custom to go with it carp cap diverse little nasty dirty right now but man [Music] Thank You loan yeah so I started growing pretty much at the end of 2014 beginning of 2015 I started growing in a 4x4 tent with the 600 watt HPS deep water culture and 110 gallon tote with two beans from I love growing marijuana calm who strain was gold leaf cross of alka poco gold in something else I think but it was [ __ ] huge I got quite a bit I got like 21 ounces or some [ __ ] it was cool we should see some of the the other pictures from that that I didn't post on Instagram some funny [ __ ] yeah I'm [ __ ] high [ __ ] man that [ __ ] me up so here is my first grow it was bad but in that at all I ended up washing some of it too and then pictures of my first wash it's not so great you guys not so great and I think I just washed popcorn Doug's I'm trying to see where's that uh affordable picture the top cola was [ __ ] like I [ __ ] you not I waited I'm just gonna show you cuz you guys wanna [ __ ] believe me that I thought I waited [ __ ] huge man look at that [ __ ] crazy are the roots on them with a [ __ ] dog I was running GH newts back then one plant just completely triumphs the other two [ __ ] bananas I was doing stupid [ __ ] with the [ __ ] look at that monster bugs on that thing what are all the dots on the the pieces of leaf that were trimmed all the way Oh uh-huh yeah I was I was pretty happy with that for the first girl it was a [ __ ] it was a hairy string uh-huh I thought it was partly because of how I grew it but I reached out to I loved growing marijuana and they said I did good there was definitely some things I could have done a lot [ __ ] better holy [ __ ] but man that was fun and I used to pop seeds and put them straight into neoprene collars and into dwc I know there's probably quite a few of you guys that do it but now I just wait until the taproot got long and just slide it straight into neoprene and go straight into help onyx or DWC that [ __ ] was fun ladies through experiment so [ __ ] much like it ridiculous ridiculous how much I used to experiment but I did it because I knew like if I got all my experimenting over at the beginning then I wouldn't have to worry about it later on I would be profitable you know what I'm saying cuz if you don't fail first and you just have nothing but success you're gonna get ahead of yourself and you're gonna trip on your own feet but if you trip on your own feet enough and you figure out all the [ __ ] kinks and you learn how to think ahead on certain things you figure out what works what doesn't work what scales up well and what doesn't right like aeroponics was amazing for me but I learned after experimenting with trying to run a whole room with it it it doesn't scale up well it just does it um you know it just doesn't scale up period there's no other way to put it I'm especially with the way that I was trying to do it and my limited resources it was strictly like reinvest reinvest reinvest reinvest so that I can constantly add more equipment add more plants add more space you know and I [ __ ] you not it just took about it took till about a year ago for me to get to where I was able to have this amount of space to grow and this is like [ __ ] man I'm like a hermit crab in here it's like a shell on my back it's not very big when we move and I grow like and I build a new facility then I'm gonna have like a couple of rooms you know but this is just I did once oil grow yeah hydros where it's at you guys here's what I'll tell you about soil I used some cool RIT sub cool I used his 2017 super soil recipe I cooked it for about two and a half months and then I did a piss-poor half-assed grow under like some [ __ ] tea vibes or something and that I maybe finished it under C mhm I didn't give it a fair shot at all and the results were actually really [ __ ] good given the fact that I didn't even bother to water it that much you know let alone give it teas or amendments or proper light even you know the terpene profile on it was something I grew gorilla glue number four it was something that I had grown numerous times and various hydroponic setups in the rooms under different lights and nutrients and I was very good at growing it and so I ran that and the Turk profile was completely different hold on I got to plug in his GoPro and it's like okay there we go the Turk profile is completely different it was less on the gas side and more on the chocolatey diesel earthy side it had like a chocolate ty type vibe to it and it was [ __ ] delicious and I could still taste you know the the Turk profile that I get from hydro it was still there but it wasn't the dominating terpene profile wasn't the main thing it was just chocolate II earthy a little bit of gassy just but really chocolaty and sweet and it was it was great um the effects for the high I can't say that I noticed anything you know noticeably different but I hadn't had any hydro to do a side-by-side comparison so um I would run soil again but if I were to do soil I would probably be pretty conflicted on whether I went with a potted system or like just doing beds I think for me if I were to do something in the soil I would dedicate just one room to LEDs and soil and it would be beds I would have to do beds and it would be kind of like a living soil otherwise I don't think there's a point you know it doesn't have to be like oh no till bla bla bla bla bla na man like you know working a little bit but it doesn't have to be you know I don't know see that's where I'm like inflict it on f2 because I'm not a soil guy so I'm not gonna be hardcore about one thing or another i'ma look at it from an analytical perspective and be like hmm how can I eliminate some risk here cuz there's a [ __ ] ton of horrible pests that you can have it's hard to fight them with being sterile so that's out of the option anyways if you're running soil there's no point in being sterile right but then again you can run just microbes and like like what's the [ __ ] mosquito microbe killer that I run whatever that is I forgot what it's called but you could run Mike and Vinnies and nematodes and just specific predatory mites and other insects without it being like a complete no-till living soil you know you could just be very precise with the things that you use to minimize your risk of other bad pests but it's just such a gamble man I am look in my room now and it's like I let it sit after-hours for a whole week without cleaning it and I still didn't even get it bugs in there you know what I'm saying because of how I built the room and I don't run dirty ass soil so I run rock wall and I run I ran my last friend sterile because I wanted to give it a fair shot I will never do it again mark my words all my years in all my different ways of growing I have always ran hydroponics with beneficial bacteria and microbes right and I've done it in various ways I've handed it to the reservoir not top that'd only I've done foliar applications I don't wrenches and dunks then all types of [ __ ] right and I was like all right let me try going sterile [ __ ] that I don't care how white your roots are there is a symbiosis that is happened in the evolution of this plant between these beneficial bacteria that exist in the soil where they evolve that and it creates a terpene expression in the plant that is unavailable if you are sterile hands down if you compare a hydro grower whose recipe is exactly the same - the microbes one go sterile and one goes Bennie's you're gonna have different terpene expressions the room everything can be exactly the same it could be the same exact bro you know what I'm saying I could decide not to apply beneficials to half of my plants next grow and the difference would be apparent and the growth the vigor right the health of the roots and just the overall final product the terpene expression would be different right with the potency be different I've never had anything tested for potency I will going forward but before I have it so now that I'm getting ready to pop seeds I'm probably gonna have a [ __ ] ton of testing done you know but we'll see we will see but Vinnie's absolutely absolutely absolutely will never run without them yet this lady here is yeah and [ __ ] snapped out as different environment will give you different chirps yeah but the environment would have to be vastly different to for that to happen you're talking it would have to be probably a delta of a continuous fiber or more Fahrenheit you know you're talking a room that has proper a/c and ventilation versus a room that doesn't yeah you're probably gonna have some different terpene expressions they're absolutely Stoney's [ __ ] right on the money on that different immuno responses from the plan are going to trigger different terpene responses right I like my best results always came from running this super brew that my mentor taught me I have the recipe say it was the latest recipe he ever gave me before I he told me dude you're like smarter than me now you're better than me now you're doing more research than me now you should just go and find somebody else or start teaching somebody and I was like [ __ ] really you're not gonna teach me anymore your tricks and he was like dude just pick a girl and [ __ ] out now you got it I was like all right I haven't talked to him since then other than an occasional hey man how you been but it's been like probably two or three years so let me see what was up [ __ ] was I gonna pull up that run Scottie super booth thank you I looked back at the [ __ ] thing and you had it all right let me pull up my Google Drive it's a venti recipe it uses multiple things alright I'm gonna give you guys the [ __ ] lowdown recipe right now you choose to use this if you want or not here's the [ __ ] deal the recipe is you're gonna need great white gh subculture M G H subculture B aqua shield or hydro guard GH floor blend and a sugar source you can use molasses or a hydro sweetener or turbinado you're going to put all this into a makeshift bioreactor so basically it's gonna be cool between roughly 60 to 68 degrees super bubbled and stirred or through a water pump right but if you use a water pump that's going to heat it up over time therefore you need to be using a chiller or keep it in an environment where it's still going to maintain a cool enough temperature and it needs to be light proof recommended to use RO water but any non-chlorinated source is okay everything is going to be represented in teaspoons per gallon you're gonna use a quarter teaspoon of great white per gallon you're going to use an eighth of a teaspoon each of gh subculture in and be 1/8 each per gallon and eighth of a teaspoon right then you're gonna use anywhere between 10 to 15 MLS per gallon of your hydro garden or your aqua shield all right that's your bacillus okay it's gonna keep the bad beneficials from growing okay depending on how warm your tea mixture is you're gonna want to use more Irish hydro garde right if it's warmer use more it's cooler you don't have to use as much you're gonna use one ml per gallon of flora blend which is a pre blended tea now this was all created back before Monsanto and blah blah blah and GH was taken over and sold and blah blah blah right so if you have issues with GH then find alternatives to what these are just look them up see what they are and then find alternatives all right but for a sugar source you're going to use a half a teaspoon to a teaspoon it depends on the bricks of your sugar source and the temperature of the brew the warmer it is the less sugar you need but the less time you have before your tea expires alright so real quick quarter teaspoon of great white eighth of teaspoon of G H M eighth of a teaspoon of GHB and then 10 to 15 MLS of hydro garden or aqua shield one ml of flora blend and then 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of your sugar source you're going to mix it all together and put it into your bioreactor or whatever you have to brew it let it brew for 24 hours so that it has time to replicate itself into useful proportions aka colonize doing that will make it last much longer and then depending on the temperature and how well you keep it mixed and hair rated it will last anywhere from 6 to 14 days it should always smell natural like the earth maybe a little bit sweet if it starts to smell nasty like something is rotting or foul it's bad scrub the bucket between fresh batches and you'll also want to scrub and clean the air stone for each fresh batch to the bacteria will colonize and form what looks like dark brown or black spots it's not a bad thing it's just colonized beneficial bacteria unless the smell is bad the instructions for use you can apply to all stages of growth including cloning which I used to do I would add some into my cloning mixture and that's all I would add and with maybe a little bit of cal-mag and my clones would have roots within four to five days I [ __ ] you not so you could apply it seedlings clones veg or bloom you add 8 to 10 ounces every 3 to 5 days and with fresh bedding on what you're growing and I guess right if you get too much of a buildup of beneficial bacteria colonies and your reservoir or on your medium you're using too much and or adding it too often and you shouldn't have to scrub your air stone in your plant reservoir until after the grow if you're adding it to like a DWC reservoir you only need to add a small amount if you have to scrub your air stone you're adding too much it shouldn't colonize in your reservoir like that now the way that I would apply that is I would apply that to rock wool via top feed just 3 to 5 ounces per cube at most probably once - twice a week hand-fed that way none of it is in the irrigation system none of it is in the reservoir the reservoir remain sterile running Athena AG Plains or any other hypochlorous acid and/or a citric acid to keep your irrigation lines clean and your mineral deposits from building up so if you run the proper amount of maintenance which would be maybe like three to five MLS per gallon at most of like a hypochlorous or citric acid I would run the hypo versus a citric right you can still run beneficials in your medium and that hypochlorous acid will not be enough to break down and kill those microbes but because in rock Woollett inert medium and you're pretty much feeding until you get runoff every day you need to make sure that you have colonization on the roots at least so you always feed those microbes right at the top of the crown to maybe one to two times per week is really all you need and those microbes will continue to colonize on the roots and even though the medium is being fed and somewhat flushed as long as you're not over watering you shouldn't be pretty much wiping out the beneficials they should still exist in the medium to an extent and recolonize every time that you reapply but they should never be completely wiped out but you keep it out of your irrigation and out of your reservoir your reservoir doesn't get messy or nastiest a sterile stays clean you know and if you want you can even do like a once a week dose of like - peroxide like medical grid right like maybe one ml per gallon two MLS per gallon once a week once every two weeks it'll help knock down any issues that you might have with a build so why is it that stony you're saying that molasses doesn't feed microbes why is that a big misunderstanding [Music] [Music] [Music] this isn't growing 101 what's wrong dad [Music] you don't like the tea lesson [Music] you were talking to a cat well I think it just depends on how much molasses you use and what type of molasses I think it's important to note that you have to use an unsupportable asses if you're just using regular molasses a lot of times it does contain sulfur right there's different types of molasses and there are certain ones that are specific for brewing teas but you can get so like a Blackstrap so for free molasses is what you want and like I said it's a small amount depending on how much you're using right how big the batch is what the temperature is what would you recommend as a better so brown sugar fish and brown sugar so how is how can how can a food source be too strong I'm not being argumentative at all I'm being inquisitive because you're the organics guy I'm a hydro guy my usage with microbes is very limited in comparison to ours so we need to be clear I'm coming at you in a humble inquisitive way please tell me how oh yeah TAC wavy [Music] [Music] window shopper I got a flash it out of here on me and sulfur I'm just yeah I'm just curious so oh you just heard it then go to molasses and goddammit you was just talking out your ass then [ __ ] outta here with that oh no I'm just repeating somebody told me funny that's funny [ __ ] say dad I'm [ __ ] bidding two times it's only ten [Music] [Music] oh I'm sorry I'm high three [ __ ] high [Music] dude nobody's holidays so you're you're new to the channel I think so stone you like this channel is all about breaking stoner myths and forum [ __ ] right like obviously there's great lessons that have been learned from anecdotal evidence and experience passed down and experienced through multiple growers right but at the same time there's something to be said for verifying that via science and and developing an understanding for it right so that's basically my channel is about breaking through the [ __ ] and finding out the whys how comes what Fuller's all the [ __ ] right and figuring out if there's any scientific actual you know evidence behind it and then you know that way I can research it I can understand it and once I have a firm understanding of it then I feel confident and speaking about it but until then I never speak out of lane you know I always become things that I feel like I've studied from a scientific peer review like scholarly sources me verified study do you know but there's a lot of stuff in cannabis that hasn't had no scholarly peer reviewed you know research studies on and there's not journal articles on a lot of that stuff is only available outside of the US because there's censorship in the US and you can't reach it because it's you know it's blocked off right you have to look to the Netherlands and a lot of places over these that are doing research israel [ __ ] like that nobody saying you're talking out of your ass don't you know don't take it the wrong way let me finish what I'm saying let me finish what I'm saying so what I'm saying is we welcome an open conversation here we welcome multiple points of views we welcome the debate right like I tell people not every disagreement has to be an argument right you can agree to disagree but you can still have an open discourse about it and try to seek some type of understanding or if if all else fails even if you agree to disagree maybe you walk away with something to chew on and then later you experience something that connects the dots for what that person was telling you and then you're able to understand it in a way that makes sense and then you're able to use it to your benefit right so everybody here is very open-minded we're not argumentative we're super chill and low-key positive vibes only we welcome the conversation so don't feel defensive or like nobody's coming at you because that's totally not it everybody here just wants to learn everybody here is eager learn the facts and learn [ __ ] that's gonna hold true not [ __ ] you know what I'm saying we want to be able to verify it that's all so don't feel like nobody's coming at you dog it's not like that this isn't that Channel you want to through some nugs all right you guys are asking me about what the dry and the cure you guys realize the dry and and cures done already right completely done yeah man it's it's hard to pick up the vibes sometimes when people come in here it's all gonna do it what's up magic have ad for micro crocked what do you mean micro crops you mean like having like perpetual like multiple harvest in the room or I'm an owner in the [ __ ] all the time you guys other [ __ ] everyday when somebody comes in here and tells me something I don't know and I'm so happy to learn it I'm so grateful to that person because I do so much research it's like sometimes I feel like I know a lot but then when I speak to other people that grow from you know other areas right not even different methods just other areas and learn about the challenges they face I realized damn there's a lot of different perspectives for their [ __ ] that changes just depending on where you are you know I'm saying indoor-outdoor [ __ ] hydro lor soil it gets even deeper than that right the no-till [ __ ] guys versus the regular soil guys and still put bottles loose in there's so many different avenues man it all depends on what lens you're looking through that's all that matters right I just try and absorb [ __ ] information from every angle I can and bottle that [ __ ] up in my own way and then just use it whatever way I see fit that's that's honestly if you can learn from everybody I see too many people snub their noses up at one way of growing or they'll [ __ ] it and look down on somebody because they have a smaller grow or they grow in a tent man if you can't learn something from everybody then you're a dumbass I'll say that again if you can't learn one thing from everybody then you're a dumbass so if you don't listen to what other people have to say then like here it's shutting off your own sources of information it's stupid people gotta learn how to be more open everybody so [ __ ] defensive in this day and age everybody so quick to be like you're attacking me or oh you're gonna get offended or oh I'm offended it's like and y'all got a desensitize and [ __ ] sinning yourself [Music] but you guys wanted to see what's up with the hardest so let me change my battery real quick I got a fresh one right here what's my person 12% should be enough hell yeah but anyone can [ __ ] it up so that's right so my garage is a little messy right now because of the harvest I got to call it dumpster to come so I could throw away everything so check it I did it dry for about seven days and then took it all down and cut it straight into here so that's some runt that's some run this is from the TfL lighting side the GoPro doesn't okis well but this is 507 we got a bunch in here and then I think all the raging oh this is a raging push side you can see the frost on the bottom of the bag of the ragin cush it's just visibly there more right there you can see all of that [ __ ] look at that that ragin cush puts out some [ __ ] trikes man there any on these [ __ ] TfL a little bit but not as much I'm telling you man the blue spectrum in the rating cush holy [ __ ] it just puts out these [ __ ] trikes I think I need a bigger box it's coming on the 27th until then it's Tetris baby before I start this next girl I swear to god I'm gonna finish the outside of this wall that's okay it's so [ __ ] early one in all the vapors all right okay I'll show you guys the room it's still on reset mode I'm not done yet I already come in here I did I did way earlier I'm excited to run these these are new this grow these are the six by six by four Jumbo's these are their new ones to extended to cases summer run those and these are new drippers last time I ran to gowing per hour because mango tech said those would be the best because they don't fog that's what he runs but they get water channeling so I'm around those oh my god my battery is dying so fast as I stand here and talk hold on maybe all right if it dies I'll be right back all right battery's out a hundred percent what Dad Matt which one oh yeah another piece of the puzzle came today for the bed you set up told you guys the condensate pump would come if you guys want to know what is the best condensate pump in the game the best bang for your buck it will pump probably as high as any home grower needs to go this is it [Music] diversity CP 22 okay this thing is awesome got an alarm indicator it shows running indicator it has an auto shutoff if you want to hook it up to a condensate if this thing fails it'll automatically shut off your AC so that it doesn't flood or your D hue so it doesn't flood it has a built-in fan so that doesn't overheat if it runs constantly it has like a 20 foot head I think which means you can lift it cuny 20 feet up in the air main rain or main only alright so we're gonna have another lesson I see this is the moneymaker right here they're gonna be probably underneath if I feel sick underneath I can always slide the tent up a little bit by moving the casters but it'll fit under the tray oh my god [ __ ] quarter inch away that's okay I could fit it on the side of the town and secure it right here but either way I'll get that set up underneath there now to pump out the old nutrients so all right here's the thing with the Jumbos there's it's not always bigger roots of bigger fruits so crop steering you guys that are familiar with crop steering good if you aren't familiar with it basically all it is is the way that your environment is climate steering you can't cross steering without you can't crop steer without climate steering your environment dictates the demands on your plant and in the way that you feed and water your plant will help tell the plant what type of growth it should do there's vegetative growth and there's general growth generative growth is basically flowering or producing flowers and buds and mass right you can encourage either type of growth based on a your environment that puts the demands on the plant and then be your irrigation usually you want to lower ec smaller volume of feedings more frequently and then when you go into generative growth you want to have higher volume of feedings right so you're going to be feeding a higher shot size basically a bigger shot size you're gonna do it the same frequency almost a lot of people have the misunderstanding here's a golden Nucky this is like the biggest golden nugget I could give you about crop steering when you switch to flowering a lot of people think that you want to go from feeding frequently to infrequently so you would like cut out some feedings it's absolutely not the case you still want to see the exact same frequency because the plants only going to want to more so if anything you're going to add additional feedings right but you're going to stop feeding sooner right the same veg you feed up until the last hour right and then you turn off the lights I mean you turn off your feeding and the lights go off an hour later right that's bench in flower you're gonna want to turn off your irrigation like three to four hours and before your lights go off so that they have a larger dry back overnight right in between irrigation cycles I won't give you the magic numbers but you're only looking for a small dry back overnight you're looking for a larger dry back and flower that's what's going to tell the plant hey you need to be more like a generative growth and you're gonna give it larger volume feedings you know every feeding so it's gonna be like boom I'm gonna grow I'm gonna grow I'm gonna get water only at these feeding so I'm gonna take it in and I'm gonna grow you know that is that is crop steering so when it goes to these cubes they're going to allow for faster dry backs right which basically the plant is gonna it's gonna suck up more it's gonna consume more there's gonna be a constant spike in that EC going up and down as these irrigation events happen and the dry backs occur in between shots so that's going to encourage more of a generative growth and I'm actually probably going to cut down my veg time or by about a week to two weeks and the yield will still stay the same as so long as I still run the right plant count and the right lights you know this next round I'll be running from seed seeds are automatically more vigorous plus I'll be doing an undiluted herb natural soak and then prior to popping them so they're gonna be even more vigorous because of all the special [ __ ] herb natural right usually on average they say seed versus clone if you start a clone versus a seed you imagine the same amount of time and flour in the seed is going to be more vigorous in yield 15 to 20% more in the clone I've never verified that because I've never done a side-by-side but I can say for damn sure I believe it I'm grown clones versus seeds multiple times and seeds are way more vigorous their growth is funky and the word is still escaping me am i that spelling when things are equal side by side I'm a watching chat I don't know why I'm [ __ ] forgetting that my hair got long I have to adjust my hat oh [ __ ] ah anyways I've dropped enough golden nuggets for the night I'm stoned his [ __ ] my fear is done and I want another one so I'm gonna call it a night and I'll catch you guys on the next year", "YiN_hpgTbmc": "what is up youtube it's your boy it's your scottish government for 204 coming at you with a quick video man uh before we get into when this video is 21 plus 18 plus it's a cannabis video you know i'm a medical marijuana patient of new jersey so but yeah we're gonna get into this you know fast and easy it's gonna be a pretty quick video we're gonna i'm gonna show you guys what i bought take a dab and then in the video after that give my little review on the wax and stuff and then in the video i'm gonna then go to sleep because i'm [ __ ] tired low-key and by the way i've been dabbing this for a while super terpy fire but anyway it's called durb and terpes uh e85 jet fuel x uh jeffy x biscotti one ounce jar ounce of concentrates but yeah it's definitely crc but i don't mind it it's really some fire bro to be honest with you the taste fire the effects of fire it lasts a long time so i did the spoon test because you know i like this first off i looked this brand up on reddit or you know whatever the urban terpes i looked it up it's obviously a black market brand and you know a lot of people were just [ __ ] talking about it but people who had it before said it was fire so i was like whatever bro i'm gonna just [ __ ] buy it do the spoon test if that shit's fake i'm gonna get my [ __ ] money back you know i'm saying so basically the spoon test is where you drop some concentrate on the spoon you heat up the spoon from under it a little bit until it turns to a puddle then you put your finger in there the wax and you take your finger out and you let it cool down for like two three seconds and then you try to like peel it off and if you could just peel it all off or your finger like candle wax then that's just fake but if you can or it's pine resin probably but if you can't it just smushes around then it's real wax and i did that and it [ __ ] smushed around like a [ __ ] i could not get that [ __ ] off so that was a good sign but yeah i've been smoking it honestly i've been getting high as [ __ ] so you know this [ __ ] is fire like i'm not nobody it's just like any other wax i bought it's fire yeah this is my first day smoking d9 like dabbing d9 in a while because you know i bought this ounce and i was like [ __ ] i'm about to buy this ounce and [ __ ] i bought the ounce i took like you know a couple dabs of it i've been dabbing here and there but yeah that's just definitely fire i plan on making some edibles with it tomorrow so you guys will probably have a video coming with me making edibles uh i'm trying to get this but the consistency is good it's kind of like the wax wax i've actually reviewed on this channel that like white looking crc obviously wax it was fire obviously some of the best wax i've had on my channel and uh it's kind of like it gives you like that it's like more like sugar wax than live resin i'd say hey let's see if we can get a close-up real quick on this try to get this one scoop a close-up let's get a focus man you know i'm it's most like 90 short crc which i'm fine with that honestly i'm not really worried about it being crc a lot of people don't like crc i'm not really worried about that as long as it's [ __ ] real wax you know that's all i really cared about yeah definitely [ __ ] the smell is [ __ ] insane all that [ __ ] though bro i'll give you a little look at the jar if there's anything in it by the way it's from this piece of paper because i i had to scale it out so i put it all on this [ __ ] piece of paper and that parchment paper i used to press a nug so it has so much [ __ ] plant matter on it and i got all the plant market matter on the [ __ ] [ __ ] so i was like damn ain't that unfortunate we're gonna dab that right there that's a [ __ ] glob take a little tiny bit out of there but yeah it's some fire though i ain't gonna lie to you bro it's definitely some fire i'm waiting to [ __ ] to uh make these edibles you know so let me show you guys what that means by the way 30 quick little uh you know still a little bit of wax on the side too dirty as banger i know kill me look at that is i don't know why it does that that's from the reclaim that i smoked out of this one time left to stay in forever you know so def oh my god almost [ __ ] broke it definitely gotta get a new banger soon bro but wow look at that that looks [ __ ] phenomenal i'm not even gonna lie to you got a zipper this let me know what you guys are thinking man did i did i just buy meth like this is not meth by the way youtube don't delete me man that was a joke but yeah like what like what the [ __ ] did i just no it's wax it's good it's fire definitely honestly off of smoking and [ __ ] like the times i smoked it you know today i'd say i would recommend people buying it by the way look at this [ __ ] carb cat bro broke just a couple minutes ago completely like just broke hopefully there's no [ __ ] whatever this is made of hopefully none of that i'm guessing glass or whatever it's not glass i don't know what this is hopefully none of this pieces gets into this that's what i'm really hoping because i'm not trying to smoke whatever the [ __ ] this is made out of all right anyway we're gonna hit this [ __ ] up we got the blazer we got the [ __ ] gt blazer lit up you guess a little look of it you can even see seems like and it tastes good though like that's the thing about it like even if it is crc which is like 99 sure it is it takes fire by the way crc if you guys don't know crc is just it's color remediation column column whatever it's called and it basically it's just something that people use on their wax to change some [ __ ] not like you know some [ __ ] that doesn't look too fire to some fire looking [ __ ] basically it's what people use to change the color but it can be dangerous if they don't like filter it right or something but like for the most part it's not dangerous a lot of dispensaries sell crc and pa you can [ __ ] look it up damn that [ __ ] takes fire though i know some of you [ __ ] out there smoke crc every day man definitely some fire taste i can't wait to get my other [ __ ] bro my d8 i can't wait to get that i got this [ __ ] really for edibles i'm gonna be making a [ __ ] ton of edibles with this at least two to three batches i'm hoping i'm gonna do one batch first see how it is do another match um dude i'm [ __ ] smacked man shhh my eyes up i thought it was like it was street still like even though now it's like reclaimed can i reheat reheated so many times still not a bad taste to it [ __ ] baked i've been texting and [ __ ] through this video that's the last dab before bed d9 man so [ __ ] bait tomorrow i should have a [ __ ] uh product review finally i've been waiting for these [ __ ] packs forever man it said saturday though it says saturday it should be delayed matter of fact let me check the [ __ ] let me check that right now one of them is in transit expected to get delivered at 23rd which is today so it's expected to get here today it's in transit that's bulk dusty so bulk dusty's expected to get here today delivered january 19th oh okay this is the loud house hemp loud house have got delivered oh now it's in trend all right that's different it was just in north so i was getting closer to my house this eye so uh highest elevation south florida is in trenton now so and that's expected to get delivered today damn i got so far that's bulk disney highest elevation south florida supposed to come today that's two that's supposed to come tonight rogue river labs is in trenton st is in newark still bro this is [ __ ] three or two days in a row now that rogue river labs has been in transit in newark you know but they updated it at 3am yesterday so this is two days in a row now that it's in north that's expected to come today so i got three packages that's supposed to come today i'm about to check to see when skye hyo's coming that's fedex that's supposed to be fedex that's two cartridges and then i got another package with the water soluble [ __ ] syrup and the uh another 10 jesus distillate got so many [ __ ] packs coming i got three of them coming today that's kind of exciting bro we're gonna have a big review video later on boys either that or i might cut it down into three videos i don't know we'll see we'll see i might unbox everything on the one video and then cut it down into three videos i don't know we'll see what's going on though let me check to see when sky higher is coming and then i might check to see if loud house had set the tracking number yet got somewhere ever since i [ __ ] started smoking delta 8 i've been ordering the [ __ ] out of that [ __ ] bro i'm done ordering [ __ ] this month like this month i'm done ordering anything at all online let me check sky higher real quick i'm [ __ ] bait man yeah this wage is definitely legit this is one second boys let me tell you guys when i'm gonna get the carts man i want to order some [ __ ] from harper city hemp but just not this month i'm not going to do it this month but i ordered way too much [ __ ] this month fedex let me see man this is the only package i got with fedex too scheduled to deliver it monday oh i just got a new subscriber shout out to uh discipline discipline is his name but it's with a z so discipline eight shout out to that dude man for just subscribing if you see this video shout out to you but yeah my uh so the two cartridges right now are in indianapolis scheduled to be here monday which is cool bro so that's bang that's two days today is saturday sunday monday you know supposed to get some packages today tomorrow i can go with no packages and then monday i get another package it's fire let me see what uh flavors i got real quick what strains i got from sky hello so i got i got a delta a thc cartridge i got bubble gum og and it's one gram and i got white rex cannabis derived terpene and i got this right here too actually if i can find it let me pause this guy and show you guys i'm not big on cards at all i don't smoke cards for real but i have this right here this was actually my grandfather's when he had him a cart that i gave him uh that i gave him that my homeboy filled with a whole bunch of uh it wasn't delta it was delta nine thc distillate it was a card that i watched mine you know it's the [ __ ] who filled it i know him he said he felt it would distill it dumped the nine so that's the only time he ever really used this [ __ ] but yeah that's cart [ __ ] right here i don't even know how to [ __ ] to use this oh you press like because you know i used to have cards yesterday i used to [ __ ] with cards five to six years ago back when they first started i used to use flavorx that's a real brand now you know all these fake ass brands are [ __ ] i used to get real cards they were like fifty dollars for [ __ ] they were four dollars for a half gram like eight dollars for a grand bro and it was flavor x and it was the old packaging when they was like really selling carts and [ __ ] like that was just the real shits man look him up i used to have videos on my whole channel before i got to leave it deleted even a tip had flavor eggs on it wasn't none of these [ __ ] ass see cell cards or none of that anyway boom we got that [ __ ] i can't wait for the car video bro i definitely have a cart i might keep one and i might give one to my grandfather but i'm gonna have to taste the both of them first to see which one i like because i can't just blindly give one away you know but oh i don't know what i did instead of blinking see that i don't know what that did i don't know you guys let me know if you guys ever seen this battery before i've never seen this before but got that [ __ ] we're gonna have some good reviews coming soon man that's what you come to the channel for his reviews stay tuned because that [ __ ] is coming tomorrow by the way reviews tomorrow hmm listen anybody in the comments who wants to cry crc i'm already knowing that it's [ __ ] probably crc man i don't give a [ __ ] you know because i don't i saw the video shout out to the customer 420 till i'm a fan of them but bro i saw a video of this [ __ ] throwing out crc wax i was saying it was garbage whole time if you go back to his old videos bro literally 80 percent of the city smoking is [ __ ] crc like bro what i couldn't believe it when i saw that video i went back to his old videos and literally literally everything he was smoking was [ __ ] crc you can look at it look at his old videos just look at the quality of the wax i mean some of it was straight up shatter and [ __ ] son actually you know straight up pressed rosin shatter and [ __ ] like that that wasn't all seriously but the live resident [ __ ] that he showed [ __ ] like that bro he had crc look you gotta look at it man i mean not every single video let's see i see but i said a couple little [ __ ] but that's what everybody bro uh and i'm not this is no dis to everybody i mean i'm smoking crc right now but there's a lot of [ __ ] i see smoking crc strange show or strange central i mean i've seen him smoke crc a couple times in his videos wrong g dab crc uh dab crabs in michigan or what's their names reclaim you know i'm not i'm not i don't have nothing against people with special needs but his name is reclaim [ __ ] that [ __ ] i seen a lot of [ __ ] smoke crc bro but you know it's it's in the wax community man it's there ain't getting rid of it [ __ ] like to make the product look a little bit better than it looks which is whatever as long as they filter that [ __ ] right what do they think boys", "UNWHow4VH3k": "well we are back we are back and we are pressing a quarter of moxie viper cookies okay uh this is i haven't i haven't pressed a lot of moxie uh in a while so this will be fun this stuff is ringing in at uh 26.9 percent combined thc thca we've got a 121 micron bag here and the crd 30 ton triptech rosin press is set to 180 degrees fahrenheit i don't use timers i don't use the gauge that's on this pump so please don't ask me how long i leave it on just watch the video and you'll see how long i leave it on for okay so this has been rehydrated with hydra stones and we're going to load this bag up hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there just a reminder if you are a medical marijuana patient in the pittsburgh area and you have dispensary flour and you would like to have it turned into gold please come and see me in penn hills here at the studio i do that for patients i press form for free that is a patient's helping patients initiative that i've been doing since 2018 never charge a patient to press their medicine for it it is important that patients get good quality medicine at a price that they can afford and i am trying to help in that respect so here is our quarter get this thing all put into a nice little package and move these lights up here and get this placed right where i want it to be there we go that paper of course anytime you're doing live stuff okay all right so let's get that out of the way and get this centered up where i want it to be get the light in there on it real good so you can see it get real close and put it right there all right here we go let's get this valve closed on the pump let's make some medicine there's nothing i enjoy more right now than just getting the best that this flower can offer and as long as you treat this plant with respect she will give herself to give you the best medicine that you can have much better quality than anything you will get in the dispensary as a concentrate solidness is definitely the way to go and rosin whether it be hash rosin or flower rosin is a step way bigger than any of the commercially available chemically extracted concentrates so let's just remember where the quality is and the flavor because this is a full spectrum extract and take terpenes and winterize it do all kinds of crazy stuff they just you just get the buds and the essence of them their soul that's the way i like to approach it so as you can see it's going to get harder and harder to see so i'm going to let this go now and start concentrating on this press i'm going to let that heat soak in for about 30 seconds before i finish get the full pressure i don't know if there's any big drops tomorrow for the weekend but i would be watching the healing center my tree rise all of those guys because you know how that goes friday if you get a big drop and if you're not ready to grab it online you can lose out real easy all right almost at pressure there we go that's where i want to be with it let it sit there for a minute i'm going to pull this shot back out oh yeah this should be fun so again moxie doesn't come out with a lot of flour they've been coming out with more lately and i don't get a chance to press much of it because it's usually at the high end of the price spectrum not a lot of patients bring it to me so i figured i'd grab some and we'll see what see what it does you know and there isn't a whole lot else you can do except uh try it and it goes into my database you find out how it stacks up against the other grower processors and the other strains that they're putting out so i'm just getting the scale ready i already have a jar make sure i get the tear on that first seventeen yep that's great okay are you ready you ready to see it here we go okay viper cookies what'd you give us oh oh yes oh yeah i'll tell you what take a look at that that looks mighty mighty fine to me so let us get that paper off of here turn off the i am done pressing unless unless there's a patient that comes over with something for me let me get the shot out and redirected all right a small blowout no big deal take my tools here clean a little bit of clean rosin off the end of that but like i said blowouts happen no matter whose bag you're using luckily they don't happen all the time so let's get this fired up tara and philip she looks like a happy plant this thing was coming off looking like it was made from washed flour uh and that it didn't just come from straight flour some of this consistency is very reminiscent of a lot of hash rosin i see being shown on ig gas rosin's fantastic it's just not practical for medical patients in pennsylvania because of our prices you know so pennsylvania and the medical marijuana program flower rosin is king of solidness because you can't get the good stuff good ash rosin at the dispensers they don't sell it they don't make it people who do make it aren't making it for the legal market so best you're gonna get medicine wise from somebody who can craft it immediately for you somebody like me who's doing flower rosin just like this gotta love this plant with all your heart to be good at doing this consistently you got to be having access to flour that is of amazing quality to get this kind of result oh this stuff came out so beautiful oh yeah oh moxie my good friend dave perlow gabe pirlo who is the ceo of moxie he and i have had a very nice relationship as far as his business ideas about doing solventless believe me when the feds lift the the lid off this whole thing and deschedule this plant you're gonna start seeing a lot more solventless on the market because it will be on the recreational side probably but you will see it moxie has always been a concentrate centric company it started off they didn't have the canopy enough to to sell flowers so all they sold were their really nice concentrates and their cartridges i love their cartridges liquid moxies melon wreck is awesome ellerange is fantastic a big fan of their distillate cartridges but their flowers always been kind of rare you know now they're stepping up their their production ability and now they're coming out with more flour which is really cool so let's see what we got for a yield and wow 0.61 well when you take away the 17 grams for the jar that is well that is not what i would consider an acceptable yield okay again my bare minimum acceptable yield is half half a gram per eight this comes out to be point three per eighth which i mean here's the thing though the quality is amazing okay and in terms of the look of it it smells incredible you know but there it is maybe i can get it you can see the better light i mean look at the quality of that there's no disputing the fact that moxie makes really good flour the problem is the flour that they make or that they grow doesn't have the wax and lipid profiles to make them a good candidate for solventless extraction via rosin press so always bear in mind that when you're going to buy flour you need to pick strains that work for you and you have to be willing to accept that you may get a strain like this like this viper cookies which looks to be amazing probably going to taste incredible uh but the yield is not sufficient for for me from for me personally it may be for you as a patient you may be a baller and can afford to buy enough eights to get enough of this pressed to make it worth medicating with it i tend to look for the higher producing strains i think this is an excellent strain i bet it's a great strain for the other uses dry vaping quote unquote um but for rosin it's one i would probably take a pass on personally but if you're seeing this and you're liking what you see grab yourself some dispensary flower and get on over here to penn hills and come and see me and i will do this for you too stay safe stay medicated be good to each other everybody have a good day", "lMqAvutmySA": "yo yo yo what is good youtube welcome to another live session getting ready to uh hang out take a few dabs do a lot of work all the usual fun stuff that we do here so welcome go ahead and get my setup going all right i hope you guys had a good productive week hope you guys are having a great [ __ ] friday i

exhaust fan i had to turn it on because i glued my table together and the smell is so [ __ ] strong [Music] um okay that's off oh everybody hitting me up for my runs but nobody wants to pay the price well i won't say nobody there's quite a few people that are but other people that aren't it's the people that want to resell my [ __ ] and make a profit why am i going to give you my hard work at a discount so you can make a profit just because because what because you want more no no no oh no that [ __ ] kills me what the [ __ ] is wrong with people anyways we're gonna get into this now here's the first thing i'm gonna do i'm gonna try to stir up this jar this jar is packed to the brim i don't know how well it's going to stir but i want to homogenize it get it all even so i think you can see that [Music] now this is the same tool i used to collect it yesterday so we'll go ahead and use this ocean you like that i don't even posting memes bro i just post funny [ __ ] [Music] um [Music] all right amazing [Music] it is so hard to stir this though because it is so full y'all look [ __ ] crazy in the comments y'all are wilding out so so [Music] so [Music] so good oh [Music] oh [ __ ] gloves suck i can't wait for regular gloves to be back in stock [Music] you one to move down uh so no twist in that so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] all right do so so my wife doesn't dab much but she dabbed some last night and uh she was surprised she had this look on her face and i was like oh no what's wrong you don't like it and she was like damn that's smooth and i was like oh [ __ ] that's what's up that wash was 789 grams in and then i got 122 grams of full spec hash from that yeah usually most places around here that carry like this quality of stuff it's usually 80 to 100 gram depending on where and that's in southern california just that's the typical range but honestly it's hard to find stuff of this quality in shops stuff like this usually stays his head stashed it doesn't find its way to shops all right here we go i'm going to give you guys the dab shot the one you've been waiting for okay okay i'm hoping that that's framed up okay check my camera first i think we're a go it's a little close and swap the banger real quick so [Music] cheers i'm gonna get you guys in there in there [Laughter] so so cheers you guys wow [Music] huh fun [Music] wow big head change look still clean what was that four or five big ass hits already at 405 on the email um got me sweat [Music] it tasted like sweet candy like with a little tangy lime taste [Music] baby [Music] [Music] foreign look [ __ ] fire god damn all right so let's go see what i've done [Music] [ __ ] [Music] woof all right so look at my phone so i can answer you guys comments here [Music] all right i got this other table set up that's what i was going to do what time is it 2 37 i still have time so i need to go through here and put the trellis poles on [Music] but uh that's about how much room i'll end up having on that side actually i lied so it's going to be more like right there so there's some room on that side there's some room on that side and then i'll have to uh get these lights just pushed over a tad to the left but it's looking good i got to put these trellis bowls on and that's what i got to do but let me go ahead and let's see if i have my charger can i plug these [ __ ] in oh my god that runs got me baked i'm not even gonna front it's some of the strongest stuff that i've had so far or at least it's so different from everything that i've had in the past that it's just the highest rate it's a definite upper um i do not sorry i'm i'm getting you guys swapped out with the battery here while i talk to you but um it's it's not like oh i'm so high that i'm just not gonna do anything that i was supposed to do now it's more like [ __ ] yeah let's go get work done if this kills the connection i'll be back so okay you said you can't work after taking a dab like that yeah you can with this stuff you can it's a definite like hey you feel good now go get work done that's how we feel it's amazing [Music] so let's put these trellis poles on let's bump some music [Music] [Music] my [Music] so [Music] my [Music] take these off real quick just so i could put this on [Music] so [Music] [Music] ah [Music] really what did i do tighten it too much that's [ __ ] [Music] so okay i think you guys can see what the [ __ ] i'm doing i'll check the chat in a minute so tell me if uh the framing is off [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] there we go [Music]

right there yep [Music] yeah buddy now if i slide you out what are you gonna do you stay there yep you're gonna stay there good [ __ ] good job fantastic so earlier i uh sealed this gap right here i'll check it for leaks and uh make sure that it's good to go and then i just fixed the one small leak i knew i had right here and i think i stepped on this and made a crack somewhere the other day over there i have to fix that but i have the [ __ ] spray right here for the not the spray the adhesive [Music] [Music] yes oh my boy here [Music] yes [Music] i better not wait gain any like type of weight [Music] whatsoever [Music] [Music] [ __ ] you you magnet you're not strong enough what type of [ __ ] magnet are you there's gonna be pain in the ass because there's not a whole lot of room right here this is all the room i have so i have to try and pull the tank table away and take this at an angle no matter what i do it's going to be at an angle that's okay do [Music] do do [Music] oh yeah let's not forget that one [Music] [Music] um you [ __ ] [Music] there [Music] i wish this thing was [ __ ] magnetized little rug burn [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] down [Music] [Music] dog [Music] do i can i can i reach that with my the go-go gadget oh i don't want to lean on this crack never mind let's not do that i was about to lean on it and go get it [Music] [Music] so [Music] this one's a little cramped too [Music] [Music] oh no that's fine i'll leave it on there [Music] yes another beach [Music] [Music] this is a leak detector right here [Music] [Music] so [Music] uh [Music] so [Music] so [Music] oh yeah it's not magnetic [Music] all right so [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] um what else are they going to do i wanted to see if my my rolling bench fits through there i don't know it's like super tight [Music] i feel like i just want it [Music] um all right well [Music] you know what i'm gonna have to do right [Music] i'm gonna take this off and i'm gonna take this outside and i'm gonna chop this off and i'm gonna chop that off [Music] so [Music] okay i gotta do a little bit more work here something i've been needing to finish so bear with me [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] my garage is [ __ ] messy still i know i know but what i don't know is what the [ __ ] happened to my drywall tea [Music] i'm not sitting in there it doesn't fit in there back there no huh well now begins a new adventure where did i put the drywall tea it's a pretty big object in this place interesting got it let's do this [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i [Music] [Music] uh [Music] so [Music] did [Music] so [Music] so [Music] that way when i walk past it i'm not knocking the styrofoam into pieces [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] the lights will keep everything inside here warm [Music] so [Music] okay last edge [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] me [Music] so [Music] appreciate that stones yeah it's definitely about time for a safety meeting but i wanted to knock out this door first i've been lagging [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so uh [Music] [Music] so [Music] so i don't think i'm going to pop seeds yet i think i'm going to do another mono crop and the reason is i don't want to pop seeds and not have uniform lighting up top especially because these are my expensive genetics so i think i'm going to go ahead and run another monoprop to do a side by side between the tfls and the raging [ __ ] don't get stuck on there yet in the raging kush [Music] [Music] i would rather have uniform lighting so that way i could pheno hunt properly it's hard to phenoh hunt when you have different lights going on because the lights control what the plants do so much it's gonna [ __ ] it up and give you skewed data so it's better to run them under uniform lighting foreign [Music] oh [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] bam and i'll create something for these so that they stay pushed together oh i got an idea [Music] i could tape those together [Music] and then it can just fold in half [Music] [Music] life [Music] [Music] so then i can just come in whole thing pops off wiggity wiggity wham slide it over here oh yeah all right it's doable so maybe what i'll do is i'll cut these in half add a couple more magnets and make it like a four piece sectional [Music] you get a yum yum [Music] that works normally i won't have all this [ __ ] in here either so we'll see and then so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] that's not sticky is this the sticky side you sticky all right you sticky [Music] yes [Music] ah [Music] it's not very sticky though might have a problem there [Music] so [Music] that seems a little off way off but there let's get it back on track [Music] i wasn't that far off actually [Music] [Music] not gonna lie i probably should have did it that way from the beginning it would have been way easier [Music] it's cracking so what's up enzo [Music] look at that [Music] yeah that's the top so we'll want to do that one too [Music] so [Music] so [Music] hmm [Music] do [Music] no that's not gonna be enough there so that don't matter i'll put something [Music] there there's nothing across the top there [Music] okay [Music] [Music] is there enough room to do that in here damn there [Music] so let's see how we're looking come over here take this slide up pop that on pop that on that's one maybe if we pull it over some so close the reason i put it on the styrofoam is because i'm not 100 sure that just putting it on this metal part is gonna make it work but we'll see anyways let me go ahead and just put this back up because i'll dick around with how tight it seals [Music] later pretty good though it doesn't need to be 100 light proof my life finally died plug in so let's see seamless cultivar this is the result of that bubble from the other day pretty good so let's smash some of this into a little jar for personal use [Music] so [Music] yeah everybody always likes when you take the top and you do all this [ __ ] to it [Music] i'm going to show you what all the influencers do to their their hash before they post pictures of it they push it down oh [ __ ] don't cut yourself right and then they take their dab tool and they just go like that a bunch of [ __ ] times [Music] that's it [Music] i don't know why i wish i knew i'm not hip to that one guys fire man [Music] all right let's take a dabbaroni one more little magnet here back in boston you didn't know what to do if you're running into like issues with your paws and you guys there's so many variables that it could be it's really hard to diagnose it you know over chat but um yeah if you guys need help dialing in your rosin pressing or your bubble hash processes set me up for consulting easy i have all these beautiful white little crumbs of rosin i'm trying to pick up off my dab mat here i like to waste [ __ ] let's get it watch my phone yeah just like steve said man it's more about the strains i noticed that give you different consistencies sorry check some notifications real quick well let's take a fat little blob not take that small little piece let me take that off there don't want to be greedy this stuff is really smooth and it expands like crazy [Music] hey that's for you guys [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] what [Music] uh [Music] [Music] oh yeah [Music] who's cannabis love there's a lot of really good pressers out there man for sure where did my child go what the [ __ ] i somehow pushed it away weird [Music] so [Music] so [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] true fantastic well it looks like two and a half zippers already on [Music] sorry i have to check the messages check in um people are [ __ ] blowing me up right now it's crazy cannabis love master i don't like that [Music] i don't like anybody that claims the name master grower [Music] [ __ ] [Music] i mean i see some decent grows but i would never ever ever associate the name master with it man not even close master implies you have nothing left to learn i don't get down like that anyways good content though good content oh man this high is great it just flows and flows and flows and flows ah all right well i i personally just think that anybody that calls themself master is a little too arrogant and needs to have a slice of humble pie i mean as much as i know i could i know my nutrient mixes and what they turn out to be because my nutrient mix is the same you know what i'm saying that's the only thing you really measure you know i'm saying yeah you could do that but that's to me that's that's the key to being a true master grower is taking the variables out and not guessing [ __ ] it's taking the time to do that extra step of measuring and making sure you're precise and taking notes and finding out specifically what works you know what i'm saying i don't know different strokes for different folks but if you're not constantly trying to improve your craft that's you know yeah i don't know i don't know anyways all that's left in here is the uh humidifier system that i'm gonna do and this is way though anyways you guys i'm gonna get out of here i got some more work to do before i call it a day so i'll catch you guys tomorrow peace", "n-DwD9o8T8E": "[Music] right and then you got ballers then it says 28 grammar [Music] [Music] as [Music] [Music]

the presses from yesterday that i didn't finish it up got uh six bucks here we're gonna go ahead and start pressing these um i'm thinking at 200. yesterday we did a range of temperatures the lower temperatures were not cutting it so we're going to go back to our our higher tip that i like to do that 202 we're gonna go ahead and uh we'll see how that does got some more parchment so i got the uh pucks properly wrapped up now and prepped in the appropriate size parchment sleeves so we should be able to get a decent flow and we'll just have to see what we get and we'll adjust the temperature as needed i don't imagine we'll be going down below 190 so excuse me one minute while i go ahead and finish straightening some [ __ ] up it is [ __ ] chilly chilly really really really [ __ ] is cold in the [ __ ] whoa i honestly i'm about to put on my [ __ ] key hold on yeah burr yeah we bout to take a dab right now hell yeah seeking something i'm glad to hear that man that's dope get your press on so here's the jar that we started last night this stuff was super turpy so we got all these crazy dark terps in here and we've got this lighter area and we're going to go ahead and we're going to mix all of it together today trim run gelato cake and white runs it's a little darker but oh my god i am in love with the taste already the taste on it is like a mint chocolate chip coffee it's bananas not the flavor but just it's crazy i haven't done any like stirring whipping i haven't done anything to it since last night i'm curious to see what it's going to do over the next couple days oh man and it melts so clean like you wouldn't even believe with how dark it is how clean it melts i'm gonna show you guys [Music] oh yeah that works in this life so clean we have a special announcement from

that [ __ ] up i think that's probably how you read that [ __ ] as you can tell i learned my french from dexter's laboratory i'm led fromage that's uh yeah that's about as good as we're gonna get on that one [Music] [Music] i gotta now i gotta google this [ __ ] i don't know what you're saying but i gotta find out i gotta find out he said okay goodbye [Music] [Music] the power what pleasure strength i'm sorry is that being is that being culturally insensitive am i being stereotypical am i stereotyping i'm sorry let's get this press started i'm banked already [Music] um [Music] excuse me excuse me hold on the tripod get you guys set up and then um we'll go from there [Music] hey [Music] dabbing gloves big force the team oh the team sounds like he's trying to say like uh the team is strong like big up to the team [Music] am i am i right we just started working at amazon working overnights that means you're packing [ __ ] women's dildo orders and [ __ ] huh doing all the freaky [ __ ] overnight i got you on that [ __ ] [ __ ] it's okay boy what else could they use the overnight [ __ ] for at amazon that's gotta be it that's gotta be so [Music] [Music] [Music] my man said he's part of the ginyu force that's what he said until we figure out what he's saying we're just gonna assume that he's saying he's part of the ginyu force [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign oh this one gets loud oh so good return puck feels uh pretty well emptied and got off the plates pretty quick and was the same color or lighter than yesterday a slightly better return feels like so i dropped the temperature a little bit but not much because this stuff does just come out darker because in the terps [Music] so i still want to keep the flow high [Music] myself [Music] uh wow i'm allowed to give you guys information soon but i can't give you information on pricing yet i was told i have to wait until science led makes the official announcement and gets them on their site and then by then they'll have like um shipping times and you'll be able to pre-order and [ __ ] they don't want to put out the information too soon so they told me to wait trust me i'm i'm so ready to tell you guys [Music] you know [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm at uh 190 right now it's just looking off because the lighting is [ __ ] and this is a trim run bro here maybe this will help you guys with the color issue i know it's hard to tell but you'll see you'll see get this in the jar and then we're going to go ahead and start the next puck that was a good temperature and we're gonna run it at that time yeah i don't really have a good spot you guys where you're not gonna be in the [ __ ] way i'll try and move you over a little bit i think my laptop could be [ __ ] maybe let me see food grade month okay you guys if you say so you know what determines whether it's food grade or not how clean it melts when i show you how clean it melts you're gonna be like oh okay yeah that's not food grade the trichomes that come off of trim is usually going to be more mature because it's exposed to more direct light than the rest of the trichomes that are covered in the plant matter right so when you process trim it's going to come out slightly more amber too all right and then if you're dealing with a strain that's really really terpy and depending on what those terpenes are can also make it darker right so never judge judge it by the color alone and be quick to say oh that's food grade or that's not good like it's really really hard to judge it based off of color alone especially fresh off the press so oh yeah definitely people judge with their eyes first for sure you eat with your eyes first you judge off of appearance first but again this is fresh off the plates and you got to give me a couple days and work my magic on it telling you guys i'm telling you huh i want to mention just my lighting is [ __ ] probably back you guys the [ __ ] up huh um the plan is going to be to whip this all up and heat mat it and then burp it at um at a certain point [Music] so good extraction on that one too this is going to turn out just like the los altos did it's gonna turn into that like jam with chunks in it and i'm gonna love it we'll love every minute of it there's not good light over here where's the best light for me let's go in here oh no [ __ ] that room goes crazy let's try right here man the light [ __ ] right now there we go how's that color looking it looks like [ __ ] when you look at it from the top because the camera can't perceive the light the same way but it's just terpius [ __ ] so and you would think oh the lower temperature you go the lighter it'll be no because it just takes too long to get off the plates and we already tried 200 that was too hot then 190 is is the sweet spot it's the best it's gonna get for uh for this i mean i can go like 155 160 and press like five grams at a time maybe get a different result but i'm not pressing five [ __ ] grams at a time that's not what's gonna happen today i wonder if it would help so this is gonna get real silly if i don't put you guys down soon oh this is between 16 to 22 grams in every one of these bags how did you already know right my man saw the board behind me and added it up already my press is feminine thank you her name is bertha so yes she is feminine it's not the craziest smell actually because i'm not running it too hot but it's like a minty coffee lag oh there's some fat ass chunks in this hmm two more oh my goodness we always gotta get one or two huh you know actually i think that you've been on this channel being done before you are the weakest link bye [Music] [Music] i don't know yet my yield on this run yet because we're in the middle of doing it right now i'm not trying to be a smart ass but open your eyes [Music] how old is the material it was a couple weeks old when it was given to me about two weeks old i want to say sat in the freezer for a couple weeks i don't know if uh what the yield has been i haven't really been weighing anything yet so i'll just wait and see i'll wait and find out at the end and i get a veggie burger with uh grilled onions no tomato with fries with uh spread i mean i put my own beyond meat burger patty on it when i get home still enjoy in and out but do it the vegan way yeah buddy but also whoever did mention edibles for food grade i am going to turn a good portion of my cut into edibles or at least caps really potent caps rosin gaps no i didn't do anything today i'm working working working working working and uh somebody else says one more and then collection and then we're going to stir it all up and get it going on the heat map i'm gonna heat mat it at least overnight i'll show you guys i have no secrets no secrets whatsoever i don't time anything i don't look at the gauge anything if i don't know who you are on the gram or if you don't follow or like somebody i know doesn't follow you then i don't accept you you got to tell me what your name is so that i can go and accept you and maybe maybe if i've seen your name around here enough i'll accept it otherwise you gotta know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody so yeah there i'm gonna start doing a lot more live sessions that are gonna be more interactive i'm gonna set up uh a streaming session in the new hash set so it'll be a good stable connection and we'll be able to have some proper lighting in there our windows uh vented sunlight and we'll be able to have some real good sessions okay so so yo i watched this uh hugh hefner docu-series with my wife and it was actually pretty interesting i didn't know that he was so involved in social issues it was really interesting to see that and how he went against the grain with racism and segregation and he would invite um all these black stars to come onto his show right and he had aretha franklin and um brain farting on the other person and but he had like a bunch of different up and coming artists and he wasn't afraid to have them come and perform at his club because he didn't care he didn't see color he just saw talent and he wanted to make it known what his company stood for and didn't stand for and so he interviewed like he did really really in-depth interviews with a lot of celebrities and at one point he did an in-depth interview with malcolm x and malcolm x was you know saying his typical stuff very radical extremist stuff and mind you majority of the readers of playboy back at this time are white and he published it against the advice of all the other people that were working for and he published it unedited and well not unedited like they edited it but they didn't like edit his answers or change his wording they left it all exactly how he said it you know um and i'm like yo that that's [ __ ] ballsy and he got a lot of support for it actually afterwards and a lot of readers wrote in and said that was awesome thanks for sharing that interview blah blah blah so yeah man that was that was really interesting to watch that and obviously to watch his back and forth with struggling to be um you know married and father and all these different things that he just couldn't [ __ ] do living in the [ __ ] mansion i think any normal man would succumb to that [ __ ] after a while especially after being away from your wife the man was surrounded by titties and ass 24 7. like i think he had so much titties and ass i would get tired of it i would be like [ __ ] put some clothes on like it's not even exciting anymore to see your titties they're just always out like put some clothes on surprise me i want to come around the corner and just be like ah titties surprise it's been three days then i'm gonna be like oh titties but if i see titties every time i walk around the [ __ ] house i'm titties like what like it's like looking at an elbow it's just not gonna matter anymore you know just doesn't [ __ ] matter anymore i don't know how that man stayed excited by i guess maybe there was just so many different kinds of titties i don't know i think i would get over it titty climbing wall bro you know how much i just pictured that [ __ ] on my head like a rock climbing wall but instead of rocks his titties yo oh my god you are creative you are creative that is funny he says my friend has a thing for elbows i mean i'm a classic i'm a classy man i i like exposed shoulders if my wife ever has like a shirt that is like has one of those wide neck collars and you know her shoulder starts to show a little bit i'm like oh that's classy sexy i'm an old man i guess but hey can we get a quick vote while i take this dab a quick vote side boob is 2003 but it's okay quick vote he said yes yo kristoff i wish i knew what you were saying somebody tell me what he's saying titty sprinkles by morgan you know desensitized from titties and ass yeah man i'm telling you bro why you think he needed them pills bro he didn't excite him no more he couldn't do it all right here's my poll thongs or booty shorts drop it in the chat right now that's all i want to know thongs or booty shorts this is going to tell me everything i need to know about every last one of you from here on out i'm deciding your face as a friend or a foe choose wisely how [ __ ] would you guess cheers man cheers i'm going to show you guys how [ __ ] clear this is too here you", "a_Y8loBehR4": "[Music] [Music] guys welcome the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny and we are back for another concentrate review today we are checking out some rosin from 7-10 lives 710 labs they reformed their Colorado company and now they came out to California here we go got a shovel a because it's hard to get on the Denver yeah we actually took the close-ups for this stuff yesterday when we left it in the fridge it was a little cakey but still have a little bit still have a little bit of you know greasiness to it gooeyness left it out overnight after you know basically destroying it [Music] Turkey I'm not usually a huge rosin pin mm-hmm I was just gonna say is it flavorful for rosin or is it flavorful for just an extract in general honestly it's flavorful just for extract in general I guess we should talk about what it is we're smoking we are smoking on some z-cube today now Z cubed is apparently a I guess there's a little bit of a debate on it it's either a three-way crowd like basically skittles back crosses itself a couple times or it's skittles across with OG then cross the skills again either way some skittles taste the rainbow type [ __ ] it is very flavorful and ethylene packs a little bit of a punch it's a little sativa T definitely made me feel a little more like alert who's this barking this is by a dying breed seeds yeah originally third-gen fam [ __ ] i mean i think they probably won 40 50 cups buy this [ __ ] at this one how much every cup this is placed at some point or another multiple times the thing about the skittles is it doesn't look that good when you look at the flowers of it it has about zero bag PB on it does not look good in flower form but goddamn does it taste good I mean I can still taste it on my palate it definitely gave me that opening vibe you know what I'm saying one of those strings that has a super-high terpene content and a relatively low THC content right everybody gets so hung up on the THC numbers and they forget that like without the terpenes and the cannabinoids the THC does out basically nothing for it it all acts together people it all packed together so you know as a result this is one of those strings in my opinion now we're talking about the skittles this is our first time smoking thank you but just the regular old skittles not really my favorite strange smoke if you're talking about flour no not at all but it does make some good concentrates it is a very short flowering plant which on the production side is great you know seven weeks right seven weeks our times so and that's that's amazing I mean eight weeks she's fully done yeah right right so I would love to throw that in my garden strictly for concentrates because you know the flowers trash yeah it is one of those streams though that you know can kind of surprise you as far as when you look at you like oh this right this you look sweet this is some [ __ ] meds but when you smoke it it's one of those sleepers that kind of does pack more of a pleasant you would think right right especially you know it's not the strongest when you talk about dabs but it's right up there with some of the most flavorful [ __ ] the lemon geez a lot of those like orange lemon Terps that just like come through really well on oil for some reason this kind of falls in that same class of church yeah I mean honestly the flour it smokes really good and like a joint or a backward - like I'm not gonna lie but it just doesn't look good you know I'm saying but that concentrates great alright I'm gonna go in and see what to do with the taste you see were to do it with the taste it is hard to get on the batter though that's the one downfall got it the one downfall hard to get on the diver that's the most rosin though we forgot to keep it in the fridge and then you know boom it just waxed out you know I've got the little pocket on it's not a pocket purge because it's not a little but they you know it kicked up in the pocket and that was that now you gotta use shovel to break cover on this stuff I'm gonna discover super blonde yeah how's it taste [ __ ] yeah that was a dabba doo honestly though on the flavor I wasn't very scary to me really no here's the thing about rosin for me especially bubble hash for us and I'm like 95% sure this is Posche rosin is a lot of the stuff you see that looks like this now right yes you know it always kind of just tastes like bubble hash and I don't mean that in a bad way you guys know obviously we used to do it's one of the full-mouth Friday videos like we will have good water to Michael but I like good bubble hash more than I like good rosin that tastes like bubble hash you can bubble there's only those few strings that are really good for you know making bubble hash like sours and all the really greasy strains like that that really make like a bubble hash that actually tastes as true as possible to the natural product one good thing there's GDP in it no there's great babe I got you guys so I wish there was GDP a really original skittles right is wasn't like a grapefruit and a great finish great free really it's a grapefruit and a great page supposedly River and great buddy it should have an eagle everybody knows great babe it's got some peanuts the effect of the shooters pigment it's definitely more of like a head for head as far as the body feeling goes yeah it's pretty much immediate too we had already taken a few dabs or some oil today and feeling it a little bit but this stuff I do Efes is hitting me harder this stuff grab me hot I'm not gonna lie like I think you can tell the baby packaging I'm just gonna say what you think about this packaging this packaging pretty sweet it's pretty slick I do like it I'm not gonna hate on looks like it's got all the regulatory standards on there open up the top here and these flaps right here have a couple little sayings on it this one says oh jeez make better oh gee that's cool I like that and then this one says preserve your Terps keep refrigerated yeah that's one over here to quality drives every decision we make from the garden to the lab to the jar that holds your cash happy beautiful that's beautiful beautiful words from 7-10 labs I'm diggin it packaging 907 as far as overall concentrator I think we shall give this ready yeah I mean this is really good Rosen its fire like I said I just haven't we're not about the rosin yet that gets me to fully commit right you know we're not rousing people we're just gonna wear em I'd rather say that rosin is not the first thing I picked out of the lineup to smoke to some of y'all that might be the first thing you picked out and that's fine by me I'll pick some here BHS it's almost like it's sort of like you know if you looked at it on a spectrum it's like that spot right in between bubble hush you know full mouth and boy right you know right it's just he has never really been a friend to the extracting process when it goes like keeping your terpenes intact and everything and yeah I think the best rosin that I've smoked are at least the turbo is another smoke doesn't in Flour mm-hmm every time I smoked some rosin that's made from bubble like this it kind of just always tastes like a slightly different version of just right so back to the rating I think what your regular right yeah that's great okay overall concentrate rating I think I'm gonna probably have to give the effect on this like a fart like a heat you know I'm not too loaded up but I definitely did get a head change as far as smell targeted in a Tazewell and looks looks our popular tonight because it's really really really Blanc got great looks so I'm gonna go eat 58.5 for Rossum I'm gonna go higher on the effect right now the effect of this is like a nine or ten for me well like from one day yeah I'm taking one dab of that the heck change is really nice cool so I'm gonna go with the night on that smell it was pretty good I'll probably go with a seven their appearance I'm gonna give them a plus one for the packaging so I'm gonna go probably eight so somewhere flavor that's why where I go lower probably six and a half seven something like that yeah so overall I'd say probably a seven or an eight whatever that method is some probably seven or eight eight five I'm being generous today I like it it's a great concentrate 7/10 labs skittles cubed thanks for watching I'm Danny I'm Shane these [Music] you", "vlO1jMDzCKg": "yeah it's gonna be a long video all right today we have six courts inserts here all loaded up with different strains some are live resin some are rosin I got one giant diamond here and I even got some sugar wax here and I think that's what I'm gonna start out with this is some Blood Diamond from Agra kind this [ __ ] looks nuts and honestly it has the consistency of like a sponge has an amazing terpene profile it tastes straight-up like grapefruit it feels like it's like a charcuterie board of dads I'm about to have a very good time here I'm sure not everyone knows what quartz inserts are and how they're used but I have an entire youtube video where I break it down super in-depth so if you want to learn more about quartz inserts you can go into the description of this video and watch that first but from here on out in the video I'm going to assume that you know what quartz inserts are and how they're used it's gonna bang your nice and hot alright now that our banger is going down let's get a quick little close up if we can bounce away boys this might overflow not gonna lie one piece breast oh he's so good my god [Music] Piper hush sorry you guys got my dog with me she's away from all the deaths not bad I got a little doggie gate set up here that's oh my god man this should taste so good I'm not kidding my girlfriend even like hates the smell of weed and she smoked this [ __ ] and she was like damn you should get more of that that [ __ ] smells good that definitely raised the temperature in here holy [ __ ] those nice big shout out the cop products for making these courts inserts that fit their bangers perfectly not to mention the tweezers they make so handling them when they're super hot is really like a stress free hassle all right that was a nice way to start the session I like legit sweating a little bit yep that's what what's nice about that inserts is honestly there's not a lot of residue that gets on the banger you even want to overflows it's so much less than one actually gets an insert so it really does provide your banger from getting that like Chaz dusty look to it all right that was nice but next I'm gonna dab some rosin this strain is strong wah but number two from olio this one really impressed me even from olio it smells and tastes amazing the look on it's great honestly even when it smells it's almost [ __ ] clear let me show you all right I have number two get it nice and close time a little bit the smaller Deb but I still think it's a beige decent size with a desert no wait till it really starts to smoke up in here and then I go for it this one's a little hot oh my god Oh oh my god it's like one hit left boom Wow that [ __ ] is nice definitely burnt up though with that on that one oh my god there is nobody left in there even even when it was that hot it tasted [ __ ] good man these inserts really make the dabs last longer I sort of got I mean this time I went a little hot but even if you get a nice low time they [ __ ] Rock here alright threw down four to go [ __ ] alright next I'm dabbing on some good goog live president from Moxie I really like this drain it's a sativa hybrid but honestly it's just a straight sativa in my opinion it gets me so [ __ ] high in that like cracked-out sativa way or you're super chatty and like just want to go out and go do something like this is definitely a constraint for on-the-go I'm not gonna do a close-up on this one [ __ ] it let's see the whole function of the Ring all right let's drop it already Melton Oh Lord dude I'm already so [ __ ] big this is gonna be a long video yep it's gonna be a long video oh my god [ __ ] give me that little nose tickle oh my god I gotta hear at the chit still going Jesus Christ this is what I was talking about [ __ ] oh my god all right tap it out there I swear it man that is a straight sativa it's not considered one but like that rosin that killed me and that one's brought me back to life halfway there only three left alright next I'm gonna dive is a little scary it is like a straight THC a rock but it's actually just like lab rats and diamonds without the live presentation it it's one giant rock so this should be interesting this [ __ ] has no flavor obviously because there's no turfs but it just has this like weird chemi taste like I'm honestly just not a fan I'm kind of dreading this stab out of all of them because this is a giant [ __ ] rock of it but wish me luck this I do want to go in a little bit hopped out because since it's just straight THC a really all it needs is heat to get the full effect alright let's watch this [ __ ] melt so weird has just no flavor [Applause] a little bit left it holy [ __ ] alright it's done it's [ __ ] done oh my god dude I'm not even gonna lie there's so much replaying in here you know what that means cheers [ __ ] [ __ ] me oh this is all hot [ __ ] no bueno just has no flavor so weird the highs crazy on this stuff but it's just so weird now there's no Terps I need the Turks terms all right give me some turps next to reindeer the strong Nana I'd add this a bunch on my last video has like a super great banana terpene profile I love anything that tastes like banana I don't know why it's hard to come by and it always is just like such a nice experience when I get it and this is live rosin by the way so definitely gonna have a good Turkey in profile all right as well doing a close-up let me know if you guys are enjoying these little close-up insert drops actually really enjoy the inserts so I'll keep doing videos like this if you like it so let me know swinging a little hot on that gotta take a little breather there [ __ ] [Applause] [ __ ] me oh my god dude Robin just hit you different really does who love it great experience I'd love rosin rosin for life all right last but not least I'm going to do some only old life present my eyes are feeling heavy so I'm glad those videos under this drain is guava breath ever get what the number is let's go with guava breath to the number really never matters to me when people are like Oh what watermelon skittles is is the 16 or the 48 I don't care to that exact i honestly should but my memory is just not strong enough for that I'm like I know I like that strain or I like the sound of it I'm grown with it like it's talking me to remember what number is better make sure you ask look like you definitely enjoy the video if you made it this far I appreciate every single one of you guys watching let's do the snap I'm doing a low temp I don't care if you judgment boom get in there we're ready [ __ ] dodge like that holy [ __ ] [Music]

man I have heard nothing but good things from like their products man they the fact that 710 labs takes so much pride into the products that they all they do is just put in hard work and the results speak for themselves man they got people talking all over Instagram YouTube Twitter like I'm talking about like everywhere that I go everyone asked me as I have you tried seven ten have you tried seven ten and I've tried their hash rasen but I have not tried their what their Weed Man so I'm very very excited to get into this but for before we get into this man I have to give a big shout-out to

paint but you know if you want to smoke it you got to pay the price so we're gonna save this for the second part of the video we're gonna roll up a nice joint with that but first since I do have my rig right here MJ Arsenal and my torch all the goodies right here I think the only thing we can do is take it out all right so I'm already have been dabbing it so I'm bushed shut you guys in there it might be missing some so this right here guys is what I have currently right now and it's honestly some of the turkeys like 710 miles has to be some of the turkeys but I mean wax that I have ever smelled man like the the Terps in this thing is just so amazing and I kid you not man stabbing on Psalm endless like wax is just so freakin good man thinking about doing is heating this up for 30 about 30 to 35 seconds and then waiting about 45 seconds to 50 seconds I feel like that gives it the best the taste and it's not very harsh smoke yet you get very very milky clouds so let's go ahead and torch this thing up boys cheers i heated it up to 35 seconds I'm gonna go ahead and let it go till 45 just because I had you have the window open man and I'm gonna go ahead and meanwhile though let's go ahead and choose a nice little chunky one just to start things off boys because honestly I have I've only dabbed it once today and I feel like man this one's gonna catch me because I'm telling you the hatch frozen is so smooth that you only really feel it when it starts building up in your chest man so we're about during your second day and still got another ten and yeah let me know in the comments below if you've ever tried 7-10 labs man if you have make sure to hit that like button on this video and if you haven't we'll hit that like button anyways cheers boys oh dude that

because you just get the smoothest hits the milk is hits and then the Terps now I'm tick I'm talking about I can taste everything in this I can taste everything man it's phenomenal and after you're done your your nail should look like this man you should still see oil in there and man there's seven ten laps definitely definitely worth that's the $80 that I paid man I would I want to buy the Percy that one right there is $100 I believe or $90 so if you guys want to see a video on the percy live rosin let me know in the comments below like this video and subscribe so auntie dad dad got me super high and I just remember that we also have to smoke another joint so I'm probably gonna step aside from the dabbing and we're gonna go ahead and crack this open man this oh gee Kb your see you guys see how fresh it is man I have not opened it brand new look well you can see the seal right there man this is gonna be the first time guys that I have ever seen this flower in person and I'm kind of excited already it's like a little glimpse right there so let me go ahead and pop this sucker out oh dude oh now just follow my computer oh dude it's as beautiful as the oh oh my goodness dude yo I know my camera is not gonna you know pick up every single watch I'm gonna have to use my phone for this guy's but this but right here you guys know the phone camera picks up every single trichome everything that's why we use the phone and look look at this guy's just look at this you guys are gonna be in all all right so this is the og KB right here look at this dude the beautiful orange hairs I'm talking about look at the trichomes look at the purple little stems think you know oh my gosh the curation on this dude is just so phenomenal I haven't even smelt it what does it smell like I have never saw anything like this smells like me but it's just a different type of legal officer dude this is like literally one of the most aya peeling pieces of bud that I have ever seen and now it's just a fact so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna roll this up I don't know how much help I roll it up but dude this thing is just so phenomenal looking I don't even know if I want to break it apart but I just want to just put this in a casing and just put it in a corner of my room do you never touch it so this thing looks so phenomenal I'm gonna like I said I'm a roll up a joint and I'll see you guys in a little bit right here we got the joint right here man it's honestly I rolled there I've been getting so much better at rolling these freaking joints so all we got to do now man is pretty much just burn off the paperboys and basically here you go here you have it your perfect little or joint now I want to say there's like 1.5 in here man but does it really matter though because I just want to know how good this is man I want to know if it's worth the money because this this 8 was more expensive than a cookie so he hasn't gonna be the first one to find out boys choose only through the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal statement choose wood hmm after that personation I did get a little bit of some a little bit of paper tape so [Music] whoo it's actually pretty freakin smooth man so far so far I do i I did roll these in some raw hemp papers organic hemp so there might be another reason why but honestly so far it's burning a really really smooth I am getting a lot of earthiness from this plant itself and it's giving off a little bit of a sweet tone but honestly it tastes very very very good like it's something like I know we did we'd look I know we do sweet guys but you can tell the difference from something that is properly cultivated to some [ __ ] that you know that that is make that is being made in mass amounts and things like that like these guys they take so much pride because it's small batch all the time they never they never overdo the batches man because they want to make sure that every single planet that they grow is growing to a hundred percent perfection on their own terms you know but so far man I haven't I'll any clips of this this it's burning very very smooth like I'm telling you let me give you guys a little close-up of pilots burning right I rolled it really really good it's burning even all the way through you got the little tip right there if you ask them to see that and it's an enjoyable smoke man it's currently 10 o'clock in the morning and usually whenever this is the first time I'm smoking also unusually whenever I smoke first my eye like I started coffee or [ __ ] to him whenever it's the first work of a bit but this is smooth like I was saying and it tastes very piney earthy but it's enjoyable as heck I don't taste any really fruitiness flavors of it no I taste a little bit of sweetness but it's not overpowering this thing is chiefing though it's obviously getting me super super baby I ended up waiting a little bit after taking the dabs and then just I mean I rolled out the joint while I was high a [ __ ] and then I roll I waited a little bit more that way I could get the full effects because I didn't want to go from being a super stone because that was a super fat that that I just took I don't want to go from being super stoned to you know getting even more stunning I even being able to differentiate the type of high that I'm getting in the flavor because my mouth was dry as heck I kid you not that dad got me so tight but I was brick and faded for it for a minute I'm not gonna lie I have not been that faded in such a long time and it's such a good feeling now and then they finished chugging milk for sure all boys that looks like we're at had a lighter fluid on our centers [Music] this thing is McEnroe I hope you guys like the new location I mean I'm just in my garage and I hope you guys not like the current location man I was gonna do it in my car but I was like man for a special day like this my mind let's just do it somewhere where you know you guys can see all the smoke around me not the same setting give you guys some a little something different I just in used to Macanese well I'm about to finish this whole joint to the face but not on camera because that would literally turn my videos so freakin long all right guys so my review for this ogk be it's about its max I'm high right now like super faded and it's such a different height such a soothing high but usually with wheat it's either I don't get high or I get like you know too high to the point where I don't even enjoy the high because my head's hurting but this right here yeah but this one right here is honestly just hitting like every single aspect bro like I'm sure I know I know for a fact after I'm done with this I'm probably I'm probably gonna have a better good morning you know I'm already have me good morning gonna go better and EMA like like I would say though I would definitely would not mind dropping another 150 hundred 60 on some 17 laps again like because there I'm telling you they're rosin smack nice it was just the perfect gap the turf through there the taste is there that I was there everything about it was so good and I feel like usually I don't get that feeling with other concentrates you know with other flower so yeah man I would definitely purchase this again time though I do want to try the Persie rosin you know want to try I'm not even sure what kind of strain this was it was like an indica or sativa guessing it's either hinder guard hybrid so next time I want to try just a straight-up indica and see how much that smacks me because I feel like if this give this is smack at me right now I can only imagine what a straight up in meter with you so yeah guys I'm gonna go ahead and hand out the video here because I'm high as a hack right now I just want to enjoy the rest of this man hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video and you know and if you did go ahead and leave a like comment and most importantly hit your boat with that subscribe button and reach so let's try to get 400 K subs I mean 40 K subs boys that's the next call right and you guys are gonna help me do that guys so I hope you guys have a blessed day and we're out", "lbxe9wjChMA": "welcome back to the canvas packaging show episode 3 in this 12 part series also known as a saga we're talking about concentrates today quick reminder to subscribe to the channel we're going to be doing a lot of eco-friendly packaging in 2019 we're going to show you guys through the canvas packaging so so please subscribe and without further adieu unless Danis I need to add let's get right into the cannabis excuse me concentrate packaging Kalia has an announcement to make sure they've all going to show us the products first and then this was created by Heather the Saudi a favorite thing I've done for the concentrates in the entire you know for the last year Wego she calls her own packaging Fuego Johnson a good sky by the way shot up the sky shot at the skies Str jar it fits through the card Co dry it can hang it's very cost-effective it shone like the spot UV if you can can you see that on there this thing's getting a lot of compliments all right next up show it like unwrapping it on the actual show you don't have to unwrap that actually it's just it's just the bow just about yeah holding backs to put your jar in all your warnings on there it's a Massachusetts product all right keep this moving League that's the same concept just another is a flap here that you can put some branding on or a message of some sort I love that idea of how do you put a message in there that tells the story so it's like just that person holds your package and you can hit them with some kind of call to action whether it's going to your Instagram or you want to show them your tagline of what you're about so how do you tell your story through packaging is something to really think about not just a box it's a way to tell your story and it's a proven fact that I'm doing the unboxing process we talked about that a lot when you have more flaps you have more openings it's more exciting and it leads to a much lower case of buyer's remorse certainly just from having a fun experience in opening the box opening the package it's like you're opening a gift it's a true unboxing process we do a lot of the stuff in our ecommerce division and it's all about unboxing opening it up and really being pleased with what you see on the inside and half of the fun is you see on YouTube all over the place unboxing experience half of the fun is the unboxing process repeat customers that's what's gonna have people come to you again as a repeat customer versus as more dispensaries pop up down the street why would I go to you know location a versus B it's because I have that experience through their packaging and it resonates for sure alright we interrupt this program Talia please show your Christmas cookies to everyone a lot o you're interested in buying cookies for Scalia please so let's go to the chatter envelopes upgraded this has an insert in it two items from our fashion side of our business that we think could be adaptable this would be like super high but I was thinking this for shatter Irving this for a concentrate but that for shattering there's a hinge box with raw materials has an inlay and this is a flock interior which is like a by the sweater this obviously has a bracelet insert inside okay inside this box is a wood lacquer hinge box which again this was for a ring but we can make an insert for your jars really nice pause would I don't know if it shows up on camera but a gorgeous gorgeous almost like a mirror finish polished would non contempo sample don't have to be a different size but just I really like the opening and the magnetic closure and the material to the materials are a huge thing that plain to the brand overall so it's not just the design on the box with the material selection and I see a lot of people in the industry just choosing standard 18 point board with four color process for color print and the textures are great way to tell the story of what you're about where you premium will then use a premium texture are you eco-friendly are you natural then use a natural craft field so keep materials in mind this is a similar example it has a magnet in it this is the box for makeup it has a mirror inside but it has that nice snap closure type of box that you will not throw out like Dan was talking about knowing the experience and knowing what her customers going to do after he makes the purchase or she makes the purchase sometimes you want to just have a package that's going to contain and after you've thrown away other times if you really want to make it whether it's giftable or you just want to add to the experience you've designed packaging that's not going to be thrown away that's going to be kept with the life cycle of the product or even after that so an item like that with a mirror on it could be put on the desk has your brand on it forever and again the customer connects with it you know for years and years and years to come I see that was like a five milliliter concentrate jar would look really nice than that that that concept okay what do you anyone say about this all right so this is just sort of a aspirational or concept that we haven't really tested but we're thinking a concept issue to have shatter inside of there I want to see if you guys think that would be viable this is the concept that we did for the fashion industry we had a floating ring box and I think a lot of people like to see shatter they like to see how clear it is right how transparent it is I'm thinking that could be a really really cool option to display these Nick what do you think that was actually your idea about the your set you're telling me about like the transparent nature like to see you know the purity of it how transparent is honestly I think that's a great idea I think that would be really unique and different okay I guess this episode is over because our helpers just run out the door and she's back alright anyone have anything else to add in the concentrates you guys things you're seeing in the market that would be worth sharing with the audience or do we kind of hit everything and everything about the boxes we have a customer that were conceptualising packaging for now that wants to make sure that whoever is using her packaging moving forward can fit it in their pocket or if you're using it for a pre-roll or concentrate that they can take one of the tubular ones and actually turn it into carry your joint to a concert or going somewhere else where they are just having it a nice box to fits easily in their pocket like chapstick with so I think that that's really important for people to try and not keep in mind too when they're designing their packaging is the smaller the better and you know people can use it more than once that's really going to be the best-case scenario mm-hmm oh great I think especially with the primary packaging so like I think a lot of this stuff people could have a box they're gonna keep that primary package on then like fit it in their pocket I think that you hear that a lot that's definitely a common thing what is it going to be like for the person who's carrying the product how do you have that seamlessly integrated to their lives the cookie was great and a little rude eating on camera I could see someone writing the comments this guy's eating on camera but I'm sorry to you whoever's gonna call me out on that", "dh3aYJDw91M": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this wax tastes like [ __ ] watermelon and this is versa I've had this brand plenty of times on this channel already but watermelon I believe is one of their newest strains that was released at my local dispensary so I had to pick it up you know I've gotten the lemon oh geez the rainbow flames all that stuff like multiple times so as you can see I already opened it and you know that's how I know it tastes like watermelon but funny thing about that I actually bought it last night but the lighting in my room wasn't good so I was forced to just smoke it and doing a video in the morning the next day so I hope you guys can understand you still won't get to see all of it it's all all its glory and I will be using that utility in fine I know it's [ __ ] [ __ ] but I mean we're gonna have to make it work but juicy right here 73 percent THC not bad hopefully you guys can see it it's at the right and watermelon no Singlish is opening packaging very very nice another thing I'd like to mention is that this is different from the other eras that I've seen or have tried in terms of the consistency of blacks I mean look at it it's basically a sugar which is good because sugar it's harder to get on your lid you know you see it it's not gonna just if I did this it's not gonna slide down slowly like sauce would you know was very good smells really good I mean if I had to describe it as smell just like some raw garden stuff but it tastes different than how it smells which is crazy yeah like if there is actually a hint of like a watermelon or it might just be like a like a placebo you know that you know it's called watermelon that you kind of taste watermelon I'm not too sure but if you guys have tried this please let me know just give you a little soom in Gnome see the color is really good it's not too dark there's something about you know dark wax is just very unappealing but that doesn't mean that it can't be good Billy because I believe was it bright labs they had very dark dark oil but that [ __ ] was fire once they wanted to be I'm speck of fat hit for you my fault [Music] boys but that new Mac Miller album is [ __ ] dope recipes - Mac rest in peace - juice rest in peace 2x rest in peace - Pete there's some peace to [ __ ] everyone that's that we lost roots in the man that's [ __ ] sad cheers guys like seriously there's like a hint of watermelon I'm gonna hit it again and blow it at the light just because the lightning you're not gonna really see how much smoke I'm actually getting by email okay [Music] - is that you guys so first I bought it for $24 out then took 209 if you guys are around my neighborhood or my area authentic swoon I it has really been coming up especially when Thanos is very crowded they they don't really update their menu it's just like you feel rushed all thanks to 209 they kind of just talk with you you know so you take one more hit for you guys important to end the video here I do have like drone I've message message these guys to see if they're ever gonna be in Modesto I don't know if they'd be

stupid container there's a dab left in here but I can't even scoop it out not with this thing anyways but I'm about to show you a super easy way to get every last bit of hash out of every one of your containers this is gonna save you so many doubts right now on the stream answers to all the questions you've ever had about weed what's up i'm matt welcome back to the strange show this is a channel for adults and patients where i answer all the questions you've ever had about weeds you don't know how many of these little containers like this or maybe even worse the even smaller ones like this that i've thrown away that still have some hash inside of them a long time ago i never knew how to get the last dab or two out of these things and it would drive me crazy until i learned how to make a turn to tell me Tyler showed me this so shout out to Tyler thank you buddy this saved my life all three of these containers are pretty much empty I can't get any more on my stick but after we make our Terp tube we're gonna have a few dabs of these guys so super easy you really don't need a couple things first get all your containers that you have that still have just a little bit of hash in them then we're gonna need a drinking straw a pair of scissors and you probably already have your torch handy but we might not even need this first just cut off a few inches of your straw just make sure the piece you cut off is at least a few inches long now we're gonna take the piece that we cut off we're gonna cut a really steep angle on one side of the straw like this now that we've cut at this really steep angle we're gonna cut the pointy side off right there so it's nice and flat on the front and it looks like a little shovel now we have a very flexible tool to scrape our container with and it's hollow and you're gonna see why that's important in just a second but look how good it scrapes this out I mean it gets every drop there's nothing left in this that looks brand-new now and I can do that to all of these I could go around the house and find any of these I might have and try this and it even works in these little tiny ones because the Turk tube is so flexible that it just bends to any shape you smush it to so if your hash isn't as wet is these are if it's too hard to scrape with your turkey that's when your torch is gonna come in now if you have a hairdryer laying around I'd probably use the hairdryer first but you're probably like me and you're sitting here it's all your dabbing stuff in front of you and I don't have a hairdryer in front of me - dad what so I'm gonna use a torch so just take your torch and just barely wand it over your hash container and just gently heat it up just ever so slightly then it should be a little more runny and wet and pliable and you can do that with your torch or a blow-dryer or whatever you could probably just put in your pocket for now or anything to make it warm now all our containers are clean and our Terk tube is full of past but it's way down in the tube how are we supposed to give to this out this is why it's good for it to be held just take your scissors and cut right up the middle of your straw now you can get your dab tool and to scoop it right out of it and now we got a big bat dam out of an otherwise empty container now that's tight that's the success Terp - yo buddy don't forget to subscribe for good vibes and I got nuggets of knowledge cuz when you watch the stream show it's like going to weed College [Music]", "GKsAskKo3Hc": "Everybody, how's it going?

Well, that's because all the terpenes have been boiled off and Honestly if you anybody who's had diamonds with that's just Straight white diamond versus or a clear diamond versus one that is that has terms in it Ten times out of ten. They'll say give me it what herbs I Mean this and this has like all of the cannabinoids still in there all your major and minors At least the way pure chem labs does it let's go. Let's go Digging deep here. I'm digging deep Look at Diamond action Shoot I don't know if diamonds are a girl's best friend anymore. I think maybe they still are but They might just be an all sexes best friend Now if if somebody wanted to Just get two diamonds out of here. You'd basically heat it up boil off the terpenes and You know, you can get a much like runny consistency But perfect. No, seriously, this is perfect for Dabney.

stuff and because of them know we are making this video it is Thanksgiving that they have given thanks so what better way to show thanks and to make the big review of this runts that they gave us [Music] by taking a whole gram to have a Thanksgiving that's right I'm going to attempt a full granddad challenge in the link down the description below you will see that I actually attempted a half a gram dab and back when I was like attempting to start dabbing again which was like seven months ago but before that I I took a long break of Daddy back in like 20 2014 2015 16 those wrong primers I was super dad hit like super Devers back when like shatter and live resin was like the thing anyway now you know I hop back on it this year and I'm a monster again so now I decided in the first time that I attend to the half granddad honestly I thought if I almost got it but I was dead I couldn't good I just couldn't handle it dad King Martin and his [ __ ] could probably handle this full grab so let's see if I'm not all taught and let's get to it so first of all I heard a guy rappers I'm just going to show you guys real quick a little preview [Music] that's just some gas live resin chatter everybody yes we're gonna have dad with this would you guys be able to do it let me know in the comment section down below I know there's videos of people doing way more like stupid fat dad but those are just like ridiculous I feel like those are waists absolutely as you guys can tell I'm fresh out the bed just woke up what better way to get this given started then with the full gram damn alright I was trying to give you guys a little story we're trying to you know render times as much as possible but enough of the talk with the intro you guys Sauber's you want to see get to the dab already so

textile extractions so my purpose is to go through that and start to finish so everybody kind of knows what I look for in selecting a back micron and then how to properly fold and load the bag bottle textile and some of the reasons that we do that so I'm gonna go and extract 3.5 grams of fresh flour and we'll open the flour to determine what micron a bag that I'm gonna use now these are our three different microns that we offer in the three and a half round bags the 160 micron which we'll use for fresher flour spongy flour that doesn't flake or crumble as the flour starts to dry out we'll start to use a smaller micron so we don't get any of the plant material flowing in with the rosin 120 and then we go all the way down to a 90 the difference in yield between 160 and and a 90 micron is maybe a half a percent so it's not a huge difference in yield my experience tells me but there is a small difference but when that half a percent extracts all the plant material out of it it's well worth it so that's why we go down at micron on bag so we're gonna open this this 8 and see what what condition it is in smells great and at state roll it's pretty moist I'll pull out an UGG and I'll just determine where it's at it's still nice and moist so I'm gonna go ahead and use a one sixty I don't think I'll get much in it it's right on the edge of a 120 and 160 but it's if it's between 69 70 percent all the way up to 73 percent humidity it should be about at 160 between sixty nine sixty six sixty five ish 120 anything below the 65 ish they use 90 or you can breathe some more life into the two with a Babita pack or something of that nature so anyway now that we've decided what bag we're gonna use I'm gonna take the three and a half gram hundred sixty micron bag out this one I'll get rid of the rest of these now of course we offer these in three and a half rounds seven grams and fourteen grams and if you're using any of our bags the bottle textile that we'll show you here is all the same just more material and those aren't that those ram size ratings aren't a must if you do much more than three and a half grams and a three and a half gram bag you have risk blowouts at lower than thirteen hundred and fifty psi on the actual material so the key to bottle tech now that we've determined that we're going to use 160 micron bag we have I think three and a half grams here supposed to be exactly what we got three and a half grams scale the first step to it is we'll take the actual bag that we're gonna use this one and we're gonna invert the bottom corners that's the first step to bottle textiles so I'm just gonna lift them inside out with my thumb it takes something somewhat sharp like a pair of scissors and I'll poke the corners in so they're completely inverted just like that when I put my thumb's in the pockets and I'll peel them back just a little bit so it looks like that and the corners overlap each other and what this will help with is it'll lock the cylinder in the coin like puck in at the end so it'll when it extracts you'll know the exact surface area size to be able to determine the exact pressure on the material to get a consistent result and you can multiply that result by multiplying bags in a press thus having the same pressure on material so having the corners overlapped like that now we'll start adding material to it bring our material over from here and what we do is remember it's gonna extract straight down so we'll one of the base in it put some of the smaller pieces I'll just drop them in kind of let them settle where they want to settle remember we're making a round coin like shape so once we get a base in there we'll go ahead and just kind of lightly press down so they'll be start filling the gaps and we start forming the bottom portion of the bag against the surface which folds the corners in like that drop the rest down here I don't want to at this point be too rough with the material I'm not trying to put the plant you know plant material and oils together I'd like to pull pressure to happen under heat that'll allow the extraction to happen properly so once I get the bag loaded like that and the bottom looks like that you can see how the corners overlap each other this will help hold them together when the extractions happening I'll take and cut the bag off about half an inch above the material line here one of the differences with Knux master bags is that they're double back stitched every stitch so that material that you cut it won't unravel on the bag you do experience blowouts with these bags you're probably um extracting under too much pressure these bags blow out at about thirteen hundred and fifty psi on the actual material so once we get it just like that we look at the bottom real simple the top we cut off half inch above the material line we fold it up like a little present on all four sides now the last side that we fold in is the side that we're gonna put between the plates that'll hold it all together so that very last fold of the present is the one that we're gonna slide in the plates this way now once you have see I'll fold it once again so once you have that all done you'll want to raise the press just about the height of the bag apart by doing that it holds the parchment real nice and what you'll see is we'll start to get an accordion effect when this comes down it's not putting outward pressure on the natural bag and that's why the keys to bottle textile if it holds the surface area and it allows you to have a consistent surface area that you're extracting with each time let's see how it has that accordion in effect on itself but that's pretty much the key to the bottle textile is packing your bags that way and that'll give you a consistent extraction result every time so when you start to work with a particular strain you can know what to expect at the end and I've got about 14 hour psi on the factual material I put too much actually so we'll see what the back good so that bottle textile extraction key is to have at the end the puck just like that that all your product separates wrong it'll be that same size every single time and with that reason for results like that thanks for choosing next measure", "HjVnvEy-IkA": "what is going on welcome back to the I smoke Channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today we're going to be covering diamonds and sauce versus shatter two forms of cannabis extract but what is the difference and how in fact are they similar those are the questions that we are going to be answering in today's video remember to hit that like and subscribe button if you are feeling these videos that helps us grow rich even more people and get our message out there so without further adieu let's talk diamonds and shatter I've got my Chuck B glass piece originating in the USA for today's video it's getting out of the Pelle case so I can show you what it looks like oh yes and we are gonna fill it with water you ready and here we go we are ready to kick off the video let's put this pillowcase away the old one 120 Pelle case what you need if you're traveling with your glass let's talk about the difference between shatter and diamonds and sauce we're gonna start with the most familiar form of extract that you've probably come across for ready it is shatter and this has been on the market since at least a few years ago but all the way people have been extracting cannabis going back to the last century recently shatter has become a much bigger thing lead partially due to the advent of medical legalization and recreational legalization in the States that is where this was first super popular and now extracts come in this form so what does she look like shatter can have different coloration but is generally gonna look a bit more stable than other forms of cannabis extract when you get shatter you will know it is shatter because it will literally shatter when you break it you can see from the way that it breaks although some of it may potentially be a little bit more sticky but basically shatter looks like this this is some lovely mimosa shatter we got beer 710 this is what shatter should look like if it is clean it might come in a different color look at the consistency look at the sort of golden hue and just just look at it guys you can see that that is some nice-looking chatter if it's tiny or if it has got too much chlorophyll or aged plant material eg trimming it it might be darker and you might see shatter that's like really dark almost black looking I wouldn't really want to dab that anymore but have done in the past how does it differ to diamonds and sauce well let's take you through what diamonds and silks of Diamonds themselves are almost pure THC a crystals basically 99 point something percent tetrahydrocannabinol where is the source is a mixture of Turks some cannabinoids and the flavonoids giving it this lovely rich flavor profile not being an extractor I don't know too much about the process of creating diamonds in source but the source is a really Turkey volatile cannabis extract that is on the other side of the spectrum to something like shatter shatter has a really nice stability to it although it may degrade into a more waxy like substance over time particularly when not refrigerated as those turps cannabinoids flavonoids begin to break down into a delicious extract soup that's when you'll see shatter waxing up diamonds and sauce basically is like honey sort of looking liquid the diamonds are the crystallization of that so that could happen when the extract has been left in a pressurized compartment over time it begins to crystallize and over the last few years the process has been honed and developed until we start seeing big thca crystals that look like rocks basically and that is diamonds and source I really like the flavor profile you get on this I think it's very hard to replicate the diamonds and sauce flavor profile in shatter or even in fact in other forms of cannabis extracts the more stable something is the less in my experience is the flavor some exploded in my mouth you know a lot whether it's with the Diamonds and sauces so volatile goes turps something which is unparalleled so this is some lemon skittles diamonds and sauce you might be familiar with the skittles strain skittles with that is a really popular Cali import strain lemon skills in their skills cross and this is the diamonds and source of that straight away I can tell you that out the to extract this one smells really nice this one smells about ten times nicer you get a little bit of the aroma with the shatter but with the diamonds and sauce it is really really stinky in a really lovely way for the lemon citrus the skills sweetness you know that fruity pebbles types or a sweetness I've got both of them in front of me I can smell this one and I can't smell this one diamonds and sauce is going to smell a bit stronger because of the volatile nature of the extract you know it's lighter pea sauce shatters a little bit more stable than that stability means that you can pick it up with your hand as you see with this shutter I can just pick it up and hold it and that is because it is nice and stable allowing me to do that without it breaking down I couldn't pick this up and hold it I'd get it sauce all over my hands and that would be a waste we need Abdul for that so that's a comparison between shatter and diamonds and source hopefully I haven't missed much out do feel free to add your input your insights in the comments section I think that people will be wondering what the difference is between the different forms of cannabis extract and Shatter versus diamonds and sauce is an interesting comparison should we dab some first of all we're gonna start with these shatter this is mimosa another really popular cannabis strain that I'm sure some of you would have heard of so you can say this is Shattuck is as I'm digging my dad's hole into it it's literally splintering off into little portions you need to be careful with shatter particularly when cold that you don't accidentally flick it off of your your parchment paper and onto the floor sometimes it can be harder to pick up with a dab tool than than with your fingers as this is proving because it's just not sticky we are ready to go live with this dab of mimosa shatter and I'll see you guys on the other side wow that mimosa flavor is delicious but I do find with shatter he's sort of got a very slight chattery taste to it so you sort of can taste the form of cannabis extract it is now a wonder whether that is actually the lack of volatile Terps meaning that it's not as flavorsome as other forms now there is also something to say about open-loop blasting versus closed-loop distilled butane both of these forms of extract are extracted using a solvent it looks like this it is called butane and it is the same gas as goes into your blow torches your clipper lighters etc obviously handling this stuff in an enclosed environment is dangerous it is extremely flammable that is why it is recommended that if you don't know what you're doing do not try this at home I've spoke to more than one extractor that has told me that they've had an accident in the past and it's not really a little accident when it involves things like explosions and fire so stay safe people there are safer ways to make your own extracts at home just look at rosin all right should we do a dab of the diamonds and sauce and see how it compares to that in the motor shaft that we just tried I think we should it isn't the best shape to dad till family in diamonds and source actually but I think we're gonna be able to to get your nights tab allows a these looks great guys we're about to do this tab right now and I'll see you on the other side tears folks [Music] wowsa oh man all the flavor got me that dad makes your eyes forward sometimes that was intense that was expansive that actually gave me the sweats guys been a long time since I got the sweats doing a DAB the flavor of the lemon skills diamonds and sauce is absolutely incredible through the coffin I was able to get that delicious sweetness you know just as it smells it tastes and I've been dabbing that all yesterday I'm really loving that flavor so which is my favorite out of diamonds and sauce and shatter it has gotta be the diamonds and source guys and girls it is a delicious form of cannabis extracts able to give me the sweat after all this dabbing that's pretty impressive and it is certainly particularly that version of it a winning flavor and dabbing experience shutter is nice but it's got that shattering flavor but I think with the Diamonds and sauce you get this like magical level of flavor that you don't really experience anywhere else saying that though with diamonds and sauce you definitely don't need a big dab those crystals of THC a are expansive and very very strong and I just experienced that from a normal-sized dad got me quite a bit high up and giving me the sweats which I don't mind it's been a while since a DAB has done that to me but what do you think of this video folks what is your favorite form of extract have you tried dabbing it they leave your comments below this has run on to 24 minutes of filming supposed to be in a three minute video that has been the video comparing the diamonds and sauce and the shutter that's it for the moment as always thanks for watching and keep token stepping on here rollercoaster going down but I never felt this high biggest right how the century [Music]", "_cBnbmY67EU": "[Music] alright you might have seen the intro already but I wanted to open this because I'm actually outside Blake's house and the lighting in his room isn't the best and he's always playing music so I figure I just opened this right now and the only reason I want to do this right now is begin not at home is because I actually want them to try it as well you know I want to share with them I want them to know what they think of it you know I'm saying so I wanted to do the opening right now and then I will do the review at home by myself later on so if you do see me like you know in a car and then a mouse that's what happened guys we're just gonna be looking at it okay so this was bought at phenols I believe it was $28 and it's white Tahoe cookies and it's live resin butter know what threw me off was filled is usually a lot more expensive but then when they said butter I was like oh you know I'm saying because when it comes to the type of concentrate that actually costs a lot of money because butter is part of like the easiest concentrate to make other than probably rosin you know rosin very simple but you do need expensive gear and stuff the butter is generally pretty easy you know I'm saying so that's why it was only like 25 dollars a gram I noticed that the THC percentage is pretty low but like I said it doesn't really matter about just THC you know there's other things involved and it's live resin so it should be some terpenes up in there to kick it up a notch so let's just open this I don't want to just kind of keep the box nice and Christine for the what I'd a bit or a later I might just rip it cuz [ __ ] it gets a box right care about a box but yeah why Tahoe cookies has been I've talked about it on this channel before oh wow very very nice I've tried some of the fields stuff before as well I have never tried their cartridge though what the hell what off the bat I really like the packaging this is very very easy sheet look at this [ __ ] you could [ __ ] have this on like a shoe design you know and be dope that's pretty [ __ ] dope dice oh wow it looks like wow I'm actually pretty surprised I wasn't expecting this I haven't empty said butter I thought it'd be like a crumble ish but it's like a light color which I really enjoy okay 20 I'm gonna say $28 maybe 27 I don't know around there but Wow okay excu a look at it first let me get the thumbnail get the thumbnails always yeah alright guys back at my house I am going to continue the review of this field extract white Tahoe cookies no I'm saying if I already opened the box and all that before I went to play Xcel's but now that we're at home we're gonna finish this review off drop the bat low very very nice packaging I did not keep the dab tool that it came with I gave it to Blake but this slip is pretty good like yeah they were actually impressed like I gave money a hit and then he was like I'm about to go there right now even though he just went to the club like two hours we'll hope that honestly says a lot filled extracts usually is a pretty expensive to you know very very creamy creamy looking we're just gonna take a hit since they're gaming right now I'm probably just gonna mute them for now I'm saying but that was RJ and Ben on the game you know saying so we're gonna take a hit of this and then we're just gonna tell you a little bit more about the product itself I'm saying not bad I'm like oh I feel the extracts usually they have that sauce that kind of looks like a sugar wax sugar sauce see wax you know I'm saying you know boys [Music] [Music] very very clean taste very smooth - for a hit that I just took like that size I usually would be coughing but very very pleasant not to like chirpy but you can definitely taste like a slight hint of like like some cookies you know some very earthy pungent I don't know how else to describe it but it's a very familiar taste and not bad like first price and I've always wanted to do like a field extracts video or another one after that because I kind of did like it it was just too pricey but yes another thing I like to mention is I mentioned this on most of my videos but the price that I get it it's not the price that you're gonna get out depending on where you are so please be aware of that I don't want to steer you in the wrong way you know just because I get it for 29 doesn't that mean you'll get it for you know what hopefully you do get it for 29 and yeah other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video just another product video hope you guys can understand this is pretty good stuff I'm not gonna lie other than that have a great day [Music]", "t3guzHArEDo": "this video is for mature audience if you're not a mature audience then watch this video today we have a four gram jar of some double black concentrates VBS carat diamonds they're VBS carat diamonds are some of the larger largest a big diamonds I've ever seen so we're gonna see what we've got here I got a four gram jar of the lemon bezel and it's about seventy five percent total THC and I can't wait to crack into this let's see if we got some good stuff [Music] [Applause] and this lemon diesel smells so good and there's one diamond in there it's like so much bigger than the rest it's like [Music] yeah let's let's get into this all right so the VVS diamonds look really good let's have a coke sesh with them right now [Music] well I'm a big tester all of us that's gonna get smells gonna happen but if you liked this video make sure you subscribe to the channel for more content in the future and for a lot content tune in to my twitch in and twitch.tv slash Cubans they have live right now", "qzeEWxC1UQc": "smoking man growin and watch it fall down [Music] what is up DTC's got it real hanging out super psyched to have a new friend Julian from Bab logic over hey thank you for having me really yes yes hey I appreciate you guys blew it up at the deconcentration celebration yeah yeah yeah no it was a fun time yeah you took home you took home I think was third place in there boys what was this again you brought some with you yeah we can each owns the HT batter it's like really high terpene high potency yeah this is oops this is one to remember right here you brought two of them I like yeah I brought a couple kami I brought a truck Korean or trap cookies and so what's your specialty if you guys were dab logic what are y'all known for um we create high quality you know highly purified high terpene solving with hash oils solvent less overall solvent list so we specialize in ninety micronized soil we also specialize in the different types of bras in all the way from our newest product which is like the HT batter's all the way through like the HT show weight HT what's that mean hide your bathing yeah basically anything you know reaching on the 15% you know mark we consider pretty high tech 15 yeah 15% terpenes just pretty freakin high yeah especially for solving lists you know most concentrates are around six to eight percent on the standard market really a lot even less than that most most standard solvent less concentrates that you'll find on the market are probably about four to five even all right so help me out there help me evaluate concentrates what makes a good concert we're going to the dispensary together what we looking for yeah so when I go in and I look for a good concentrate first thing I do is you know you don't get to smoke the product in the dispensaries know you got to evaluate yeah you have to evaluate it either you know through your nose through sight you know right and then through prior you know prior time smoking either something that like that or but they could think about the colors beautiful on that yeah color colors is that you know is that to live or die by totally a giveaway you know I mean if you're looking at something and it's green or it has like you know a really dark amber to it you know it might be dagger dated it might have had heat stress you know something like that or it could be just the nature of the plant you know something like the truck the truck cookies that's always gonna have at least on the phenotype that's being passed around right a lot of the hash and being created from it right now yes it has that orange you know you cue to it yeah it's almost purple in the hue you know and when you press that and refine it it becomes like this orange almost amber like but that's beautiful orange I got a glowing orange I got no problem yeah yes smoked something that's glowing or it's the earth tones that I have a problem with yeah what does it are that's a sign that chlorophyll it's Asano's beat up too much yeah so when a plants cut if it's cut fresh you know a lot of these plans a lot of people are making fresh frozen and for plants cuts cut fresh it's gonna release Greenleaf volatiles which are different esters Josh aldehydes and you know alcohols that are released by the plant those end up actually soluble eyes in chlorophyll chlorophyll has a few different colors chlorophyll can be anywhere from purple all the way to you know the green that we know about well like purple is that like when plants purple up at the end is that chlorophyll that's so yes there's something to do with the chlorophyll and in the biosynthetic pathway that it actually takes right it's either heated or as it's you know matures or ages but a lot of times that's antioxidants is well produced by the plant such as anthocyanin or something similar to that those antioxidants even have somewhat of a smell to them even they're found in a lot of berries they're found in God and things like that so that's you kind of you know start to realize okay the purple plans have this berry-like or grape-like kind of smell to it it's kind of through that anti oxidant pathway and the enzymes that produce those right so and that's all based on the genetic makeup of the plant I have a very natural next question how the hell did you learn all this stuff man you go to school for this are you just a Googler so there's not much information out there there's a lot of there's a lot of people who are pursuing to find the actual chemistry the actual science behind a lot of this stuff right some of that has been published what has been published you know you can find Ethan Rousseau dr. moosh dr. Musallam alright people like that okay they are pioneering a lot of this stuff and you're just reading their white papers and you read then read their work and then we also you know we work with scientists on our team as well we have a scientist from the University of Boulder who worked in the Caine lab and we're so he's an extra he's a expert in genomics so okay bioinformatics and things like that Wow it's so crazy that in the cannabis company have to have a genomics expert yeah you learn how to hire them I mean yeah it's starting to evolve to the point where now if we want to really you know pursue this we have to understand it more solving this hash is something that's kind of coming back from where it was you know in the past that's all there was there were thousands of years ago if you were to look at you know what cannabis crasher from you know it was charas and you know things on the hands it was the right amount of heat and pressure under pressure that you're able to even remove it from your hand or even able to change the right the chemistry of it because they didn't start smoking it you know it hated to be decarboxylated in order for that to happen it had to be left out in the Sun for a certain amount of time or it had to be heated to a specific temperature for a certain amount of time right you know and through this alchemy that you know has evolved I mean they found plants that were more beneficial for those processes you know that's why what we know of today as the hash varieties come from a very small group of plants because those came out of you know Afghanistan and Grammy Hall and you know places like that that we're actually using hash as a resource for a long time yeah makes sense that's pretty cool I'm just trying to think like everybody's got a different art you know growing can be an art shift photography can be an art what's your what you ought man yeah the art so the art really is involved with just uncovering mechana bees resin you know there's so much there that we don't really know about there's so your the extract artists I don't even know what's your title at that company I don't have one I founded dialogic founder - ice that's a great title because you're gonna have to do anything after what you already did your work no I still I still work with hash you know every day I'm still with the plants and every charge in my fingernail exactly no you just don't think yeah but uh yeah I'm still with the resin every day you know I who I started creating who I created that logic with right was some close friends that also still to this day are are doing different uh different extracts and working with the resin so it's a big industry man yeah so I wait how many people is we just laughing but you came to my studio and saw my work yeah about five guys yeah they all stopped and took a break to take it does take a couple dabs from you totally yeah yeah what's your work scene like what's it like to work at dab logic how many people to start with so I have five people on the the actual extraction team my California team is now expanding I have one guy out there right now but we're in the process of getting expanding that team our lab is just getting the CEO so we're just getting we're just able to move in your building out we had to you know gut the whole place and redo it all for insulation and you guys to talk of something logical you know the whole nine moved in a huge walk-in freezers you know cuz we have to we're taking a lot off you know off these mountains and in Humboldt so yeah can we talk about that for a second just said I was asking about your like I was in Cali for the I don't know can I call it Cali I heard that don't live in California called Cali yeah I mean it's humble it's where it's at right here you know Northern California yeah so you were there we're supposed to hang out last week and you're like dude its I'm out here still harvesting yeah and then I'm like alright so you tell me about what you got a 120,000 square foot indoor there is that right so no no no not that quite that big we got 20,000 square feet makes you like a computer we have hundred acres up off the grid and other 600 acres that's being built built out still isn't fully that 600 acres and fully permitted or license yet I'm not pulling anything off it yet but that's a beautiful property that property goes from the top of a mountain all the way down to the valley there's a river there should be good water oh and I make important water as important mazing water there's huge ponds and the property and streams and so that and that's your your founder that's your baby right there so that I'm partnered with the company Verde Verde natural they're out of they were started here in Denver by guy Chuck and he eventually partnered with who now is the main owner of the company Jeff he has expanded this company you know dramatically he's who took on dialogic and we got and flew it up and I mean you gotta have balls or night ball if you have to know what you're doing to first off do a hundred acres some people have success enough with your 100 acres to do 600 acres yeah yeah service schedule for that has to be amazing totally and I mean you know we don't grow on the whole hundred you know there's a lot that goes into actually running these this big of a farms and you're talking you know huge you know ponds and huge almost irrigation lines that are actually sure culvert it into the into the ground I run a 20 acre bamboo farm yeah yeah purty I was like yeah I was like yeah you need water you need a well you need huge yeah you need a water cleaning system yeah yeah yeah and we're trying to you know be all organic and you know the whole soil all that come on let's get into the growth first off how the hell do you do living I okay I got it you find a place with good soil if you're gonna do living soil on 100 or 600 acres I mean we bring in we do a mixture of local humble Mendocino County dirt and then we bring in some Canadian soil as well yeah yeah that just sound great water that stuff's yeah it's amazing that already is microbial active when it when it gets there you know it already has a nice you know uh humic body to share sure it's not ain't nothing sterile yeah yeah you know if it's and I think they do inoculate that would mycorrhizae don't they I know that they pull out of that out of some plots that they have along the old-growth and that God is definitely as major fungal and bacterial actually seen a peat mine or a peat bog I don't even mind yeah back near uh an old growers to have I Drive by it and it was like whoa what is that thing it's just cutting into the earth yeah I know yeah the pits interesting there that's a finite resource in there you know yeah it is yeah yeah I will say Florida peat not as good as a reason they imported from Canada so that's actually really cool that's alright so as long as we're talking grow how do you give quality and quality outs yeah how do you have first off indoor grows got to be tremendously different than an outdoor grow right yeah completely different different processing then on your end here that your the extract you noticed I mean definitely I was talking to somebody I was talking to it was loving in her eyes yesterday and she was talking about how to be I was asking her how to be a you know a really top quality extract artist she goes get to know your resin I think it was friend she can always that originally said it her for get to know your resin you know everything's different you know your room and your resin is gonna be different absolutely yeah when you move from grow to grow or you're starting a new grow and it's new growers its new people it's a new soil mix it's a new everything sure you know it is scary you know you're coming in with varieties you know it's not like we can really transfer varieties from state to state ads so it's like we're having to find and source varieties in California wait really that we haven't ran yet but I mean you can't or you can't uh so I mean a wedding cake can find its way over an account we have wedding cake we have like all you know I know you would never talk about other people no there is there is ways to definitely get them over they audit and through in through tissue culture and things like that we can actually legally do this stuff if we're sending over callous and undifferentiated cells we can actually send that across state lines and technically it's a gray area sure it's not a cannabis plant so they can't call you out on it you know I'm just sitting here being like oh it's so silly you should be able to smuggle stuff anywhere you want but I think about all I'm from South Florida you've got people from South America and all over the place that are smuggling little plants in because it's tropical these plants from their home they are bringing so many diseases literally Jersey palm decline they have straight-up palm decline there because people are bringing palm seeds and growing palm seeds that were laminated yeah it's a huge deal yeah it's scary I mean you know we truly we want to find varieties that we know are gonna work right but we also want to be able to work with as many things as we can so it's really just finding the lineage and delving into where are these plants coming from can i source plans of that lineage from whoever you know in the area that's mainly what we look into do you have any other growers in your area cannabis or hemp because that would be a freakin nightmare if you had people growing hemp for biomass no it's okay in Humboldt County there is a lot of cannabis growing you know there's tea farm everywhere you look is there pollen I'm in there saying if there's pollen in the air and your she gets pollen there could potentially be pollen there could potentially be molds from other Wright farms and things like that so we have to be very careful you know a with who we let on the property be with you know how we filter and maintain the air quality and our property is this completely outdoor these are greenhouses what are we doing with the the big properties are outdoor they're full season that's just right in the Sun you know exposed to as many you know anything that happens yes there's a greenhouse you see matter space in that even there there will be greenhouses there will be all sorts of stuff that I put on those properties it's still gonna have full Sun and greenhouse or full Sun depending on how you grow depending on you know what varieties you're doing you could have very good full Sun that goes well depending you know how your season is out there really it's seasonal you know you could have a fall that's extremely rainy and damages your whole crop in the six-day period you know you could have a fall season that's sunny amazing and warm and there's no rain in sight all through flower and everything was beautiful she kept your dust down and you maintained your property and you did well enough to be able to like oh yeah I can you know harvest these plants that are gonna be very well do very well for you know some of those extracts yeah I mean you're talking about hmm having some problems you know if the weather is wrong mm-hmm or doesn't cooperate you know that basically catastrophic crop failure totally yeah we're doing all sorts of stuff that we can to mitigate that as the season progresses you know we're watching weather we're watching humidity we're watching as things are moving up the coast and into the mountains it's what you do though well we can prepare you know like if if a heavy rains coming you know that's gonna be very damaging the other show if you if things aren't stake properly your trellis properly not like that it's gonna just destroy your field you know just based on that alone so that's um you can do not even though huge raindrops or hail hitting those bus cream yeah yeah and I mean we we're trying to develop different rain protection systems that we will put up once the plans get more in the flour and it'll just be short little lean-to type frames that basically go over and they'll be big but they're only gonna be able to protect a few of the chosen plans right one it's not gonna be the whole thing you know so we'll start going through the that whole property was done from seed so that is also we're doing Fino hunting there so you need that yeah some special ones over there yes I mean there's we pop 2,000 seeds you know so it's a big female hunt we got the varieties from a guy Jesse his company as bio vortex they do amazing stuff at Humboldt Wow he's in another leaf Trinidad area not actually I think his farm is actually really cool know him I think I have run into him before yeah he's a great guy he I could probably swing it his way too but uh he does so many talks and writing and get a home but sure absolutely in a cannabis and absolutely gonna get your culture you know my beef is with everybody that's that's putting their their lives on the line their livelihoods on the line for cannabis is that in Florida if I were to have you know 600 acres of palm trees and they got a disease or they got wiped out by a hurricane you know what happens I get to buy myself a Mercedes man the government comes in it gives me 50 70 90 percent of what the hell that entire crop was worth and I had a check for three million you know I'm sorry if it's that many acres yeah yeah tens or twenties a million oh yeah I just sold my entire inventory before before it was even mature yeah if we get hit with you know as I guess outdoor cannabis growers there's no catastrophic insurance for us I'm sure there will be once event organization happens but kind of gotta be hard to get people to throw their life savings into you know or I should even say it's just an investor and that's and that's the thing and that's why you know we do what we do you know that logic is like we need the best material we you know that when you're getting something from us it's going to be the best because we can't take some thing that failed you know write anything that failed it's it's it's either has to be compost or its you know if if if it can be you know saved in any way from hydrocarbon extraction but that's you know what's scary about that is right people you know lose a crop or something like that and they pull it to that and it's who knows what mycotoxins heavy metals things like that are contained within that yeah how do you feel about BHO you solvent list newt or what I typically only smoke solving this hash um just because you want to solve this company yeah and I'm you know I'm in the industry I see what happens you know with I do carbon extractions and don't get me wrong there are some amazing right carbon extractions out there and it's important that you know that that side of the industry exists in Georgia they're you know keeping the earth clean and they're you know doing what it takes you know I could see one be one type you know blast rooms and things like that and I think it's fine the exist bad promotion for the cannabis industry for extracts of if they're blowing up with Dirk scanning themselves we don't we don't want that and you know a lot of times people don't know the difference between distillate or solvent lives or something like that you know found someone like us someone like us would know because it's its second nature whatever by now but it's like you know when I talked to somebody from Wisconsin or I talked to someone sharing Oklahoma or Alabama or you know somewhere like it's all good there even people out in California you know northern Northern California you know they're there's so much distillate there's so much hydrocarbon extraction everybody's running to ashes big freakin farms up there okay there's nobody that can press come close to processing that size of farms yet which is you know I mean so it's like look like a factory over there Shh I mean they are a lot of the hydrocarbon facilities around 24/7 and yeah I can take on a thousand pounds a day Jesus mm-hmm Wow what do you think you guys's capacity is gonna be in California I mean you're gonna need to have some see you've got hundreds of acres yeah it's an it's not quite that big in again we're selective for solve unless gotta take the best out of these fields we take only the best so it's it's something that when we're doing and we do about a hundred pounds fresh per per wash is what will got we what we do got um so that only happens two to three times a week typically it's something that takes a lot more effort you know through the whole process it's something that we can't really just throw it in the tube blasts it out throw write purge oven and let it sit for three weeks it's like there's a lot of processing and there's a lot of maintaining and being very careful and being you know quick but also you know taking your time yeah what how do you get the young quality and quality out when it comes to when it comes to you know Roz and I guess how do you get it to where what if you have a problem I guess is what I'm trying to say in the grow yeah soil so it's kind of tough to correct that yeah it's some things off balance if there's you know some something that may have been watered wrong or you know fed improperly yeah that a B word what about bugs bugs I mean bugs are definitely a problem you know if you're if you're dealing with large scale cultivation but you know if you're maintaining cleanliness you're maintaining rigorous integrated pest management systems leaving meaning predatory insects very cool in vegetative state never in flower it's also using you know specific essential oil sprays or oil sprays that could be used in vegetative state never in flower beautiful you know one thing that we do is we make sure that our products aren't sprayed if it's coming to me cannot even come close to being sprayed it can't and that's why if a farmer that's why we have to be so selective that's why we have to grow and we have to inspect product you know even if like our own farmers are out there there they might be doing something to save their own crop so we have to go out there and inspect that and make sure that's either not happening or if it is happening we need to move on and get to the plants that you know or part of the crop or even move through the crop altogether you know and only take you know something from yang on their farm I had tasted and by no means a connoisseur I like extracts don't get me wrong but I'm not a connoisseur and I tasted something that I was like this tastes like sulfur like it looks good he's like sulfur like obey me use the sulfur burner and you know a little bit too late that could be you know there's especially you know if you're an old-school farmer right and you're doing things you're trying to be organic you know you could use a sulfur burn you know but that nowadays most people are aware that that comes through a in the cannabis smoke would be way more in the concentrates you know so but there are varieties you can lineage you know coach lineage that could the diesel lineage that could lean towards like that skunky sulfuric almost type smell got a stir so you know if it's important that know your grower it's important to know you're know where your weeds coming from grow your own most importantly I mean that's why we you know it's why we do what we do is so that we can grow something that you can be certain is going to actually be something that you would drove you ain't smoke you know we don't we would never put something something in our products that you wouldn't I wouldn't personally use myself there's so many people that I just let like b-grade stuff pass through just because they're like oh nobody will know what he can tell showing in extracts it's this or that or it's going to this dispensary they'll buy I've been dispensaries and I'm like oh you buy the shift exactly yeah so it's important for us you know to sharing you know relationship with the growers and maintain the relationship with people that were selling to you know yeah what's up with the dispensaries on the other end because you kind of middleman as far you can't go in and actually rep your product during no I mean some dispensaries allow us to come in and you know frame help market help train route kind of create awareness yeah if you come in you don't know what's sitting on the Shelf right why are you gonna buy it you know well like you got this pen people are in the cartridges it's kind of going away from that you know putting your extract in a pen and having to reload it these things are super low-profile super convenient what's the first off go into a dispensary you know be like hey what kind of good cartridges do you have and sometimes they'll go none don't buy them here they're all mix of propylene glycol and stuff like that what's the secret first just cuz I'm in the cartridges because I'm picked this one up so cuz I'm gonna hit it so something like this out what's the secret to make them something a good cart what's the difference in a good part of a shitty cart this has no cut this has none of the propylene glycol MCT oil any bogus food grade this or that else is 100% from cannabis and it's also and lessly made so it's it's a high terpene extract put into a vape cart is what it is it's not something that somebody made to get rich quick it's yeah this is real hash I remember they made more convenient yes something you could melt your hash into and then you could put it in your vape pens yeah and I mean it's terrible there's a little bit of post-process like you you if you just stick show into a cart it's gonna crystallize it's gonna kind of coagulate and it'll be hard to smoke lawyers you know so creating the proper terpene ratio and things like that is very important you know and that's is that strain dependent or that's very strained dependent with us it's a hundred percent strain depending because we can't really manipulate the terpenes too much or the constant we can somewhat manipulate concentration right can't we can't change what's there you know it's like if what's there is there so we're just kind of working with what we have to kind of make this yeah makes sense if you guys make carts you guys make it what does he cause batters yeah the the carts something we've been doing for the past two years year and a half something to make it more convenient sitting so that also somebody who doesn't have a rig and doesn't typically dab right can actually use our product this is super this never really happened before the vape car it was not quality was yeah yeah so it's like being able to formulate you know the get it from this to that was huge yeah it was the game for us and really has made it so that my mom my grandma my aunts and uncle rate of have able to have been able to try my product whereas before they can I get a really good order yeah even though what it was you know couldn't couldn't even wrap their head around it yeah but we we you know what with most hash makers you know the the goal isn't I need my car nice oil you know a lot of times we're taking now because so many people love the rosin and things like that we're taking our ninety micron pressing that right having specified batches that are ninety might come or 90 120 mixtures sure like that the higher grade microns and that's what's getting some that's more often than not that's what we're pressing now because it's just what people are after and water hash is also good side of the market but it's it probably accounts for twenty twenty percent of the actual solving with sales and those riding the whole grand scheme of things seems to go quick do no otter hash yeah it's expensive yeah you know the high grades there's unless you're doing you know extremely large batches there's not a crazy amount of it you know maybe a couple hundred grams you know something like that so it's something that's very limited something that's not you can't take something low grade and make it into ninety micron ISIL it has to be grown perfectly it has to be done perfectly actually washed perfectly so we presented and given you the consumer perfectly as well you know so we have to keep it maintained you know from start to finish you know a cold environment on it you know we have to make sure the people who are selling our product right the consumer are also keeping in the right environment and then we have to let our consumer know and they have to have the education to be able to know to put this in the fridge or to keep it cold they asked something that maintains that you know environment we have a kegerator and we never use it having a kegerator in the house is actually a bad idea so why I started hiding my dad's in there man they you just don't have enough refrigerators once people know you keep them in the fridge yeah they figure it out me yeah every fridge in the house yeah bad hey we're talking about these cartridges you obviously if you were in for a year and a half ago you were getting in the days you were a little bit ahead of the trend ahead look her how they how do you keep a head into curve and what's coming up next around the next curve for cannabis yeah we're always trying to keep ahead next big curb you know we're looking at I see a lot of people are like pushing for you know really like colored high flavor hi hi flavor profile resins like 710 it's white yeah yep yep so it's really it's shooting for that shooting for the holler proper color high terpene me but also still maintaining you know the right you know potency you know because if you're pulling too early on some of this stuff you're just getting something that tastes like cucumbers and like wait up just doesn't even get you that high it's like if you want something that has the full body flavor like you have to take it to its prime maturity you know we we have to get out of the kind of mentality that ambered trichomes like when it starts to amber that's starting to show my maturity cuz that's like that's already overly matured you know like yes we're trying to pull a little bit before that ever even happens before the first amber trichome happens like the day before that would be the perfect you know yeah I'm just saying and this is I mean cuz you're trying to bring something great to your customer something extraordinary so when they try all of them they like to dab logic that's that's the one I like yeah how educated is the customer did they get it a shopping price do you have to it's just like cmed you're gonna we can educate them on that stuff or they end up buying hemp seed oil for you know eight dollars on Amazon and thinking oh everything is good ya know I mean education is huge most people they don't know the difference between like quality organic solvent list and some low-grade hydrocarbon I straight up they don't eighteen dollar shadow yeah and with CRC tech like the color mediation for like hydrocarbons and things like that I heard something about what the hell is color remediation they're pulling chlorophyll and you know oxidants out of out of the hash you know which is great because that leads to a higher grade hash but it's also like discern or both from like something that is high grade you know it's like okay this this just is high grade because I grew it right I maintain it I took care of it I processed it right you know this came from any run of a mill place with who-knows-who doing them whatever and it's coming out looking the same you know that's the that's the thing yeah plastic surgeries you know a couple yeah so it's gonna be then you know now going back through the customer finding you know the nose the trained eye things like that being able to actually understand what what you're getting you know yeah and that's hard you know if we're we're still in the phases of trying to teach people what good genetics are you know and you more if they're not even understanding the Terp why those genetics are good the terpenes that they're producing the cannabinoid profiles that they're producing them we're gonna be like then they're gonna just be sitting there clueless when anybody can call anything whatever they were you know I mean most of the country thinks independence atiba there's two varieties of cannabis one gets you up let me get you down exactly yeah and it's who's that well who's your I've heard I was actually at the dispensary one time it must be right after Social Security checks were issued hmm to what everybody was 55 60 years old so you know I mean they were older yeah I was just kind of wondering like where the growth is I actually was talking to somebody and they were telling me look the people that are smoking weed are already smoking weed you know what we're really after now is the people that aren't smoking weed the other 85% of population we're looking for you guys say you know ever think in that that way or is that why you got stuff like these pens yeah they really make it I think what the vape is designed for its to give it to anyone who can basically take a hit you know if you can take a hit you can try this pen there isn't even a button on it right it's magnetic it's just you know it just slides right in yeah it's so easy to use it's nothing like heating up a nail and take your day about measuring a dose all that kind of stuff this you just measure with the pup knows how hard you're drawing you know so it's it's per a buddy of mine called me I've been talking about this guy because I feel terrible about it a guy knew back in Florida had a stroke and you just case just told me he goes my body's hanging off me you know it's my hair and my leg of my arm and he's like it starts hurting and I was met recommended that he grabbed one of these pens and check him out it's not a cannabis user and magically he got one and he's like dude I like it and it's really cool cuz in the beginning you could take like a couple of one hit and you're like wow yeah I have a friend that has psoriatic arthritis shoutout to Paul and yeah it's really bad man where sometimes he just can't move his hands and it sucks cuz he's uh has like a technical job as well he will take one hit of the right strain and he just goes like immediately he goes I'm all better I'm all better mm-hmm David it's amazing and I was absolutely I don't know if you got any medical cannabis stories or not I mean like that is so inspirational to me totally my yellow rooftops you know my grandma actually has went through cancer twice she has you know used cannabis to help her right through different chemo treatments and things like that she's fully off chemo now and she's only using cannabis and CBD you try to help and you know so that's kind of where she's at sure the whole world would change their mind on cannabis if somebody handed them a joint when they had a stomachache okay know what I mean that's all they would have to do is when he had a snowman somebody joint they got I instantly feel better I can actually empathize with the psoriatic arthritis guy cuz think about having a horrible stomach game taking one hit of weed and being like I can get up off the floor I can get out of bed you know terrible state your intestines I've never been ashamed of cannabis always been me Oh doing what I can to let people know that this legit shouldn't be considered deal with all the other drugs while the other armful drugs know it's a medicine I agree 100% yeah and that's kind of what we do - it's a logic is the reason we're organic the reason we choose solvent less is because we want to give you the purest truest medicine you know we don't want anything getting in the way between you and nature in this plant you know we're just presenting you with as close as you can get to it you know so it's it's then up to you you know to use this medicine however you choose you know whether it's dope and your consciousness or whether it's to heal your ailments or just a plain old you know relax you know like all of those things are so important you know to de-stress and to unwind like it's part of why we all use cannabis and it's so so important you know and that's why I think cannabis users as a whole have that mentality in that mindset of for lack of a better word we're chill you know sure it affects you I think I think it affects your brain you smoke enough weed it shows you out of it that's actually a generalization know some crazy [ __ ] just smoke weed all day they're not the least bit chill oh well yeah no I mean thinking of one that was a pink shirt you know just knows how much weed they use but let me ask you a question so we're talking about the expansion we're talking - everyone should smoke weed all right they everyone should consider it a medicine anyhow so do you want federal legalization that's a super double-edged sword they're super sharp one I mean I don't look at medicine as pharmaceutical in any way you know I hate do it yeah they do they do they think you know put it into a pill or make it something that's completely controllable something that we can maintain and control reacts down to the milligrams same way oxycontin is a molecule that they can control exactly you know and by doing that they take away the whole plan the full spectrum you know aspect of it and using THC on its own I mean all the studies show that it's way way way less beneficial than using in conjunction with Kurt beanies and other cannabinoids that are found actually within those plants so no to federal legalization just cuz just gonna commoditize I mean federal legalization I think will be the last thing that happens what I think will end up happening is states will end up partnering with one another we'll be like we'll see California Oregon Washington State interstate they'll partner what's going in there yeah all of a sudden you know it'll open up other other avenues for other states and it'll be able to follow a trail through our country one way or another you know and as long as that money files which follows a trail the federal government somehow will probably be ok yeah exactly I mean it's everybody knew it was coming you know it was like the Jack Herer initiative of 2012 it was his whole thing you know it's prophecy it's good there's no way you're super you can't win an election by saying that you're against cannabis there's no way yeah once cuz we've been fighting for so long brother kids yelling it yeah I love it I love it worriers boom and we're back and magically we're taking - yo so where can people get this stuff anyway so you can grab it at vert and verts and Fort Collins if you're in this area otherwise if you're in Denver you can always get it at Verde if you're in Boulder you can get it at Verde nice that Verde carries the largest selection of dialogic products overall so deal

information on our site including calculator tools and turb files be sure to check us out there knock Smasher calm [Music]", "adMUJRGqIP8": "everyone welcome to my jar Tech tutorial well not really jar take away my version of jar attack the reason I say that is because there's a bunch of ways you can do quote-unquote jar tech but the way I like it is to make the material really buttery and really hard so what I do to get that material pretty much all I've done so far is I squish seven grams of flour I put it it got it from the parchment and with my tool and I've put it on to a jar with no lid in between plates and it's out 1:29 and sitting at that for about 10 minutes so I'll come back to you guys and probably about half an hour to an hour once that's a little bit more buttered up so I can whip it and I'll let you guys know what I mean by whipping it then because you can see that's already kinda starting to butter up and that's what we want but we're gonna let it go for about another half hour to an hour so see you guys yep so what I have done here is I've pretty much just taken a little dab tours you can see right there there's now a little bit dirty and I've just stirred this rosin around I noticed that one part was getting really buttery but the rest was staying really runny I actually even noticed that it's trying to build like some sort of I mean try to zoom in there some sort of like little diamonds or like some hard pieces of rosin super-dope but um as you can see it's been whipped now and I'm just gonna put it right back in here this was about half a minute back this was about half an hour in that we whipped it so once again it's just insane out 1:29 it's been in there for about half an hour we just whipped it pretty much stuck a the blossom stick in there and stirred it around mixed it up for about 30 seconds to a minute and then put it right back on the plates and now we're going to sit there for maybe another hour maybe another 30 minutes I'll be back to you guys when that's 1020 minutes from the last video maybe I don't know 30 minutes in - after the whip as you can see we're having very nice crystallization you can see him some big diamonds starting to form we're gonna let this keep going let it keep buttering up and so they could keep doing its thing beautiful we're probably about an hour in since the last video and what I have here pretty much is a very stable a little bit buttery you can see the Terps popping up on top but it's pretty much starting to harden up and as you can see this is that consistently and see I said I wanted from the beginning although I'm still gonna let it go for probably about another half hour or so everyone and how's it going this is pretty much all finished up I started at 11:53 it's now 147 so probably took like a little over two hours I don't know but this is pretty much then the results as I like it this is very hard all of this pretty much puffed up and became very solid like it's all butter and that's how I like my rosin so if you guys don't like it like that you could have left it at the point where it's diamonds or whatever but once again this is just a little tutorial on how I like to do my rosin tag and the kind of results I like to go for kind of things I do and how I do it but yeah guys this is an official tutorial if you guys want any of things I used pretty much all I used was unlocks master unit two heaped up to press the rosin and to heat it up and if you guys want you can use this kind of code yeah I'm stoned and I'll save you guys a bunch of money on these presses or on DeYoung the mini that I used because this is where I made the rosin so I'm yeah if you guys more a mini or alex master you in there like that just discount code yeah I'm stoned one word you guys will be able to save some money at Knox Master Lock yeah guys it's the finished product I hope you enjoyed and thanks for watching", "A0hZd1ueLtg": "hi my name is cue Pinson is Wednesday in Colorado Springs and Wednesday is important because it is one of the days we like to Rio now before I get started I want to say follow me on twitch TV slash coupons for more awesome live content now Wednesday it's one of the days of the week we get deals on concentrate Wednesday and Saturday are two of the bigger days wax Wednesday and Saturday as they call them not everybody has those deals but a lot of places to do so we always like to look on Wednesday and I always start in the comfort of my own home on weed naps calm want the best places to look they have plenty of deals they can look up everything in my area there's bounce deals there's grand bills there's plenty options there so we're gonna get a little bit of an idea of what's out there before we get started and hopefully we get some really bang stuff today we are in the car here headed to the ATM most dispensaries are cash businesses and it's a lot easier to tip and purchase things with cash oftentimes so we're headed to the ATM to pick up some cash and I'm looking here on my phone actually and signed up at a few dispensaries for their text message alerts and they'll text me with their daily or weekly deals or if they have kind of flash or fire sales as they call them so we're gonna look through a few more deals here on the phone I already have a few ideas from weed Maps so we're gonna maybe go to a few places today once we decide but right now we're headed to get some cash and the dispensaries we are leaving the bank now we pulled out $80 we found a few good deals from a few dispensaries we're gonna go check out the first one now but we're gonna see what we can get with $80 today now I've had some good luck in the past getting a low price grams but we're gonna see what today hold so if they don't have good stuff we're gonna move on but hopefully we can get a few really bang grams for about 80 bucks here okay we are at our first stop for today one of my favorite dispensaries we are at high hopes cannabis with a cause I just started shopping here recently and I haven't been disappointed they have excellent products they always have great prices and the staff here is really friendly so we're gonna go in here and see if we can get some excellent stuff for today okay we are just leaving high hopes now it seems as though the prices are so good today that they've been cleared out so we were able to pick up a couple of different grams that concentrate as well as a pre-roll joint so we've got a gram of blackberry head band sugar and a gram of Agent Orange live sugar and we got a pre-roll joint of that lemon diesel we're gonna enjoy later so excellent prices but the selection was a little light because they must have just got raided oh man the views are sick the trees are covered in frost there's plenty of plenty of cool things to see in Colorado Springs we are outside of our second dispensary shop for today as you can see the views here are insane worse not that Apothecary farms powered by apothecary extracts one of my favorite dispensaries you can get apothecary extracts all over Colorado but they have a few of their own dispensary locations where you can pick up directly so here we are at apothecary farms in the springs looking for some more concentrates what of you over here we are just leaving apothecary Farms had to stop for a moment to check out that gorgeous view it was too good to pass up but we picked up a couple more grams from apothecary we got a gram of axilla wax and we also got a gram of their jam band lime batter which I've been hearing a lot of great things about and they were recommending it there too so we definitely picked up a couple of good ones here and I'm excited to try these right so we've spent all the money we've pulled out for dabs today we got four different grams as well as a pre-roll joint we didn't spend everything we had we've got a little leftover so I'm gonna do a little bit of foresight here a foreshadowing and then we're gonna get some munchies for later I found some coupons in the mail today so we are just going to get our munchies now and we are going to enjoy the dabs later foam pepper on the tomato black olives cucumber and the spinach oh I see this business and what also I'll just go with a little bit of that yeah we'll go at the now thank you good eat just like these chips later bad there's one thing you never expect to see him it's a trenchcoat you never expected so I realized my car is super dirty so we've pulled into a car wash here it's getting clean now my card is getting a pound and it's gonna be a while so we're gonna get up oh yeah and we are on our way home to enjoy our spoils for today more amazing views Colorado Springs is beautiful okay so we just got back home and went to two different dispensaries today high hopes and apothecary farms we got two grams of concentrate from each and we also got a pre-roll joint from my host so let's see we got a few different concentrates different grams here and a pre-roll joint we're all joint one gram of the lemon bezel good stuff nice price on this usually pick these up we got the gram of blackberry headband sugar blackberry headband sugar this is the one that is not a live and let's take a look oh this one looks very nice blackberry had been sugar wax very good stuff this one is from high hopes let's take a look at the other one this is their Agent Orange live sugar so we got a gram of the Agent Orange live this one's a little bit more expensive looks like that one got a little bit mixed up in the bag there I had it sitting upright but maybe it was upside down and that one smells very good check that out check that out this one is really saucy this one has a very very strong smell to it okay and then we also got two other grams from apothecary right and I know we got to two different two kinds here here's the axilla wax this one is 73% th if I can get a difference I'll never focus focus anyway seventy three point nine percent THC this one looks great excellent concentrate in there and one last one we got was the jam band live better and this one is very popular the employees were raving about of this one is eighty two point nine percent THC this one is a really good really good strands got a very good smell right when I open it it smelled amazing so let's take a look here oh yeah this live better okay so let's invite my girlfriend in here near there to do some Deb here is one more look at our spoils for today we got the BlackBerry headband sugar we got some gaygent orange lime sugar we got that pre-roll joint of lemon diesel from high homes we got that axle wax and we also got some jam band live batter so we've got a couple of emails plugged in here into our high five vape and we are ready to death alright we are finally back home we got the emails fired up and we're going to try a few of these out here what do you got there jam band you got that jam band from apothecary and I've got some Agent Orange live sugar from high hopes that's a really tasty the jam ban that's the last one okay we got our last couple of dabs lined up here I've got some of that axilla wax what do you have the BlackBerry headband sugar let's see how these ones taste oh that one's smooth and sweet like that so everything passed the test we got some great concentrates today and we got a couple of live options we spent a little more on the live better in the live sugar but the taste is very good we spent I think just under $80 for four grams that concentrates in the pre-roll joint so I think was around 76 for everything not a bad price for today I hope you enjoyed hanging out with us today and please if you like the content go ahead and subscribe to our YouTube channel

this stuff is amazing great flavor great flavor okay next on the old list here what do we got what do we got we got damage we Earl's lazy be Tesla tower as a sativa one gram is 2849 with tax included alright and that is 100% to the wrong price and I'm gonna have to go back and check that because I'm pretty sure this was supposed to be $18.00 we're at THC 65 th CA is 71 total of 76 14% terpenes which is why this stuff tastes so good I'll tell you right now it's looking like that is the most expensive thing other than the Opel sugar and that should have only been $18 but that's okay I'll take it back now we got pink Starfighter right here and then if I you let me open this one up these are all sealed up I just got them back from the store and you see that it looks kind of gooey mom see it's not gooey at all it's a crystalline it was a really nice very very very nice consistency not gooey not sticky really really nice really nice and I sat pink starfighter we got the pink Starfighter Mother Earth farms wax one gram like I said this is pink Terp sugar sugar wax turf sugar wax we're gonna THC 74% total THC is over here we're looking at 74 point for beauty beauty beauty and this stuff right here was ten dollars and ninety five cents for one gram about one two three four yeah I bought I bought a fair amount of dope but this is a full full on seven grams of oil and as you can see it actually costs less than 100 bucks everything on top of it is totally 100 percent tax over $35 all right well there you have it you guys have a wonderful day I sure do appreciate it if you ever make it into a Washington State make sure your swing by check out nature's gifts give me a comment let me know what you guys are getting your belt for we'll see you later peace", "o6UrX9n_UWo": "[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys it's cliff with peer pressure here thanks for tuning in to are solving this review series we've got Roz and Ryan from olio here today we're gonna be checking out his papaya punch number four let's get to it [Music] the papaya punch number four from olio is a cross between purple punch and papaya both heavily indica dominant strains the purple punch was giving me hints of grape candy and a sweet blueberry muffin fresh out of the oven while the papaya was was on the sweet candy side of things papaya candy maybe a little hint of mango in there and it's very surprising that it was an indica dominant strain because most of the effects I was getting were what you would attribute to a sativa dominant strain and I was getting a very energetic productive and uplifting high I tribute this to the high concentration of limonene found in the string and the limonene is really what was giving me that mood elevation in euphoria the second most concentrated terpene present and this strain was Lin Ahlul and I tribute that to the relaxation and stress relief that I was getting from this hey guys it's clip peer-pressure here welcome to the solvent ice review series this is episode number two we've got rosin ryan here with olio and we're gonna be reviewing the papaya punch number four this is our jam product this is been heat cured this is pretty much the most separated of all our consistencies as far as THC a and terpene content within the rosin and we believe it's probably the most shelf-stable even if you don't put it in the fridge or anything like that it keeps flavor for a long time and it's honestly my favorite consistency that I'm smoking right now so you can leave this out and it doesn't it doesn't you know decrease in terpene value it won't dry up which some people do like but this here let me show you here sure so what's this little dab tool here so every gram of ours has kind of comes with a personal dabber it's just a little extra thing we do just select emergency dabber in case of situations for sure very nice nice touch so what can you tell me about the the strain here so this is our papaya punch number four this is we have a few different fee knows we always Fino test a few different seeds that we get it's like the most exotic fruity and most punchy almost phyno it's got an exotic note it's um it's got a little bit of that artificial grape in it from the purple punch it's probably one of my favorite strains at the moment and this is from pony seeds papaya times purple punch very nice yep this is perfect for during the day I'll run some errands after dabbing some of this stuff it's very relaxing but its clear-headed yes it's a hybrid like most things are nowadays and for me personally I know it's different for everybody but I could dab some of this and still get a lot of stuff done during the day I don't feel too body locked or anything like that I still I'm ready to go you know do my stuff for the day so got that clarity stay exactly exactly and it's so flavorful that I almost don't expect to relax feeling I'm expecting some type of anxiety yes achieve a high but it's honestly perfect mellow high for the middle of the day definitely so how do you typically go about finding a good hash string it is many different steps so first of all to grow which ones grow nice we can't get any males obviously we take out the males whatever females are left it really is dependent on how well they grow their yield in the garden then once we wash them it's gonna be based on water hash yields it's gonna be the thing that plays the most role and if we keep it or not if it does yield well a nice hash and it presses well usually we'll keep it it all depends on flavors yields we all come together smoked them we all you know put in our opinions of you know which one do you think is a little bit tastier versus if the yield if it's really worth it sometimes we'll take a tastier one even if it yields a little bit lower just because it's got that little extra that we know people will will enjoy it so for sure so what do you thoughts on fresh frozen verse washing dried and cured flour so you can wash cured I've seen it done stuff 99% of our stuff is fresh frozen almost almost all we have our own in-house garden everything is harvested fresh frozen washed within usually one to two weeks so we try to wash it as quickly as possible really keeps that terpene profile just like it was when you were smelling the plant so when you're going around you got your fingers on the nose I want that to be what the rosin tastes like yeah I went down I really do think fresh frozen you know produces that a little bit better of a quality in the end for sure yeah so yeah you talked about doing BHO extraction in the past and you know when BHO first came out people were always looking for a light golden color but it seems now that things are kind of moving more towards an almost white color and I've even heard of people pulling their plants early to even get that color do you have any comment on like that is a huge trend right now in the in the grow world as people know you can pull your plants a little bit early but you're gonna sacrifice what I believe is a little bit taste and your potency the effects from you pulling early I believe are gonna be felt people really go for that visual yeah so when people see white hash they really they get excited yeah I think people really need to try the hash more side-by-sides sometimes a darker hash will blow the lighter hash out of the water with taste with potency affect how it makes you feel so I really think people should try stuff before you know everybody eats with their eyes so to speak but but uh you really gotta get smoking yeah so what can you tell us about the terpene profiles some of the flavors that you're getting up the papaya punch number four so this number four is probably our most like exotic fruity vino of this papaya punch it's mostly papaya notes it's that exotic fruit in there and it's got a little bit of artificial grape in there from that purple punch that's definitely that's it in there I think it's probably the most well balanced of our papaya punch he knows as far as flavor goes and that consistency is honestly my favorite I like when I see large chunks and they're swimming in Terps so definitely that Jam was just it's something else that is beautiful I seriously could smell it earlier just sitting back here when it was sitting over there so I liked what you did with it for sure well what about terpenes in general their medicinal benefits I mean how do you think that plays a role into the medicinal benefits the high and whether you classify it as an indica sativa I think everybody you know takes terpenes in a little bit differently obviously some of the ones like limonene stuff like that are just known to generally give people a little bit more uplifting effects like that but as far as terpenes go it's really about finding a flavor that you enjoy in an effect that doesn't hinder your day really yeah if you smoked something that you really like but it's giving you anxiety obviously that might not be the strain for you you should find something you know with similar profiles that don't actually have that same terpene you know within the plant so if you like something fruity but you're getting horrible anxiety from lemon let's maybe try like a citrus yeah or another a strawberry banana or something like that where you know hey this tastes really good but it's not gonna cause me to freak out yeah strawberry banana is one of my favorites - it's super relaxing probably the heaviest indica of the fruity stuff that I've tried so I know a lot of people that love it definitely definitely so one thing I love about following you on instagram is that you're just always dropping knowledge helping push the community further for those of you who aren't following him on Instagram he's at a troz and Ryan check him out lots of great content out there so I feel like the first time I ever heard the term rosin jam it was from following you on Instagram can you comment did did you coin that phrase is there anything there it was kind of more of the people speaking we did a little survey and stuff we just wanted a different our selves a little bit um there was a huge craze going on at the time of people putting rosin in jars and this whole new tech that's going on and I really wanted to create a name that people think Jam they think olio but honestly it's kind of taken off we've noticed other people you know using the rosin Jam name and we really don't seem to mind we've had people in Spain posting rosin jam so I think there's a really awesome to see and it's just it's just our version of rosin sauce or you know just a just a new just a new consistency we're just trying to cone so definitely yeah consistency is everything when I'm looking for a product if typically I lean more towards the jams you know if I see something that's a little more buttery that's just not usually my flavor lots of people like the butter does it is all of reference a lot of people love the butter just for ease of dabbing people like to just dig in some people grab it with their hands and just drop a bomb right in there and just its ease of dabbing it's a preference some people don't want the rosin heat it up some people want it straight off the press and put in the fridge so we like to offer a product for everybody yeah if you want your Ross and put in the fridge we have classic coins um if you want butter we have butter if you want your stuff lightly heated we have a batter and if you want a true separation and you want your rasam to look like BHO a live resin consistency and you don't want to leave it in the fridge then the jam is for you no down so I've got a bunch of homies they nerd out on temperatures as far as pressing goes dabbing goes do you have like a perfect temperature range usually fall in when it comes to pressing and dabbing yes I do if you know if something is pretty melty I use usually stick around 180 degrees that's a nice low temp of times and stuff really vary between how much you put in the bag and what you're squishing and all that but I like 180 degrees it just really is like a nice golden you know point for me for sure yeah so what about the your actual rig or the nail have you ever played around with temperatures I have and stuff it's been a while I'm usually just a time kind of guy kind of figure out what my new nail you know Davin is I'll heat it up and kind of do a test or at 45 seconds you know on minute 30 kind of see what my nails I like a low time dab it uh I'm gonna be dabbing I like a little bit extra on the bottom I'll leave a little puddle sometimes I don't mind you're sure we'll be sure to keep it on the blue setting oh yeah yeah so when you typically take a dab how long does it take for you to feel the effects usually I'm and this is just me I usually feel the effects pretty instantly honestly me too I uh I'll take a dab of this stuff and be ready to go yeah you know it's it's pretty instant behind the eyes yeah yep do you get that with other extracts or do you think rosin high gloss hooker I think rosin in general and solvent listen general I feel throughout my body a little bit more I noticed when I dabbed BHO it's it's more of a head high uhm BHO always you know it feels a little more floaty to me uh rosin solvent list is always a little bit more body I feel a little bit more relaxation from it instantly definite so tell me a little bit about the the bubble hash side of things how are you guys washing what's the trick to getting this so it all starts in the grow so most of our stuff is it's very well taken care of throughout all of its life the veg has to be very clean the early flowering stages at the environment is a huge factor so that's all before the wash is really the plant when we take when we're harvesting no no trimmers even touch the nose they're all hold it you know by the stem cut off the nose and take little golf ball sized pieces really trying to not disrupt any trike formation that we've you know work so hard to grow so washing we use our all RO water it's all hand washed pretty much as gentle as you can wash bud they do it multiple times will wash four or five times just to ensure that all the heads are taken off it's done in a cold room it's all ROI sorrow water it's as clean as can be in there so yeah that's how you make clean Rossum's clean hash and a clean girl so you mentioned washing by hand why do you prefer that over say and automate it where I can just hit the button and it's just uh really control over you know your whole process you can stir as gently as you want you can have a machine that stirs pretty gently but just having that control that hand on it and really seeing how much you're taking off each plant and stuff like that it's that extra care that really goes into it that really just makes it that much better for sure well let's let's get to it yes you want to about here guess we'll switch on over to the blue temp there it's the lowest temperature we've got I've got a little new little guide tool too they do come in handy [Music] man that's just what I was looking for you can definitely get that sweep of pile on the front and then on the backend you've got that like earthy grape soda candy like it was it's definitely what I'm looking for I'm glad you enjoyed it man yeah I always um I always enjoy papaya but that uh that little extra little grape really adds something to it it's got like a little almost a spiciness almost to it it's just really good for sure so what are you feeling like effects wise right now what do you think I I love the relaxed feeling I get from this the clear-headedness good vibe to some music right now to there so I just love the effects just great for chilling yeah you know I've got a real calm my body's real relaxed but in my brain I've got that little tingle to it but it's still real clear yep perfect biking it's quick behind the eyes and stuff quick acting I still feel like I could you know get up and go do some stuff right now so it's perfect and it is some strong stuff dum papaya punch generally tests around 80% for us so I mean that's a pretty high THC content so sure yep the rest of it's pretty much chirps we've been getting regularly 20% turps with the jam it's probably a 5 to 8 percent increase over just having it out you know just fresh press so wow it's quite a significant difference yeah so if somebody was looking to get some of this sweet papaya grape soda candy where could they find that so yeah you can find our product pretty much all over Colorado it's in recreational and medical shops dispensaries we have a flagship dispo it's higher grade they offer recreational and medical at two different locations you're probably gonna have our your best bet you know finding some jam there but we also you know post drops all over our Instagram page at dabble leo 7:10 you can give us a follow I also have my personal page at Ross and Ryan so I usually post the flavors as soon as I make them people get a little anxious and always ask me where it's at it's gonna be about a week or two before testing and all the packaging gets ready usually about a week and usually the olio page is where you can find all the information the drops what you know pretty much where everything's going that you're looking for thanks for stopping by man really enjoy the papaya punch number four it's definitely gonna be one of my goat cheese for this summer for anybody out there is not following them on Instagram be sure to check out at Roz and Ryan always dropping knowledge about solving this extraction trying to push the industry forward and dab olio 710 that's where we got the papaya punch number four from highly recommend it I really appreciate you guys having me I always love talking hash and thanks again so much come down so after sitting on the high for a while you know I really found it interesting that I was getting a lot of sativa dominant effects or what you would think would be sativa dominant effects because they're both in economists trains that we're working with here you know we've got the papaya on one side we've got the purple punch on the other like I said both indica dominant so you would expect a sedative effect but what I found was something really uplifting and that's why I think it's the perfect Brosnan for summertime vacation because it was relaxing mentally but still energetic got a little euphoria from that so an all-around great summertime high and perfect for like I said any vacation any trip to the beach or the lake definitely be my go-to and thanks for tuning in guys be sure to like and subscribe below follow us on our IG Facebook at go peer

is iced out images coming at you with another product review this one is once again I haven't got the kid to respond to me yet about the discipline came from them so just like my last product review that I did yesterday I'm going to put that in the description below so this is Tropicana cookies is the name that I was told on the top the person just wrote traffic honor and I know I pronounced that weird but I'm from England so that's just the way it comes out of my mouth smells so [ __ ] good live better so pick this up 45 of G so I got this and then I got the mother's milk which is in the other video if you don't mind going to watch that one if you enjoy these videos just [ __ ] cold out today house how blonde leaves whoa [ __ ] freezing so I'm still in my work gear but so 45 of G got the mother's milk and got this mother's milk previous video blah blah blah blah blah so this one I don't have my other phone with me much kids on it right now but the the stuff that I can remember that I looked up is that it is peppery citrus hoppy flavor it is cross between Girl Scout cookie and tan G so I've had to Angie before and I've had Girl Scout cookie I've liked both so we're just gonna jump right into this we're gonna be rocking it off of my sci-fi glass piece so anyone new to this channel sci-fi glass shout out to these guys I like a lot of their [ __ ] so far like off-the-wall and cool-looking start heating up the Bangor and get this damn and after work did that I busted my ass in the freezing weather kind of dead you know well hopefully everyone else had a fantastic and warm day I froze my dick off pretty much any time they took my hand and my gloves off and my hands were exposed to the air from the moment I pumped up a tire this morning time I got to work time I got home just cold it's going to be like 17 degrees tonight here in Michigan maybe even less I forget it might be 10 degrees I don't remember get my days mixed up a little bit yeah what's that hopefully you guys had a great day sad I just worked came home my girls about to leave for work so I'm gonna take this and then go inside and spend the rest of set time with my son I'm supposed to pick up my mother car today it didn't start been sitting for months so we're certain it's gonna be the battery we tried to jump it that didn't work we changed the battery out that ended up not working come to find out that on Lexuses there's like if you do something a certain way the security system won't let the car start or recognize that the key fobs inside the car I don't know it's pushed the start though this shit's all new to me it'll be the newest car is over owned 2010 which happens to be almost 10 years old the last war I had was a 92 Toyota for sale before that was a 99 stable 99 contour prior to that the newest car I owned was a 2002 or what if there was a 2002 that I got in O five it was a Saturn SC 2 coupe and I loved it that car so from my other video I'm gonna let this cool down just a little bit longer than I did last night because that [ __ ] must have still been too hot because it's just instant and I was baked but you know I didn't I didn't taste as much of the chirps and stuff as I wanted especially coming from something like this quality ooh Oh fat daddy tasty damn there's that peppery / hoppy taste the citrusy part is almost like bitter you know like it hits hard yeah very tasty well as I said I'll find out what this bow these are from and I'll put it in the description below in case anyone wants to try to get their hands on it I understand it was 45 a gram from the kid I get it from I'm not sure what deals they're running for you know it says five g's on it so so I know the guy picked up 10 grams of live batter five in this one five in the other I got a gram of each very very tasty strong strong high and pretty sure this is a hybrid I don't know I'll put it in the description below I'll copy the ship from Leafly and just I will put it right in there and any other information that I need to put in so yeah strongly recommend it Tropicana cookies if you can get your hands on it it's probably pretty good in just normal wax but if you can afford to spend the extra money and get the you know the live batter I'd recommend it the quality is better taste is better and the potency definitely seems higher just seems like a better product all the way around compared to say a lot of these you know FPR ones that I've been getting from healing tree Wellness Center that's not talking [ __ ] about healing tree Wellness Center that's just saying that the quality of this is better than that and the proofs didn't pudding you know that's like a dark almost goldish color almost like a like an amber type color almost and this [

some of you live close enough to where we could arrange [ __ ] like that you know stop in at the shed and come being a video just chitchat [ __ ] [ __ ] take a DAB and we can you know have like guest

favorite subjects of all time that is solventless extracts that's right water-based extracts today i'm talking with my good buddy chris from solely solventless out of denver and man he's been really like pushing the bounds of uh um extraction water extraction rosin extraction in the colorado area so if you're around if you're around denver or come to denver definitely uh check it all out man hey guys and if you haven't joined already please join us at therealdirtpodcast.com subscribe on itunes and hey man check out our new youtube channel you know we're just working on it but uh should be all of our episodes loaded up there real soon and uh i believe that is the real dirt podcast on youtube so thanks again for joining us today and as always sit back and fire the largest joint you can and enjoy this episode of the real dirt and this is chip from the real dirt good morning hello one and all another episode of the real dirt podcast this is 2021 and today we're gonna talk about extracts concentrates how they're kind of made and what they are the first time i ever heard of a concentrate of course it was it was called hash and we didn't quite know what it was and this guy kevin price i believe he was he he was like hey i got some hash she you know and we looked at it and we were like man this looks like rabbit [ __ ] are you sure this is hash and to this day i'm pretty sure he sold me rabbit [ __ ] as hash and we didn't know any better so we smoked it but it's come a long ways and as soon as i got real extract which was jamaican hash oil back in way long time ago i realized the potential of extracting the trichome and extracting the molecule from cannabis and have really been fascinated with it since then in all its forms from traditional hand rolled hash to sheaved and pressed hash to bubble hash to sub critical co2 butane propane solventless like i'm really fascinated and interested in it all and today we have chris from solely solvent list chris a good friend of mine say hey chris how you guys doing out there thanks for having me chip you know chris is an unsung hero he has some of the finest extracts on the market they're boutique and rare to find and if you ever see them absolutely scoop them up they may be a little bit more expensive than the ones sitting next to it but you know what it is absolutely worth it hitting it chris i appreciate all those nice words there chip yeah man just paying attention to detail man and you know really having a love and appreciation for this plant and all that's all its power that it entails you know so you know we're small small batch but uh you know we're just starting out if you do happen to catch us on the show like chip is saying yeah man you definitely gotta give us a shot you won't be disappointed we like to take our time like i said that attention to detail is important when it comes to solving this extracts there's a few things you definitely have to uh pay attention to as far as the input or the material you're using to get that output that we all desire are what you know the customers are desiring these days one of the biggest things about xtract is the quality material in gets exceptional quality out and many people just use the trash you know to make it and and you can't absolutely do that but to me you guys can best gear possible you use the best buds possible that's right my friend yeah a lot of credit goes to the action you know the cultivators first the flower has to be top-notch the flower's banging and it's on point and usually you know the hash on the other end comes out what you would like as far as like you know quality numbers you know that can all vary from a few different things different genetics and yield different numbers in those areas you know it's it's all interesting it's all you know experimental it's just great to learn and you know every day you know whether it's something that really throws down a lot of hash you know and you know it's in the family of the gmos or the cakes or something like that or something that doesn't really throw down as much it's more you know on the terp side i mean that's all important you know it depends on what you're looking for what are you starting off the day with man you you you smoke weed in the minute at the beginning of the day are you one of those people i mean probably like three or four times at the beginning of the day three or four times at the beginning uh i mean what did i have this morning i had a little bit of the uh some some live rosin made by myself it was some uh i call it the gumbo mix or you know my term that's right because chris is from actually from louisiana yeah you're right you're right um he's also our resident go-to of anything southern cooking food as well he holds the gumbo and shrimp and grits title at cultivate colorado currently right nobody compared yeah i mean i i i take that pretty probably anybody wants to step up at all i'll take it you know but oh man when we made shrimp and when you made shrimp and grits down here in oak okc my crew here never had it and literally the other day they were like man that time you guys made shrimp and grits he actually said chip you made tripping crap right uh i didn't take credit i mean it was a team effort man come on we watched you do it extracting hash is just like cooking you can be a cook or you can be a chef right you got all the right ingredients you got all your temperatures together you prepare everything properly you prep everything properly then wow you got something then right yeah 100 yeah like uh you know a lot of people you know may not go along with the the mix material washes but i particularly like those because as you were saying with i like cooking and flavor profiles and things like that you know you take two different you know hatches and mix those together you never know what you're gonna get man like you can be in a mood this day take a hit of that you know the same hash you know that you hit two days ago and get different flavor profiles because you might be in a different mood or something you know it just really depends like today a mix of tropicana banana and monkey berries and i really like that that's my gumbo mix for this morning chocolate chip did pretty well those did about i think that was at four percent together so not bad numbers so you're mixing these you're mixing these flavors in the bag yes i like to actually mix material together and wash it together in the bag you can do it separate if you like and then mix the resin at the end and press it like that if you want you know that's a preference thing man everybody got their own way to do it yeah way i like to do it you know so it works out well for me i don't have any issues with it taste fire love the taste so we've been babbling a little bit here i realized like there's a lot of people that listen to these podcasts or we'll see this podcast that don't really understand what hash or extract or rosin or resin or solvent list or bubble or co2 or any of this stuff is man let's just let me get your opinion of it let's let's let's start at the beginning let's have like a 101 basic extract course from chris i would tell you this i honestly um you know definitely knowledgeable in the extracts but as far as an extract connoisseur or someone who is going to go to a store and buy an extract over flour that was not me three or four years ago i would say the hydrocarbon extractions or co2 whatever you want to call it those extractions you know just we're not really that interested in them as far as like dabbing them but definitely using them for edibles and things like that which they would come up really well in edibles so you know never really you know downplayed it or anything like that but starting just like let's let me let me pause you right there and ask you and let's make some ex explain to people what's going on so most of the extract you see on the shelf at a dispensary say in colorado or california it's some mostly some sort of wax or goo or oil or shatter and most of that is made with butane or protein propane some type of hydrocarbon mixture right right right right they're literally just combining all of the the plant material they're mixing it with the hydrocarbon and then they're separating out the plant material the hydrocarbon they're recollecting the solvent the hydrocarbon yep and what's left is the extract right right right right and that's what mostly is on the shelf so when you're when you have a pen what's what's in most pens chris you get a mix of a few things these days i've seen uh you know you get your distillate pins mixed with terps i would say uh you get your sauce pins i've seen you know lately you're starting to see some live rosin pins kind of new on the market but mostly mostly just through it and terps i would say which you know distillate would be you know just your pure thc no flavor profile and then able being able to take different tariff profiles and then add that to the distillate you know um it was some sort of solvent these those are all mostly solvent yes correct yes right right but but you mentioned rosin tell me what the difference is between solvent lists and and the the non-solvents oh well you know as you mentioned uh earlier with the uh actual process of collecting the trichomes using hydrocarbon uh with a non-solvent uh extraction or a solvent extraction as you want to call it you're actually going to be using water as the solvent or as the carrier or the lubricant whatever you want to call it but like super cold water so you want to use a combination of ice and water to actually collect those trichomes opposed to the hydrocarbon so a healthier way or a healthier method i would say as far as like uh approaching the extraction process but uh you know each process equally has benefits for whatever end product or whatever way you want to do with it but i just if you're asking me water and ice seems pretty safe and clean to me so using that path to actually strike trichomes uh you know solving this just you know really stuck with me when that started coming around i think nicotine probably is the guy to give respect to that starting that term from what i understand you know and he's been around for a minute pushing out some great product just learning and discovering that really got me really interested in that and these days you're starting to see it they're starting to be rising carter just popping up you know rising and batter live jam you know uh sauce and diamonds even like people starting to even make diamonds and solvents which is crazy because that's like mechanical separation and things like that it costs more for a reason though you have to put more raw material you have to take more care in the solventless extract than just a hydrocarbon extract the material 100 matters you can do it from trim and things like that well taken care of trim will deal some great results but decide it'll actually use you know your prized buds you know and something that a cultivator or you know cultivar that does really well you know you're gonna you gotta wash it you gotta collect it run it through the bags you know then take it from the bags goes to the freeze dryer you know that's in there for 24 hours comes out of the freeze dryer then you have to see that then you have to you know collect it again into your screen bags and then now you have to press it so you know you press it then you collect it and then now it has to cure whether you want to you know heat cure it cold care room temp cure whatever it may be there's all these different ways you can approach it there's no wrong or right way in my opinion it's all great technique yeah it's all technique and preference you know some people swear by full spectrum you know or like some people swear that oh it's got to be the 9120 or only 90 you know and that's like man that's cool you know that's great that's your preference you can like that but like you know it's it's it's all out there man it's everybody likes something a little bit different and it's great that you have the options with verizon you can do that also when you you use different material you get different results and it's really hard on the commercial market to have the same exact material over and over and over and over again and and so that's the importance of like what we're talking about you got to watch it see what's going on because what might collect what even one strain grown by one guy might collect differently than the same strain grown by someone else right and you you've you've seen this over and over again like wow man those crystals are really small those crystals are really fat like this is nothing but glands this is nothing but stocks you know yeah man i've seen two two different growers two same exact stream like almost one and a half percent difference you know which is crazy you know like that's a decent amount of difference you know but still great outcomes on that on that particular stream but uh yeah you're right uh environment that's actually grown in um you know maybe i'm starting to notice has a play in into that too and maybe appearance of the actual riser you know whether it's going to be a little bit lighter things like that whether those whether that person maybe pulled that product a little bit early harvested a little bit early things like that and you know kind of go into it too you kind of never really know so like having a good relationship with your suppliers where you're getting your material from really helps you know and like consistently consistently knowing that you know you're dealing with these guys it's going to be this every time you know you know that it's going to put out you know these guys grow it perfectly and boom you know everyone does good yeah well it takes a different mentality well slightly different mentality to grow for for high quality extracts i mean many people grow for extract but they're just literally trying to grow biomass they're just trying to grow like weight man the highest quality stuff though it comes from when you really take care just like you would ganja right all the way to the end and you finish it the same way and you know you dry it and store it and package it all the same way like you know maybe i mean you don't have to trim it necessarily right but like you definitely have to like you know there's a little bit of processing going on yeah you definitely like to prep it i mean you know you know you don't want to put any you know leaves that doesn't have any any sugar in there you definitely don't want that sure in there you know so you got to prep it a little bit but definitely as far as like taking care of it and growing it with the utmost attention attention to detail you know as far as like i know you don't have to do your ipm's but you have to minimize those things like that you know that really like carries over into your end product you know later in your flower cycle when you come up with an issue you know that's love matters you know so you got to be on it from the beginning man and take care of the growing environment you know many people are familiar with with this term bubble hash or water hash but let's talk about why what this solvent list how it's different from from just like a crude extract with water yeah so with bubble hash you know in the cycle route to get rosin you pretty much get bubble hash first but like you said most people are used to seeing you know the bubble hatch in the form of you know looks like sand i guess almost keith rather people familiar with the grinders you know and you have to keep catchers but like typically you know whenever you're washing the material and collecting it in the bubble bags you know before the whole freeze dryer thing at this point you take it out of the bubble bags you gotta pretty much dry it at the perfect condition to get it to not mold or anything to be able to go from like you know you know the bubble hash process like that that we're all use that's a pretty intricate process too to get that right to get that correct for freeze dryers like i mean i guarantee you i would have failed plenty of times you know what i'm saying i mean i i mean i maybe tried it a few times when i first moved here from louisiana trying to do some bubble hatch before rosin was even a thing you know and you know it came out well but that whole drawing process is tricky and lucky out here it's dry the standardized you know so it was pretty you know relatively easy to learning curve is you know easy out here with that lack of humidity but i don't know if that would happen in louisiana i end up with some moldy hash man you know a few times i'm sure yeah yeah you got to control your dry environment yeah but you know now but now with with free drives it's a different story yes free drive is definitely a different story pull it out of the bag wet press it out water out a little bit put it in the freeze dryer yeah right yeah and even with you know i mean still with freezer i mean you know you're using freeze dryers i mean people don't tell me you could press it in horizon a lot of people keep it as melt too you know you you know you separate use your bags and use that 90 bag get some full melt people really love that nice full melt these days it seems like you know different strains are going to give you different meltability of the heads but like usually that that 90 through 119 seems to be that that one that people love for that good bubble hash melt you know super clean heads you know barely any specs of anything you know but you know it's got to be clean that's got to be taken care of properly to get to that point you know and using the freezer man just freeze-dried bubble like can be incredible oh yeah right a few times i've had it it's been ridiculously good right but it's to get that high quality dabbable bubble at that point like it's really really strain specific that you hardly get any yield you know out of your your your batch when you do it that way right compared to kind of like what you're doing and you're making you're extracting as much quality material out of the the leaf as you can with water you're taking it freeze drying it right and then what happens well from that point once it comes from the freeze dryer we take it and we put it between these nice plates by these low temp plates i like to use those plates but they're great heated plates low temp heat and pressure um the bubble hatch goes into filter bag and then between the two plates and that presses out the rosin so you go from the bubble hash and then those two plates creates almost like a you know like an environment of where pretty much that that protective layer on the resin heads or you know that the bubble hash bursts from the heat and the pressure and it oozes out all that good oil rosin and you collect it into the jar or into your banger or whatever i've seen people do some crazy stuff on instagram but so basically it goes to a jar we're using water yeah and then we're freeze-drying it and then we're using a press with some heat on it that's right right and this is this is all just water and heat right natural man that's it water heat a little bit of pressure you know and boom you got some rosin you have some beautiful extract that you can then take from that state and cure it how you'd like or you can keep it in a fresh press state you know take it into cartridges take it into edibles which oh man make some beautiful edibles tastes so good i love that that you know some people complain about that weed taste or whatever i like a nice rosin taste and an edible in my opinion that tastes good me too yeah i prefer all the edibles with more basic extracts uh keef water rosin oh yeah right i i prefer those as extracts for sure hey all of you uh uh edible companies out there man don't just use distillate make some with keef make some with rosie yeah your clientele will love it too i'm sure they'll start learning you know when to experiment with different inputs is you know the education of all this stuff will definitely keep growing with more states becoming legal here you know as we keep seeing it almost weekly and it seems like i see another state is passing some you know medical cannabis or recreational loss which is great man so you know hawaii yesterday alabama tennessee like people in texas new york new jersey like it's going everywhere right it's happening man it's happening and that's great you know and you know that people people are going to want they're going to want to learn about it you know that's how it is man you know the thing about private market cannabis and that industry is is we always try to squeeze as many dollars as many cents out of a square foot or out of a plant as possible because you know it was gray market or it was totally illegal and and now that we have these legal markets it allows to us to do research and experiment with with cannabis on a different scale and you know even though like solventless you know might be twice as much on the shelf it might be 65 80 a gram on the shelf you know the the the manufacturer still is he's not really like making a ton of money at that price it's literally you know he's making less money that way than he would if he was doing butane or propane or co2 right he's making less money that way than he would if he was actually probably selling the buds for flour too right like it it really gives is solventless extract it really defines to some degree a different segment of cannabis production right because it's not just like this like the biggest bang for the buck right get the most money out of the square foot it's like hey i want to make this product and this is how we make it and then the market bears the price 200 100 yeah it's definitely a it's a it's a special product that like you're saying it's there's multiple steps to it man you know so so complex i mean it should be worth 120 a gram i mean i was just out in california and that's what it was about yeah it's 120 a gram there though because all the taxes that go on yeah and that's and that's what i was yeah it was attacked right right but yeah it's uh i don't like to say it's not for everybody but like you know if you want to get into it man it's definitely something that like it takes a little bit of you know diving into you know there's a few steps to it a few things that you definitely gotta you know you gotta pay attention to detail that's what this is man you know it's more like a food or a laboratory-like environment all right not to say not i mean that's what you know other extraction techniques as well not to say that's not how you would treat it with that one but like you know just particularly with the solvents man like like you said you grow all your flour you could take this flour and sell it as flour or you would take it and you know throw it in this water with this ice swishing around and hopefully some trichomes come out i mean you know that sounds crazy yeah crazy it does you know the research and you know the groundwork that a lot of people have done you know in the past few years i would say have definitely like built that confidence and i would say you know definitely curious minds like me for sure because it was definitely tough for me to dive into it too i remember thinking about this more than a few years back i'm like man that's crazy just take the flower and throw it in there and like like really okay but now you learn and you get educated and you're like okay now it makes sense you know now okay cool i'm definitely gonna go take my flower and throw it in there and do that you know because this browsing thing just tastes really good makes my edibles taste really good too so sorry i just had to break for a second you guys over at the uh i just do yeah right yes yeah i know you gotta have security up in the studio man all kinds of [ __ ] roll up here i mean tupac learned it the most i know dude that's right that's right i just was watching a couple episodes on hip hop evolution about that sad story man sad story sad story sad story yeah you know greatness often is is snuffed out too early man that that's you know i lost a couple friends this year uh danny smallwood and rob cox and man like you know it's always sad when uh flame goes out too quick man yeah that's right yeah man my condolences i'm sorry to hear that man hey both those guys danny and rob loved extract love bubble rob love bubble i was making it with both of those guys in literally 2002 and nice we we got super high you know on more than one occasion on a a handmade bubble that we just made with literally pantyhose and silk screen and man you're taking it back man you're taking it back [Laughter] right but it can it you know you don't have to have all the equipment you can do it at home you can do simple extractions at home and people should try if you're a home grower definitely try to do that go to the store go to the dispensary buy some see what theirs is like and then try to mimic it right yeah 100 there's a lot of information out there on the web these days uh you can follow an array of guys on instagram too um that are really interested it seems like in letting people know how to do this i gather a lot of information just from perusing instagram man following people that i look up to that i know we're doing big things out here in the industry and you know if you're familiar with colorado's or rosin scene you know who i'm talking about but you can find some information out there don't be scared of it man you can get the equipment relatively easy and it's relatively easy to use and you know learning curve with anything i mean don't expect you know just get it and then all of a sudden you know you got what you but it takes a little bit but you curiosity man you got to want to do it you know you got to be about it that's all i'm going to say you know like yeah you know if like if you like extractions and you like smoking extractions and you have access to flour and you know you have opportunity to do it you're in a state that allows you to do it i say do it absolutely i believe that state can be a state of well-being 100 so uh yeah get out there grow some weed man make some extract of it roll some joints with it yeah pass it along to your friends and your family and then grow some more do it yeah keep it going man keep it down great chat with you man likewise man i really appreciate you having me it's uh you know really an honor being on this show and i you know sharing the information that i possess here which you know take it for what you want but uh yeah man you know what i love about you man is next year you're gonna be on a totally different plane with this we should do another one next year and see where you're coming out with it you just learned so much you're like a sponge man i'll come out there i'll i'll come see you in okc next year we'll do it out there oh yeah hey absolutely we'll we'll uh yeah man we'll make some we meant to make some this year but it didn't work out just yeah that's what that makes yeah we'll get it going man no worries come you know do some fishing as well oh well i don't know man you tear it up a little bit too much [Laughter] i need my fish in my pond you're catching them all come on man i look forward to it chris man i miss you guys likewise man it was good chatting with you this morning thanks again this is uh chris with solely solvent list how can how can people look you up chris oh you can find us on instagram uh we're a solely dot solving lesson that's s-o-u-l-y dot solventless pretty easy to find yeah man so we not solving this um check us out we got some you know good things happening here very soon and uh yeah be on the lookout for us thanks again chris man appreciate it thank you and have a good one too oh man i tell you after that episode i want to sit back and uh vape up some some good solventless extractor maybe even go back and get myself some bubble hash and sprinkle some on a nice large joint you know i think i might have ruined myself that extract years ago by making uh trainwreck keefe joints and and train wreck bubble hash joints i probably lost a couple years smoking dust and i hope you guys learned a lot about extracts and solventless extracts today you know they're they're they're not dangerous they're safe it's just water um not that like hydrocarbon products are dangerous either but but many people have an aversion to them but hey you shouldn't if you're interested in you know uh solventless extracts or bubble hash man you should try something if you can make it at home you can buy a lot of the materials online you can always check us out at cultivate colorado.com cultivateokc.com hey if you haven't already subscribed to our podcast please do that's the real dirt podcast with chip baker and check out our youtube channel man we're going to put all of our episodes on there from the past we're going to have all our new episodes on there so you'll be able to listen to all 70 80 90 episodes on youtube at your will so thanks a lot for joining us again today yeah man the next time you're out there in the world the next time you're at a dispensary ask the dispensary about solventless extracts ask them their opinion um ask them to show you some this has been chip with real dirt thanks again", "enz-OhEF6lA": "[Applause] [Music] uh [Music] i just picked up randy uh he's going to get a new bong because he's self-conscious about his dirty ass i'll just show you guys what i am embarrassed to like actually put this on but uh he said he wants to get a bong so i'm gonna take him to get a bung but the point of this video is this dollar dab i bought this a week ago still haven't done a video on it and uh hopefully i could split this in two depending on the size so i want to give him one as well but in my opinion to get the full effect you should do the whole thing that's what i was thinking yeah we'll see we'll see because it kind of it feels like it has some weight so we'll see we'll see we got rj we got rj subscribe to him if you haven't already he just got done doing a video yesterday with his cousin so it should be a good one whenever he does decide to pick it up he brought the forbidden fruit as well you know you've probably seen the video where we uh went and picked it up already fire stuff but yeah whatever i just gotta say man i hope you guys are enjoying your week um i have not been releasing as many videos as you guys do see uh but man there's a lot of reasons i don't want to digress into that right now but i hope you guys are patient with me and i am 25 so plenty of time yep so let's do it baby all right boys we are back showing what you got you know i'm saying a little a little uh what is it detachable one oh damn that noise oh dangerous let me put up here yeah you could switch it so you can go here oh it's in there oh whoa okay so it's a switchable beaker bung so you could hit it like a normal beaker bong or you could switch it off put that here put that there i think i like it this way it's like a science project right here so it's like you know homie's got to put some water in that yeah we got a new ball yep let's go baby yeah and also uh the homie picked up another one of these from that video uh the night the dispensary run the jetties yes the jetties uh legend legendary sky og sky og take a hit of this so yeah man i was about to get this rick and morty mom i'm not even a fan of rick and morty but i just saw the design on it it was for 35 bucks luckily i had the second greatest person here with me you know i'm saying no i'm just joking now but luckily andrew was there and he pointed out some other bombs you know for better price and not even that better design like on the bong itself so like i said this is only one dab so if it's not enough for me and randy to take we're gonna be taking other dabs alongside you know this video as well or in this video but the whole point of this video is to showcase this one dollar dab that i got from finos exactly a dollar out the door so oh nice let's see the functionality i'm gonna need more water so definitely gonna have a good time getting hot tonight as i play video games right here hold this all right how do you let me do this i'm uh i'm gonna showcase it hold up open it all right go so the strain is sour sandia uh the brand is bloom or something what is that boom or is it say here right there it's on the text bloom oil here boom something whatever i think it's the papers got it all messed up it's cool yeah i don't really care bloomfy bloomfire something bloomfire boom fire bloomfire something okay let's loom field you think yeah you're right okay yeah all right open it let's see what this looks like i'm excited to see what this looks like guys [ __ ] little dollar dad okay so i had this plastic i don't even know just twist that [ __ ] up feels like a fat rocks in there push down and turn oh there you go put pour on your hand the [ __ ] is that so we got one dollar dab you guys [Laughter] that's literally a one dollar debt okay this is for people who uh don't smoke as much i assume put the thing in there so i could prefer a thumbnail do you want to get better lighting what do you think this [ __ ] sun's [ __ ] is good here we go the [ __ ] is this there you go baby dab one dollar there so we had a one dollar dab as it looks like it looks it looks like it's for you know people who don't smoke as much and you're looking to you're in no how about this oh i think this is for more it's glass huh is this glass i think you just toss the whole thing in there yeah really i think so i'm just joking i don't know you don't burn all that that's [ __ ] plastic honey it's plastic that little rubber thing no not that or is there a read me i wonder if it's fire it's batter so you think you just put it in there you just i don't think you put all this in there no no not that green obviously i don't think i don't even think you put that glass piece into either think about it sure i don't know is there another youtube video no [ __ ] it won't we won't you want to light this for me yeah here i'm gonna put this back on so yeah it's not over i know i know so uh randy's gonna heat that up for me i'm gonna take this hit but yeah it pretty much looks like just one hit that's kind of lame to be honest you know you can't just grab it like that yeah here we go yeah my [ __ ] finger slime so uh i am gonna drop this in here but it is [ __ ] hot as [ __ ] so let's just cool it off a little bit you know if you want me to hold it for the camera for you or just leave it oh yeah yeah hold the hole hopefully it's the lighting i'll find out right now oh yeah i have to put it back yeah all right just this one yeah turn up the iso it's not bad let me see i already should not touch screen right so [ __ ] i'm scared all right ready [Music] it is you just drop it in there but uh we don't have a carb cap guys so we couldn't enjoy it as much but i definitely got a good hit man as you can see right here oh i wish i had a carb cap though but yeah that's really really cool that they did this yeah i feel like we should do that again with the car cab it's better at the end of the day batter can only go so far and when it cramps to like taste and stuff it probably wasn't going to get me too high but the idea of a one dab uh one dollar dab how are we going to get this out this is 12. that's cool dropping it yeah i can see that's becoming a thing i really can probably for people who are like just really interested in dabbing and don't know it's like if you have if you're if you have like a dollar at laying around why not right it's a it's a weird experience but it's cool yeah can you blow it out there hella higher because this is what i'm gonna do oh check this off watch out for the water though hold this here thank you for saying that boom oh crap it wasn't gonna go out today you know what i'm saying we're turning to the ground and i'm saying just like the sand it was before time i was gonna clean this this is mine it's cool so uh burn that uh let's pack you a hit of do i have my stuff on i'm not using this no you haven't tried this yet we're gonna give him this is the sherbert so i have a diamond i think that crack diamond oh did you say that diamonds aren't as tasty yeah man let us know if you guys tried that dollar dab or if you've heard of a dollar dab or anything like that similar or you know let us know in the comment section below yeah seriously though seriously though it looks like a phone experience for the dance for him that's a [ __ ] that's a dollar dad right there it's a [ __ ] fat one dude i want a light but dummy no i'm saying we're gonna take some dabs here and then we're probably gonna end the video here just uh a quick one i just wanted to showcase the dollar dab that was just the main focus of this video and honestly it was uh not bad at the end of the day it was only a dollar you know and if you don't want to tip your butt tender because he or she was an ass or not giving you the good [ __ ] spending on that instead of giving it a dollar to them you know i'm saying i don't know just some stuff to try out but look at all that remaining it was definitely a lot for a dollar with that you can see that's a all the excess stuff burning yeah we don't have a car kit huh huh we don't have a car kit we're [ __ ] what if we use this just kind of like oh yeah you can yeah right yeah i don't know why we didn't think about this [ __ ] wow damn it you have to be high first here give me that i don't know if i should do that yeah okay it's going in it's ready yeah cheers you guys hope you guys are enjoying the videos you watch continue to support my homie and yeah go up here more show them that droppage oh yeah oh yeah rainbow sherbet yeah it's smooth yeah yeah diamonds are not as harsh but yeah yeah good good call on this let me try that for ben frizzles [ __ ] yeah i wish i had thought about that earlier i'm stupid that's cool all right even though we didn't do i didn't do it i did tell you that the taste was there it was good it was good so excited we couldn't cap it for you guys though [ __ ] anyways damn you barely touched this yeah i know can you light it i told you i've been smoking the other one oh yeah [ __ ] that [ __ ] that video you guys would have already seen by now maybe yeah if you guys see the basements that i bought that trash i'm trying to burn all of it all through it you know i'm trying to best for life trying to save the bet yeah the best for last you know best believe i wasn't gonna bring that out to the homie andrew that's [ __ ] disrespect bring that [ __ ] around scent you know what i'm saying so i was like nah i ain't gonna do it anyways so i only brought the [ __ ] the cart and my uh forbidden fruit and we have a good time for you guys man all right oh yeah try this car it's kind of clogged so it's all right uh in the video guys i said it was 100 uh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "tq185XBggYE": "what's up you guys this style on us today a [ __ ] beautiful day Suns going down it's nighttime already but it was still a beautiful [ __ ] day was warm sunny broke my bike I'm cruising around and stuff I should take a video seems like that but let's get to it guys I got a couple of new things you've probably seen on Donny clams channel cuz we all we had a sesh not too long ago it was here at my house and a couple of these pieces you already seen most likely but you haven't seen this one

from peer pressure thanks for tuning in we're gonna be checking out some punch-drunk live rosin on today's episode of solvent les review and I've got Josh the owner of coach masters here to talk all about it and how you can even win your own Awards and what judges look for alright let's check it out today we're really excited to bring you an award-winning live rosin from cush masters in Boulder Colorado this punch-drunk is a nice combination of Bermuda punch and Mac otherwise known as miracle alien cookies - phenomenal strains that they blended together in the lab to make an entirely better creation it took home first place at the Brewster's 7/10 showdown this year and when you open the jar you can immediately tell why it caught the judges attention fruit all kinds of terpenes that are really evocative of a fruit market in South America come at you it's almost hard to tell which ones you're smelling because it's a mixture of pineapple paya maybe even watermelon looking at the consistency it's this gorgeous shiny butter mixed with sugar and you can tell that the terpenes have even started to separate ever so slightly at room temperature this strain isn't the highest in potency testing at around 74 percent THC but that's okay because it more than makes up for it and the smell and the aromas and the flavors that come along with it which we would argue are more important in most cases anyway hey everyone welcome back to solvent let's review this is Eric today we've got a really special episode got Josh from cush masters and some award-winning live rosin just to come first place at the rooster show down in the category so super excited Josh thanks for coming on the show yeah thanks for having me it's a awesome here yeah I tell me a little bit about cush masters so cush masters was a bridge anole founded in 2015 we did contract processing for you know quite a few different people in the industry and all within Colorado and then we expanded our brand outreach around 2017 and you know we're focused on connoisseur extracts and making sure that people are outputting the best quality inputs and outputs for you know come overall concentrates because it's a huge new part of and wave of the industry so we wanted to make sure that people were properly educated as they Deb as they consume as well as make sure it's some good stuff nice so you guys have been at this a little while how long have you guys been making browsing for we've been making rosin since about 2015 yeah so just so everyone knows Josh is also one of the co-owners here at pure pressure and one of the people responsible for really seeing big-time value in solvent lists a long time ago when people were making it with hair straighteners and really josh was the one that came up with the idea of how do I come up with a better press so that I can make this more viable so yeah I mean coach masters was born and you know we found and definitely a necessary need in the market for a high quality you know versatile rosin press you know what we were using just wasn't cutting it and we wanted to make sure that we could put out the best concentrates you know the same way that you know starting material creates quality extracts you know it also comes down to the machinery and the repeatability of that machinery and so you know went out and you know built the press and you know peer pressure is what it is today which is a huge blessing and it's great you know it's amazing to see everybody utilizing that technology and you know it's only getting better yeah so tell everyone a little bit about what goes into making award-winning rosin so the strain we've got today is punch-drunk which is a cross between Mac and Bermuda punch and what is Mac stand for Mac is just a strain that was bred and is it miracle alien cookies is that what we're calling cookies yeah well yeah so tell everyone a little bit more about the strain and kind of what went into this yeah so I mean both strains you know we're grown separately as their own strain and what we ended up doing they each have their own unique profile so you know each their own terpene profile their own you know necessarily bud structure features that type of stuff and trichome head structures which all take into account when you're utilizing and going in for water extraction okay because that was the first process of getting this final product right here mmm that we're about to consume here shortly so that was obviously ice water hash washed pressed when you guys were doing this is this a cross between one strain that's the punch-drunk or is it two strains have been blended together purposefully it was two strains that were blended together you know purposefully okay I'm within the Brent within the lab itself okay so they were grown separately uh-huh and then we decided the two profiles uh would create an amazing you know over what we hoped would be an amazing you know extract you know sometimes they're hit and miss you know sometimes it's harder to sell concentrate when it's a blend like that so you really have to be careful on how you mix these terpene profiles and you know don't make a flavor or something like that that somebody won't enjoy sure okay so there's there's there's some risk involved that's when you're taking a blended we're these strains wash together yes okay so you put it all together washed it and then pressed it because I've definitely heard of some companies and places where they'll wash one or the other and then they'll actually mix the heads after they've been dried but you is there a reason that you prefer that method because it's all you know one cohesive product within the bubble hash itself okay you know when you end up working with bubble hash and depending if you're in a cold room or not you know you end up getting you know those greasy patties bubble hashed a little bit harder to work with so when you have those two flavor profiles within that bud form and it's also where you're gonna have your highest terpene within those genetics itself so you know that's gonna come out in your flavors and stuff you know some are gonna be more dominant than others which is also why you got to be very careful on which ones you mix together got it so for example probably some of the gas your OGS are gonna really overpower certain blends for example exactly okay you know like even on the fruity side as well you know you're gonna end up with certain like tangerines and stuff like that to just overpower everything within extracts so your clementines and your tangerine they're gonna take over that you're making absolutely so another question I know that probably a lot of people watching are really interested in hearing about is when you're picking strains to wash well ones that are really gonna dump and be worth the time and energy to do it can you tell ahead of time like how do you know what's gonna work do you test it like what's your process there yeah I mean that's one of the you know common ash questions I think within the industry and it's you know a very challenging part of deciding on what material to choose from mm-hmm is working with the right growers I'm working with people who are open to feedback and not stuck in their ways I'll start in the garden right yes yeah definitely start in the garden you have to have a good product to work with okay and so really developing those relationships and making sure not only are they handling the products properly while they're growing it so they're not damaging the heads but also well they're packaging it up for delivery to you you know take for an example you know you just cropped all your buds and you're going into freeze them well you have a bunch of bagged stacked on top of each other that aren't necessarily frozen yet so you're gonna wait think about what that's doing to a trichome head you know it's just extremely delicate very delicate right you touch a trichome head usually you know it will explode all right yeah cool so super super interesting stuff when it comes down to actually making something that wins an award like this I mean what goes into that what are the judges looking for and in your experience having entered a couple cups and competitions and having won awards across a couple categories yeah what advice can you give for other people out there who are trying to win their own hardware here yeah I mean I think knowing your competition is really important looking at past competition sure results are also very important looking at those profiles of those strains that have won past Awards within those categories within that award so knowing what the judge is won mm-hmm and you know some competitions allow you to enter more than one per category yeah and so what that allows you to do you know normally if we enter a you know let's just say the 7 10 showdown for example which is the one that we won right here um we were allowed to enter up to 3 into whatever category we wanted we entered one into you know some of the stuff and then we entered 2 into some of the categories as well okay what are some other categories you guys are working with um just tool it around which we took first home first place home as well nice you know we did pens ok those live rosin fans of those live resin pen who live resin panel yeah and then some disposable live resin pens you know just both types of hardware okay and then we also entered wax shatter and crystalline which is diamonds so it sounds like it's probably not a bad idea to enter as many categories as your lab is able to if possible absolutely I mean your material and your products also got to be there um you know you don't want to enter something you don't think you have a valid chance of winning you know because they are very costly as well to you know be entering multiple things into multiple categories which is why we normally stay to one entry but if it's a category that you never know what the judges could be looking for or it's a newer category let's say for example rosin you know you can go with like you know like you're saying earlier the more oh gee you know dominant you know and that judge panel might be you know more of a G type of flavor profiles or the more that fruity type of profile so it gives you kind of wide range to fall within the category of the judges as well gotcha so you guys entered more than one into the Robin category is that we're saying yes we entered two into the rosin category for this strain specifically since this is what we're reviewing today the punch-drunk but if you could guess what why do you think that this one one what about this strain you know before we sample it here in a second like what's special about punch-drunk you know ever since it came out of the machine I mean even all you just knew it it was a beautiful color the clarity the smell in aroma that we are achieving off of that rosin even as its sat in the jars changing consistencies we you know just everybody in the lab kind of gradually went to it it was kind of like a natural thing and like you know we have our solvent list room which is you know separated but you know obviously with high terpenes and rosin extraction and stuff like that you can you know smell them through the doors sometimes yeah and so people are coming in and solving this room the day that we were doing this extraction and you know obviously things like that get picked up by the techniques or the texts that are working that day right when we were talking about entering this competition it was a no-brainer for us this is the one that we thought would do it but we also entered more of an OG dominant profile as well so this one's definitely on the fruitier side yeah given given the name and cross that you're describing together okay cool so let's take a look at this obviously in the video you guys are already gonna check out some sweet macros also really like this package design school got some gold foil on it yeah that's nice thank you can I can tell why people are picking that up on the shelf yeah so here's our little glass jar I'm gonna take a little sniff here so yeah it's really strong yeah like surprisingly strong when you open it I've been to you know labs all over the place done a lot of this and and this one it's just I mean it'll stink up this entire room yeah absolutely no question you're like I'm really trying to dial in it's got you know definitely the tropical fruit I mean some people if I was gonna guess it be some kind of like banana II papaya sort of smell it's hard to nestle made this one so unique you know like knowing kids put their direct finger on it it hits so many different peoples you know wants in a concentrate which was really exciting to see and it was just off to smell alone which can also give you indications yeah of what ward winning concentrates and stuff that you know could be good as other products as well so extremely stable consistency this has been sitting out today for a little while at room temperature most of the time a lot of these strains are gonna be kept in a freezer or fridge during the day and then this however you can just tell that this is really buttery its sugared up just a tiny tiny bit it's almost glistening here in the jar I mean it kind of feels like somebody brought some giant fruit bowl into the room here that we're just smelling on set natural terpenes sweat even at room temperature you know that those terpenes start to rise and separate from the actual rosin itself you know and like I was saying earlier you know the jar itself was you know so potent within the lab that every chunk up the whole place it just stinks up the entire room I mean I can't even imagine we got a graham right here you know we're talking how much were you guys pressing at a time I mean we were pressing around 80 to 120 grams at a time so before we try it because I'm really fixing to I mean I don't know how much longer I can talk about this before we give this a shot but consistency is one of the biggest things when it comes to winning awards is what you've said in the past and what we've heard from some of our other brand allies and some of our other customers can you speak to the consistency aspect especially of rosin specifically and how that matters yeah so consistency in your final product is probably one of the most important things you know especially being a lab or somebody who isn't selling it directly to that customer being on the wholesale side of that equation you know what that does is it allows you to you know no matter who's grabbing that gram within the dispensary um you know it's that gonna end up staying that consistency so making sure that you know you manipulate your material in a way before it hits the shelves so that it stays that consistency whether you're going for shatter or wax or butter or sugar or you know micro diamonds you know some Jam tech like all of those different things and consistencies those are all done within the lab so making sure that as you give it to your packagers that you have a consistent product that you're selling as a consistent product it's nice and stable yeah it's ready to go it's not changing on it so that the judges and someone who is you know buying this off the shelf is you know they're they're getting what they're seeing on the Instagram absolutely you know and that's probably one of the most important things you know for me is being able to provide the industry a consistent product awesome so cush masters is located in Boulder Colorado proud to have them here in the state so we smoke out of a couple different things on one of our previous episodes with Roz and Ryan sometimes we've got a nail we've had episodes where we're putting honey on toast today we've got a puff coke what's setting are we gonna what what do you recommend I call it low for me anything that you're smoking I like to go at a lower temperature so half frozen in general nice low temp always yeah cuz you're gonna be able to get those terpene profiles better and you know if you burn terpenes too and you have too high of a terpene rich product you can actually you know full heart right harsh yeah so you know I really like to enjoy these high quality yeah it's almost like a fine wine right we're not having our dabs medium well today okay we're we're gonna do this proper so all right let's give it a shot you want to load me up absolutely cool [Music] that's strong what are the what are the potency results on this one um so this one we got the box right here so yeah take a peek Matt just like as I'm sitting here it that that fruit that I was smelling in the jar just kind of working its way back might not like toward the back of my tongue you know sometimes certain concentrates they have like a little bit of an after flavor but man with these premium hash robins but I mean super clean and you can tell you know no throat irritation whatsoever there I mean granted I'm not someone who's taken the world's biggest abs but that's one of the biggest things for me is just it's clean I'm not coughing my brains out right now you know I can actually sit here and really let this soak in and I can enjoy it and it's just like I mean that is just really tasty stuff I mean it feels like I'm down in Central America at a fruit stand trying to pick out what pineapple or banana or you know pie I'd like to have and that's the stuff you have to hit and those profiles that you really need to you know what it's like what sounds good to you you know and it's almost like that uh technicians you know responsibilities as materials coming in to identify identify and try and work through those rows in order to achieve those high yields those flavor profile combinations all of those things to create phenomenal concentrates yeah because sometimes you know and why sometimes we do do mixes is because for run size totals for lab optimization you know sometimes you know one girl only grew you know let's say 4,000 grams of this strain and so you know we have a eight thousand twelve thousand gram capacity per run frame we go bring them together if they fit together and they mesh to go there you know why not and you know stay at full optimization yeah so I mean the the sum of parts greater than the individuals here big-time especially for this one good stuff yeah I mean the profile there is just comes together so smooth and so elegantly and like the actual almost like fruit like flavor that it gives it's like you know almost like smoothie yeah so now that we've been sitting here for a minute and I'm starting to like really feel it this is a review after all this one's really nice I'm finding that it's really relaxing it's got a pretty calming quality you know it's gonna be a it's almost like a little bit of a head huh definitely definitely a little behind the eyes in this particular one I don't get that with a lot of strains yeah but it's not overwhelming you know I wear some head high as can be you know and like it's kind of just like step back in the couch you know beat still you know not I'm here I feel lucid exactly but I'm also a lot more relaxed and I was a couple minutes ago and you know that's what we really try and hit within you know concentrates because it is such a representation of the plant and what its capabilities are yeah and you know people out there gonna experience it different ways but I can see why the judges were really pumped up about this one it is it is pretty clear once you get a chance to try it absolutely absolutely you can find us you know pretty much you can go to coach masters calm

you", "tt2jaAPM66I": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title we are going to be comparing live rosin and live resin first off let's get this out of the way live resin is made with bho which is a solvent and live rosin is made with no solvents then let's get that out of the way but the brands that we have in question here is raw garden and we got classics this being the live resin and this being the live rosin and i made a video on this one already but i did not make a video on this but i woke up today and i was just like i want to make a video so let's just see what i got and see what videos i can make so you know like i said i rarely get live rosin so when i do i try to make the most videos out of it as i can and once again shout out to p2ps for making this possible he gave me some funds to uh purchase some live rosin myself he didn't tell me to purchase live rosin but you know i figured you guys have been asking for me to get live rosin for quite some time now you know i don't get it all too much but when i do it's a it's a special occasion but once again shout out to p2 peeps he finally reached 1k on youtube here's hoping the 10k this year you know what i'm saying so like i said uh i did a video on this classics live rosin already but i didn't do a video on this but i would like to say that this strawberry rose from raw garden is super fire i will be giving you close-up shots and all that stuff but i would i wanted to make this video to explain the differences between live resin and live rosin because it's an only one letter difference and i feel like some people especially people get getting into cannabis or extracts and stuff don't really know what's up also take what i say with a grain of salt because i am not an expert in any way this is just me uh researching stuff from myself but live resin for those of you who don't know is basically the live and live resin means is when you harvest your plants and you flash freeze right when you harvest them instead of allowing the plant to cure over months and all that stuff and basically reduce the moisture in the plants but the initial moisture from when you just harvest the plants is the initial terpenes that you get from that live resin so right after harvesting you know how plants look super sticky when you just harvest them but then when you cure them they kind of like dry out and become less crystallized and all that stuff but when you just harvest them you flash freeze them you get all the live resin terpenes the initial terpenes that are there when you just harvest the plant usually extracted through a closed loop system using bho and all this other stuff but yeah that's generally how you make live resin live rosin on the other hand you would think you know you would just uh you know flash free some rosin or something and make it that way or maybe flash-free some plants and then just squish it but for those of you who don't know rosin is made by heat and pressure you know i've made some rosin on this channel before i use the the juice box which is a handheld rosin and basically you get a little you shape your little nug into like a hockey puck and then you squeeze the [ __ ] out of it with metal plates that are hot and in return you just get oil that squeezes out in between the metal plates and that's what you collect in terms of rosin but that is not live rosin that is flower rosin live rosin is a little bit more complicated that's probably why it costs so much more in terms you know 710 labs costing like 70 to 80 this might i add was like around 45 to 50 so still pretty pretty pricey uh but probably on the lower end of live rosins that you can get on the market uh but live rosin basically have to make ice hash which is you know you put your your your flour into like an ice bath and you shake out all the trichomes and then you filter it with micron bags and then you get like this bubble hash or bubble melt hash and then you smash it with heat and pressure and then that's the end result and the end result is a very terp terpy terp rich [ __ ] end result you know it is usually like whitish to brownish light brownish uh but the end result is very very good top of the line concentration you can get today is it's got to be live rosin so uh i figured i'd make a video comparing the two and yeah you know like i said it's not every day that i have live rosin in my inventory you know so uh i will get some close-ups on it but we're gonna be hitting it out of the smoke ski so let's just open this i do want to show you guys what they look like all right so we got the strawberry rose as you can see percentage right here eighty seven point five five percent tc not bad i will post the crosses post process but pretty much that's what it looks like i mean it's been picked up but definitely one of the the better raw garden strains that i've tried in a while you know don't get me wrong all of them taste pretty fire but this one stuck out very strong strawberry taste just all around good and then we got this one right here so this is the rosin as you can see right here the percentage of thc is not that as much as the live browsing but still very very tasty so let's open that for you guys sorry one hander so that's what it looks like not the greatest looking live rosing honestly it looks like some nasty crumble but i'll tell you right now the taste is there guys holy [ __ ] stevie really enjoyed this on the santa clara vlog those are what we're working with in this video i'm gonna take a hit of both and we're gonna see um i mean i kind of explained the differences between the two already now we're just gonna have to just hit the damn thing you know we're gonna turn on the smoke ski and uh we're just gonna let it rip i definitely used the [ __ ] out of the smoke ski yesterday so hopefully it's still running good it is that blue battery so might i add that this is awakened make as well so i won't go too too crazy but we are going to take some hits to say the least hopefully you guys have been enjoying the content lately i try my best to upload frequently so i appreciate you guys let's start that over again and uh let's take a hit so like i said i did try i tried these already strawberry rose phenomenal raw garden like uh if you're a fan of strawberry and you're a fan of raw garden i don't see why not you're not getting this uh because it's honestly one of them the raw gardens that stuck out to me most recently other guava cookies did too also but this one too so tasty still a little bit more in here i'm gonna finish that um but like i said as far as the taste goes very very refreshing uh very strong strawberry sweetness to it but as you can see it's 87 thc as well so it's definitely high up in terms of potency and the taste is there so i definitely would recommend for all you raw garden fans out there i'm saying this as i wear this sweater but good stuff let's clean that real quick let's take a hit of that all right take a hit of this live rosin about it i would like to mention is that when i put this onto the nail it kind of heats up faster than live res uh it starts bubbling quicker um i don't know if you guys notice that is too maybe it's the thinner in some ways i don't know but it just seems like it bubbles up quicker and it vaporizes quicker like starts bubbling quicker but cheers oh jesus okay there's something about live rosie it just tastes clean it could be just like the placebo of you knowing that it's solventless that you just you just think it's cleaner i don't know but it's for some reason it just tastes cleaner a lot more smoother the hits was faster that's why i cough but i feel like live rosin is but a bit more bearable in terms of uh smoothness or you know harshness so but with this video with the end of this video i will take this last hit and hopefully you did enjoy this video hopefully you learned something between the differences between live resin and live rosin because you know i would i would have loved to see someone make a video on this [ __ ] you know i'm saying i'm sure there's videos out there but there could be more you know so cheers this oh that is going to be the end of the video like i said hopefully you did learn something between the differences between live resin and live rosin you know there's a major difference in terms of price between the two so it's good that you know what makes them so different in terms of that major discrepancy and price you know what i'm saying but other than that hopefully you did enjoy the video peace out [Music] [Music] hey [Music] you", "QavXt9ntmR4": "[Music] we're live rosin history greetings greetings and welcome to the town house here in Venice give thanks to bud gasm over here for bringing us all together my name is Nick Atia of essential extracts I'm joined by Phil Salazar of soil grown solvent list we got some other family over here give thanks to everyone who's shown up and come out shown support and is here to talk to about the history of rosin we wanted to provide a little education and throw it back to some of the people that have been involved since day one that have got us to where we're at today so Phillip did you want to say a little something about yourself before we get started I'm just here to talk about the history of rosin I'm super excited about it I like where it's gone where it started and where we're pushing towards so I'm just stoked to talk about it I don't well I'm gonna break into it I love giving credit where credit's due and I'm extremely blessed to have been here from basically day one from when this term was coined basically so a lot of this started before Instagram and before Facebook we had a lot of underground forums and the forums were where a lot of us growers and hash makers gained a lot of our knowledge so there was this gentleman named confession compassion Co mph a s o n I believe yes h o n but I also you know his his name is out there freely his name is chadwick Bastardo and i really like to give credit to this gentleman because back in the day there were a few forums that that I was on along with this gentleman compassion and he was really the one who started using this term the term rosin has actually been around for centuries it's been around for a long time in the adhesive and in that world the adhesive world just for a gummy substance you know sermons to like violins yeah rosin that term has been around for a long time it really was brought into the cannabis industry when confession started utilizing a stainless steel bowl with the stainless steel spoon heating up that bowl heating up that spoon and literally mechanically pressing his bubble hash into that bowl and stirring it around and he started noticing this ring of oil on the outside of that bubble hash and he was like huh that's interesting there's this separation and so he started pulling that ring of oil with his dab or tool off of there and back then it was knife hits and he started taking that oil off and taking knife hits and noticing that there was a lot less residue and back then the term full melt clear dome FM CD was a very popular term for when we got bubble hash or water hash so good and so clean that it would bubble up and make these clear domes and basically burn to very little if not no residue it wasn't until Chadwick compassion actually started playing with this technology of utilizing hot stainless steel instruments and mechanically separating the oils from the waxes that he took this knife hit saw these clear domes and saw zero residue and I really want to say that that's where rosin started but at that time there was no way to make that technology commercialized or scalable you know a lot of people in this industry talked about how is it scalable how do you scale this technology and that's where a lot of things are going and so you know back then it was the hash makers treat rosin started spreading that term you know this is back I want to say 2005 maybe 2007 2007 I'm really bad with the actual date but this is pre dabbing you know so back then it was the hash maker that got to keep that ring of oil for themselves you know rosin really wasn't able to get out to the masses until people like this gentleman came along and I want to talk and I want him to talk to you guys about what really pushed rosin to be scalable initially what was the term that you came up with and what were you doing well I think I called it like solving this hash sha sha something like that but the way it started I was just really really into making hash and you know all my melts and stuff and smoking it and then like it got to a point where I ran solo on what I had I didn't have any more of my harvest and I got solo on my melts I was like literally trying to smoke like four star three-and-a-half star like low-quality melt hash so and I have to give thanks to you because I remember seeing a tip on your page back then where I would take Milo my like my low-grade melts and put them between parchment I'd use a hair straightener just to thin it out and it actually helped I was able to get a better dab off low quality hash and you know I got tired of that and so I'm trying to remember like exactly but fast-forwarding you know past like flattening my hash out and like just dabbing it like that getting to the point where I'm running out of my dabs so something went off in my head I remember just thinking like back okay okay going back again okay I remember I messed up doing that I pressed it too hard not in the hair straightener and I see it would be real shiny on the outside and dry in the middle and I wouldn't think anything of it I'd fold it up do it again phone I used to do that like I'd fold it up like three times so it'd be nice and like homogenized a nice good melt off of a low-quality hash you know what I mean the best you'd get off of it so light bulb goes off in my head I'm thinking back I remember that shininess I remember the dry so I didn't have a hair straightener laying there this is the longest story possible of it but didn't have a hair straightener laying there so I actually took a chunk of hash between a piece of parchment shoved it up against the email with my finger and I'd try not to burn myself or burn the paper on the side of the coil and sure enough I pulled it off and there was oil like I was hoping that would happen very little not enough to dab so I kept doing it doing it doing it took me like five ten minutes to get one dab hit it and sure enough my father-in-law family was there nothing it melted to nothing and it we were just amazed so from there it would that's where it started that's where the Hat I would say that's where the rosin for me started you know it started by a mistake that came back to me later on as an idea and I took it from there you know and so I was I was pressing hash so it all started with hash for me no screen screen wasn't any part of it at all so I was making low quality rosin still could still small contaminants in it for the most part it melted to nothing and so I ran out of all my hash and we got to a point you know we're just smoking bud so Bing light bulb and I took a bud and I did the same oh and actually when I was pressing the hash my wife had come out and she brought me a hair straightener cuz I had been using her hair curler and so she swapped that out for me so boom I get back to the out of the hash now I'm at the weed I pressed a but I think it's like 400 degrees super freakin hot so I pressed it on the parchment and crazy amount of oil came out of it like three of us got a dab off of like a little half gram bud so we were just amazed and they just went non-stop from there like nights of just pressing out eighths taking like five six hours just to press out an eighth on a hair straightener and that's where it took off and really I think that's where are all of our light bulbs turned on because we're like that's where it's scalable this guy is pressing flowers you know because before we you know us hash makers we didn't want to press the best-quality hash you know we've we got amazing quality hash and we wanted to keep it as that you know we might have started playing with a hair straightener to press it so that we could dab it but we weren't anywhere in the mindset of actually removing that waxy cuticle until I feel like flour rosin came about in that term I really want to give credit to Phil over here because I think that's what changed game for a lot of people especially on the mast level because kids all over the world had flour it was a lot harder for them to come by amazing water hash but they had flour and they had a hair straightener and that's what change game at that time is when I really believe we're pushing towards you know safe extraction you know everybody wanted to make oil we're all dabbers you know and when at a time when when solvent list was scarce and when you'd get hash and it wouldn't melt it's just a disappointment it was hard to come by six star five star even good hash to even know what it was so I lost my thought that hash split right before [Music] but yeah going back to it you know we came from somewhere and I'm just gonna give you guys a little recap right now we came from somewhere where we were watching forums of this guy named compassion taking bubble hash and pushing it on some stainless steel bowl to then playing with hair straighteners to then pressing flour itself into flour rosin and now look look where we've come you know there's been so many different advances in technology since then this man helped put out one of the very first rosin presses on the market there's been so many other rosin presses since and the technology just keeps changing and evolving and you know it's it's I think it's thanks to the education that we started the open forum education style that can fashion was pushing it on originally that we've continued that trend of really pushing education to our peers to our community and it just continues to evolve into something that I had never even imagined I grew up making bubble hash in my uncle's barn in a hot barn and now we're actually separating THC their THC a you know on a scientific level really we're seeing 99.9% THC a without the use of any chemical solvent so it's really really really come a long way pickup everyone that's involved in that movement we can talk about you know where it's going now so are you guys familiar with some of the new consistencies that we're seeing out there how many show hands out there in the crowd how many of you guys have tried rosin just rosin alright so when we first started making rosin was really when the consistency of earwax was popular in the BHO world so I'm gonna bring it back to like 2008/2009 and Pho had really just hit the market pho was called earwax back then so as us hash makers started to make water hash on a more controlled level a higher level we wanted to mimic what was happening in the BHO world so this is pre rosin but we started making hash on a higher level where the hash was coming out gold rather than brown and it was coming out smelling really like the flour that it was come from because we were controlling the variables of the water the temperature of the water our environment that we were making the hash in and that starting material we started really really paying attention to the starting material rather than using stuff at uncle's farm that had been sitting on the side of the road that he didn't want on his property because that was more weight on his property that's what we were making bubble hash out of initially up in Mendocino Humboldt County we started making bubble hash out of close trim and not just the close term mixed with all the fan leaf and everything else they were throwing away then we started making water hash out of fresh frozen material you know I think 2008-2009 was when I first did my first wash with fresh frozen material and at this point we're making water hash with whole plant fresh frozen material later on we're gonna talk about some of the amazing magicians in the crowd over here that can make fire with dry trim it's been sitting around but right now you know the pinnacle of water hash is using whole plant fresh frozen I'm jumping around a little bit here but throw it back to that 2008-2009 generation when earwax was popular we start learning a little bit more and then chatter becomes extremely popular 2009 Colorado California 2010 and Shatter is the consistency so we started wanting to recreate that consistency of shatter so we started heating up our hair straighteners a little bit hotter you know pressing in between parchment paper just our water hash at a higher temperature to create more stability more of a clear see-through shatter consistency and I think that's another one of the variables that pushed us as hash makers to find out what rosin was we wanted more stability we're trying to create these consist we were seeing in the BHO world but we weren't seeing as much stability if you just press hash at you know 200 250 degrees you're gonna see it turn into shatter but eventually you're gonna see it start to degrade turn darker butter up some of those issues and it wasn't until rosin came along and rosin the actual art of rosin is removing the rest of that waxy cuticle if you look at cannabis cannabis you know is a plant that has a lot of these shiny trichomes on the outside the crystals if you will all plants have different structures of these crystals and as hash makers and specifically rosin makers we're learning about this structure even more with every strain that we run some strains have that longer stalk with a very small head with a thick waxy cuticle and they may not run as well in water hash they may not press as well in rosin you start seeing some strains that have a thick stalk in a really bulbous head with a thin waxy cuticle and you're seeing them run better in water hash you're seeing the waxy cuticle effect the rosin less and you're seeing higher yields higher potencies and so you know moving forward we started seeing these different consistencies like shatter like the ear wax and then as we move we started seeing this sauce consistency in the butane world where we were seeing a layer of terpenes on the outside and it's pushed us rosin makers to continue this movement and to continue trying to create a higher echelon for our industry by pushing education and I think we've taught each other at this point that we can now separate THC a via different temperatures and different pressures to pull those terpenes and pull those the THC a separate that and now as we see these saucy and jammy consistencies in the BHO world we've been playing with pressure just like butane hash oil is utilizing these columns basically to pull pressure and then keep the butane and the trichomes under pressure creating separation we're now seeing the same thing in the solvent list world some are calling it rosin jam some are calling it solvent list sauce but we're seeing these consistencies now via ultimately means and rosin so rosin history just continues as we see different consistencies as we see I feel like as we see now hydrocarbon guys starting to separate delta-9 and CBG and THC v that's all with pressure and columns and temperature and so I think as we continue that might be some of what we see in the future as far as what rosin can really do you don't need a column you don't need heavy chemicals you don't need to possibly bro up blow up your neighbor's house we're seeing all of these different consistencies via solving this means thanks to rosin through the use of heat pressure and force right on I think that really kind of concludes it do we have any questions from the audience or anything else anybody think that rosin is going in another direction anybody disagree what what we talked about as far as the history of rosin it's a trip how far we've come really this started what 10 12 years ago and now it's on the commercial market heavy I just actually came from cookies in Maywood and there was a ton of different rosin brands on the shelf and it was amazing to see it started 10 years ago but I'd say realistically it took off about five years ago when when the masses started to learn and do it themselves at home and the more Minds that are able to focus and work on it and share the knowledge that they find that's why I think that's why we've quickly evolved this technique you know compared to has been around forever and it's taken so long to get to where it is but you know with the butane extraction and with everybody hands-on trying to do you know learn two new techniques and do the next best thing with solvent lists or with rosin I think that's where we're breaking through and and I think you're right we're gonna find you know all these different components we're going to be able to separate you know we're already at the point where we're separating THC and fats and terpenes so I think we're there it's pretty crazy to see some of the hydrocarbon companies switching over to solving this you know that's that's where I feel like that's when we made it you know like this education really did something we got the guys that have been known for making butane making solvent list now that's one of the cool things you know as of January 1st 2019 a lot of the new regulations came into California and it was very difficult to just set up a closed-loop system get the fire department out there go through all those regulations people are able to get to the end goal of a concentrate and a nice healthy alternative right one regulations hit and some of the first companies to come to shelf were rosin companies or solving those companies because it was a little bit easier to get manufacturing going licensing for type six via type seven was a little bit easier to push through she didn't have to deal with the fire burn nearly as much still do but a lot of factors have really really changed game I feel like when we started putting solvent list products or water hash products on the shelves in Colorado back in 2009 we were maybe 1 to 3% of the concentrate market was water hash and at this point I think we're definitely pushing 20% of the concentrates especially in places like California and Colorado so big up ourselves appreciate all the support and keep pushing education for real that's what puts the products on the shelves that are healthy that's what puts the quality on the shelves and that's what helps the consumer understand what's good well I mean the perfect example is the diamonds you know we kind of touched on it but I'll back it up a little bit just in case anybody didn't catch that one but in the hydrocarbon world right when we learned about roz in a year or two into learning really about commercializing and scaling up the creation of rosin we started seeing the butane guys make diamonds and we're like oh we got to learn we got to step up our game over here we're on shadow right now you know we're starting to make this butter and these lighter consistencies but diamonds oh how do we make this in the lab how do we compete and really you know it was all in playing with different temperatures different pressures different separations I feel like the first diamonds were not actually grown we're now seeing on the solvent side of things growing diamonds with pressure but the first diamonds to come to the industry were actually mechanically separated amorphous solids morphus solid crystalline yeah and you know I was gonna bring it up a little earlier I might have touched on the gentleman but I have too big up a man named Jeff or the cannabis Reverend this revenue because of church Jeff church cannabis Reverend was one of the first gentlemen to bring in the actual micron screen to separate the oils from the waxes or what we later found out to be a lot of that THC a you know so that bag not only contained a lot of the waxes but it also contained a lot of the THC a so eventually we learned that pressing at higher temperatures would completely remove the rest of the the terpenes and actually are a lot of the rest of the cannabinoids and at those higher temperatures we were just retaining THC a right and eventually we learned that that white powdery substance was the THC a that we are seeing some of these hydrocarbon companies put out we started testing some of those that white powdery substance and hitting anywhere from 94 to 99% THC a in our regulated licensed labs in Colorado and then we were like whoa how do we turn this white powder into what looks like the diamonds more heat and pressure so we brought the temperature right back up to around 250 degrees people do it at different temperatures but basically to melt that white powder back down into a solid form and then you can mold that that form into whatever shape you want I think when we first started doing it we were just making very very thick slabs so we started with the white powder we heated it up into these thicker slabs and we were smashing it in the lab and in our parchment paper and it was basically just making all different shapes and sizes of crystal and we started getting that tested and even with that slight temperature up crease upwards at 250 degrees we were not seeing any THC a turn into THC which was interesting and our labs were telling us that it was pure 99.9 percent THC in fact some of the labs that we were using not to put anybody on blast some of the labs that we were using for giving us test results back at one one hundred and eight point four percent THC a so we had to step back and say okay we can't put this on the shelf that doesn't make any sense you can't have over a hundred percent what's happening here and we contacted the lab they're like well we've never seen anything that high you know what's going on and we started looking at the standards and you know this is gonna be an ongoing issue in newly regulated environments but one of the standards came from res Tech and there's another standard that's put out with another company there's a few more companies that are putting out cannabis standards now but res Tech Stander's range from like ninety seven to ninety eight point nine percent their THC a standard and when we turned in our THC a sample is higher than that so we bumped the scale and I feel like they have to create some new standards at this point but we started leveling it out the lab started learning and we were mechanically separating THC a so to get back to the original question mimicking these hydrocarbon guys you know it started with the earwax we created solvent less wax now the rosin has really really given us the advantage to recreate different consistencies we're seeing in the hydrocarbon world we saw diamonds become instantly popular with butane extraction and propane extraction few other methods to create diamonds and we had to find a way so we utilized heat pressure and mechanical separation how much a did you throw away before you figured out that's the craziest thing yeah well luckily we were actually using a lot of it in other products topicals edibles and other things of that nature because we were seeing the test results in our coconut oil and other things but we just didn't put two and two together it's crazy to think back on it but yeah we definitely threw a lot away we definitely use some for purposes that we shouldn't have been using it for you know in mechanical separation I always like to talk about allocations and this is maybe something we can take a little break on but allocations are extremely important and that was one of those allocations we were throwing away something that had a lot of value another allocation I talked about is when we're especially when we're talking about butane versus solvent list I used the strain blue dream for the perfect example you get a full indoor operation of blue dream you bring it into your lab and you've got the hydrocarbon guys next door butane extract guys and they're yielding 18 to 24 percent on this blue dream you bring that same exact blue dream into the water hash lab we might be yielding three to five percent on that blue dream and originally I just started this discussion about the trichomes structure whether it has a thick waxy cuticle or a longer trichome stalk but blue dream is one of those ones that has a long stalk a very small head and a thick waxy cuticle it does not yield well in water hash and this is just an example you may find the very specific cut that does do well in water hash but for general purposes aloft in times the blue dream that we see is just not good for allocating towards water hash it's great for hydro carbon and so the same thing goes with allocations on the back end we found that that white powdery substance that we were taking away in our bags and keeping the clean clear beautiful gold rosin you know we were throwing that away as Phil mentioned and we've now learned to allocate that and utilize that THCA that we're thrown away any other questions we got lit up here so I don't all right so we're used to you know the full spectrum like 45min 160th you guys to play with like the 1/16 plus for separation because you know I I found some light goods you know find some good heads in the ones bigger heads who beat our dicks have you guys tried explored that so you're saying you know do we basically isolate the 160-180 micron and you know press that out and see the quality of that rosin and do stuff like that or separate or keep it like yeah I mean personally yeah I've actually just recently I mean it was some indoor but it was isolated 180 micron from an OG which is to me not a common thing to find for ice water hash a 180 you and it was incredible it actually put out about 91% return on the rosin so it was the most most impressive 180 I've ever seen when he talked about that return on the rosies talking about the actual trichome head being pressed into rosin and when you're talking about a 91% return that means there's barely any waxy cuticle it means you're barely losing anything you start with 5 grams and you're yielding about four point two four point five or four point six grams now I'm horrible with mass start with the gram and you know you're getting 0.9 one bag there you go but but yeah I mean for the most part a lot of strains I do I like the 180 I like the 150 I think it really depends on your methods you know gentle agitation depending on strains and knowing what you're working with the environment you're working in and controlling all your variables I think the 180 and the 150 are really good because for the most part I usually isolate everything depending on what I'm doing but I find in the end a lot of things end up just making it into the same batch because what I'll do is I'll isolate and then you know I'll press everything out and I'll separate everything by quality you know so not quality just by color but call you by terpene profile always have to dab it taste I noticed the 40 the 40 micron is usually not my favorite I like to keep that little separate because I don't know if it's more fats and lipids that are in it that's giving it a certain taste but I mean it's still great oil but to me I think keeping the 40 separated is better than keeping the 180 and the 150 separated because to me the 180 and the 150 have a high terpene profile to me those have like my favorite terms you know like if you never catch 150 or 180 those are just man lucky and to really you know summarize that it's so strained dependent you know I was actually speaking of your og cush that you'll did amazing in your 180 bag we ran some lemon cush Himalayan lemon cush it was a strain that was brought back by a soldier friend of ours that we ran in Colorado for a long time this one round that one of my growers grew wielded over two ounces of full melt in the 220 bag okay so anything's possible and to go back on what Phil said I really like to emphasize that we actually do the same thing we separate all of the microns I run a couple 220 bags we actually run a couple there and in the washing machine just to make sure we've gotten all that plant material I then run a 185 a 160 a 120 you know sometimes the hundred the 90 that you know sometimes to run a strain that we've never ran before I'll put all my bags in there I'll try and separate as many as I can because each strain each grower each medium is gonna be a little different even from one row you know you might be running the same strain in a grow house but have LEDs in one row have your HPS and another you're gonna see differences even there's differences from the top of your plant to the bottom of the plant as far as the trichome formation the amount of oils in them the size of the trichome head so we really like to especially when we're running a strain that we haven't run before is run all of those different micron sizes you can combine them in the end I can't combine them you know if you've started with only three three microns you can't separate them sorry beforehand so we like to start out with as many bags as we can see where the heads are lying and then eventually on that next run when you're running that same material from that same garden you can remove some bags you don't have to use all those bags and I think right there I think what that is in my opinion is every strain has a different head and tell you know so it's like the heads the cream and the tail is gonna be your butt end it might be it's lower quality you know but for the most part when you see the head and tail together like a full-spectrum hash oil something it's a good product but when you actually pull that tail end out of like let's just say for instance a headband we're running and that you know you can run seven eight spins you know 30-minute spins and you're still pulling and you know five spins in it was just quality but you can see it's getting darker more contaminants but then you get to the rosin and you're pressing everything out and everything's just coming out gold regardless of the hash you know and and you know it's all about the yield so you got a hundred grams of high-quality and 10 grams of just some darker oil other strains you know you'll notice regardless of the yield you might got the same yield off that strain as far as hash but it comes to pressing you know you have more wax membrane to those heads so therefore you're getting more more tail in with that head so you know you're get looking at like let's just say you get 80 grams and 30 grams of tail in because that's the darker oil yeah and that's that's more when you're looking for like when people are separating their Roslin's you know having like you know their their heads - and then just the edible grade for me I kind of I'm more of a full spec guy I kind of like to keep everything together as long I like to keep the tail end out and I think that's an important part of extraction is the head and tell regardless of what we're doing rosin ice water extraction ahead and tell it's all about knowing when to poll and what to keep separated a mature grower as anybody here ever explored with ultrasonic cleaning for washing hash like definitely actually we've yeah the question is has anybody utilized ultrasonic cleaning with hash or ultrasonic technology and we've used on actually a number of scales and people companies that I know right now are utilizing that technology in a number of ways as well I'll touch on a few things we had a company come in to our facility we were one of the first licensed facility blessed to be one of the first licensed facility in the world in Colorado and so a lot of companies from the cold brew industry from the wine industry beer industry started contacting us because we were able to do license protected R&D and an ultrasonic agitation company or cavitation company similar technology contacted us from the cold brew industry and brought in machinery into our facility and we started playing around with it unfortunately cannabis is a lot different than coffee and hops etc and we just kept having clogging issues with that machine but I saw value in it so what we did use utilize that cavitation or that ultrasonic technology not to separate the heads from the material like we initially wanted to and I still do think that there's value there and I think that there is viability and I think that you could do that but instead we ended up because it costs so much money for the machinery and to keep making these diodes bigger and these passageways bigger because the cannabis had to flow but we wanted to get an exact temperature there were a lot of variables that cost a lot millions of dollars really in R&D that this cavitation company didn't want to just keep shelling out but we ended up finding out that on a very high level turning up that cavitation device that ultrasonic device we're able to actually fully homogenize the oil into the solution so for edible products for topical products there's a lot of value in ultrasonic agitation and cavitation I still do think there's value in separating the oil via this technology if you guys aren't familiar basically ultrasonic agitation is a wave that is so intense that it can actually separate oil from wall they've used it in actually separating rivers and things of that nature on a larger scale ie cavitation but we saw this value because we started turning it up and actually breaking the trichome heads in water which would be our solution and now we have oil and water in one solution we started going back to okay how do they get oil out of water and you know we started playing with some of the technology that they're using in the oceans to get you know spills out of the oceans these polymer tubes basically that run on the bottom of the ocean that are pulling the oil out of the ocean and we played with that but we weren't seeing the yields we wanted to see I still do think that there's a lot to do there and there is a future for it so keep playing that's what it's all about I didn't get to it I didn't get there yet myself but I think one of y'all could share share share with everyone put it up on the forums throw it up on Instagram tag these guys they'll put it out there that's what it's about man that's what it's about we found each other somehow we found compassion both both of us found compassion so keep spreading knowledge for real and stick around today because I think we definitely have some more discussions a little roundtable with a few more hash makers in the building but we're gonna take a little split break I think right about now", "ezRzBxPQpbI": "when you know that this is $75 and you're getting a big scoop of it I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there [ __ ] it this video is for mature audience if you're not a mature audience this video is not for you what's up everybody Cubans here and today we are going to get into some rather expensive concentrates I picked up a gram of some hash rosin today that was priced at $75 and it is one of the most expensive grams of concentrate I have ever purchased so let's take a close look at what we got I've had a gram of Summit connoisseurs genetic and concentrates Tiger's milk and this stuff looks like a nice little slab of peanut butter I'm pretty excited pretty excited abot both so you can get a look at the packaging here this is that Tiger's milk and it's testing at about seventy nine percent THC and then it does have a little bit of CBD a in there but you know what I am so excited for this let's just take it down where are my clothes at let's get a nice nice little scoop here out of the email all fresh and clean and I'm gonna see how it does does [Music] um yeah that was really good I'm gonna actually throw that on a courts now I'm gonna throw that around on a few nails and see if we like it but just to compare I picked up some cheap dabs this cost 75 a gram for some hash rasen 75 bucks for this it's pretty expensive most most of my concentrates I usually find deals and get a lot of good looking stuff like this this is some live batter I got for about 15 bucks a gram one-fifth of the price now sometimes I find live sugars live diamonds of batters around that 15 to 20 dollar price if I'm getting it on a deal it's not the everyday price so begin the deal you can get this stuff cheap so it's really interesting to pay five times as much for a single gram of concentrate I can't I can't believe I did it it's still interesting to me that this costs five times as much as this other gram of some delicious looking stuff but some hash rods and it's hard to come by especially here in Colorado Springs it's not super common to find rosin hash rosin so I guess you got to pay that top dollar because it's so rare but let's get some more dabs of this cone I'm not done with this yet let's see what I'm gonna do some cold starts when you know that this is $75 and you get in a big school but I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there okay [Music] it's throwing out a couple bucks in that [ __ ] it [ __ ] it and get a little bit more I need about three-fitty oh we got it okay okay just pricey tab right here damn it all right let's get a nice cold start here and see if it's super delicious on the court oh damn well damn okay okay that's good stuff so I just stabbed it a couple of times here and it's pretty good stuff but is it is it worth it is it worth paying five times as much as I do for some good live banner is it worth is it worth paying five times as much to get some solvent once that's basically the major difference is the fact that it's solvent list most concentrates are made with a solvent it's the easier method it's the most common method but with rosin they use heat and pressure to make it so they just basically squish the THC or they squish the extract out of the nugs or out of hash most of the time they'll make a hash and then they'll press the hash and that's what this is this is a this is hash rosin so it's a little bit more expensive and my understanding is the yield is a little bit lower it's it's a process to make the hash and then when you press the hash you wouldn't get the same type of yield as if you were doing like a butane or propane extraction so I think part of the process is it's a little bit harder to get high-quality product and you're typically going to get less with whatever amount of plant material you go into the process with so I think that affects the price it is pretty rare out here in Colorado Springs not a lot of people are pressing - I can find it in a few places some places have rosin and half chosen but it's not as common as BHO and pho and there's so many dispensaries that grow their own bud and they do their own in-house extractions so something like this I can I can pretty much get really cheap any day of the week if I'm looking around so for me to pay five times as much for this it's a little little far-fetched I honestly I'd rather have five grams of this and haven't done but yet and it's just I like volume I like to do a lot of dub so I'm gonna go back and forth on these we're gonna compare I just want to shave this I got this the same day I kick it costs literally one-fifth the price I'm just gonna see if it's if it's it if it's 20% it's good like it doesn't make oh god I just paid so much money but anyway anyway anyway yeah that's that's solid for the price that's sell it for $15 grand look um I I think it's good I think that that the rosin is good I'm gonna dab the rod let me have a bucket that was that was the I don't even know of the other strain is [Music] [Music] I mean it's definitely better [Music] the Robins better smoother and tastes a little better you can't really compare the highs because I'm better than both back for it but it's all about the taste for me and it is smoother is it pay five times the price smoother [Music] I don't think so because it's not it's not five times as good yeah I don't even know how you would get five times as give it something like this this isn't the best this isn't the best cheap batter that I've got but for something to be five times as good as this would be pretty impressive so this is not five times as good probably not worth five times the price if I see it on deals I may get it but I don't think it's worth anything that's worth three times the price two times the price even thirty forty five bucks I get why it costs so much it's a it's a little bit less common not as many people are making it and you get lower yields with it I get why it it costs more but it's not currently it's not at the price point where it's super worth it for me to only buy rosin maybe if I had a press and I could get amazing yields myself but I don't grow and I don't have any interest in growing so it's like I don't have to buy all my nugs anyway to smash it so kind of interesting I like finding deals so maybe I'll get excited about finding a deal in the future but yeah this isn't actually the most expensive gram of concentrate I've ever purchased a few years ago I remember purchasing a I purchased several grams actually a full melt bubble hash that I got remember the dispensary but I got some full melt bubble I think it was about eighty eight bucks a gram I think I remember paying just under ninety a gram it was really really good stuff it was like some of the craziest stuff I ever spent I I gotta go back and look for some pictures of it cuz it was a few years ago those full mount bubble hash grams I got were like pretty good but after I got a mouse this isn't worth eighty eight bucks a gram what the [ __ ] did I just do so I kind of feel that way here what the [ __ ] that I just do but we made a video that's what the [ __ ] we just did so let's do a few more dabs of this [ __ ] might as well I've only taken out several dollars off of it I don't see if we can take several more I'm interested in the cold start here so let's do that [Music] here's a few dollars [Music] yeah this is good stuff still I wish I could afford you dabs well this was actually pretty fun and I'm pretty blessed after all those naps and I'm glad I finally got to try this rosin up and see it in a bunch of dispensaries even if I did pay money for it but if you liked this video be sure to subscribe for more content in the future and check out my other social media I'll have links in the description below and for my live streams tune in to twitch at twitch.tv slash Cubans if you tune in at night I'm probably live right now getting high dabbing some much cheaper than than $75 a gram rosin unless you tuned in very shortly after this is made that I might have some of this left but uh come hang out and we'll see you next time [Music] I would say perfect balance but I'm going [Music] [Music] [Music]", "VpIZwirwtEU": "[Music] what's up guys your boy p2 peeps today we're going to be checking out rogue river labs sour banana shriver and i'm just not going to say anything else besides from that from now let's go ahead just take our hit and then give her our normal spiel after so cheers everybody thank you for coming in and you know joining in on this video appreciate y'all hope you got a dab pack the bowl ready to go or you know your cart pen at the ready cheers boys [Music] oh you know we got to get a blinker going for that first hit that's just standard so anyway man this is pretty good so we're looking at the sour banana sherbert strain is a hybrid from rogue river labs and we've already seen you know a good amount of their carts and uh products and things like that here on this channel so you know this i'm not gonna say it's gonna be no different in a bad way but you know you you shouldn't expect anything different from rogue river labs if you're already uh you know a customer if you've already had it you know you're gonna know what to expect it's a smooth hit very good flavor actually you know what i'm saying um i forgot to mention that this is the cannabis derived terpenes version so this one has a personally to me a better flavor profile than the other ones that we've tried here on the channel which are not cannabis derived terpenes cartridges back to the taste portion we're getting kind of a tangy taste there it's not super pronounced but i will say that the the piney taste is definitely there you know the tang kind of there pine definitely there you know we're getting really piney taste here not really much of the gassy kind of diesel-y kind of taste there's anything like that uh sweetness very mild i wouldn't say it's too sweet no pepperiness i'm detecting at all or anything like that so you know that's kind of what you want from a strain that says sour banana sugar i'm assuming if you're you know grabbing a strain like this you're not much for the peppery terp the kind of more bitter terps and things like that so um yeah potency-wise though this isn't too bad i'd say that i think that uh the black lime og definitely hit me a little bit harder than this one did off first hit but we'll go ahead and take another one here i mean i have given this a go a few times every now and then but it's been a while since i i've actually uh tried or you know had a delta 8 thc sesh this is what one of the last delta 8 thc cartridges i have on deck i do have a little dropper to refill them with so that's just kind of what i'm waiting for to finish all of them out and then i'm going to refill them all and you know continue having my delta eight sessions so let's go ahead and take another hit guys so i can give you guys maybe a little bit more notes on that and see how it feels and things like that you know this is a hybrid strain so don't expect it to lean too far into one direction um i mean it could though you know this is this is a sherbert you know sherbert's kind of uh for me at least they kind of lean towards a more uh sativa like dominance but they still slump you out from the you know the indica so let's go ahead and take a hit y'all thank you for joining me once again and i hope you can join me on this woman positivity and good vibes always oh and before we take this hit please don't forget to hit that like button drop a little comment let me know what you smoking down below or what you plan on picking up this week if you're looking at anything that's going to be very exciting very new go ahead and let me know down there all right cheers everybody [Music] yeah that one so that blinker definitely got me i'm probably gonna be coughing for a little bit more excuse me nothing like the first session of the morning right boys always be like the first session in the morning your lungs are like a lot weaker you know what i'm saying like big rips just take me out on my first session of the day um you know obviously when i sash later on it's not as bad but yeah this one this one definitely hit me so now that we got a nice hit there to talk about that potency i'd say it's pretty up there i wouldn't say i'm enjoying it more than the uh the black lime one just because uh i think that highway is perfect for me you know that it was like an outright indica and that's just that's just what i prefer um this one i'm definitely getting a little bit of that uh head high feeling a little tingly in the eye so probably gonna be in that eye droop very soon um i'm not really certain whether i'm feeling more of a sativa or indica dominance here or anything like that you know if if you guys know more about this strain than i do then for sure let me know everything i kind of saw online though was a little disputed on where it leans so i guess it just depends on the phenotype you grab for it so my opinion on this cartridge very good just like all the other rogue river labs ones and um you know flavor wise i think this is a lot better than all the ones i've tried so i'm gonna need to get some more cannabis to have terpenes uh thc carts so thank you guys for watching all right well i know y'all can tell the camera freaking died but i'm still going to take another hit before we go guys this video just ain't over just yet but if you didn't stick around until here please don't forget to hit that like that comment that's so too hey that nerdy bill please please please you know if you're trying to stay in tune for all our uploads live streams things like that please that noti bell is going to do your work thanks everyone for joining in let's take one last blinker here for the video appreciate y'all for stopping by i mean i hope you guys have a good day week night whatever time day it is you guys are watching this i just hope that you continue to go about your day and your time with positivity and good vibes cheers [Music] [Music] don't forget to go check this out if you have not rogue river labs make some great stuff i'll see you guys next time man pizza out [Music] peace [Music] you", "hdQt-Ej-2Ho": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with tokentim420 this is a florida medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 and medical marijuana patients all right like say hi to everybody out there if you haven't subscribed hit that subscribe button down there leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know how you're feeling tonight what you're smoking on token on what you're moved in um so today we got the token tim's mad scientist lab we are going to be making some rosin vape carts on our own save a lot of money um i will like give a shout out real quick um i got some of that girl scout cookie now this stuff was only coming in at 15 it was minnie's i couldn't see that online um and i'm not a fan of girl scouts but this stuff totally changed my mind this stuff's real good um nice flavor to it nice high to it not quite a sativity ah as sativa leaning as the last stuff i've had that was the girl scout cookie so like i said not bad at all all right so we're gonna make our own rosin vape carts now you guys know i've tried true leaves i just went and got another one we got the skunk ape blue river rosin we tried both of them for cure leaf i left the other box in there from the select um some people was asking if this was live resin or not to me it didn't really taste like that tastes more like the terpene like the cannabis infused terpene vape pens exactly like them so if you could find those vape pens cheaper i'd go with them but we're going to show you a way to do it real cheap and i tell you what they taste amazing all right so we squirted a little distillate in there i got i was trying some of them i got a little tore up had to take a break my water cooled off so it didn't work so this is take two on the video honestly um that's that papaya cake rosin from move or from true leave sorry um in there and then the distillate we're using because it's an indica uh the indica uh bubba kush coming at 78 percent so all i did was microwave some water and a shot glass put it in there you don't want to get it up past the stopper there you don't want to get back in there i want to get this part done before it cools off again so there was probably about three left in here on this syringe it's got a little bubble but it was about at three i put a little bit in there already so when it's warmed up it's just gonna go real easy in there yeah i guess we're gonna use all of it all right that's all of it are all that we're gonna mess with getting out at the moment now if you notice the pad i'm using is that five dollar baking sheet which is silicone so it's the same thing as a dab mat that i got on amazon it was like five bucks or two for five i can't remember videos if you go back as while back i just cut a piece off to fit the table so i didn't have to clean the whole table off so now all we're going to do is we're going to take this and we're going to mix it up now i have made a few of these before i did warm the rosin up on the one and then by time i got out here it was just kind of like a hardened back up more like a caramel just letting it sit out at room temperature seems to work better let me pull it off the view for a second and make sure i got it mixed evenly sometimes the distillate wants to stay on the side but as you know the rosin carts are about 60 bucks apiece and they're only half grams so this distillate i believe was 60 bucks from grow healthy which truly has them for 60 most everybody's around the 60 mark for a full gram so this right here will fill two vape carts um and then the rosin's uh 75 gram so you basically for 135 you're getting two grams um which you would only get one gram buying it by the vape cards like i said these are half gram vape carbs these aren't full grams only half grams if you also notice on true leaves the thc is always really low i'm using 80 distillate and 80 um rosin so these are still up in the 80 percent so we're gonna use our um we had some la confidential co2 cart which i got another one of these so we will be reviewing it later then all we're going to do is unscrew the top here now i will say that it helps to have a decent dab tool the dab tool i'm using is the one i got for five dollars uh from banger supply and if you use code token tim you'll save 10 at banger supply they got these for like 5.99 so try to keep it up here in the camera see what we can do so mainly what we're going to do is we're going to take the flatter end um or either end the flatter end kind of works better towards the end and we're just going to get a glob out there like that this stuff's stringy and looking in the camera is a pain in the butt all right we'll hold that there and then what i do is just press it around the stem and then put it down in there so let me go over here and do this where you guys can still see it but yeah you guys can see it there now i'm gonna go ahead and use the flat end just kind of scoop out a big scoop like that and then smooth on that thing and it's easier just to push it right down in there you guys can see that just kind of pushing it down now it doesn't go real good um so there is a trick we'll use here in a second once we get it pretty blobbed up all right trying to it's hard for me to focus i need new glasses so i keep pulling it off the frame to me to be able to see it now i'm just scraping all the gunk out of the jar real good i'm gonna do the same thing i'm gonna go over to a clear spot each time and just wipe it off on that and then take the tool focus there we go and slide it down that thing it's not wanting to focus if it does go on the outside just scoop it back up all right we've got about all of it now the first one i tried to wait for it to go down and it just didn't seem to go down quick enough so i'm gonna take a little torch and i'm gonna heat the glass down in here i'm not gonna heat the concentrate i'm just gonna do it like that without burning my fingers off hopefully so i'm just going to slightly warm the glass going around you can see it's starting to drip there where we warmed it up so just real quick that one bubbled on me and then it starts to it'll just start to run down in there then go ahead and take the tool and access there's a little bubble there we're going to pop that scrape all that off on there try not to get it inside there for sure we've already got it about half full it doesn't take a lot um a lot of concentrate that is you can see i only had about three in that syringe and i only put a couple dabs in there it really wasn't a lot so again we're going to take a little bit sometimes with this i can just scrape it right across the glass or like i said just roll it around that and whatever's left there the mouthpiece fits real tight over that silicone ring and it just pushes everything else down let's get a real good scrape on this jar real quick and then i'll show you the other ones i made and talk about them a little bit now i will say the flavor on this stuff is just amazing it tastes just like just like doing the dab let's scrape this off of there real quick all right now i could play around and get some more out there but i want with you guys i'll just dab that out with my dab straw later so we're going to stick that on see how it just squishes that on through there and we're going to screw that on now i found with some of them you'll have to go back again with your torch and this one's a little thicker you can see it's still thick so i'm just barely going to heat it if it starts to bubble you want to quit so i have to look at this real good and it'll take a second for the heat to transfer through to the glass still a little creamy there's still some up there at the top there we go this one must be a little thicker glass than the other one i had we're just going to hit it a few times now if you notice when we did that it kind of cleared up a little bit not a lot but so you can see the little holes down in there now where the wick is you'll see how that cleared it up some and i didn't bring the battery out i told you i got pretty medicated all right but we have made a few other ones um so i made one yeah this is it i used the move vape pen and this it worked great for about two days and the battery died and if you can see right here at the bottom it's got little um holes i thought i could take it off with a battery i grabbed it with some pliers and apparently i couldn't so i shattered it what i'm going to do is unscrew the lid i'm not going to do it now because i want the glass to fall off and then i'm going to heat the banger up and i'm going to put it in there upside down like that and just let all that wax come out now this was the um i used the skunk ape and the bubba kush um the skunk ache ape was from move or true leave again sorry i don't know i got move on the head now i did put some of the thca powder in that one also and it was really really really tasty tasted just like the skunk ape tastes a lot better than the skunk ape rosin car which we'll get we'll have a video on that later but like i said really really really tasty um and the thc is going to be up there and it's a cheaper cheaper thing so i'll show you the other one i did but first we got to do it sorry it's alive all right so i did make a live resin vape cart um this is with moves rainbow train wreck and you can see how it's cleared up a little bit more i hit it with a little bit more of the torch um but it tastes amazing there's a little clog there that's why heated this one up it was clogging a little bit but man it tastes amazing and the high on there i'm telling you the high is better than any of these vape pens i've had yet and i gotta write what i put on this one so i don't forget that's the rainbow train wreck which we know it's live rosin because that's all there is um but the skunk ape one i'm telling you you know vape card even these i hit these um you know 10 good hits off of them to catch a little buzz um i was only hitting that skunk ape three three little hits and i was blasted i the dying i made that i rolled up a joint um and after my three hits i had like this much left of the joint and i looked at that i'm like hey no way i'm lighting that thing back up so it tore me up pretty good so if you guys want to give it a try like it's not really messy you do have a little bit of residue left in these so you could either take a bud and roll it around in there and then roll in some keep and make your own moon rock or you could just take your dab straw and hit it you could also take a hair dryer and melt it down so it would get it in a corner better to get a little better dab out of it but if i mess around with it with like this one that has that little scoop on the end i can pretty much get everything out of that jar there won't be anything left and especially it's starting to cool off now because it's getting ready to rain here but especially when i'm working in a hot garage and it pretty much stays warm here anyways it makes it easier to work with it's not coming back up so it's easier like i said just to push push it all the way around to the corners i just take this one the longer straighter one and get the sides like that and what i'll do with this is dab it that's what i do with the other stuff that's why i mark the charge but i think it rub keeps rubbing off with my fingers so that one's uh we just made the papaya cake so that was this one we're just gonna put a pea on the jar so i remember but yeah that's what i'll just use when i come out tonight i'll scrape that again you can see like i said i just got that little bit i wiped off on the edge there just by taking it around a little bit and just keep scraping it back on the side and then when you get enough to take a dab you just take it all off of there and dab away and like i said with the other with the rounded one it works a little better getting everything out there real good this one's not bad but the other one's better so like i said it doesn't take long to get you a dab and then just drop the dab tool in the dab rig and you're good so that's my take on making my own vape cards um the live resin i did use the co2 true clear the sherbert so i figured it'd have a nice cleaner flavor but this stuff here wasn't bad um i haven't tried this one i just made yet of course i didn't bring the battery out um but i used it with a skunk 8 but that skunk cape's got such a strong skunky um smell to it it's hard to for anything else to come through so we'll see if anything comes through on this one but like i said the thca powder worked great in there too it didn't clog that one up that one worked you know it was almost all the way full and you can tell see there's not much left in there i smoked over half of it in a couple days it was so tasty and like i said the battery just quit on me so i don't recommend refilling those the reason i refilled this one and like i said we got it filled with just that little bit i didn't use a lot i'll show you how much i used on that um but this one's got the charging port on the bottom so hopefully we can recharge it when it does die now i only use this was a full gram i did lick a little bit and but pretty much i just used two i pushed it from where it was at the one to maybe just past the eight so maybe three milliliters of this stuff but closer to probably the two because it did fill that pin up and it's only 300 milligrams so like i said it didn't take much of this to fill that vape in and i did dab a little bit in my mouth dabbed a little bit in the banger just to try it the flavor wasn't bad the banger wasn't real clean so i couldn't get a good flavor on it so we'll save that for a review hopefully too well that's going to be it guys if you have any questions just leave them down there in the comments like i said this is an easy way you could also just put the distillate straight into the vape pen without the rosin and just make a bait pin that's what pretty much they're using is distillate but like i said with just a little bit of that rosin it makes it a real good flavor so you don't need a lot of that even you could probably just put maybe two little dabs in there mix it around put one in there see how you like it next time add more if you need to but like i said they tore me up good so i definitely recommend those of you who are feeling your own give this a shot let me know what you think of it that's going to be it guys we do got some more videos coming tomorrow we got a delivery coming and then we'll also do what's new in the florida mmj we got some new things coming yeah so make sure you tune in tomorrow for that one uh make sure you subscribe this delivery should be the last delivery for the giveaway the 420

Damien from natty REM show up and man thanks showing up the bakery brother yeah no problem yeah actually thanks for showing up at the concentration celebration you know that was so much fun thanks for having us hey guys [ __ ] crushed it over there man has some beautiful contact UK cheesy all entered yeah that one's a great one it uh it tastes like a blueberry muffin and it's about like a like a 50/50 hybrid yeah it has us just [ __ ] is this man that's the banana couch livers and cartridge yeah this thing's fruity is all hell yeah that's why I invited him over I asked him he's got a fat has anything interesting going on and he says you got to taste the live resin cartridges and I've actually recently gotten into these I started buying a few different brands auditioning them but it's just Turkey as a [ __ ] and thank you so much as I'm surprising because I don't normally get super high off these and unfortunately I got super high before we're doing our interview so yeah let you know how it works but yeah delicious man the libraries and then that is a hundred percent pure uncut we don't put anything in it and we just keep it that way I'm gonna try to match like the turkey and profile as much as we can it didn't help me out with okay so the first cartridges that came out I completely dismissed them cuz I tasted on my taste propylene glycol I was at an event last night down in Denver and people were showing off their their new technology and I tasted a cart and it was just it tasted like bait juice it tasted like you know and I was just like dude I don't think you know I mean I don't want that [ __ ] yeah unfortunately like when when vape cartridges and pens are getting really popular if that's all you were tasting this PG and then people start cutting with dislike because of it cut similar right it was not as like harmful to your body as PG but now it's the point where we can have libraries and cartridges and then our next step personally is going to be a solvent cartridge as well all right interesting now now sama I hear these solvent lists newts all the time man that will only do solvent list and everything yeah I like them both I really do we do - honestly well most of our lives smokes butane or not butane but BHO and then a lot of us also smoke live rosin or don't let me hit this I'm gonna be I'll be too [ __ ] all right so what's it explain to me just because I'm trying to learn about cartridges I'm sure other people are what's the difference between the cheap cartridge at the dispensary in the AO and the $50 one it's all about quality there's a lot of companies that are more about quantity so that's the peak those are the guys that are cutting it would probably glycol and that kind of stuff yeah it's a lot easier it's a lot easier for your resin to get into that liquid form when you're cutting a PG or distillate so I could smoke it without it buttering or sugaring or crashing Lots inside the cartridge but we found a way where you don't have to mix it with any of that and you can just literally pour the live resin right into the pin and close it and give it to the customer a sick and that that's when these things have really evolved now I went to a concert recently just two nights ago and I'm normally used to having a bowl or a one-e-and and some container for flour or even if I have one of those pins you know if I got like a goby or something like that I got to go be I got the shatter that I'm loading it with I got something to get the wax off my fingers yeah these are [ __ ] easy and they're a little too easy but I just thought I was gonna hit one now I can easily smoke one of these cards she's just like sitting at home or right if it's the Durbin poison and writing like all the dishes in my entire house or love it you know all the tours so so this is just terpenes you get to like get to back to my education so when they when you distill or I'm sorry when you run something through a column you get what the I don't know how to like what they pick the Diamonds out of the terpenes and then they use the terpenes to make this sauce is that right or to make it live these parts with the with the live resin we're able to pack the column the shoot butane through the column right so what you get is the butane the cannabinoids and the terpenes and then you pull that butane out of the terpenes that cannabinoid right so then that's what we put into the pin so you're getting everything that you would get if you sucked like the diamonds and drank the sugar if you salt the butter anything like that but it's all in a cartridge now Varian just okay I love it I'm starting to get an understanding here so you said pull the butane out what's that wood residual butane and all that stuff is that something you got to worry about it's nothing that we have to worry about too much we've been in the game for a while over a century now and so we have over a century over a century and we're there for a hundred years no not centuries I told you these things it was him and Henry Ford it's our decade yeah no we actually have been in the company for a decade now and what we've been doing is like fine-tuning that tech so now we don't have any of those issues that's cool I mean it doesn't taste like anything but but turps honestly thank you yeah it's actually we try to match the exact terpene profile that you would get with the actual cannabis plant interest like a banana cush there's the Michelle gross banana that's what the banana cush is actually tasting like 1980s that's when the plant was produced and so that's why they named it banana cush because it was that banana that was hard to find at that time and when you say matched herpes I don't understand what that means um so when you smoke the plant or when you smoke the bud and it's like even from like the from the original breeder you're still gonna get around the same terpene profile sure and so what you smell in that grow is what we're trying to capture and keep inside that cartridge is what it's like a recipe um it's not a recipe it's like a it's like a natural recipe that the plant produces okay so you thought we're trying to keep it the entire time while preserving the terpene profile I'm not adding terpenes no just now I get it don't add anything yeah excellent makes sense man so we were talking about the big word the buzzword in our industry is vertical integration are you vertically integrated men and all that means is that do you have everything from your own grow to your own processing facility I guess sometimes it means your own dispensary right yes we're completely vertically integrated we do have outside processing on the side because you've good adding yeah so what doubt side processing means some growers ask you to process their [ __ ] yeah so we have a lot of companies similar to like it cut above where they will give us our fresh frozen and we will process that fresh frozen for them right and send it back to them so they could sell out their store but at the same time we also process our own in-house and that's about 95 to 90 percent of our in-house or all of our processing is in-house and so with that in-house then we sell all that wholesale throughout Colorado God so if I wanted a natty Rams cart I should ask for him by name though if you want an atom's car I suggest following us on Instagram you can sign up for a newsletter where we drop every week where we drop all the cartridges that's enough for a newsletter to get one of these made come on you got a store fine or something we also have a sore point deal that makes all right so as far as managing a grow as far as managing quality control I'll be I want to tell you a story that I got some edibles I've been getting into and actually going back to the dispensary recently got me some carts and got me some edibles and I tried this I said what's the most bang for the buck for edibles like 2000 milligrams in this tincture well I tried and it's bunk you know I mean just had nothing going on it and I'd [ __ ] drink half the bottle there's actually frightened for the first hour thinking it was gonna kick in I never did yeah it's all about quality control but I mean so and actually I went back to the dispensary who's my local dispenser really cool folks and I was like hey I want to show you guys this stuff seems like it's bunk no you can't even bring that in the store holy cow I can't give you a refund and it was like you realized what a yellow hour our hands are tied on doing business you know even the advertising credit card processing it's so difficult in business you know definitely well even as far as quality control how do you guys handle that well from grow all the way to selling and processing and getting it out the door there's always quality control so we start from the clone as it's growing there's always people checking it right and sure all the plants look good then as it's getting harvested and getting frozen there's another quality check and then as it's getting processed and then as it's getting created and then that's getting packaged in years out the door there's always the quality control check it's just even kind of corporate here man do you got white lab coats and stuff no it's not it's not very coke right it's more just the whole team cares like we all look at it we're always inspecting it even if we're not told to so you're hoping that we're just like naturally looking at smelling it making sure it's like the actual thing and it's not that we have that issue but there's so many different strains and there's there's always like different phenotype we'll checking making sure it's like everything that we want man I'm thinking I have a bamboo nursery a 20-acre bamboo nursery down in Florida can we do like 20 different varieties like I'm 20 different strains and I just think about the quality control that we have and what it really comes down to is if we lose a thousand plants that's a thousand plants you have to fungus or something that's a thousand plants that those guys work their ass off on it's also a matter of pride they're actually producing something so there's a you know it's just a inclination a pride to actually produce something amazing yeah we try to keep that tegrity and we tried to did you say tegrity yeah I love it a farm no but there's a we always try to keep that Tiger tea and we always try to make sure we give the love that each plant deserves just as if it was one of six plants in a basement so I guess it is but as you expand it's like you have to make sure that you are that efficient precise and so then you can slowly grow with the rest of the company yeah yeah you say slowly grow as the rest of the company yeah I know a bit gonna dunk your time I know about growing but I'm always interested in what's going on with this industry as far as what's going on like I don't know as far as I see Oklahoma blowing up now there's all the Michigan blowing up I'm a little bit confused about the state of the industry nobody gets to do interstate commerce anymore or ever I should say what do you guys think about that where do you see the industry in five years so they gotta open that up and I kind of national legalization what do you think I think it's gonna take around like three to five or even more years just for like that to switch over and basically because of the tax code that's with federal government right now is that way you know the more I think about it and the more I study it the more it just has to do with money or how they collect the money you think it'll take that long they're pretty good at figuring out how to collect money I don't know it's like since the beginning they always had a way for them to collect money even if we thought that all of our money was going to the public and it was going to for Denver is going to the homeless look even if we think all the money is going towards that they're still making good amount of money she's messed up in the in the system or in the industry then you get a fee and that fee is like out the door grabber aegis yeah yeah I've heard stuff goes yeah I've heard stories so a bedroll legalization who still stinks five years away four or five years away um I mean we're not holding our breath for right now right um it would be great if it did happen you all were looking forward to it yeah most companies I talk to her like hey and I'm doing just fine in this in this niche I just had a lot of money to get here yeah I'm not looking forward to competing what sold out what do you think about competing with I'm pretty confident that we can compete with them as we're growing we're getting more excited and our coffins is getting like bigger and bigger and it's been more than 10 years and we have just been sitting back and like making sure everything is exactly the way that we want it right we're out trying to jump a gun too quickly and in the next six months or so it's gonna start building a little bit bigger and then after that then I would in about two three years we plan to be in multiple states so yeah that's all it takes that long to [ __ ] expand huh yeah I mean I guess you got to get a grow set you got to get a location you gotta get like successor is that what the big the big hang-up is licenses yes they give you a license you can [ __ ] hit the ground running yeah it's just one of the first tube so you have to jump through just a interesting man so a dude if so if you could change anything if you were in charge of cannabis policy man any ideas man could you fix this get any big ideas if there was one big change I would try to have like all the companies in the cannabis industry try to work together cuz right now it's a lot of competition right and if we all actually work together and talk together then I think it would be easier for all the companies individually and how do you do that one it's such a hard product of just English you got such an that's hard it is tough I mean we try to set up as many meetings as we can with different companies and try to collaborate with them and like become like one solid team the beer companies do it though yeah the beer companies aren't all at each other's throat you go to a tap room and there's 25 different taps from 10 different you know 15 different breweries so here we're figuring away everybody's got to have their niche these are interesting it's y'all's niche yeah uh yeah I think I like it yeah yeah he's a nice easy chair everybody like said there's not even a button on it it's just one pole it's easy to get in man it's easy to get into a show or something like that anywhere you want let's go for concerts and events yeah obviously as a as a professional company because it's just that like you bring into a concert or anything like that but like it's the perfect thing all right I gotta ask man everybody's always even dreaming in prohibition land if I could just go to Colorado or California Michigan and work at a cannabis company man that'd be amazing that'd be living my dream almost like like winning a lottery don't yell don't uh don't wish for things that you don't understand yeah so is that something that if if I went to a cannabis company do I get to just smoke all day do I get to dab all day is it [ __ ] yeah no tell me about it first and then dabs later okay um we we always go in like early in the morning hit the ground running um just so we can get as much work as we can right into the end of the day and then after that you can relax and you can like with that we usually hang out with each other after work sure um but yeah we can hang out we could smoke and all that kind of stuff but yeah when it comes to work it's very straightforward we get stuff done he makes sense she just fired up what time you guys fired up in the morn then I got enough I was talking to because I was talking to an extract artist yesterday just ten hour shifts [ __ ] yeah our shifts on the rig this for personally for me I think I wake up around like 3:30 4 o'clock in the morning such as that and then guys are dedicated oh yeah yeah I start checking my email probably like around like 5:30 all right get into the grow around like 6:00 6:30 and then I'm there and sometimes until like 7 8 o'clock at night Jesus Christ man what happened out yeah geez how do you keep motivated like that it's insane well just like honestly it's great working in like our facility because everybody is like integrated so there's wrong in the lab and everybody works together around the same place so like if you look over and you see like a seven-foot plant I just got chopped down that goes by the harvest sure then like obviously like that's gonna get you hyped up because right oh man that's going straight to fresh frozen we're just gonna concentrate which might go on are these pens so is it ironic but you have to go into the bathroom and sneak some cokes to the pen then no just [ __ ] yeah kind of like the office with how many cameras are set up at the Grove for like yeah yeah oh it's actually some place so actually somebody put a meme up that was like you know back I deal 10 years ago I was hiding in the woods to try to smoke a you know a bowl with my friends yeah and now it's like you know 2019 it's like should I hit this pen and target yeah I love it the Internet is just probably like I'd say like the Internet is thriving just as much as the cannabis industry is right now share this from the tools we get are absolutely amazing you know like that you know being able to use Instagram being able yeah was that a kind of professionals association I don't know how they that man knows a bunch of cannabis professionals and I didn't have any business cards so just like nah just follow our instagram oops I need to do what's your Instagram I'll catch you there yeah mine's actually digital about sushi that's my personal llama but then I also run the natty rooms underscore Colorado beautiful Instagram page beautiful man beautiful so it's [ __ ] cool Manfred enjoy hanging out thank you though thanks for having me I got the chief on one of your pens all in Oriya delicious man I'm gonna go find one of these brother you can have that one deal I'm gonna go find another conclusion it'll find

weird or we're setting him up or anything and yeah she definitely surprised me because people don't just give you [ __ ] ounces like that you know what i'm saying [ __ ] super dense smells amazing i've heard really good things about it but i have never personally tried it myself yeah i'm excited i haven't tried it either but yeah i'm basically like city exclusive [ __ ] is pretty good i had like darwin farms from there one time uh the boston gelato probably like my one of my favorite we in the world like super good i remember there was one that you had talked about it was like elephant

competitors yeah you see ain't no jokes around here man chokes up there's water coming in that's two that's three easy work legendary bro oh my god bro let's go i'm the double barrel though oh", "ZLzvApa7uOI": "hi guys welcome back to my channel so today we're going to be talking about the baker's dozen this is the frozen this is the frozen I should say that most of the violin is professional violinist are you know looking to buy it and honestly you guys it's it's impossible nearly impossible to get it especially these days so yeah let me talk you through this I have two kinds of the baker's resin I'll give you possibly all the information I have and yeah let's start it alright so I was able to get this resin after waiting for nearly two or three years on the waiting list I was able to get it to roughly a year ago so I have been using it for yeah for pretty much like a year or so as I can really give you my honest opinion I do have two kinds he makes two kinds Rosen's this is the original which has like a purple kind of a brownish stamp and then the green stamp this is the the French version so this is more Italian I'll say he described it as a original Cremonese recipe and this is more after French which is the V own he call it V own sea trout or something like that so there by the way they are made in England and this is a very bakers is a very small company that it's owned by you know it's a family-owned company and basically they make this resin once a year they described on their website during the hottest months on it assume it's during the summer this is where they can get the best fresh sucks you know from the trees and they basically cook it right away the port or fresh so this is like probably the only one in the world that makes a company that makes resin - fresh from like a fresh liquid SAP so the resins Kames beautifully packaged you know they also included like like a little piece of paper which looks like a very kind of old paper with the information about each rosin and I thought it was really really cute looking obviously they were all sealed nicely so the first resin that comes with this kind of a brownish a little stamp and so take a wax stamp would be you know on the top four bakers so the first one is the original and obviously on those Scrolls you have a little information about the rosin so I'm just gonna quickly read a couple of info because I think it's quite helpful to know so the Baker's original is a hundred percent a handmade based on an authentic Ramona recipe dating back to the time of Paganini so you know he claims this is the original recipe recipe and unlike many products this rosin is made from a fresh liquid SAP so if you're not familiar with the resins like usually resins you know that whoever makes the resin the resin makers they buy a SAP which is comes in the solid and then they kind of melt and you know two older magic and they make the resin so baker's resin is made of the liquid SAP so he's basically doing right away so you know the this obviously is resulting in a superior resin and fresh or product so it's a hundred percent natural and the highest quiet quality you can imagine so the reason this resin you guys is so difficult to to get and so hard to get is basically it's because it's a seasonal product and they can just only make so many of that resin and I believe they put you once you get it they put you on the list and I believe you can buy it every two years they send you email you know here's your fresh frozen would you like to buy it as far as I know you guys I'm gonna leave his website down below anyway but as far as I know the list the website is like closed for a new customer I know it's not gonna be really helpful but you know you can you know look into it for the future and see you know maybe they won't reopen the new customer list and you know hopefully you can get on it but ya expect to wait a couple of years because you know like I said I waited a few years for this rosin so anyway so this is the original rosin and it's beautiful you guys I mean look at this eye you can obviously tell that I use it quite a bit during this past year so this has this original Rosa has like a little like kind of like an ember you know outside color so it's a little bit darker than the young rosin so this is the original the second recipe comes with the same packaging but it has a little bit like a green kind of a wax stamp again with the letter B on top this resin in accordance to his information this is the Baker's young Citroen is created but hint from a traditional French recipe which was popular a wonder Lyon was alive so again it's made of the fresh liquid SAP and yep in this result this resin is highly reactive to players input and capable of a broad range of tonal variations so this rosin is lighter in color as you can see from the original one so this is the French recipe and the other one is what Paganini was Italian so Cremona I guess it's Italian recipe so this is this is basically the only two resins you can get from him this is what he specialized in so before I will tell you what I think about those resins I did record a little sound sample and just I'm gonna insert it now so you can go ahead and listen and just think about it like can you hear the difference alright so you can see both of them and just tell me if you can hear the difference [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so could you hear a difference because I couldn't if I listen to this recording to me it sounds exactly the same I did use two different bells they were all clean so I had a fresh you know rosin on on each of the bows now I even when I play it you guys I couldn't tell much of the difference between one and the other formula maybe I like the original a little bit better than the French recipe but there is really very little difference and honestly it all is gonna come down to your personal preference okay now let me talk about the price a little bit because knowing that this is so hard to find you would think that this resin is gonna cost a fortune because if you're familiar with the curent resins they're on the market some of them can be extremely extremely expensive and to my surprise a year ago I paid about $25 for each US dollars for each resins that cost me $50 or something like that $50 for two Rosen's I think it's extremely inexpensive considering how much work you know he put into it so the price point of this rosin is just there it's perfect like I mentioned my personal preference if I will have to choose for life just one I probably would go with the original and then this would be my second choice but honestly you guys those two are equally equally very very good resins I would agree with the claims that has a very low low dust you know which is good especially for those who are allergic those people who are allergic you know even when you rosin about you know there's very little rosin dust coming out and also very little rosin dust is accumulating on top of the violin which is good these are super smooth you know very but they can be quite crispy if you need to you know it's it's obviously depend of your technical abilities of your you know obviously your right hand has a lot to do you know with that articulation but I found this roses to be really really good I have no any complaints whatsoever the question is is this resin the best rosin in the world considering the fact how difficult is to get and you know although obviously all the claims I don't know if this is the best or is this as the only one because I own quite a few resins you guys and I compare this resin to my other resins and honestly I think they are all beautiful you know and I'm talking about you know more expensive resins you know let's say the leather bespoke rosin from Australia that cost twice as much probably as this or even more and yeah I feel like that rosin is equally as amazing as this so it's very hard to tell you guys I'm just being completely honest with you so if I'll have to you know just choose one rosin for life I don't have extremely hard time because and I'm by the way I'm gonna do the video if you want me to do it give it a thumbs up on my top top five favorite resins let me know if you wanna hear that video so um yeah I think at the end of the day all of it comes to your personal preference what do you like there even you guys I'm getting so kind of picky because for certain pieces for certain about I'll use it different resins so I'm talking about like I'm going to the next level this is not necessary because I feel like one one of those rosin would be perfect for you know playing any piece yeah is this the only one is this the best yes and no I mean it's your personal preference it's exactly what you like exactly what you believe in exactly what it sounds good to you how much a good sound you can take out of this you know how much the rosin is really helping you with creating a beautiful sound articulation and all of it so I think it's a really personal preference at the end of the day and I would highly recommend to get it if you can if you can be lucky enough to get this yes go for it try it for yourself especially that it's not you know that expensive and you're not gonna be disappointed for sure but at the same time I don't want you to feel that you must have this rosin because this is the only resin that you're gonna be happy and satisfied with so there we go yeah I'm pretty sure you can buy you know different resins and be equally happy and satisfied you know using this so there we go guys so this is exactly what I think about this no complaints whatsoever it's a beautiful resin I will leave mr. Baker's website down below although I read just recently he's not taking any new customer so I'm sorry for that you guys but if you do get a chance to get you know this resin just try it it doesn't hurt it's a great resin and I'm sure you're gonna be very happy alright guys thank you so much for watching if you're new to my channel don't forget to subscribe give it a thumbs up if you like this video and also give me a thumbs up if you want me to do my top four top five you know favorite rosen's so yeah let me know if you have any questions and I'll duck take some bite", "790iHK19SlY": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive kind of think of it every day is a good day to be like alright guys thank you for another video your boy Shaka if you don't know who I am my name is Shaka Zulu if you see my videos you haven't subscribed yet please subscribe subscribe and if you're new to the channel subscribe cos right I'm always coming with a good vibe doesn't love my videos mat now you might not love it you might love it I don't know keep watching and you'll find out but today as you can see from the title I bought I basically bought a live turkey and cart and I bought a live resin cart and I thought the live terpene cart was a live resin cart because when I went into the dispensary I went to a dispensary out and I think my desk I can't remember what the dismiss of his name was but when I went out to the dispensary I asked can I get one of your life resin what kind of life resins you got and she showed me the live it was a live terpenes actually it wasn't my present so I decided to do research on it and find out what's the difference between a live resin car in the live terpene cart so that's what you guys are going to get today but before I get into that this [ __ ] truck is made how [ __ ] I hope you guys can [ __ ] hear me but you already know your plea kind of start this off without bond rip you guys [Applause] [Music] buddy you gotta start to vlog off right with a bomb grip diet but yeah I'm probably gonna get out the car actually cuz I want to show you guys you're not wearing that to park that I'm app so cuz if you guys are on quarantine and you're scared to come outside or you just don't want to come outside you want to be extra safe I want y'all to get to see you know where I'm at so you feel like you're outside you feel me so you feel like you outside get your join get your bongs and go on a little walk with me out here and we're gonna talk about this live resin and live Terps guys but before that let me I got one more thing to tell you guys I'm coming off on 400 subscribers when I hit 500 subs I'm gonna do a Q&A video so if you have any Q&A questions put them down below I'm gonna try not to answer your questions I'm used to just answering people's questions so make it a serious question maybe even say it's a Q&A question if you can but if not I'll like it I'll like it but I won't reply and the reason why I'm not replying is because I want it to be a Q&A question for I want to save up some Q&A questions basically for my video but um let me get out here let me get my wax pan get that live resin I'm smoking on the the nut rot live resin it's berries and cream I forgot to say it in my video last time what the strain name actually was but it's berries and cream [ __ ] way go hi guys all right guys [Music] it's actually a good amount of people out here but I'm still working under a willow tree hopefully you can see I give you a quick overview all right guys the first difference is each stretch it's different than like you know your typical shatter crumble turps because it's two different extractions it's the process it's called a freeze frozen process where they extract and extract the wax before they actually care all right so when you chop down the plan you skip the whole curing process it helps preserve the terms and it also gives it that you know that flavor profile that comes straight from the flower that I roam that days you know I mean preserves all that although they do here the plant when they make terpenes on the other hand I'm gonna talk about terpenes now they the turps cards the live turf cards are usually way more fresh and are cleaner and less harsh on your throat because they take out the fats and the lip nodes the lip node another difference also up to is you can see the layer of terpenes in the jar when they make a so like you can actually take a dab of that term because the THC content is way different in fibrous and I think it's a less THC content so it but it gives you more but if I'm wrong people tell me I'm not I'm just going off of what I've been reading about the live resin and in the Terps the live resin turps because I do have a car a live resin Terp cart I got this car is called freak n abisco I think it's called I'll show you guys later but I haven't tried to get live resin nut cart you fit me snot Benz obviously prefer libraries and more than flavors and herbs but imma try both for both II for you guys but that's all I really know know about my present look at the difference between libraries and in terms I'm not I don't know that much more if you guys have any more information for sure put that [ __ ] down in the comments you guys already know I check out cuz I want to learn more about the libraries in interns honestly and the different methods of extracting because I've been one to make my own some [ __ ] to get like a press and make my own I'll be like next level but we'll see what's up but I'm going to show you guys that cart before I go cart it actually looks alright it looks like fish Jilla to me obviously because dish hill is more lighter and darker but it's the terms I honestly need to look up with this still it is someone comment the difference between dis jillion terms in the comments please I need to know all right guys see I'm gonna show you guys in a man let's help Wendy can't get a good like hit I hope you guys can see me it's kind of dark like cuz it feels like it's gonna rain but might not rain just gorgeous [Music] freak a nabisco freak a nabisco [Music] see the live resin is way way more darker than the live resin turps but it's still cool I mean we won't find out if it's good I'm gonna be honest with you guys if it's not good I'm not will tell you guys [Music] don't forget to Like comment subscribe more videos to come if you guys want me to try I guess I am gonna try it but man shout out to whoever told me I forgot who it was and my comments but you told me to try these now that's the reason why I got it I'm gonna try it out for you also I forgot to tell you guys if you made it to enter this video I'm just asking guys you know cuz 4:20 you can't really do anything you can't really go out anywhere I plan to go house somewhere but but you can't even go out anywhere right now so what do you guys want to see for 4/20 I kind of got some ideas got some edibles the con huh I think that's how you say I'm not sure hon huh no cannabis infused indica pink lemonade and I got freakin strawberry ones put all together this is 400 milligrams and I'm thinking about you need on 420 I'm showing you guys like how high yeah [ __ ] so loaded on that day I'm gonna make a vlog for you guys either way but it'll be cool if you guys give me any ideas of what you want to see and I'll try and work it in there you feel me but um thanks for watching the video guys seriously [Music]", "gp9rDMAuogw": "this channel is strictly for viewers 18 plus I do not use or promote the sale of illegal

"what's up guys today we're doing a review on uh this is orange skittles from uh sticky frog this is a terp sugar live resin looks like we got 73.16 on total cannabinoids and 6.66 on terps that can't be good definitely smell some orange definitely some gas smells like orange gas um real crystally looking too real sparkly that stuff sparkle to it yeah it's pretty hard there's some uh flat pieces in here which is nice very orange too in color all right let's fire it up this is a cross between agent orange and was it agent orange and skittles orange skittles it's real dry it's not wet it's real dry all righty it's a real dry product like that i move the banger around like that it kind of hops around it doesn't really stay in the middle some of the other products like gems and juice or the cake icing it stays right where you put it me wow really nice flavor let me taste the orange mostly gas though this is a very chronic chronic flavor very tasty very smooth too very nice i'm actually kind of impressed usually when the products dry like that it can be a little bit harsher so very nice all cleaned up in the banger very nice nice product that was my first rip of the day too oh my heart racing a little bit so it's a hybrid it's probably a sativa leaning hybrid though cool eyes getting heavy yes sir all right loving it sunday morning dabs that was sticky frog orange skittles give it a 8 out of 10. nice product", "WE4H-gXnGJA": "yo what up boy bacon babe today I just wanted to do not really a Q&A but kind of respond to some of the questions that I've been getting in the comment section some of the comments as well we're not necessarily questions they're trying to tell me different ways to do things so I'm not opposed to taking advice only a fool would be but I am opposed to taking advice from people who are just talking but don't do if you don't actively press rosin don't tell me [ __ ] about how to do it because you don't know how to [ __ ] do it yourself I actually do it one of the comments that I had was that on one of my videos where I left a pre pressed puck inside the plates for too long while I was trying to prepare the camera so he did the material up a lot and when it came out it was a little bit darker than normal so a lot of people like to comment on that one and a lot of people are you know one person told me use less less pressure because you get more plant material in your end product and just let the heat lose it all out well that time [Music] Oh [Music] whoa whoa all right I'm still not over being sick completely sober all right so that's what I was saying um that's Bob that's backwards straight-up backwards you want more pressure less key you're not going to get more plant material in your product by using more pressure that's just not how it works the rosin bags that I use are 160 micron there from rosin evolution and they work perfect with my pre-press but you guys have to remember that when you're pressing out rosin the filtration bag excuse me those bags are not for filtration actually they're guesswork [ __ ] look they're just for containment so when you have that puck of flour and you go to press it it wants to expand and as it expands it will reach outside of those pressing plates and then you're not pressing that material anymore right so what the bags do is they don't filter to keep the plant material inside they just they keep it so that the plant material doesn't expand too far out because you could press nugs without any bags and still get all the oil without even collecting plant material the plant material only stays right along the very edge of the Google oil so again those bags aren't for filtering anything they're just for containment and make it a little bit easier what else pressing temperatures so temperatures - depending on your material you're gonna start as low as 180 and go anywhere up to like - 30 to 40 the fresher the material is the less heat that you need to use also the less time you need to press it if material is not the right humidity you're gonna have to press it for longer and you're not gonna get as good of a yield usually 60 to 70 percent relative humidity for your but it's good to start with and I'll usually press it fresh material like starting around 185 190 and if I'm not getting the yield I want but I'm getting the quality then I'll increase the the temperature by about 10 degrees until I start seeing the yield that I want now when you increase the temperature got to remember it's like a it's like a sliding scale right and right where they cross those two lines cross that's the perfect like settings right temperature time pressure so what you're trying to do is you're trying to get to keep high enough to make all of the oil lose out without degrading the actual material right so it's heat that degrades it not pressure so ideally you want as much pressure as possible without blowing out your bags right or breaking your parchment with as little heat as possible necessary to facilitate the flow of oil out of the material usually that ends up being around a thousand psi on your plates so for example my plates are 22 square inches right now to hit a thousand psi you know you're gonna have to get up there around like 13 14 tonnes because you take the max pressure that you're putting out so let's say you're putting out 10 tons that's 20,000 about 20,000 pounds of pressure now you divide that by the surface area of your plates which for me is 22 right and so I end up needing to be somewhere around like what is it I think like 15,000 psi or 15 tonnes will give me about a thousand psi so do the math on your own the base of yes the max pressure you want to get to and then you just change your temperature based on that so the higher the temperature the faster your product will start to flow right now this is where it starts getting tricky and it's a sliding scales because your temperatures too high you degrade your product but if it's too low then it has to sit in there and between those heated plates were too long even though it's a lower temperature it has to sit in there too long in order to start flowing and get the final yield so now you end up with the degrading product so like I said it's a sliding scale you want to have a high enough temperature so that you don't have to press too long but you don't want to have it too high to where it's degrading the product and then your pressure you're just going to keep ramping up the pressure until you don't get any more yield out of it so that ends up being like like I said fresh material 180 to 190 and about two and a half to three minutes for fresh stuff and then for older stuff it's usually I go a little bit higher and press rike around 210 or so for about three or four minutes but it also depends on the type of rosin that you want so a lot of people would see this and be like oh man that looks like like a big bunch of doodoo but this is your super Turkey stuff that's been pressed out at about 180 185 so you're gonna get more of the oily sheen on there right you're gonna get a lot of Terps and it comes out more like a sauce and this is cured this has been cured for about two weeks now and so this is just super super stable and this is really [ __ ] bomb but a lot of people don't like material that looks like this and keep in mind this would be super golden if I were to thin this out but a lot of people want like ghost rosin which is the stuff that is so clear you can almost see through it but people are into the purple rosin now there's a lot of trends but you can't let the color dictate everything because it's not just about the color right because of this stuff fresh bud pressed out at 180 there's a little bit darker and more Turkey than stuff that I've pressed out at higher temps of the same bud I pressed out at 2:30 you know and I've gotten slightly different looking material it was more shatter consistency way lighter color even though it was a way higher temperature right almost 40 degrees higher same pressed time actually was a little bit shorter with the higher temperature because it started to flow faster so I didn't have to press it as long you know this is some more 190 190 180 but you know you can get all different types of colors and consistencies and the point is that it doesn't necessarily dictate the quality it just dictates the parameters that were used when they pressed it so let's see what else you guys want to know cover filter bags temperature pressure time collection don't collect on anything too cold I made the mistake of collecting on top of some dry ice there was a protective surface in between but still the cold got the the rosin too condensate and create some moisture on top of the rosin and that's just because it got too cold so now I added moisture where I don't want to I want to remove it so that's a conditional time to cure and get that out properly but make sure that you have I would say like a couple is regular ice packs and then put it like a cookie sheet and I still look on mat on top of that and that should be enough to keep it just cool enough to collect easily but not getting moisture on it Oh a lot of people asked me about the the paper I use PTFE squares so I don't use parchment the reason I don't use parchment is because 90% of the markets parchment paper is covered in silicone silicon is very very easily broken down by a lot of different terpenes specifically D limonene which is very high and a lot of Turkey buds and so when you go to press you'll notice you have your little circle your puck of Bud and then around that puck there's like little box where it looked like it seeped through the paper or the bud is eating through the paper and that's actually the the terpenes eating through the silicon and then getting through the parchment paper so what happens when that happens is the silicon gets broken down by those terpenes and then when you're scraping up your rosin you're actually scraping up bits of broken down silica that get into your rosin and then when you when you ignite that or vape it burn it whatever that's toxic silica is extremely toxic when ignited and ingestion so those of you that are pressing on silicon treated parchment paper still chances are they're silica in your material you may not notice it but it's there now it seems a little bit easier to collect material off of parchment compared to PTFE if you do not have the correct temperature to collect it on if I were to place ice packs underneath this and then collect my material it comes up extremely easy way easier than parchment nothing gets stuck to this it's the most nonstick one of the most nonstick surfaces known and unlike parchment paper that is only heat treated or heat rated up to like 400 450 degrees PTFE is heat rated up to 500 degrees and pressure rated up to 500 pounds I think it is which is pretty significant nothing breaks through this in my experience I have not broken through a single PTFE sheet so that's why I use these I got a pack of one thousand four by four squares for 125 bucks from turkey roof comm or you can check out the version PTFE roll if you guys are doing bulk compressing with larger presses get a whole roll of this this is 14 inches across and I think this sheet was like maybe safety ET or something like that and this was like I think 100 something bucks it's worth it so think that covers and yeah it's depressing show me what you guys got if you guys have any questions comments please drop them below this was a very impromptu video I was gonna do like a whole little script and make sure I covered each bullet point but dabs happened and then I just started talking and here we are now so that said you guys have any questions about processing material growing anything like that drop them below I reply to almost every single comment if it's worthy of a reply show me what you guys would like to see in the next video and if you guys have any material that you want processed and you know the Southern California area hit me up and I'll press your stuff for you and I'll show you what it's like happy dabbing I'm about to hit this and I'm gonna be out of here [Music] [Music] we're hearing all the stuff in my email probably today because I'm impulsive and I have money right now all I need is another control box similar to the one that I built for my rosin press a PID controller and a plug-in spot for the coil that I already have so it shouldn't cost me a more than about a hundred bucks and I'll be able to build the control box for for the email and I won't be torturing anymore because [ __ ] this shit's annoying especially because I smoke in the grow room now because my wife is pregnant and I'm not trying to have her getting all secondhand smokey up in this [ __ ] so I don't smoke in the living room anymore which is where I usually chill and play video games so I got a run in here to take dabs or smoke and then run back out there in between rounds or games it's like man I wish the [ __ ] was just always lit always torched up ready to go I could just come in here drop it down and be out but I got to spend like a good minute and a half [ __ ] torching this [ __ ] up to get it clean and then let me cool off but it's all good oh yeah the I don't have any packs in here with me but I did make these little gel packs I rosin in coconut oil this shake is for I take four of those it's a wrap a rat I was in Chicago for business with my lady over this past week and that was what I would do I didn't take any flour and dab anything to smoke at all all I took was those pills I was a pill-popping animal and she would hate me like 3045 minutes after I take them and it was just kale like chili Hey [ __ ] dog barking for no reason Cheers [Music] I can't wait to not be sick [Music] whoo [Music] alright that's it for me they can be about catch you guys next time", "B-Im1QApqUU": "what's up guys we're back with another dive video dica grabs we're going up to we're doing [ __ ] we got the nice new piece you use there's a [ __ ]

keep thinking back right along with us", "gBxDK8RyU-4": "what's going on y'all supreme reviews here coming back at you with another episode of dab talk a series we review cannabis concentrates in six different categories value packaging looks smell taste and effect we then take these six categories write them on a one through five scale add them up divide them by six which gives us our final score today we're going to be reviewing um a brand new to me brand called seattle private reserve they're decently popular they've been around for a while but i've never tried their wax before so i'm excited to try it so seattle private reserve this company has an interesting sort of history as far as i know so uh back in the day when my friends and i used well my friends would cop it and i'd go to their house and smoke it um their seattle private reserve flower i noticed just wasn't up to snuff they were charging a lot for it and every time we got it it just never seemed you know up to par with how much they were charging but as far as i wax goes i am uninformed i have no idea so i'm excited to see if their wax is different and i'm hoping that it is different because i've seen pictures of it on instagram looks quite appetizing so yeah without further ado we're going to get right into it here value so starting off with value this gram uh costed forty dollars so not too bad um at forty dollars a gram it's not cheap at all but for this type of quality at least from what i can see it looks really high quality so from this type of quality uh forty dollars is not not terrible at all um because you can pay anywhere from i'd say low of 35 all the way up to even 60 dollars per gram for something like this um so yeah i i think the value is pretty it's it's okay it's at 40 it's kind of expensive but you're not going to be breaking the bank for it moving on to the packaging here really really like this packaging so you guys can see here they got the strain name on top source cake and then got all this information here on the side all the stats all the terpene percentage everything like that and it's all in one glass jar no cardboard no plastic no extra added waste to this product really really happy about that i love this kind of packaging y'all i think the last video that had this kind of packaging got a super high packaging rating so yeah i love this kind of packaging so now for the open test here so i think you just grab it and twist or okay hold on so if you guys see these stickers right here you are probably it's your best bet to cut them so i'm grabbing myself a tool here your best bet to slice through them with something so that you can then turn it because using the torque to turn it like the torque from your wrist is probably not going to work so right now i'm going to use this tool cut a little bit of it so i guess that's my least favorite part of the packaging so like really my only part that i don't like is that you got to kind of do a little bit of finagling to get it open but once you do that you're going to get to the goodies it's because they have two like plastic stickers there's one cardboard sticker that one's not a problem at all but they got these plastic stickers make it almost impossible wow okay this is actually a lot harder than i thought not gonna lie right i think i got it okay this is actually annoying to open i'm not even gonna lie like what what is going on here what am i not doing right can't open it dude okay this is i can't open this this is ridiculous what the [ __ ] okay sweaty hands all right so this packaging sucks i can't even [ __ ] open it this is ridiculous this packaging sucks ass dude this packaging is terrible what the heck i can't okay well i can't even like what is this i can't i'm getting so upset right now i mean what is this going to take dude for me to open god damn man like [ __ ] really still not [ __ ] opening on me all right [ __ ] all right i think i almost got it okay this almost i'm so sorry y'all but for this delay but this is this is ridiculous this might be the worst packaging i've had on the channel so far okay got this [ __ ] open holy crap okay that took how long that took like okay that took like four minutes to open i'm so sorry about that y'all but i figured you needed to see it real time [ __ ] this packaging no like [ __ ] it i thought it was good this sucks ass like what is wrong with this lid there's a bunch of like plastic [ __ ] here there's like plastic notches that you gotta like push it down and [ __ ] dude that's impossible to open this packaging is terrible this just fix these notches man i just spent five minutes opening that that's ridiculous okay deep breath calm down okay we're good i'm sure there's a couple funny ass faces i made during that i'm not gonna lie because i was getting i was starting to get pissed i was like i was wondering am i gonna get this gram open for the video or am i gonna have to stop the video but that was by far the hardest gram to open on the channel so yeah that's annoying moving on to the looks well these they look really good this looks really good it's got a really kind of a moist live resiny look to it crystal crystalline it looks really good it looks really kind of battery like it's all going to come up in one scoop which is nice you know i hate that little crumble consistency where you pick one up and it goes everywhere that shit's annoying but um but yeah i like this the looks of this one a lot moving on to the smell here okay that smells bomb it smells like so sour you see sour kush cake was it yeah sour kush cake you're definitely getting some of that wedding cake profile for sure pretty you can smell like it kind of smells sour this is really good it's got a pungent smell to it i like the smell a lot for sure pungent sour wet and cakey really nice moving on to my favorite part of the video and a much needed part of the video considering the beginning took me five minutes to open the taste i need a fat dab right now that was ridiculous y'all that that was ridiculous i literally had to grab this screwdriver and like do some really weird crap to get this open but i did it i got it open so here's a present to myself for getting this gram open cheers huh all right whoa that did it okay um it tastes really good i'm not even gonna put the lid back on i'm just going to like set it on top let's [ __ ] that but it tastes really good it's got kind of a the same kind of sour wedding cakey taste that it was smelling like there i really like that really strong really really clean all the way throughout really really nice uh taste on this product on to the effect here sorry y'all dying a little bit over here moving on to the effect so i like this this effect now that i've been sitting here for a couple seconds it's a nice it's a nice hybrid like i said about the uh i'm pretty sure it was the runts i feel like i can either work out right now which i just did or i can relax and play with like play with my dogs or watch something or whatever it is that you do when you like to relax you can do that after this train it's a nice nice evenly even keel uh sort of hybrid i really like the effect on this one i like the the older i get the more i like the hybrids um moving on to the ratings portion of the video now so for value okay so at forty dollars a gram you're getting a really good quality concentrate you really are the only problem i have with it is it's incredibly hard to open so like if they fix the packaging on this one the value would be a little like higher but the fact that you're paying forty dollars a gram to spend like five minutes struggling to open it with a screwdriver that's that's annoying that's that's ridiculous so i'm gonna i'm gonna say for that the value gets a 2.5 out of five because the concentrate was really good just fix the packaging because that was enough to like almost that almost made me quit filming because i i was like dude am i going to sit here for 10 minutes because that was long enough i mean that was ridiculously long the amount of time i sat there tried to open that so i was just i had to i had to open it and luckily i got it open but yeah it's terrible 2.5 out of 5 for the value packaging okay packaging one out of five i'm literally giving that a one out of five because that that is so annoying like you guys i'm sure you guys saw i was getting like legitimately mad at that freaking container like that's ridiculous so one out of five in the packaging no wii container should make you angry none that's ridiculous moving on to the looks so really like the looks on this one it's got kind of a orangish sort of tint to it it's nice um you guys will see the high resolution photo of course but really like the looks on this one i'm gonna go ahead and give the looks a four out of five because those are really good really prime looks moving on to the smell uh that smells awesome uh it smelled really really good it smelled like uh like i said kind of a sour wedding cake profile so really good i'm going to go ahead and give the smell 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the taste the taste was just like it smelled really like the exact same sour wedding cakey taste i really like that as well giving that a 3.5 out of 5. moving on to the effect so i really like this effect definitely took me down a few notches after getting upset over that whole thing but yeah i'm liking this effect a lot it's really really really nice um [Music] yeah it's like like i said it's like a 50 50 hybrid so you're getting that sativa sort of pick me up um sun's out guns out sort of thing you know if you want to go lift some weights and you're getting that relaxation body high feeling if you want to relax and not really do much after working out or working or whatever it is you do so uh yeah i'm really a fan of this effect a lot it's one of my favorite ones on the channel so far so i'm going to give it a 3.5 out of 5 as well so yeah for that that gives us 18 divided by 6 equals 3 out of 5. that might have been one of the first even numbers we've had on this channel as far as the writing goes but yeah three out of five would i buy this again man okay so like i really like the really like everything about this the packaging i mean now that i know how to open it i'll probably buy it again but that's the the way this is the way this packaging is i don't know man they really got to fix it that was so upsetting so would i buy it again probably i don't know i think there's better options out there for 35 to 40 but if they put this wax in like an abstract container absolutely i would buy it again hope you guys are enjoying my content uh hope you guys enjoyed my little mini freak out earlier in this video i'm sure it was mildly entertaining or boring either way yeah please like and subscribe if you like this channel um i know i get kind of repetitive with the content so far but i plan on branching out soon i just don't have enough resources yet to really fully branch out like i would like to so really enjoying the support y'all peace out", "UT5jSg_xnyQ": "some diamonds CCA diamonds this is blue cookie last stuff I made this rocket fuel turned out caviar didn't make me big Christmas there's a whole bunch of small ones oh this makes big crystals", "tliDHT3EKp0": "what up guys big Dan over here coming back at you and yeah we got the dry sip set we had this for some time now I just wanted to take a moment in a show that I do support even the guys that uh we talk [ __ ] to each other once in a while I still support you guys oh yeah but you got it all right you gotta support everybody in the community and uh yeah good stuff bubbleman screens not sure if they're made in China or whatnot but uh definitely good stuff love him they do the trick even picked up his little cards you know what I mean just to show some support man they're good little cards and he's a good dude that's been in the scene for a long time just because I don't agree with everything he does doesn't mean I don't like him I do subscribe to him and do watch his stuff and I suggest that a lot of you new guys do subscribe to him as well and definitely check out his stuff he does a lot of cool stuff a lot of traveling which definitely keeps me entertained and a lot of good hash making tutorials for a dry sift in bubble hash and whatnot so uh let's get to it over here we're over at the extraction office as you can see we're getting ready to just collect some nice heads and then gonna get to it with the big guns you know how we do it but uh okay let me just guys gonna have a little puff if you want and now let's get talking so what we got here is these are the little labels that go on the bag this is a pound that's a pound this is like a pound and a half these are some new flavors that I went ahead and created and after harvesting and testing these are some of the new strains that I'm digging the best that I really really like you can tell there is some leaf inch left on here because they're being collected for hash and stuff like that and before they get blasted so I like to leave a little bit of a better leafy air trichomes on there for the bounce on the screens this is the gorilla glue cross with the forum super super potent you can see even the outside of the fan leaves super crystally a big fat swollen notes I'll even pick up like little buds you can see the top big fat swollen nodes little leafy but these are for hash so uh just kind of picture them if you trim them up yourself a little bit better and there we go gets a nice nice color you can see great flush again this was from the organic batch so you can see a little bit more yellowing leaves than the typical hydro but the flavor is there and a full turkey profile as well you know I do get some gigantic knobs from the strain as you can see try to get some good light here this really does the butts no justice guys might not the lighting looks like [ __ ] as you can see perfect great flush nice organic flavors just stinking super super crystal a big fat notes just your basic fire guys again this hasn't been all squeezed up and turned into like super hard nooks and trimmed up so again judge it how you want call the schwag call it what you want but it's pretty fire actually it's absolute fire I love this string but uh this strain right here a lot better as you can see bigger fatter knobs that am more type less leaf but you could tell still picks up some of the color from the cookie Parliament now this was the key lime skunk or the lime skunk cross with cookies male pollen that's one male pollen you know this is what happened when I grew it out and it's super dank super hard the lime skunk mom was super vigorous plant that's why I chose to grow it as you can see again a little bit of yellowing no big deal that's the organic I love it when it's for my testing I just love using like nice organics we have mild nutrients just to get full flavor and a full trichome production as you can see the trikes are just overwhelming on every part of the plant not saying that can't be done with the hydro just the hydro does blow up your plants like mutant style so if you're trying to get a good picture of your actual plant and you throw it up in hydro it's not going to grow the same you know like outdoors and organic and all that so it's almost like cheating so I like to know that if I could do this with organics when the hydro comes it just goes insane but as you can see you guys look at those tops just beautiful and this one is tested as well where's the little tag there's the tag if you want you could pause it and compare the terpene profiles because that's really what's going on guys you can see the dark red really really full and the purple blue and then that little bit just has a whole bunch of terpenes in that little little area right there as you can see the Kimbo cookies has a wider spectrum a more full profile of more wide range of terpenes and it's funny cuz out of all the people that smoked it they think this is the strongest and I do too I think this is the strongest out of all the buds but again that could be due to the low percentage of CBN or the wide variety of terpenes has a lot of that cookie came to on this one just strikes so you can see the purple trichome stalks passed over from that Kimbo and that purple trichomes has a antioxidant that's similar to what's in blueberries and stuff like that but there's many varieties of that one antioxidant and yeah it could be linked to curing cancer as well so you use guys to search that and google that so a lot of us some purple strains that actually contain purple tricone stalks have a more medicinal value and now that's yet to be studied guys there's a lot of studying to do you know how it goes everything's brand new but this is just stuff I've been working on and that's why I'm testing my stuff a lot lot more and just trying to figure out exactly what's going on in these profiles in this cannabis as you can see it's complete fire I mean we already know that but we got to know what's actually making it fire a lot of people thinks it's just the 30 percent THC this weed gets me more high than all the rest but it has the lowest THC and as you can see it has way more crystals than all the rest looks by far better and has a weird complex smell that complex smell has all the Terps in it as you see but it's very hard to describe guys it does have a little bit bit of the berry from the Kimbo that little blackberry flavors it has a lot of the cushy undertones a little bit of mint from The Thin Mints but it really is hard to describe and in the testing as you see it just has a lot a lot of different terpenes and a lot of them in percents but low low THC and yeah guys now these guys always test about 10 percent lower than everyone else - so you see this like SC Labs it would be 28 instead of 18% and out something like that would be 31 instead of 21 but you know that's all due to how they cap calibrate their machines and all that [ __ ] so if you just stay testing from one lab that you know their lab is just like local to you and they're you know they're legit they're straight up at least you could just save all your snapshots and it's by their calibration so then you could save some of these and send that to SC labs and then compare the two to see exactly how much higher it was and all that but just for your own sake and just definitely to have good records on that it's very good to do it this way and also you can see it helps with Karen because you can see the date is over a month old and these buds right here you can see they've been caring for some time now guys and that's the other thing with people and how they do their weed you can see everything's intact well drying is key and there is no movement these buds do not get bumped or moved around and they get picked up very carefully put into plastic containers or into these bags just like this and then they get just sealed up all the love stays in there no [ __ ] shaking them when they really try all the trichomes fall off one shake now as you can see down there we keep the bow over two packs and I'm [ __ ] you to keep them up and these pecs are reusable guys you can see this is still that gel in it when they turns to crusty hard rocks just add water to this in a ziploc bag leave it overnight and it'll rehydrate itself and turn back to gel and then you can throw it back in your bags especially not big big bags that have multiple pounds you know there's a big huge huge s turkey bags guys so you can put a few boulders in one of these but as you can see it helps it look barely any trichome stuck to the bag itself because the buds are still really nice for curing like that perfect not too crunchy not too sticky you can see the stems are perfectly dry but not gonna shake all your trichomes off all over the place so that is key in keeping your trichomes real real nice for a long period to get a nice care and then to let these sit out maybe dry over here on the board on the table throughout the day to get them real crispy and then you could go ahead shake them off just how you want and then you have a nice cure trichome heads and then you come back and blasts all the rest but the beginning is to keep those buds perfect like that throughout the whole curing process guys and that means don't [ __ ] touch him don't [ __ ] with all year I down all right guys I just wanted to do a little talk what do we get nope didn't even talk about the wax so this is what's being produced what you're gonna do about it but super stable super wax that's what's really popular right now seems like the shatter is dying down everybody's going for the mortar vivre value stuff and as you can see we're putting in work so stay up guys big Dan over over now I just wanted to do a little update of what kind of fire has been a town what's been going on and a a little bit talk about the extraction process and these are real nice to oil slicks PTFE sheets real nice pour out your stuff don't throw these in the oven good to go real nice reusable and you know parchment is good too but if you got time and you want to try those out real good you could use it for your rosin whatever Big Ups to everybody thanks for subscribing know share comment do all that", "hOaTcLLeDXc": "and it was a good time and it was I was like [ __ ] it I

much appreciate you accent we're gonna get that [ __ ] going for sure hey my name is Roy oh I just had to fix a bunch of [ __ ] with my car so here's a good question what car do you drive what's your dream car mine's a challenge I think then [ __ ] thing's are awesome nice I currently drive a 2 Series Beemer it's the entry-level I don't know it looks sick it's really it's literally like the cheapest BMW that you can buy but everyone kind of thinks it looks chill and it looks so for me I was thinking about upgrading my car really soon and like getting a good trade-in value for it I think the plan is now I'm just gonna keep my car because it's paid off and I don't want to put on a little payment so I'm just gonna drive my car until I graduate and then when I graduate I'm gonna buy myself a fat ass with I'm already saving for it but I want it to be an everyday driver and I want it to be under a hundred grand alright none and I got it if they came in GT four came in Porsches PDK I would definitely cop that like that's like the for sure cop if I had any amount of money I would get a GT four I know everyone's gonna be like bro but the manual transmission but like dude it's a robot it makes you go faster he's like broom broom you know what I mean you know no no no Eric Congrats on 300k yeah enemy my question is what are you most excited about in sales in 19 and for everyone watching my birthday is April 21st I'll be in New York City DME if you want to come [ __ ] party this it yeah the party's Henry I'm ready for a lot of [ __ ] man I think the main thing I'm excited for if you guys don't know I made it my new year's resolution to travel once a month so I've done it already for the first three months this month for 420 we're going to San Fran next month I already mentioned earlier we're going to Miami hi in the summer months I don't know we're trying to plan something fat trying to be something cool because I've never even been out of the country and I never really traveled before this year but now I have the mean so you not have a reason to his YouTube [ __ ] so it's gonna be cool man that's what I'm most excited for I'm just gonna travel all over the country hopefully out of the country at one point he's got to find the right deals and then it's kind of worth it so hey travelin that's what I'm most excited for the youtubes shit's gonna be cool too but like I think the YouTube comes with the traveling you know what I mean obviously I'm gonna bring my camera obviously I'm gonna be smoking where I'm going so it kind of goes inside with one another you know what I mean it was good my name is Sam I'm here in Austin Texas yeah yeah I was born there if you do anywhere in the world up and just smoke chew and Julie scenery the view you know where'd you go oh this would have been a tough question like an hour ago but I I was just thinking about that actually it's kind of weird but the aurora borealis anywhere where I can see that I know there's a lot of countries in Europe or just like northern country you can probably see it in like Sweden and there's like a whole bunch of like Greenland Iceland I don't know I want to go roll up a nice fat joint and watch the aurora borealis and trip my mind maybe drop a little tab maybe I don't know probably if we're gonna be honest if I'm over there then yeah I'm probably gonna drop down the southern lights look pretty sick to you no one talks about that underrated but I mean the Northern Lights bro they're all green and [ __ ] like come on you know you trip balls looking at that yeah so this is an easy one I forgot your name what you're saying Mitch Mitch yeah all right this is an easy one man said it before I'll say it again I just balanced my [ __ ] by smoking after I'm done with all my important stuff so usually I'll wake up I'll go to school answer emails do all that stuff pretty sober and then once like the business day ends you know like 5:00 p.m. type [ __ ] then I'm just like all right [ __ ] off and I already streamed before that I start my stream every day at 3:30 so it's just like I'm kind of clocked out by that time I make sure I have nothing else like the main thing that I make sure of is that if I were to just smoke too much and pass out I wouldn't be irresponsible you know I wouldn't miss any deadlines or oh of course I just realized it was it was in 1080 man that's the worst anyway just make sure that if you get too high it's gonna be alright you can just Joe and be high cuz that's the worst thing to like when you're high and you're getting high and you remember that you have like homework you do or have to like edit a bit or upload a vid or I do this and then it's just like dams it's kind of like a buzzkill on the hunt you know I mean like I like a stress-free just chill chill high and if I have things to worry about and it's not gonna happen yo my name is Daniel and my question is what is your favorite strain right now right now yesterday right now oh shoot right now purple punch it's green it was Green crack for a while everyone the real fans know like bro Green Craig been your favorite for a while would happen purple punch man when you get the purple punch bud if you ever had some purple punch extracts like I had some lunch time as dude almost came like I almost like came soft that wasn't even hard or anything like I just [ __ ] almost came my pants but hey it was ridiculous so far but I'm Eric - Patrick I want to know the shirtless big come on bro Stan how long can I do a keg stand bro I don't have everyday cakes in my life I got shot gonna be real nice I can beer bong it'd be real nice I've never done a cake set man I'm a [ __ ] [ __ ] for that hey we'll get a cake Sancerre don't even worry about all right now that you put it in my mind I've actually never done any kicks in so I got you bro you were what session was probably the 42 grand moon rock even though that wasn't really one session if you don't want to count that that is probably the hounds in one sitting either one of them those that's I don't mean that that's a lot bro I don't really like blow down too hard like everyone gives me this leg this [ __ ] they're like bro I smoke like Suge like maybe you do bro I spent like two grams a day like including the stream to three grams a day probably like it's not that much I mean yeah smoking every day's a lot but I am 100% sure that there is a decent amount of you that smoke more than me I'm not worried but it isn't a competition bro like I've never been like dude I've smoked way more than that guy like that's just some some little dick [ __ ] right there man that is some little deed confidence right there what's up [ __ ] yeah appreciate that chase why did I start smoking honestly all my friends started smoking before me and I didn't really want to try it because like I heard all the [ __ ] in middle school was like you don't do drugs don't smoke weed like dude not do any of these things stay away from it her different parents are teachers counselors everybody so I was like of course I'm not gonna get involved my friends want to get involved they can't I'm not gonna stop him you know what I mean but as I kept hanging out with him I was like they're not really negatively effected like all these things that I thought was gonna happen to him like none of them happened there was still just who they were and they were just hi and I was like dude if I was like they can just be high and still be functional still do good in school still work their jobs or whatever and I was like I'm down so tried it out summer going into sophomore year of high school and it was a good time than it was and I was like [ __ ] it I was like I might just have to keep on doing this you know what I mean like it's not hurting me at all it's giving me a good vibe let's smoke some weed from now on and then the rest is history bro you already know what it is you know Eric your Inlet yo what's up Eric my name is Travis and my question is would you ever give up smoking for a job and if you would what John would have to be like that answer is so much different now than it was a year ago because like this this weed tube [ __ ] in like this this whole thing is actually leading stuff like a meeting companies that meeting all these people that are willing to give me jobs and it's like I don't think I'm gonna have to man but but let's just say all of it falls through let's say [ __ ] tomorrow Trump's like [ __ ] that [ __ ] you pot heads no more weed it all makes it federal again schedule one keeps it and it's just like completely [ __ ] then in that case I would give up smoking weed for a job that's like six figures probably like above yeah yeah that's like a comfortable living you know what I mean like I don't need to be a millionaire or anything but if I'm given a weed it's gotta be worth it you know what I mean it's not gonna be hard to give up like I don't think I'm gonna smoke weed forever if we're gonna be a hundred percent real like I think I'm probably gonna stop or at least take a break when I have a kid but like until then bro do you I'm not having a kid for like another decade so until then we're smoking this [ __ ] but like I don't think I'm gonna smoke it forever I'm not gonna wanna maybe when the kids a little older then I started like I don't know man the futures trippy to think about like I genuinely don't even know what the [ __ ] gonna happen in like a year that's like a asking like what are you gonna have for dinner tomorrow night but anyway I think it's pretty much done yeah that's done um that's [ __ ] gross all right appreciate you guys for coming through you guys are the absolute best 300k I love you all so so much you're all the homies man this is our year I told you 2019 was our year and everyone was like dude I mean no one really said they didn't believe but just imagine that someone was like nowhere

hope everyone's having a good ass day today we're going to do a review on gmo cookies is the strain it's one of my favorite strains back in the like you can tell basically pretty recently i used to only like like my fruity strains like the strawberries and everything like that and like tangy i still i still do that i'm still always dabbing on but i have began to love the like gassy gmo strains they have just became like a staple in my my dabbing whatever the hell you want to call it but yeah so that's that we got gmo cookies live hash rosin from grow science grow science is one of the upper echelons brands here it's like 710 if you're from california and then we also got some more live hash resin gmo this one right here it's starting to butter up but it's not it's not all the way buttered up you see how it kind of looks like it has the you know clear like just not buttered up texture like this one this one right here is buttered up there's nothing wrong when it gets buttered up it's just buttered up i mean as you see how that's a lot different texture right there we're gonna take a dab out of both those um really what happens is when it just uh is out in the air for a while or it um you know gets agitated i guess is when it starts to butter up which there's no problem with it some people um prefer it buttered up i feel you do get a little bit of different terps from it um so it is pretty good and then we got the hash this is just regular like five star so it's not depressed like this it's not pressed like the live hash rosin god damn i got my [ __ ] ah all right but yeah so that's the see if we can get that yeah there we go full melt live hash rods gmo cookies as you see this has just a way a way different texture way different consistency there we go about time just look at the difference in that and we'll take a dab of this too even though it's almost gone i need to get some more of this five star hash if you haven't tried five star hash it is just it's like it's really a game changer when it comes to dabbing in my opinion anyways um it's just a lot different like live hash rosin is a game changer too if you haven't dabbed live rosin you are missing out it is the smoothest just best dab you're gonna have it is and it gets you high like a flower high too which is the great um great thing about it so for all you that don't know what live hash rosin is um let's let's get google's definition of live hazard let's see what they have to say live hash rosin okay i want to be a [ __ ] live hack of course you get everything in live hashtags and carts of course you can't even really get anything that's crazy all right let's try hash rosin all right sorry about that just how it is sometimes our hash rosin 101 made with no more than water heat and pressure and a few good tools half thousand became one of the most prized forms of cannabis resin today that's one thing that i just wanted to make sure i was highly positive that all half rosin was just ice and water and heat and pressure and that's how it's made um there's no chemicals no solvents i was i was 100 sure that but i didn't know exactly if it was just always iced and that's how i get all the terps off if you haven't watched like ice hash making video go and check that out it's it's amazing like it is really [ __ ] just badass how they make it um since we're talking about a little bit of hash rosin too um that's honestly what i love to dab on the most um so then we got other types too um well we got this is gonna be some live hash rosin jam which is [ __ ] just amazing too of course from the grow science cultivators out here as you see it's like a syrupy like sap just it's like a sap and it's uh got a really nice texture to it just really good texture good flavor this is straw nan oh not your straw nana straw man oh oh for sure and then um this is one of the ones that has been flying off the shelves here in arizona pink pellegrino bypass resin press press and this is what i'm talking about this one hasn't really buttered up at all and that's what you get when it's not buttered up at all this [ __ ] tastes like pink grapefruit and it's just such a smooth smooth dab that's one thing that's great about the live hash rather than ros and dabs such a smooth dab just it's it's it's [ __ ] great if you haven't tried live half resin try it growth and is doing their [ __ ] thing here in arizona with the live half rosin they're my really my go-to when it comes to live hash browsing here in arizona grow sciences definitely doing their thing that's for damn sure but anyways enough to talking enough for the [ __ ] well actually we're gonna talk a little bit more because we're gonna take a dab of this gmo and then we're gonna talk about gmo and then that will be my review on gmo live hashtags from grow science let's get it while we're heating up this banger we might as well uh go and get the strain that we're doing today which is gmo cookies gmo gmo cookies strain gmo cookies strain here's the definition of straight strain or moving uniformly in one direction what a [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] i guess we'll type it in because we're having all sorts of trouble let's try one more time strain gmo cookies right now in mesa there's only a low chance of rain well i don't know what the [ __ ] that was all about but pretty annoying all right let's heat this banger up and let's take a dab all right well what uh you're probably just gonna hear the [ __ ] torch that's all you're gonna hear but uh gmo cookies aka garlic cookies is a powerful indica dominant strain cross between chem dog and girl scout cookies ah i like it when the chem dog comes through the most out of doing the gmo but anyways um the ability to it comes with the ability to re relieve playing a pain without putting your ass to sleep i don't know this [ __ ] really [ __ ] puts me on some couch block that's for sure gmo cookies [ __ ] it puts them back i don't know why it definitely does the indica hits me strong well and uh yeah every gmo cookies that but anyways um the chem dog ancestry and demo provides a pest a petrol smell layered with coffee and fruit while it's gs girl scout cookies for senator tries a sweet and earthy flavor chemo cookies is bred by divine genetics what do you bark now what yeah damn this video is getting [ __ ] up that's for damn sure but we're gonna keep rolling we're doing the one take on this one i will start editing um my videos more when i figure out how to use the everything uh software i downloaded um i honestly have never edited anything in my life so we're gonna just give it a try one of these days but this is not gonna be that video i just feel like doing a one take on it and that is what it is so um yeah we're about to take a few dabs with gmo and then we're going to call it a [ __ ] video show that's how we're doing it bang your [ __ ] [ __ ] good in the hood boom boom boom yes i know i heat up my banger way too long everyone tells me that but uh yeah this thing is just some cheap glass like get the [ __ ] out of it just about every time get everything off of it and it's still clear this thing's a couple months old and it's cheap cheap quartz in it [ __ ] still that [ __ ] [ __ ] pretty clear bro and i [ __ ] heat the [ __ ] out of that and i do dab quite a bit um but yeah let's go ahead and get this dab ready let's put it this pink pellegrino back in the stash what are you burning that booga bat all right and uh the first one we'll take is uh off the gmo that's not quite completely buttered up it's starting to butter pretty good already um that's my fault well really i don't really mind when it's buttered up but i try to keep one buttered up in one knot just because i'm i'm a dork like that um but yeah it's all personal preference we're gonna pop this back in on some ice and i'm back just like that anyways this banger should be about about where it needs to be about where it needs to be i guess not i guess being close actually you know the first dab didn't already have that on now that's already on the dab we'll take that next step is going to be oh damn how much [ __ ] [ __ ] is gonna [ __ ] like that would have been [ __ ] that i would have took out you know but we're not taking anything out we're gonna take a dab with this right after the dab of

time what the [ __ ] are you talking about if you didn't catch it you didn't catch it it is what it is but if you did catch it put in the comments see if you're right see if you are right wow i [ __ ] nailed that dab right there it's one thing that's really [ __ ] nice about that temp gun especially when you're dabbing [ __ ] [ __ ] like this [ __ ] this [ __ ] 70 80 dollars for one gram so i mean nowhere no way near is this any cheap ass [ __ ] and that's the thing like i know you can go get grams of [ __ ] shatter for 10 bucks but i would rather have this one grams all day than eight grams of shatter say why because i would"}
