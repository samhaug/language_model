{"eTb7xVO_FE0": "what's going on it's Little Miss cannabis and this is my part two video on how to use the pure distillate in the syringe form so earlier I told you how to warm it up to loosen up the consistency so it was easier to use so when it's in that state the best thing to do is if you want to eat it on a cookie just put a little rice grain piece on there and directly eat it that way and if that's not enough you can always up the dose and make your little amount on there bigger another great way to use it when it's heated up in the syringe is you can directly put it into say like a cup of hot tea or warm coffee and that's a great way to use it as well so another way you can use it at is you can vaporize it so if you have a vaporizer that looks like this this is a barbed coil vaporizer you see right in there there's a coil in there and that's what you're going to want to put the actual you know little des of medicine right in there and that coil is going to burn it pretty hot and you're going to be able to be braise it in that way now the best way to use the distillate is a way called dabbing and that's something that they are not allowed to talk to you about at the dispensaries so that's why I'm gonna do this video and show you exactly how to dab it so there's different devices you can use to dab this right here is called a dab straw so what you need to do is use a little torch and heat up the end of it you're gonna want to get it nice and hot it's going to turn a little bit once it does and you can see mine is a little bit you're gonna want to bring that parchment paper out of the freezer put it right on there and go ahead and take an inhale now this is gonna go way down in so you can tell it is definitely a deep hit for sure but this is gonna affect you really really well so another way to dab excuse me is to use add a brick so this is gonna be probably the most beneficial way to use it so what the daybreak looks like is this right here you heat this piece up right here until that gets red you put this piece on and then what you're going to do is have your little piece of distill it on here put it down in hit it that way and then feel it go away down in and then the party begins I have a good one see y'all later", "p62i-lwAn8o": "hey guys it's Florida MJ 4/20 here today I'm going to be opening my latest haul from true leaf Panama City Beach dispensary location let's see what we got we've got some 9 pound hammer Rosen man 83.5% TCA and 3.1 percent of THC for a grand total of eighty eight point six and we've got some co2 oil this one we have a Skywalker og and this one gorillas grapes will see the Skywalker og eighty point three percent THC an eighty percent THC on a gorilla grapes last but definitely also least is the I got a little syringe warmer because you know I've been using hot water and all kinds of stuff like that for a long time and I just figured I'd give it a try seems like it might be more convenient let's take a look at the total here they actually forgot to put the warmer on the first time I use my trigger points they let me stack it for twenty percent this time that's the first time I've ever had them do that I don't know if that's a new thing or what but I was allowed to get twenty percent discount from my true liver points and so instead of being two twenty five that came out to 180 so that makes each one of these sixty bucks apiece 60 bucks for the co2 and sixty bucks for the rosin I think that's a pretty decent deal you make rosin at home you're gonna be paying probably forty to fifty bucks or so to make it grandma rosin maybe a little bit more depending on the strain and you know $60.00 co2 oil is just a great deal because usually it's their regular distill it that's at $60 price point and I don't really like the regular distill it that much I mean it's just not the same level as the co2 this syringe warmer right here is $20 normally with the 20% off that 16 bucks total and here it is so this thing right here what you will do is take your battery mod that fits a 5-10 cartridge on it and hopefully you can unscrew it I guess mine's a little bit leaky we have to well there we go whoo yeah that'll loosen it up just enough darn I can't get it here we go finally how'd you get a glove alright so yeah that's the problem is I've got a bunch of leakage right here so I need to get a q-tip with some alcohol on it and cleaning that thing out that can also cause your your mod to stop working I actually found this on the ground somebody just threw it out and this thing was all gunked up and so there you go now it works let's see if this works even though it's still all gunky you just screw in the syringe warmer on your battery mod see if I can feel it it doesn't really have any structions with it smells like it's heating up in there yeah you just take this sucker look how pretty it is I love how pretty the co2 oil is just take this and stick it in there I guess maybe you take off this cap I'm not really totally sure what you do I've never used it and there's no instructions but see if this does anything hmm wonder how long this thing takes there we go it's certainly heat up right here I don't know it might be easier just to do a lighter guys seriously like what in the heck maybe I gotta try it like this take this thing off it doesn't seem to make much sense to me but I'll try it when the heck was that oh there's a spring I don't know the here is like a spring weird okay let's see this is holder for ten seconds to see if that doesn't so the video cut out there right after I held it down for ten seconds but yeah it does it does heat it up you know it's not as fast as a lighter and you have to sit here and hold it so mmm if you don't want to mess with a lighter I guess it could be worth it but yes here we go there it's all it's all melted now it really doesn't take that long you don't get sick all over it you don't have to worry about using all your butane there you go you can just keep this thing plugged in if you want really so it looks like that works pretty well I didn't get any flour because I'm all out of my flour recommendation you know I got caught up in the one plant slash three boys farm ordeal and so I spent my recommendation on that now I mean I'm not regretting it you know it's like it was a really good deal hundred twenty-five dollars for an ounce so 250 for two ounces that's pretty awesome I mean a quarter pound for 500 bucks you know medical grade pretty awesome but you know I I do miss the variety I wish I had I definitely wish I had my recommendation open when I went to the grand opening of this truly Panama City Beach because they had a nice selection of strains they had like four or five strains that day and they also had all the cups I'd use all the cups I got I went back and I only had there yesterday it was just cups of what is it wine wine dream Dutch wine yeah Dutch wine and I just I've already got cups of that so I don't really care about it yeah you know it's good stuff but I like a variety so I should my recommendation should be coming up here and about a week or so so I'll be getting a bunch more reviews on actual flour in here soon hopefully maybe I'll take a couple deliveries from other dispensaries to and branch out with what I'm reviewing instead of just doing and all the stuff that's closed or that I've gotten from before but like fluent I know I can get deliveries from them and possibly vitae can and med men I'm not really sure but yeah I'm ready to taste some variety I've been stuck on the same strains for a while now and that'll teach me something in the future too you know don't get stuck on the big old hype trap if if you might have some new openings coming in your area but it's all good I just got to say that that the employees at the Panama City Beach location seem pretty cool they're all very friendly and polite so far the atmosphere in general up there is really nice you know it's not there's not a bunch of grumpy people I mean it's not a bunch of people arguing or whatever perhaps the limit on minis help that I don't know but they said that the minis I talked to I guess my team in a shift manager I'm not sure but he said that the minis are still selling out and they'll be you know usually they'll be gone by early afternoon even with the two person or two per person limit so it's just a really popular item and you can't blame them when they're you know giving out really fat jars of minis they just baton for social media with those things you know they want to get on in line they want to get their message out they want people who don't have a card and who are getting from a dealer to say hey wait whoa whoa you can get four grams for the price of 3.5 and it looks good you know like that I mean so you know it's a work in progress this is like the Wild West phase that we're in right now once everything gets sorted out you know once the competition gets more firmly rooted wants some acquisitions take place then we're gonna start to see a more stable environment with better prices and better customer or care I think right now they're just you know that some of these people are some of these dispensaries are gonna get snapped up some of them are gonna get bought out some of them are gonna you know have really bad financial problems I mean just depends you know you got to see how it plays out and in the next two years I think we'll see the market stabilize a lot we'll see a bunch of acquisitions and stuff like that and it'll be a lot better for us at that point you know we just got a grin and bear it for now it is a kind of a [ __ ] show you know trying to get flour in this state hang in there and we can do it and you know another thing I just wanted to say I think I'm gonna start adding this as much as I can to everything I say because I just noticed that online we've got so much negativity not just in our forum not just in the medical marijuana community but in America we just in our whole country everyone is so negative everyone is always wants to be right everyone always wants to prove someone wrong everyone always wants to knock somebody down a peg and I'm guilty I'm just as guilty as anybody else or more so and you know we got to just start being kind man just please please please be kind", "IG_E7qdZl7s": "as part of the boom in a global cbd industry in recent years we've seen a great deal of development in cbd products as well as the technology used to produce them we can now buy cbd oils tinctures edibles tea coffee and more when browsing cbd products you'll also find some common terms popping up all the time such as isolate and distillate so what is distillate and our products containing cbd distillate better than other cbd products there are no easy answers to these questions cbd distillate does have a number of advantages but like anything it has its pros and cons it's also important to remember that distillate is simply a type of cbd extract which does not guarantee the quality of the product you buy simply because it's labeled distillate in this video we'll cover the different forms of cbd such as isolate and distillate as well as taking a deep dive into cbd dissident we'll also examine a various way one can use it as well as pros and cons but let's start by clearing up the confusion between the two common cpd terms so cbd isolate versus cbd distillate people often get cbd isolated and cbd distiller confused that's not surprising considering they are both highly refined potent and concentrated types of cbd however there are some key differences between the two and it is important to know the difference in order to make informed decisions as a consumer so let's take a look at each intern so we can understand the similarities and differences what is cbd isolate cbd is a purified form of cbd obtained from the cannabis plant using a special industrial extraction process the crystal form of cbd isolate is subsequently converted into a fine white colored powder for consumption it's highly refined and is the purest form of cbd available with at least 99.5 percent cannabinoid content this purity means cbd isolate does not contain any of the many other cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant including the psychoactive compound thc this is often the center point of cbd isolate however the absence of the other cannabinoids means that you may be missing out on the entourage effect which many believe is the key to maximizing the benefits of cbd since the thc content is almost zero it's suitable for those who want to ensure the lowest possible concentration of thc for example those who may be worried about returning a drug test that is positive for tse although it's worth noting that all cbd products not just the ones based on cbd isolate contain a concentration of thc that is so low it will not have any psychoactive effects in fact this negligible concentration of thc is a requirement for any cbd product that is legally sold in the uk the us and many other countries so what is cbd distillate cbd distillate is another form of cbd that is obtained from the cannabis or hemp plants through a specific extraction and refining process unlike crystalline and powdery cbd isolate distillate is a vicious substance that is similar to honey in both color and texture distillate is further refined compared to cbd oil but not as refined as cbd isolate the different levels of refinement are as follows first cannabis flower the natural flowering topsoil buds of the hemp plant then crude extract the raw extract from the cannabis plant with a wide spectrum of cannabinoids as well as chlorophyll and fatty acids number three is refined oil the royal extract is refined and processed to create a refined oil that is decarboxylated and doesn't contain waxes or plant material number four is distillate further refined cbd extract distilled into a fraction and number five is finally isolate the single molecule cbd extract which is very very close to pure cbd at the top of this list are the raw ingredients that contain a wider cannabinoid spectrum as these are refined down the substances have a narrower cannabinoid spectrum and a simpler chemical profile this means they are stronger and more pure in terms of cbd with a lower potential for antarctic effectiveness sitting just above cbd ice along the list cbd distillates purely cbd oil but not completely pure containing additional cannabinoids and other compounds it is still highly concentrated however with 80 or more cbd content the remaining portion of cbd distillate is constituted of the other compounds on the plant including the cannabinoids thc and other oils and terpenes since cbd distillate contains multiple ingredients from the plant it can have a slight characteristic taste unlike the odorless and taste of the cbdi slip apart from the characteristic properties it works more or less in the same way as cbd isolate because the major component is the same cbd distillate is available in various forms and names with a range of constituents the hemp plant contains hundreds of cannabinoids while cbd isolate has only the cbd compound we've seen that distillate has around an eighty percent concentration of cbd and the remaining trading percent is made up of a large range of other substances so let's take a look at a few of the cannabinoid compounds typically present in cbd distillate cvg is a canopy that can be obtained from cbd oil by a fraction in process or directly extracted from cbg hemp cbg distillate usually has between 50 and 75 concentration of cbd it can be used to produce cbg capsules and vaping products which can support better health and well-being in a similar way to cbd it doesn't have the psychoactive properties similar to cbd and it can be used as a raw substance used to extract cbd thc or cbc cbc is not as popular as some of the other cannabinoids however it is known for similar beneficial properties as cbd cbn is yet another cannabinoid found on the cannabis plant and a component in the cvd distillate is currently still being studied to better understand its effects but is currently believed to have sedative properties cbda is also an important compound found in a hemp plant it's usually converted to cbd over time and with exposure to heat when consumed it can encourage the endocannabinoid system to suppress the cox-2 enzyme which could be useful in managing information to conclude cbd distillate is a concentrated and powerful form of cbd it's less pure than cbdi isolate but still boasts impressively high cbd concentration of around 80 additionally the presence of the other cannabinoids and compounds supports the arguably beneficial entourage effect as of any cbd product it's also important to do your research and make sure you only buy quality distillate from a trusted vendor well everyone we hope you enjoyed today's video if you're looking for cbd oil broad spectrum that is on our website we sell cbd balm oil and capsules expect more videos to come talking about cbd oil how you should take it and much more to stay up to date make sure you hit that subscribe button and ring that bell we'll see you next time", "7E6pxDesewg": "[Music] hi it's Brandi with green wellness life it has been a bit since we've done a video and I've been getting some customer requests so learn a little bit more about a few of the products that we offer so I thought we would take a few minutes to do just that today so we are going to talk about the plus CBD oil raw whales that we have now and you might have seen our other video on a raw tuile and how that works and that is from USM wholesale and that is an a standard oral syringe real easy to use you just push down that plunger the only problem with it is that the serving size cannot always be exactly precise we recommend that you and would put those serving sizes in terms of grains of rice and I've actually a customer say well what type of rice brown rice white rice long grain yeah super good question it's pretty it's pretty standard so everybody is a grain of rice size serving might be a little bit different so plus DVD has taken some of that guesswork out of it for us now they don't have a raw version they have what they call the total plant complex which is their full spectrum still has plant matter all the cannabinoids included there and then they've got their filtered option so that is their gold option and it does have a little bit more precise serving these come in a one a three and a six gram applicator so that's pretty similar to our other offering but the us have does have a 10 gram and that is a bit of a better value same percentages so the gold is going to be about 25% or 250 milligrams of CBD part of one gram serving and then the total plant complex with the green label that guy is going to be about 150 milligrams of CBD for the one gram applicator because they have that precise serving size each one gram gives you 20 servings so if we're go back to our grain of rice analogy that's about a grain and a half of rice per serving so these are super easy to use all that you do is twist until you hear the click this has been my sample guy for a while so it was little bit dried at the top I was just cleaning that off because well yeah so this is the gold you simply turn it until you hear the click I'm not sure if that was audible to you but we turned it until here to click that will go right onto your spoon to your finger to whatever you want to use and it's going to dispense about that much because the Gold's more of a gel rather than a piece that's going to hold its shape it does turn a little bit liquid I'm gonna give you one more serving size example so it still kind of looks like a grain of rice to me I'm not much of a cook just ask my husband but it probably is a little bit thicker in that application still gonna have that almost popery flavor of the filtered CBD oil with no added ingredients no carrier oil no flavorings no anything just those different cannabinoids in a filtered form now the total plant complex green label again 15% versus 25% this is still going to be more of a paste then that goolge a little different consistency little thicker we're still just going to turn it to here one click and then we will have we will have the one serving of the total plant complex so one serving of that guy just turning til we hit the click easy-peasy this is gonna look about like that so again our grain and a half of rice I'm a total plant complex this one's still going to taste really grassy and earthy heavy is our adjective but grassy and earthy and the difference between the two is that this guy just has not been as filtered so it's gonna still have some of that plant matter all those terpenes in there that some of us really like thicker green paste we're gonna pop it under the tongue let it dissolve a little bit 30 60 seconds whatever works for you and then move on with your day it tasted either of these is a struggle for you I get asked a lot about mixing them with a liquid I wouldn't do that as these are they're just not gonna mix that well with a liquid so try mixing it with honey coconut oil something of that nature to help you out with that flavor should be pretty helpful so just another option another great way to get CBD into your life on a daily basis without any additives you are always welcome to email us at

"2iOpA-P3VSs": "hey guys Peter with their vapor here and I'm back with another pro tip video on how to fill syringes specifically these small 1 ml glass syringes that we carry these syringes are a popular packaging option for high quality material but they can be difficult to fill so today I'm going to show you two methods that will save you hours of work especially if you have to fill hundreds or thousands of these things let's dive in the first method we are going to cover is the syringe coupler method this tiny white thing here is a syringe coupler we have them available for purchase and they allow you to connect a big syringe to a small syringe which is really cool because that is going to allow you to fill these at a much faster rate you're just going to take your larger syringe and make sure it's filled with your material then put the coupler on it by twisting it on to the luer lock then take the cap off your smaller syringe after it's fully assembled attach it to the coupler and begin your filth by gently pushing material from the bigger syringe into the smaller syringe after the fill is complete remove the small syringe from the coupler place the cap on it and there you have it a filled 1 ml syringe the second method will cover preferred method of filling because it does not require as many assembly steps which saves a lot of time there's a special tool that I'll be using to perform this fill and you can probably find it at your local sporting goods store or Walmart it's ten pound fishing line I have a roll of it right here first we're gonna cut about a four-inch section of the fishing line or whatever you can comfortably hold in your hand some of our clients like to take the fishing line and tape it to a chopstick or popsicle stick to make it easier to grasp but the basic technique remains the same you will still need a larger syringe filled with your material such as this 10 ml syringe I have here or you can even make this work with a filling machine you're going to start by taking the syringe you want to fill with a cap on and no plunger then place it in a position where it can be held upright luckily this is exactly how they come packaged if you buy from us then holding the larger syringe above the smaller syringe gently begin to fill the syringe from the top dead center taking care not to get any material on the sidewall of the syringe above the fill line this is actually really important after filling you're gonna place your fishing line into the syringe like this allowing it to hover right above the liquid then slowly push the plunger down and tell it meets the liquid inside then pull the vent cord out as you can see if this technique is used correctly it allows you to hand fill these syringes at light speed compared to other methods and there you have it a filled 1 ml glass syringe thanks for watching this video please hit us up with any questions in the comment section hit that subscribe button below smash that

Joe and extract lab and today we'll be comparing distillate and icy distillate is the high cannabinoid full-spectrum extract from either hemp or marijuana this is the resulting product of this lemon as a welcome party of dislike and range from 75 to 85% cannabinoids and can sometimes be even higher now the remaining percentages on this slit or other plant material such as lipids and potentially some turkeys if you take a look at the distillate here you'll see a viscous beautifully golden oil now this looking range in color from gold to amber to the red but usually the darker distillate is caused by rushing the distillation process by setting aggressive parameters we tested two gas chromatography little-to-no turbines are present resulting in a somewhat bland scent now this depends on the removal of volatile impurities present in extraction solvents prior to cannabinoid distillation high potency CBD distillate will always crystallize over time crystallization can be accelerated by cold temperatures this distillate hasn't crystallized it because it is fresh off the stove even though this lip crystallizes it would not be considered Iceland Iceland is an individual cannabinoid separated from the planet matrix in the case of cannabidiol or some meat it is a white crystal ground down into a free-flowing powder the cannabinoid contents on Iceland are usually 99% or higher Iceland has no scent and properly manufacture no taste as well now these isolated cannabinoids have much more research to be done especially some of the new ones that have been discovered like CBD P and T ACP now whether your goals are to produce a high cannabinoid full-spectrum extract like discipline or to individually isolate cannabinoids extract what I was here to help you do like this

this is Jimmy again I have talked about ahem extraction lines on the last episode I'm using the Prussian lines so we can make hemp biomass into coal oil in this episode I'm going to show you the biomass first and then showed you the step by step how to turn the crude oil into good and clear CBD oil so the biomass my current use from this is pretty good as we can see here they have done a good job on separating the biomass out of hemp fiber and hemp seeds all the material remaining in this pack are in high quality they contains a lot of a hemp flour and and leaf which has pretty high CBD contents especially don't want any hemp seeds in your bio mast the hemp seeds contain seed oil which has no CBD in it if you process a bag of biomass that has too much hemp seed in it then you and I was getting a CBD distillates that looks like clear and golden but has very low Sabri concentration in that case that punch that bottle of CBD oil will not be selling an very good price let's take a look at our distillation units so before talking about this relation line we have to talk about how to polish and how to get your CBD crew ready for this relations so right here we are using a rotary evaporator to decarbonize our C bleaker oil so in here we have about 10 litres in this round a flask that we got a foreign extraction line and in here as you can see the liquids beneath the crude oil are yellow so because we were using heat transfer fluids in it instead of a using water by using the heat transfer fluid we can heat up this units 235 degree Celsius which will remove a little bit of ethanol out of it and so decarbonize it nicely so here is our [Music] white film distillation units and our left is crystallizer so we can after we have disciplines we can transform the disciplines into CDP the isolates in in this units so this is not a usual reactor that you see we have a future on the bottom which is the white one yes you can see on the bottom so that one will be filtered out CPD isolates out of the matter liquids the matter its click liquids will be drink from the bottom and CBD isolates will be remain on the future as you can see here here's the drain so once your once you got your CBD isolates by lowing the chlorine temperature you can open a vow and drain the mother liquids out of it okay let's talk about how this were filmed this laser machine work so this machine will help us to transfer our crude oil into good and clear disciplines so we just finished the first runs of of coroico usually we run the crude oil through this machine to time so this is the feeding tank right here so this machine separates different components by using the boiling temperature differences for example your view your terpene and your CBD oil all have different type of boning temperatures also there is some sugar and there's some small particle in or crude oil as well and those things doesn't boil at all so those can be separated by using this machine as well so we just finished our first runs on the floor we have two buckets the buckets on the left is the polished crude oil the buckets on the right is the the terpenes and and also some crow fields so this machine's and everything they have a lot lower boiling temperature will we both will come out and falling into the right buckets all the things that have a higher temperature or four downs to the left pockets so in the first round we set the main body temperature the main distillation body temperature into a temperature that the terpenes and curfew will keep boiling well the CBD will not boil so we have we will also catch all some of the eighth notes in the system so in here we have two Co traps the left cold trap is negative thirty Seco trap the Reiko trap is negative 83 contract and as you can see that the negative eighty contra is we can filling the dry ice or liquid nitrogen in it to treat as well so here we have a vacuum gauge and we have a vacuum pump do stage where come from one floor the first one is turbo pump second one is the normal oil thing reckon pump so the color in the right pocket is look pretty greenish and the viscosity is very high which tells us that there is the terpene for sure and we're going to dump the left pocket back to the fitting tank and do a second runs so in the second runs the we're setting the temperature so that CBD will keep boiling well the others are not well others I mean the particles and the waste will not be boiling so we can collect CBD of the machines so right now we are running this machine further where we're running the crude oil for the second times so because you can see we are feeding the crude oil in its so the mercy is is keep running and we have the the waste coming out of from the left tube and which dripping into the buckets then this halfs and on the right we have dissidents so as we can see in temperature it's not I mean the color for the distillate is not so good because it we just start running the machine we haven't we haven't fine-tuned the machine yet so I'm going to do some fine-tuning to make sure that the color looks much much better after a few changes in temperature setting for this y film distillation units the CBD colors looks looks much much better than previously I just changed temperature setting on the the center coil for this units and also a little bit of vacuum as well make it look much better this units can output about 5 liters of distillate Spri hour and I can improve it a little bit more just changed heating heaters and Childress for this unit to upgrade it into a higher capacity so that this unit can run under be faster even he can even run about a liters per hour if you have the right heaters so that would be all the information now like a share today so we talked about distillation we talked about crystallization and my client is pretty happy about what he got today and here we have the CBD distillates that we have around today this civilities looks looks in a high viscosity but because it is hot after is cooled down to room temperature it should be close to solids so if you liked this video please give us a thumbs up and think about our subscription thank you very much have a good day bye bye", "cy0r4zIdDMs": "[Music] hi friends trent the wizard here with factory six we're diving deep into some factory six factoids going into the forge about the difference between full spectrum broad spectrum and isolate products now the first thing we need to under really understand is where does that come from what is hemp extract well that comes from this delicious little flower here which is produced by the hemp plant now this little guy is where we're really going to pull most of our product from some of the leaves but mostly this is where the concentrated product exists now it's about a three to four month growing period for this to come to full fruition then a couple months for you know harvesting and drying and then at that point we're going to put it through an extraction process most commonly that extraction process is going to be a co2 or an ethanol depending upon you know purity and speed and whatever you're looking for but there's also new processes that are coming out we're working with a company right now that is actually working on a high pressure water extraction right now that is really exciting because it's solventless it's all natural we'll see how that comes out and more as it comes down the line however right now we're going to talk about the full spectrum crude oil that is the first thing that comes off the plant through that extraction process so this dark tar-like substance is exactly what has what we call a full spectrum of the cannabinoids or when we say that we mean all of the cannabinoids that that specific strain or that variety of hemp produced so it doesn't contain all 113 known cannabinoids but it will produce a variety of specific ones depending on the strain that you're growing and from there when you put it through the extraction process those are what's going to be present here along with some plant fats some chlorophyll some other things like that this is a pretty raw material so taste wise it's not super delicious it's kind of rough to the palate however there's things that we can do with this even as it is right now one of those things being we can use it in for example topicals like a cbd balm or a cream that way we're also utilizing as much of the plant as possible because it's as close as to it as we can get it's the first extraction that's something that you can really just use and just rub onto the skin and it's really nice you're gonna get most of the benefit that you can get from the plant in and of itself from this product alone all right friends so the next step in that process that we're going to be talking about today is going to be distillation with distillation we're going to get a distillate from crude oil that distillate is going to look very much like a honey as you can see here it is a very beautiful product in the sense that it's got the fats the chlorophyll everything else is taken out of it it can come in two different forms it can either come in a full spectrum or a broad spectrum the full spectrum is going to have again like i said all of those cannabinoids that plant produced and 0.3 or less thc as per federal regulation whereas a broad spectrum you're taking all of that thc out down to four decimal points so it's a non-detectable amount in that extract for you so the main thing that we're going to use something like this for is we're going to put this into something that's more of like an adjustable product like a tincture but this is really one of the main or most popular products that we use with a distillate among the many various products that we can put distillate into all right friends and as we move along this process we're going to be taking our distillate down to an isolate so in isolate as we go down that refinement process is going to be a powder that is literally a crystallized oil which is actually quite fascinating but one of the benefits of that that gives us is the fact that we can do really targeted things now an isolate is a 99.9 or 99.5 pure concentrate extract so we're talking about really really pure no plant anything but just that singular compound in and of itself so you know this is kind of like a sniper rifle in the sense you can get really targeted you can get really specific on what you're trying to do with it and that's really really nice it's workability it's it blends well it does a lot of things that these other products is a little bit more difficult takes a little bit more time to do so for example like a great product that an isolate would be used for is like a quick tab it's a nice little sublingual tablet that dissolves directly into the mouth but again it's very easy to work with and that's why we like to use an isolate with it all right guys so the last thing we're going to be talking about today in our process is going to be a powdered water soluble extract now this is unique in the sense that we're taking a oil product we're encapsulating it down on a nano size to actually make it dissolvable in water which is really really unique considering the oil and water don't generally mix so from this we can make really really cool products there's a lot of applications you can do especially since this can be a broad spectrum product still retaining all that cannabinoid profile all that entourage beautiful effect that we've talked about earlier but while at the same time getting a very very targeted application it's really unique and really really cool to work with guys thanks for watching this is all we have for you today for more information check out factory6cbd.com watch more of our videos this is trent the wizard with factory six factoids again we'll see you next time you", "O6-wdJagsYk": "just want to say this upfront this is not a sponsored video so there's not going to be any discount codes or anything of that nature throughout this video however the company that I will be talking about did send me some product to try out for free but I'm not letting that influence what I'm about to say you see a lot of these CBD videos that get put out there and people are paid so they're more influenced to say certain things to make the product seem a little bit more promising than what it may be so just want to make you guys aware of that now let's start the video well so now guys welcome to a brand new video thank you for stopping by I really do appreciate it as always so the topic at hand CBD oil you've seen a ton of this on social media I'm sure of it everybody proclaiming that it is the number one care to literally everything under the Sun from anxiety to inflammation joint pain migraines anything can be cured with a few drops of CBD oil but is this actually the truth a company called herb strong and I'm sure you've heard of them before they contacted me about four or five weeks ago asking me if I'd like to try out one of their products for free and me being the curious person that I am I just wanted to see what the hype was all about and I did my research on it so that I wouldn't get tested positive in a drug test which I will touch on later so they decided to send me their $65 bottle of 1000 milligram full-spectrum hemp oil and if you want to see how I reacted to it what my thoughts are on it then you can just go to this time stamp right here but first I think we have to talk about what CBD actually is CBD otherwise known as cannabidiol is actually one of over 100 different chemical compounds known as cannabinoids that are exclusive to the cannabis plant now the really cool thing about the human body is that we actually have a couple of receptors known as cb1 and cb2 that are cannabinoid receptors now the cb1 receptors are responsible for psychoactive effects so when you consume something that has a strong affinity for this receptor and makes it active such as delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol otherwise known as THC you're going to experience things that come with being high impaired movement impaired vision you might forget a few things anything comes up being high it's because of the cb1 receptors being active now the cv 2 receptors are actually found in the immune system and these are meant to actually help the human body which is why you see these CBD oil companies proclaiming that they're going to help things like anxiety migraines inflammation joint pain that's because CBD actually has a strong affinity for the cb2 receptors and when active they're supposedly supposed to help with all these things now is this stuff legal to purchase yes and no it really does all depend because boom people hear the word cannabis they instantly freak out it is 100% legal I'm going to stay away from it with a 50-foot pole however it really all depends from a technical standpoint as long as somebody contains 0.3% or less THC then it is perfectly legal to purchase however anything over that threshold is obviously illegal that's why you see things such as hemp powder being sold in grocery stores because it really doesn't contain any THC now this does not mean that it's not going to show up on a drug test like I did say before 0.3% or less if it contains 0.2% if there's a chance that it's going to show up on a drug test so just make sure you are doing a research before purchasing anything CBD related now the company herb strong they did send me some product and I like I said before I did my research before even saying yes to the free products just to make sure that it didn't contain any THC and I took a look at their lab report and I took a look at the left hand bottom of the report and it said that it did not contain any detectable amounts of THC so as I said before if you plan on purchasing something just make sure that you do some research on whatever company it is and make sure that there's no detectable THC in their products because this is a powered looking Channel and I do compete in the USA PL which is an IPF affiliate let's talk about wada for a second or the world anti-doping agency let me take a look at their banned substances list and you're going to see that cannabinoids are actually on their banned list however they do make an exception for cannabidiol which as I did mention before is CBD but as I did mention if your product that you are consuming does contain traceable amounts of THC then you are going to test positive for drugs in your system so as I keep harping on make sure you do your research on any of these products that are CBD related now that we have all that sciency stuff out of the way let's talk about my experience with CBD oil now again I do compete and tested Federation didn't want to take anything that would end up biting me in the ass for lack of better terms which is why I gave the okay to Armstrong to send me out some of their stuff because from what they said it doesn't contain any traceable amounts of THC now I don't suffer from anxiety or migraines multiple sclerosis anything of that nature all I really do suffer from is some joint pains and some inflammation maybe my sleep quality could have improved a little bit but really nothing on the mental health side of things more so just actual physical pains that I do suffer from so I was hoping by taking this product it would help out with those pains a little bit so I followed the instructions for about a week five drops underneath the tongue both in the morning and at night so it's ten drops a day on an empty stomach and after the first week really didn't experience anything at all took a little bit the email one more time and said to give it a couple of weeks so I gave it another seven days same thing five drops in the morning and at night ten drops a day 140 drops over a span of two weeks and the only really noticeable thing that happened was that my sleep quality did improve a little bit my joint pains were still there inflammation was still there nothing had really gone away now I was giving it one more week but I actually increased the dosage this time to eight drops in the morning and at night so it's sixteen drops a day for another week and again no inflammation or joint pains ended up going away which what I was a little bit disheartened by because you see all these posts on social media and they claim that it is the magic elixir that's going to help out with all of your pains and this isn't something that I did experience so I am a little bit disappointed with that so this really isn't a product that I'm going to be using in the future I actually ended up giving the remaining of the remainder of the bottle to someone at work that does suffer from anxiety and hopefully it does help them out a little bit more than I did help me but I just want I just wanted to put out this video to spread a little bit of truth when it does come to the use of these products just make sure that you are doing your research on all this stuff because you really don't want to be wasting $6,500 on something that's potentially not going to work now going back to the whole sleep quality thing can I take this to improve my sleep quality sure am I going to know because I think there's better ways to improve overall sleep quality such as getting some blackout curtains to make sure that it's pitch-black in your room regulating your room temperature so you're always sleeping in the same temperature every single night and just getting more hours of sleep if you like you could improve your sleep quality for a set price of maybe like fifty bucks instead of always spending sixty five dollars a month which can really add up over time and end up being a waste of money if you could do it in a much cheaper fashion so yeah that was pretty much my experience with CBD maybe it just didn't work out for me I'm not sure but I really don't see myself using this product in the future and just be weary of other people that are saying that it's curing everything that is wrong with them because I for one didn't experiences I did a post on Reddit and other people were saying that they experienced pretty much the same thing that I did with CBD oil where their inflammation and joint pain really didn't go away there were some people that did say that it did help out with our migraines but again I don't suffer from those so I can't really speak on those so to say so yeah that's my experience with CBD oil hope you don't hate me for it if you did enjoy the video or you just feel it does deserve one please be sure to drop in to thumbs up because it helped does help to channel out a lot more than you do think if you want to see any more of my videos and please be sure to sub to the channel and hopefully I'll see you with that next one [Music]", "whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven light goal boy and we will do another review yeah man that's all i got to say about it this joint is pissing me off much love y'all seven likes do it do it all right go to twitch.tv link will be in

whole gram", "8qHG4h7fPk8": "hi I'm certified nutrition consultant Catherine with foods that heal you and foods that heal you CBD and in this video in our series I'm going to explaining the difference between four different types of CBD oil full-spectrum broad-spectrum CBD isolate and distal eight all right so I've mentioned in previous videos full-spectrum I've shown you the CBD wheel which I'll show again here but full-spectrum means that it has all of the plant parts it has all of the phyto cannabinoids it has all of the plant terpenes it has vitamins minerals all of the phytonutrients it's it contains everything my analogy that I use is it's like eating an apple if you take a bite of the apple you're getting all of the nutrients in that Apple you're not just extracting certain nutrients you're getting all of the coke the cofactors all of the synergistic nutrients in that Apple alright so if you look at the cannabinoid wheel and this is just an illustration this is not all of the cannabinoids but there's over a hundred but you can see that you have CBD is one cannabinoid and you've got CBN CBT and you even have THC and this is where the confusion can come in so yes full spectrum does have THC in it in trace amount it's still legal because it's below the legal limit of 0.3% so you're not going to experience the effects of THC if you're getting hemp derived CBD hemp oil alright so that's what full spectrum is and one more thing about full spectrum just explain between CBD and THC because this does come up sometimes people ask me does CBD have THC in it so no it doesn't because CBD as you can see is one phyto cannabinoid and THC is a separate can't avoid it would be like saying is there any vitamin B in my vitamin C there is not because there are separate vitamins these are separate cannabinoids okay so one's not in the other but they can be in the same plant all right so that's full spectrum and full spectrum is considered to be really the best option because in nature nutrients works best synergistically together and there was an Israeli study that showed also that the full spectrum was superior to these other types now that doesn't mean that full spectrum is going to be the best for you because everybody's gonna need something different you may be looking for something with zero THC in it so there's other options here as I'm gonna go through now the but the full spectrum I also wanted to give a couple examples of full spectrum so that you understand what it can look like it's a full spectrum the the most pure or whole plant extract is gonna look like our pure oil concentrates this is the green label and this is the gold label these are whole plant hemp extracts so this is the as close to the original plant is you're going to get without just grinding up the leaves all right so this is the hemp extract and then what you can do is you can have a full so that's full spectrum you can have a full spectrum drops like our tasty drops because what you can do is you can take the head backtrack add it in to this bottle with a carrier oil like MCT oil or hemp oil which I explained in other videos but you can add it in with maybe a flavor and shake it up now you have a full spectrum tincture drop alright now here's where the confusion could get in that you really need to know how to read your labels so make sure you watch the other other video in this series so you learn how to read the labels but this can be any of these truly so you want to make sure that if you want full spectrum you know how to read that label and you know that there's full spectrum in that bottle because it's the highest risk for getting anything in here and junk in there that you're not aware is in there alright alright the second type is gonna be broad spectrum so broad spectrum is going to be very similar to full spectrum the biggest difference is it's not gonna have any THC so they filter out the THC our broad spectrum product is our HC CBD spray so this has all the phyto cannabinoids it has plant terpenes phytonutrients it just doesn't have the THC so for example if your concern about drug testing for THC and you want something with zero THC but you want the benefits of full spectrum then the CBD spray would be a really great option broad spectrum would be a option there now what it does is it calls causes something called the entourage effect so full spectrum and broad spectrum you're gonna have that on taraj effect which I explained I I called it the synergistic it's synergistic nutrients working together that's basically the entourage effect when you have all the nutrients working together with all the cofactors the body's gonna be able to absorb and utilize it more effectively okay and then the third option is going to be CBD isolate now CVD isolate is going to be a white powder it's very very pure you don't have any other cannabinoids no THC no cbn CDG none of those no phytonutrients no vitamins no minerals nothing else the only thing that's in the isolate is strictly CBD and if you look on this wheel it would be only this little section right here now obviously there are a lot of potential benefits of the CBD right but if you don't have these synergistic cofactors and that entourage effect this CBD may not work very well for you now there are some things that you can do to help bring back that entourage effect and I'm going to give you a couple examples of the isolates that we have we have our cat drops are a CBD isolate and the reason for that is because cats have sensitive stomachs so we have an isolate in here now as you can see between these two bottles you would never know this is full spectrum and this is isolate that's why you really need to know how to read labels cuz I slit is less expensive so if you're paying for full spectrum and you're getting an isolate you're getting ripped off okay you want to make sure you're getting what you're paid for we have the isolated in here and then what we do is we add in back in a carrier oil that's going to help create that entourage effect all right then the other thing you can do is for example a vape we have our vapeshot our vape liquids we use an isolate but they are they can be very effective for people because we add back in the plant terpenes and plant terpenes definitely helped create that entourage effect and increase the or absorption and utilization of the nutrient and the CBD oil okay so those just a couple examples of the CVD isolate so ISIL it's not bad it just needs to be it needs to be in a formula that's going to create that entourage effect for you and then also isolate another thing that you'll want to know about isolate is that you can get super high milligrams in an isolate like our isolate powders a tiny little container with 50 or 100 milligrams in it and one thing that you can do is that isolate is you can I have a customer who adds it to to hate HC here so adding the powder to this and shaking it up you increase the milligrams of the CBD concentration and you still get that entourage effect because this is a full well it's a broad spectrum so you've got all those other synergistic and code factors to help with that powder so taking the powder straight it's usually not going to be very effective and that's a lot of times what they're using in gummy bears and Edda bear edibles they're just throwing islip powder in there and so it's usually not going to be very effective for most people but again the benefit is you can boost products CBD has no taste and some people may be allergic to for example to plant terpenes well there aren't going to be any plant terpenes in the isolate alright the fourth type is very new its distillate and distillate in a nutshell it's gonna be very similar to CBD isolate what they're doing is are isolating different cannabinoids and it's considered to be very pure just like the CBD ice looks very pure not having any of the other plant parts or terpenes CBD distillate is going to be basically like picking and choosing only these cannabinoids out of a hundred people are you know they might decide well I want CBD I want CBN and CBD but I don't want THC and I don't want CB air or whatever so it's it's kind of picking and choosing and isolating specific nutrients and putting it into the formula so there's pros and cons to that one of the pros to that again is you don't have the plant terpenes for people who might be allergic to plant terpenes the the cons would be that you don't have the plant terpenes which are super beneficial you don't have the plant terpene to are really important and you don't have all of the phytonutrients all of the flavonoids all of the nutrients that come along with the hemp extract alright so those are the four primary different types of CBD hemp oil that you can find make sure you watch my video on how to read the label so that you know what you're buying like I said if you're looking for full spectrum you want to make sure you're you know you're paying for what you get for and then broad spectrum remember that has no THC so it's a great second alternative option if you can't have THC CBD isolate would be lower on the list unless you know how to create a formula like we do in our vape pen or in our cat drops to create that entourage effect and then distillates fairly new i don't even know if there are any dislike products on the market at this point it's really experimental but that should cover everything and thanks for watching this if you have questions we'd love to have you join us on our Facebook group I'll have a link to that and you can also email us at support at foods that Helia calm we'd love to hear from you and help you out and help you better understand CBD hemp oil right thanks for watching you guys I'll see you the next video", "qr3zpQxrPD0": "hey good morning everybody its Matt hopefully you all can see me pretty well I wanted to introduce this to you basically what we've done a lot of people have been opening the capsules so we actually are working with a company out of Colorado as well so it is domestically grown hemp I have all the COAS which I'll post shortly this stuff is unreal honestly what I have here my hand is a hundred milligram syringe and we wanted to always you know as we started our mission has been to get the best product for the best price for everybody it's only $19.99 for a hundred milligrams so you can look at the amount that you're getting and the price you're paying you can see that this kind of blows almost everything else away and it's domestically grown hemp just like the flowers I've been posting on there so I want to let you guys know I'm really excited about this I took my first dose a little while ago and it's hard to explain but I kind of had like this overwhelming feeling of calmness it's hard for me to describe but you can definitely tell that it's it's doing something so I just wanted to show everybody how to administer it it comes in a little syringe it is hemp paste it's it's more of an oil but it is a little bit thicker because of the high concentration that it does have when you get it you're gonna have this blacktop all you have to do is turn it it'll come right off now because this is 100 milligrams I do not recommend putting it in your mouth and squirting it all in there that's a lot to take at one time especially if something highly concentrated like this the best thing to do is just squirt a little bit of it out like I did here on my finger you can see it's kind of like a pace so it's not falling off and then rub it in your gum lines just like that all I taste is cannabis right now a hemp that's all I taste in there it's a really really good taste it's not anything like that grassy or dirty taste that people have said sometimes about our old you know the Bluebird oils which we still do carry but this is kind of the future this is what we're going towards and you can see the major differences a lot of the retailers online some of them don't even have what they claim they say they have but there are a couple hundred dollars I mean depending on who you go with we're talking about $19.99 for something that is gonna affect many of you in a positive way so you guys are always asking this family is always asking for new products and you know Kip and I we work as hard as we can to try and get these delivered to you I hope you guys enjoy this and on a final note all of the oils are in and they will be shipping today both the cherry and the

an activity you want to focus on but you still want to just crack up it had me feeling really good and really uplifted is it worth the dabber is it a pass I'm gonna say it's a definite dab everyone the taste is so good and reminds me of a candy strawberry flavor the syringe makes it perfect to moderate your dabs if you find a pure syringe at your cannabis club be sure to grab one thank you for watching the before you dab make sure to comment down below your experience with pure vape as well as what you think about the video and what I should try next please give this video a like and

below thanks again everyone and hope to see you next time peace out", "B5B9bnBQVrQ": "hi everyone my name is Tyler welcome back to my laboratory today we're going to be talking about short path distillation the functions the components and the process of it and then we're going to finish up distinguishing between full-spectrum oil broad-spectrum oil and tea free so let's jump right in alright so we're gonna talk a little bit about short path distillation today and what what the purpose of it is so we use short path distillation to extract cannabinoids from the crude oil so basically we're really doing refining operations using the short path distillation system it's very similar to the chemistry that was used in the white film molecular distillation that I talked about in a previous video just on a much smaller scale but you can also be a lot more precise with this equipment so several different components of the equipment of this whole entire system and so we'll start off from the beginning first piece that we have here is a low temperature coolant circulation pump and this is used to keep the condenser which is right here cool and what this does is it takes the vapors that are created by heating up crude oil in this boiling flask and it turns him back into liquids so as mentioned we have a boiling flask here inside of a digital heating and stirring mantle and what's going on in here is do I put crude oil in here we stir it at specific settings as you can see here below we have it at 330 rpm and 237 degrees Celsius what that does is that heats up the cannabinoids to the point of vaporization they turn into vapors they go up the distillation head they hit the cooler temperatures at the condenser right here cooled off by the chiller and once they turn back into a wick they come down into this thing called a cowbell and I can only hear the comments and jokes from here so so get them all out of your system now yes we all need more cowbell so what the cowbell has is you have your head and then you have your three main collection flasks and in each collection flask and you'll be collecting something differently in the first collection flask that you see in the background kind of a like a dark nastier color you're collecting heads and what's in those heads is any ethanol that wasn't recovered during the rotary evaporation process there's a little bit of terpenes some fats and waxes and lipids a little bit of CBD comes through here but really this is junk the second collection flask that we have is our mains this is the good stuff this is where we're collecting a majority of our CBD and as you can see it's pouring in there nice and smooth right now and a nice golden color that's that's what you want to see and the third flask which we haven't started using yet we'll use that at the end we're gonna collect our tails these also contain some cannabinoids but you're starting to get a really dark color which you really don't want in there and you're starting to collect a little bit more of some of the undesirables that are left behind in the crude oil after your cowbell yes we all need more of it you'll see a cold trap and this cold trap is designed to protect our rotary vane vacuum pump that we have down below here in this cold trap is on top has a mixture of ethanol and dry ice as you see is sort of bubbling right now right like it's not boiling that's just really really cold and that's what ethanol does when it gets it's probably below 30 minus 30 Celsius right now and so that cold trap is making sure that any vapors that didn't turn into liquid the cowbell are turning into vapors before they make it to the rotary vane vacuum top if they didn't then it would end up potentially damaging the rotary vane back and thumb so this vacuum what it's doing is it's lowering the atmospheric pressure of the entire system so that the cannabinoids don't have to reach as high of a temperature in order to convert from liquid to vapor and the reason why I want them to convert to a vapor at a lower temperature is because we get to have degradation of those can monoids at a higher temperature and we want to avoid that so that we can have higher quality and we're wrapping up this session by talking about the difference between full-spectrum broad-spectrum and tea free or isolate oils so full spectrum has terpenes CB d minor camera cannabinoids and a small amount of THC what I'm making right now is full-spectrum stuff broad spectrum includes terpenes CBD and minor cannabinoids but no THC an isolate or tea free includes no terpenes no minor cannabinoids no THC and only CBD that wraps up this session thanks for joining me in come back again later on have a great day", "0y2EiO7UNxM": "[Music] how to use the precise dosing applicator from sir taro wellness first remove the protective cap and set it aside the color of the cap indicates which product formula you're using so be sure to hold on to it the first time you use a new precise dosing applicator you'll need to prime it by twisting the device two or three times to remove any air bubbles you'll feel it click as you twist to dispense the product you want to twist the device very slowly remember the pure reserve oil is highly concentrated the top of the device will rise to reveal these black lines these lines are small but they're extremely important to monitor closely now that you have your desired dose gently push the top of the precise dosing applicator down you'll see the pure reserve oils start to dispense from the metal tip of the applicator and there you go the precise dosing applicator makes it easy to see and dispense the exact amount of oil you need with less mass and less potential for wasted product", "FY6aic0RK10": "so everyone welcome to my laboratory my name is Tyler and today we're going to talk about using a white film molecular distillation machine in order to take crude CBD oil and turned into distillate we're also going to talk about the differences between crude and distillate and a little bit of the science behind so come on in and let's have some fun all right now that we're all set up we are ready to start processing I'll walk you through the machines and then we'll talk about the difference between crude and distillate first machine we have here is a pre heater vessel this is used to heat up the crude oil before it goes to our evaporator the next machine that we have is our evaporator heater this is used to make sure that the crude oil is turning into vapour and allowing the distillate to separate from the crude oil we'll get into that here in a moment right here we have a peristaltic pump which pumps oil from the pre heater to the evaporator right behind here we have another machine and this is a chiller for your cold trap and get into that in a second here we have another heater and this is for a condensing coil and that condensing coil is inside of your money maker here this is your evaporator what we have going on in here is we have a bunch of rollers that are taking the oil that's being fed to the evaporator and spreading that oil on to the wall so that the oil heats up which allows the oil to separate the CVD vapors and get collected into a distillate collection flask after the vapor is cooled down they turn back into an oil so what we have right here is your distillate collection flask and then you have your crude collection flask next we have a cold trap collection flask which catches any vapors that were not turned into either distillate or we're not collected in the crude collection flask and it catches it's really important that those vapors are being captured here because where they go to next if they're not captured there is into a high vacuum pump now if those vapors get into the pump then it can seriously damage your equipment and which eventually shuts down your operation and that means no money so we have here is a high vacuum pump what this is used for is to lower the atmospheric pressure of the vessel and the reason why that's important is as the atmospheric pressure decreases the vapor point for oil and actually for all substances also decreases which means that you need less energy and you have less chance of causing degradation to your cannabinoids when converting crude into distillate which means you have a higher quality and product we have right to the right to the right of the high vacuum pump is another chiller and this is used to make sure that the high vacuum pump is kept cool emitting the most important piece of equipment is a five gallon bucket here there's a lot of sitting around and waiting and I just use this to sit on that's that's pretty important for me the difference between crude oil and distillate is vast the most important thing is probably the content and the potency of CBD in crude verses distillate CBD potency in is lower than it is distillate and so that's the reason why we're making distillate is to increase the potency by weight in the overall oil you also change the flavor when you have crude oil it has a very earthy very strong flavor and that's partly because of all the other undesirable components and compounds that are in crude oil and now when you go and you turn that crude oil into distillate as you notice there's a big change in color there's also a difference in flavor there's a difference in potency right potency goes up significantly crude oil is anywhere between 50 and 60% CBD content where distillate is anywhere between 80 95 % CBD distillate what's important is that even though we're focusing mostly on CBD there's still some THC in this product and so to be federally compliant in order to sell it you need to reduce the total THC in your distillate down to 0.3 percent or lower before you bring it out to retail", "mQvE8g1XkFc": "hey dabbur zann debits and welcome to another before you dab you're here with me mr. davon today we have jetty now I've only heard of these kinds of things but this is a dab locator so it's gonna come in this little contraption that's gonna help me measure out the dosage when I found out this was at the Green remedy I went ahead and I picked one up so we can check it out you guys on the channel go ahead let's go let's open it up let's see what's inside let's see how it works and let's find out if this stacks up to buying shadow sugar or sauce all right you guys let's go on to the dab all right you guys so here we have the jetty cartridge let's go ahead check it out once again it is a super Lemon Haze which from what I read on leaf fly calm it is a mixture of Silver Haze and lemon scum so let's go ahead they have the labor right here tells you everything about it like the website the manufacturers license when it was manufactured package expiration how much is in it the percentage of CBD the percentage of THC and some directions twist to load press to dispense vaporize on low heat it tells you in the black line point zero five milligrams the red line is point one five milligrams so let's go ahead and see what this looks like and just to kind of show you guys the general warnings let's go ahead let's open it up to see what we got inside no actually guys let's open it up Oh interesting so this is the actual devil gator you guys sativa has a little tip 500 milligrams let's see how this works all right it's pretty cool let's go ahead and figure out how it works and I'll get back to you I don't want to take the cap off OOP it's going to show you this novel and what you do is you just twist as you twist you're gonna notice this start to come out and there's the first black line as you keep twisting more lines will appear when you're ready to applicate all you got to do is push the bottom and it flops right out see looks really nice really golden so let's go ahead and let's take a cab you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] now you may be wondering what is the dad locator for who is this for is this for the dabber this for the pot smoker this for the person that has trouble getting their dad I found out through personal experience that the dad locator is most suited for those that are trying to applicate extracts onto say a ball or a J a backward of one however you may smoke I think Jenny dad locator was definitely made for application for application of your dad I've tried it dabbing it in it is a good extract in there there is some good super Lemon Haze inside but I feel that that is somewhat wasting what you got in here I think it's best used as an applicator for your extracts hence the name the applicator don't go buying this expecting to dab this if you're going to dab I'd recommend getting something else some kind of just a shadow sugar rather than live rosin life resin but not the dab locator it's definitely not for the dabber this is for the one that doesn't dad much and maybe just wants a little bit of extra umph in their bowl or blunt or whatever that they're smoking is this a dabber pass you guys I have to give it a pass if you're a heavy dabber like me I wouldn't recommend getting this would I get it again possibly just to put on my joints and my blunt because definitely that's what it was good for but as far as actually dabbing and this is before you dab this is not something that I can actually personally recommend for you guys right off for listening to me rant thank you for staying this long if you've tried the applicator make sure to comment down below and let me know what you think of the applicator has it worked for you did you dab it out applying it to your dad your blunt or your joints leave a like if you liked the video if it's helped you out in any way also subscribe

connoisseurs and we've got a much requested one for you today so do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it well this also applies if you happen to purchase one of these questionable cartridges and it fails how do you remove the mouthpiece to extract the oil I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail 1 mil or 1 gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges that being said let's take this to the deck ok well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sail brand that is a batch code on the bottom alright this is another one this one here does not state sea sell across the bottom but on the base it does say sea sell m07 9 this is also a Jupiter distributed cartridge so the first things first we're going to take a pair of vice grips common write scripts and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this collar right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged that one was a little bit difficult I'll apply it to this just to stand it up and they'll have a go at one of these other ones all right I will show you again on this one here I said this is a C cell you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it alright now I'm gonna apply this cartridge to this battery just for a stable base and I'm going to open up this gelato right here and warm it up to dispense it into this cartridge okay now here is the cartridge we are going to refill all right here is the mouthpiece for the cartridge perfectly fine a couple of scratches on but that shouldn't affect it in the least here's the distillate we will be applying to it I have warmed this up substantially just to ensure that it does flow rather well into the system you simply place the applicator tip on the syringe twisting it to ensure that it has a good seal you put the syringe tip down into the cartridge and then just begin to apply the fluid all right there you have it as you can see the original line of the older oil right there at the bottom of the new oil coming down to meet it okay take that off the bottom there and see it's sinking down there very nice we didn't get a protective silicon cap for these threads right here apply it to the threads take the mouthpiece that came off of the cartridge put it over the top and it will it will not go on all the way that's a good thing that means that the seal still works it will not go on at this point you want to take a precision device and apply pressure now as you do that you will see this seal disappears and there you have it let's take this back up top and see how she does all right and here we are back on top with the csail refill that we have here now as you can see the oil has got down to the coil has mixed with that heather oil bubbles are rising to the top let's take this protective cover off the bottom of this hook it up to a battery let's see what we got shall we well there you have it that's working like a champ looking that of oil through there I can get that a little bit of gelato flavor from that distillate that I put in there it's very nice well there you have it that is how you can remove and refill one of these cartridges to extract the oil from it what you're going to want is a slightly longer blunt syringe tip and I have a few of those a slightly longer blunt syringe tip such as this one right here as you can see how long that is that would definitely get all the way down to the base of that and you would be able to extract any additional oil that happens to be in a cartridge where this this cell has failed this one no it's not failing all it's working great well thank you so much for tuning in this has been John with TMZ connoisseurs you be sure to remember to subscribe and give this a thumbs up if you liked it and tune in to some of our other videos to see if you like those as well thank you so much this has been great you have a nice day peace", "gEGqGVR7jKc": "yo what up yeah trying something new again today we have this distillate I rest this link yeah it's got CBD and it's one one ninety two percent total it was on sale today so we're gonna fill up the needle where's the plastic this is good I just did a DAB this is [ __ ] good nice and smooth relaxing today we're going to use the sour OG from little yellow bus they said this stuff will not turn black if you mix it with real distillate you're gonna have the best product out so if this don't work little yellow bus I'm gonna be mad so he said do one to one with this stuff [Music] let me shake yourself first always shake it off shake it like a Polaroid picture it smells amazing [Music] we're distant on straight distance Shh we play in there we're going to take her to the stove and let her do her thing [Music] get back when she's a little bit out clear for the cooling period now said like I said 2025 minutes and it looks nice yellow clear just what you want see how hard they alright we're back it's been 25 minutes and hardened up some but it's still a little liquidy I'm not around tryout was the 25-minute mark it's clear so let's take one of these t9 I guess they're called cartridge there was like a piece of glass stuck down in the D like I said these carts are driving me not saying more about to be done even smoking nothing but knowing okay so let's take our car squeeze it's clear it is super clear get the rest relative I don't have my good needle I had to suck a saddle that was his junkie junkie damn sucker my sucker there all right smells like the sour OG I mean it looks per deep-down phenomenal throw my excess off like I said I still got more in there but I'm just gonna try this right now to see if this battery works this one is on the charger still looks clear yeah [ __ ] man that's how you make a real card and you got to use real just one shoe I'm rocked that was 92 percent that's the thing I did a half of a quarter or whatever whatever probably like a 67 percent quarters maybe but still you can definitely feel it whenever you hit it long as this thing stays the same color yellow now tomorrow I will be 100% satisfied and totally behind my homies yesterday that's regular concentrate and we're good turned a little brown but still kept the flavor this ROG got that dispensary taste start at that fruity ass it's got that rural band I think Rick's let's see if she's leaking we're still dry no Ronnie but what did the flavor sour OG still yellow beautiful color I'm definitely rips use this thorn you have to use the stone if you want real good quartz I'm going to do a review tomorrow probably even later than regular produce and I'm placing this thing down because I'm loving to them how good it hits and the flavor and the flavor is amazing it's so smooth don't cough that's the same thing when I did the dabs with this brand of stuff you don't call if it's smooth you can put that on your dabs and flavor it if you want and it just like totally cuts off the harshness of everything can't see me hi guys thank you for subscribing this [ __ ] is good I'm very very satisfied with this turning brag at all I'm satisfied the tea this is how you make cards for real keep subscribing we're gonna be making all kind of crazy they got a blueberry sour grape this blue a lever makes Unger somebody makes us seen we're gonna start doing a lot more of these holy [ __ ] I had this thing three times so yeah get this one some little buff little yellow bus honey liquefier thanks guys keep subscribing keep watching keep you and thanks", "3msoAj5S6ts": "oh hi I'm just catching up on my Einstein here you know I read that if you take CBD it increases your IQ but I think it must be a scam because I don't understand a word in this book hi I'm Greg welcome to happy talk and today I want to talk about syringes and how to use them these syringes that we carry come in one gram 1 gram syringes and which is a thousand milligrams of hemp and that's pure hemp extract there's no carrier oils there's no MCT there's no other oils in it and other additives just pure hemp and we carry two kinds one is has 17% CBD one is 25 percent so 17 percent of a thousand milligrams this one has 170 milligrams this is the gold 25% formula so that means it has 250 milligrams per each syringe these syringes are marked by 1/10 of a gram and that's generally a dose 1/10 you might want to take half of one tenth or one twentieth of a gram in the morning another one twenty the night or just you know one 1/10 once a day and these are really easy to use all you have to do is take off the cap at the end and then push off your dose easiest thing is just put it on your finger and then put it between your gums and cheek or you can also put it off in a spoon push it down and spoon that is so they push out your dose put it between your cheeks and gums and that's it now the gold formula tastes like normal hemp wood like you expect it to taste and the green formula 7 the 17% definitely has more it has more plant materials so it's definitely a stronger taste but both are work excellent and excellent way to get your daily CBD and now if you'll excuse me I got some Einstein to study you", "lDg7IADodb8": "true leaves oral syringe

sink I'm gonna let me show this whatever I want to probably meet that actually I might read it to y'all right now yeah this is talking about the hemp rose and the flower and this was a receipt so this this the THC Disturb is 15 bucks so usually what they used to discipline for is they use it for on the website they say this is what I pretty much to make your own moon rocks or to make the caviar joints well pretty much movies like you could put it outside the joint and be able to stick the kief to your joint whatever so let's open this up Oh accidentally read this plain Jane we are ahem focus on making the smoothest cleanest most odorless products on the market our hemp rolls are designed to be alternative to tobacco allowing them to be so consumed everywhere that cigarettes are currently

so this is a container that attend there we go t so this one is THC free Oh some of it fell out whoops get back in there yeah that is that's the way it looks good it looks like almost like like shatter types looks pretty good today I'm gonna be vaping it in my new wax attachment that I got from Atmos than the thing like the container is called greedy Wow you said I gotta clean this off a little bit before I use it yeah I'm gonna clean this off a little bit I don't know how we got to the engine like that is weird wow that's a lot of stuff stuck to the side anyways I'm gonna grab a little bit of this and go it in there so I could try it out the only way I'm gonna get a small amount I don't want to connect you know [ __ ] it I'm going in running gasps no I'm not gonna fill it up but I'm gonna put a good amount in there so I can tell y'all exactly what it tastes like definitely some nice stuff there so this is THC free Oh oops this is way too high so this thing is for us to put it between 15 and 25 watts I'm gonna put it at 18 for now all right hoping I don't cough my lungs out please God yeah shout-out to Plain Jane I'll leave their links down below for their Instagram and their website last time when I tried they're there or CBD shatter oh my god if we don't do it right you [ __ ] your lungs out so yeah let's try this out I don't know what it is about y'all can't see tha now can't see it for some reason whatever every time I tried to use vaping video I get a good amount of smoke well my camera doesn't catch it all don't ask me why I just that's the way it is well this is um definitely all I can smell this it's a very thanks no it just smells like yeah a little forget it a couple little turkeys smell in there I don't have example but it's just pretty much like playing playing CBD like it's just good - oh that's like I don't I described it's hard to describe I'm sorry um but the taste of it it's like I taste like it tastes like a wax whatever but is sparse I didn't come on that hit though it definitely tastes good goes I'm like just kind of heard a pinpoint exactly what it tastes like mmm I want to say like you could taste like some some like like a lemon but pretty much it just tastes like wax I don't know if you ever tried down there like it I'm very new to dabbing so excuse me about you know could I can't explain exactly what it's a nose it tastes really really good and you could tell it's high-quality and has a good taste to it bump it up to 20 non is it on the camera I don't want to [ __ ] call my lungs out I swear when it comes to daddy I'm a little [ __ ] when it comes with Debian I'm sorry you can make fun of me all you want bro I got I got virgin on this when it comes to Devon oh my god it's very potent very strong I want to take another hit damn I could feel the effects definitely putting like a relaxation Thai food and of course you know the are ever tried to see me do whatever you know what I'm talking about has a very good taste to it well this is like almost like the this is pretty much like the shadow that I get from them I think I'd trade a shadow real quick now shadow looks a little different it looks more like crumble crumble and the chatter somebody said that it's not shatter and I don't know anything about you know this still ends and shatter and yeah I know about rosin a little bit but I don't know how they get that I don't know how they did Pierce EBD this is 90% CBD I don't know how I don't know how you melt it down so it could be like be able to use it for like what's it called to make your own moon rocks or to use it to make the you know your joints with the keep on them um I guess you you gotta warm it up somehow not exactly I'm not an expert on that like I said I'm new to admin so she's like a burn this off I don't know how to get the wax like off from this thing we're gonna do is like wax I didn't like there's a part where I put the wax on the middle and they it's like a spring type thing and it warms up and the wax is like above that for some we I don't know how that works it's kind of weird but anyways I've been videos going on way too long I keep rambling but anyways yeah this is just some high quality product in here I gotta figure out how I'm gonna ask him I guess whatever just sound like how what I how would I go about warming it up to make moon rocks and caviar banants our joint whatever we're pointed and I could keep on the joint because I definitely want to try that so if you want a DAB I think you're able to use this to dab as you can see and it's only like 15 bucks so that's a that's a steal and I can believe this is a grand well yeah guys definitely hit a plain Jane have some high quality products flower wax hemp rose whatever you want whatever your CBD needs are they got it bro they got moon rocks they got flour they got hemp rose they have a whole bunch of different strains they got papers lighters yeah they got they gotta like yeah and then they're enterprises I think they just drop their prices some of their eight to point for like five or six bucks so I think the active before that the cheapest were like seven eight bucks for an eighth which is ridiculous but no one's charging that everyone's charging like like 20 bucks 30 bucks 35 bucks for an eighth I'm playing James it's like I know playing games pissing people well hopefully when it comes to their prices whatever because everyone they have a whole bunch of followers and stuff like that but yeah thank you Plain Jane for letting me try this product I appreciate Evan and I appreciate ya I appreciate y'all over there also Diana the one that I believe is Diana please if I miss the feeling I'm so sorry yeah I didn't realize that there's a certain person running their Instagram so I didn't get a chance I didn't know I thought it was time to the owners the whole time but I got a was cool I got to meet the owners of playing general there are Dallas that is Convention Center it was CBD convention over there Dallas is pretty cool I got to meet him they actually recognized me they knew they saw who I was and yes the guy doesn't review so it's pretty cool that they saw me and otherwise I would have never even known that they were there because I wasn't I wasn't looking at we walked around so much and it's a big place and I almost

make a cbd tincture specifically the key components to an oil-based tincture now there's a lot of variety there's a lot of options that we're going to be going through it's really up to your personal preference your audience the demographic the people you're selling to as to what you pick and choose we're going to go through some of those options and really kind of help you out and guide you along the process so first thing is the ingredients and of course the most key ingredient is cbd and as you can see magically i've made some cbd appear because i am the wizard so again just to remind you all all of these here this crude oil this distillate this isolate all comes from this little special nugget here we've got another video we go into the different types of the full spectrum broad spectrum isolate what that all means so check that out but today we're really going to be focusing on how we're going to be using these as ingredients in a cbd and tincture so the first thing is this crude oil extract here as you can see is very rich it's got this nice super runny but it's a dark consistency as you can see because it's got all the plant fats it's got the chlorophyll still in there still under the 0.3 thc however it's the taste is going to be a little bit more earthy it's going to be have a little bit more of what we would call a bite to it on the profile of the flavor and then from there we're going to move up to distillate which is as you can see a beautiful honey color it really really plays nice inside of a cbd tincture and it's really delicious as you can see we've taken out the plant fats the chlorophyll that's what gives it this beautiful color and again this comes in either a full spectrum or a broad spectrum that you can put it in this is what we actually use for most of our tinctures because it's such a fantastic ingredient to work with it's easy to use the next thing we have is an isolate based again this is for more of your targeted type tincture for someone who's you know maybe worried about job loss or something like that maybe they're a first responder maybe they're you know um they work for the government or whatever your job may be this would be a fantastic option for that kind of demographic or audience if you're you know that's what you're selling to there's you know pros and cons to each again with the crude oil you're getting all those plant fats that's more of like an entourage effect with that crude when you move up to the distillate you can still get that entourage effect with the full spec or you can move up to a broad spec which again you're going to be losing out on some of the minor cannabinoids but you get a better flavor profile with a distillate as opposed to a crude and then of course the isolate it's odorless it's colorless so it's really really easy on the palette the next key component to our cbd tincture oil is going to be our carrier oil voila our carrier oils here so the reason we use a carrier oil is to help dilute the cbd make it a little bit more absorbable to the body one of our favorites that we like to use is mct oil it's odorless it's colorless it's tasteless so you can add flavors and other active ingredients and you can still kind of have those flavors come through without messing with it or you can also use something like hemp seed oil again you're going to have a little bit more of a flavor to play with with that ham see it's a little more earthy has a little bit more of a bite to it it's got some omegas but also a fantastic oil to use you can realistically use any ingestible oil like an olive oil even we've had some clients do that it really is up to the audience and the demographic that you're going to be selling to who you're really trying to target that you're you know which will guide your choice as to which carrier oil you really really want to use now the last thing that we're going to be talking about with our cbd tinctures going forward with our last key component is packaging we have our packaging here so one of the most important things we're going to be talking about is going to be the different components to the packaging itself we're going to start off with the glass the glass bottle itself the color now the color is important because it helps to protect from uv light that uv light will degrade your cbd tincture over time that's why you want a darker tint to your glass now it can be an amber color like this it can be a cobalt or a green or like this which is a painted almost black matte you could do all kinds of colors in this same thing though you could do a white you could do a blue a green lots of options lots of varieties again when it comes to that color of that glass now there's different options and styles as well as you can see these are very slight very small differences this is a european style round glass this is a boston style round glass very slight differences but again when you're looking at different types of packaging for your branding what have you that's important things to consider you also have different sizes you can see we have a two ounce here which is a 60 milliliter it's like more like a two month supply as opposed to a 30 milliliter one ounce which is like a one month supply so the other thing that we as you can see all of these are glass glass bottles we recommend glass we always recommend glass the main reason is oxygen barrier it really helps to prevent that degradation oxygenation will degrade your cbd tincture again so from the uv and the oxygen barrier that's why we always say go with glass now we're going to be talking about droppers the dropper is a really important component this is what you're going to be actually using to deliver this cbd into your mouth so there is a couple different types that we're going to be talking about this is a crc which is a child resistant cap as you can see there's a little contraption up here that helps prevent children from being able to take it off the top now it's plain and you didn't see any numbers on the side whereas this is a calibrated dropper that has numbers on the inside or the outside of the dropper that shows you how much you're actually taking so you're either taking a milliliter three quarters a half or two quarters up to you what you want to use with your own packaging you can even just get a simple non-crc non-calibrated dropper as well that's also available if that is the case this little safety shrink seal this is a requirement for all ingestible products you must have a safety seal and that's kind of where this crc prevents the children from getting in but this safety shrink seal is another component that you really want to be aware of the last component that we're going to be talking about with respect to our packaging is going to be our labeling it's really important that you get the labeling right for that reason i'm not going to go too much into it today we have a completely separate video all diving deep into those labels because there's qr codes there's compliance there's formatting there's all kinds of things you need to be aware of guys the last thing is let's chat i'm so excited to talk to you guys if you guys have questions comments below or if you got more specific questions on how to make a product go to our website there's a lot of free content there dye lines fact panels ingredient decks you name it so fill out that form ask those questions we'd love to talk to you i'm trent the wizard with factory six we'll see you guys next time", "kPgELkigQLg": "hey guys how you doing here we are at loud house hemp in huntsville alabama you know normally we talk about uh what we have been talking about lately a lot about delta eight let's do something a little different than delta eight let's talk about our uh what i'm vaping on right now and still still our ceramic cartridge this just happens to be a full spectrum cbd a little bit of cvg cbn you know all the great cadaver noise that we we hold dear and near and dear to our heart and that we enjoy using anyway as you can see all it is is a cbd distillate uh with some cbd isolate added in and then of course a little bit of terpenes this particular terpenes here is from denver terpenes great company by the way denver terpenes i highly recommend them this particular one here is fruit loops this is their turf beans fruit loops this is from their uh their standard line uh i think they have two different lines they have one that's uh well one that's full spectrum and one that's uh they're they're more standard this particular one is from their standard line froot loops we also have their fruity pebbles and a couple other ones really denver denver terpenes guys didn't record terpenes don't forget them great company also a shout out for clear nation another terpene company great um mr terpene we love all you guys we use your terpenes and our products [Music] thumbs up to all you guys anyway the district one has uh denver terpenes in it is uh fruit loops anyway let me see you can see how thick it is very very thick like i say it's just a distillate and heat it up and then you know [Music] very very good very good very good mexican cokes guys made some cokes mexican coke and cbd fruit loops derivative terpenes and uh fruit loops gotta love it anyway get back to this good smooth taste definite definite that little lemony almost like a little bit of lemon pledge almost to me everybody's different everybody's taste subjective but but very good very smooth i can get a better look at it [Music] like it's a very thick liquid very good product guys don't take much hit i mean with this right here this this this does the job very quickly very potent i would say there's roughly 800 and probably 800 milligrams of of uh cbd roughly around about 800 milligrams in a one mil cart these of course one milk carts and guess what guys you won't believe it 12.98 shipped anywhere within the united states [Music] that's right 1298 one milk cart cbd full spectrum great terpenes from different terpenes in this particular one again it's froot loop terpene uh in here really good and a little hit here [Music] like i said it doesn't take a lot guys does it take a lot uh it's hard to be draining from you guys but i'm thirsty anyway great product another product that we're that we're doing like say all ceramic carts so the there's nothing metal in the cart uh it's just a phenomenal product phenomenal price 12.98 guys for a one mil ceramic cart full spectrum nothing cut about it other than the terpenes that are added to to keep from crystallizing again because it uh once you get a distillate that's cbd that's above say like 84 or above above 80 some odd percent you're gonna start having crystallization and by adding the terpenes here that knocks the percent of total total cannabinoids down in the distillate so it keeps it from recrystallizing uh or so far it has i don't know what else i can say about it it's a great product i'm already getting i'm already super relaxed i feel behind my eyes i threw into my ears and down my neck i mean it's starting to go into my shoulders now it's a i mean it's the tits product uh not just because we sell it but because everything we sell we use we test we make sure we make sure we get great terpenes in from like denver terps which is in this one clear nation which is cannabis derived terps uh mr terpene which is again mostly can i think it's all cannabis derived terps on them or they may have a hybrid also but guys and we try to we i mean we just source the best products for you because why because we care about what you put in your body we care about what products you use and we want to make sure that that product works and that is potent it does what it's supposed to do makes you happy healthy and wise guys anyway i don't want to hold you up as always you can you can uh look us up

him bye", "zrQKILuOYfc": "welcome to blue crayon extracts today I'm going to show you a little bit about our products or CBD babe cartridge product it's full spectrum CVE has 750 milligrams of CBD in the 1000 milligram cartridge and then we also have a 500 milligram cartridge that contains 375 milligrams of active CBD that's roughly around 3.75 milligrams per puff depending on how big your puffs sizes are and then same goes for the 750 milligrams CBD cartridge it's about seven point five milligrams per possible on average so I open up the little container here and inside I have the USB mini charger the battery battery sold separately but you know we we ship it in the in a box like this but then you can put it inside your container which is kind of handy and then we have the actual CBD distillate vape cartridge here that comes in its own little container which you can stand up on its own or you could you know some you know some people like to put actually on the battery pen itself its standard 510 threading on this and then you can the container there now vaping CBD is you know is entirely different way of ingesting it then then through your digestive tract for the digestive tract you're only absorbing a certain percentage of the total amount of CBD that's in the product whereas vaping it you're getting and practically entirely all of it and it's going directly in your bloodstream so when you vape CBD you know you're feeling the effects almost immediately so it's great for you know after a sports event and you have aches and pains you can you can vape after that you have a big meeting or a big presentation it's always good to vape a little CBD before those and you know you you get the instant the CBD the benefits of the CVD and this is CBD distillate so it's got a it's got a high viscosity to it it doesn't really move much until it's heated up and when the oil is heated up it turns into a vape vapour basically what else can I tell you now our carts our cartridges are actually really high-tech cartridges they have eight oil holes in the bottom of the cartridge so that all the oil when it when it keeps up and drips down at all get you so no oil ever goes to waste and then we actually have there's there's our top airflow holes on the cartridge at the top and that allows you to pull the air up from the top as opposed to the bottom of the cartridge or the bottom of our cartridges are sealed airtight so there's never any leaks I'll show you let me show you imperative cartridge competitors cartridge so oil they have side holes not like bottom holes like ours and the oil gets stuck in between the side holes and then that they're bought the bottom of their cartridge is not sealed and so you'll you'll get leaks sometimes coming through the bottom of these so back to our cartridge here I know if you have any questions you can always just shoot us an email at support at blue chronic stress calm and let me now show you about let me show you all about the battery so basically to turn on you click it five times five times in a row and then it turns along and then for the lowest setting is 2 point 7 volts it's white and say you're just you know you can hold it down it has a 10 second time timeout so you can hold it down take your puff release it the second setting to advanced settings you click it three times now it goes to the second setting which is three point one volts this is a good medium setting the first setting actually is great cuz you can really taste the terpenes in it once you start getting up to a higher setting you kind of burn off those terpenes or heat off those terpenes and so is it it all depends on your personal preference and then the third setting the highest settings is 3 point 6 volts and it's the color red and you click it three times and it goes to red now this also has a quote this pen actually has a cool feature where if you're let's say you're out outside on a hike and it's really cold out and they'll you know the CBD distillates you know pretty solid you can there's a preheat setting where you click it two times and then it'll go for fifteen seconds it will preheat your oil so if it's cold out it will it will get it going and then when you take your first take your first puff off it will it will help hit nicely and I'm gonna go ahead and take a puffer like I said has a 10 second shot off so you can never really overheat the distillate I hope you enjoyed watching our video today and again as I said if you have any questions please email us at support at blue crown extracts calm thank you", "p85mq4hkK4A": "[Music] [Music] [Music]", "pbLFYMVyTFo": "hey Dustin here green method farms I wanted to do a quick video and just show you our CBD distillate in concentrated form so this has not been turned into any products retail products yet this is straight from the farm to the processing plant and the CBD distillate concentrate which is about 80 percent CBD what this looks like a lot of people don't get to see the CBD oil in this form because when it arrives their door it's been processed into a CBD tincture or some other product this is what the distillate looks like so this might be an interesting video for you let me just flip the camera around and I'll show you okay this group of five gallon buckets here represents about four and a half to five acres worth of our Hempfield it's kind of funny but four and a half acres fits into this little you know twenty square foot spot right here but anyway everything's in five gallon buckets this is the last time it's going to be in five gallon buckets we are actually taking it for processing but let me show you what it looks like in the CBD distillate concentrate form so there it is you might be thinking wow that is not what I expected and it looks like a solid and it is a solid right now under room temperature the concentrated 80% CBD distillate will turn in to a solid so we're gonna have to do is we're gonna have to turn and put this into a hot water bath and it will turn back into its viscous oil form and then from there we will put it into under high heat in the rotovap s-- with our formulations to be able to create the products that we send to you so anyway this right here not too exciting but if you could smell it you definitely could but know that it is hemp and smells smells great actually but anyway I wanted to show you what the CBD distill it looks like as it sits before it gets formulated into products again if you have any questions go ahead put those in the comments

dispensary we want to do a quick product review on the new dulce Vida line that we've been carrying now for a little while so what's important to know about this and your if you're looking on the screen as you're getting ready to purchase it this is a multi cannabinoid distillate that means that this particular product is our premier product because the extraction process is different and we're leaving in all the natural terpenes and all the natural oils so a distillate has typically multiple cannabinoids so not just CBD it's got some CBG some CBD VA can have a chroming and other cannabinoids making it a multi cannabinoid product so as you can see here this is the typical dulce Vita label if you turn the label you'll see all of the nutritional facts and then you'll see the potency how many milligrams in the bottle and how many milligrams per dropper okay and we have this in 400 milligrams 800 milligrams 1600 milligrams now this this is special this is the sweet delight you'll notice the label is a little different okay and we took three and a half months in the lab to make this flavoring we call it sweet delight because it's just yummy we don't want to call it wedding cake we don't want to call it cotton candy and we don't want to call it Bailey's Irish Cream some people say it tastes like all of those things separately of course not together but basically the sweet delight logo looks a little different this is in a 1500 milligram okay and 1500 milligrams in the whole bottle and then it tells you how many milligrams per dropper whether you're taking a half or a full dropper you can scan the code here the qcr code to go right to the webpage where you can find product summary information and the testing results this is the new science folks this is multi cannabinoid if you've been taking CBD if you try this you will unwilling Tibet experienced better results [Music] you", "qvek4rnK_d8": "so how to find out if you're getting your money's worth that's the question for a lot of new cbd users and it's a labyrinth to figure out on the internet now first of all price os not the only factor due to a low level of regulation within the cbd industry cheap hemp oil obtained in china as a byproduct of the hemp fiber industry is available to buy if you buy hemp oil from unregulated sources your health is at risk many of these oils are not properly tested and often contain dangerous contaminants as they are leftovers from agricultural methods not created for human consumption once you've made certain it's good quality and a trusted supplier use our cbd price calculator products in the cbd industry are not standardized which can make working out the true cost of cbd products difficult to understand this is why using a cbd calculator like this gives you the most accurate reading of how much per milligram your cbd company is charging that makes it far easier to compare the true costs and ensures that you get better value for money thank you

it's kind of hard to tell in the video let's see here in the video this looks better because it's brighter but in person this method looks the most like cannabis it's hard to to tell on the video no it's a better piece maybe and again this is what it looked like to start", "p0UOUzm4rVU": "hey there everybody how's it going today that's carpeau again yeah today I'd like to talk a little bit about cannabis in fact I came out here I have three different lists of notes that I wanted to talk about on videos and I went right to something completely different which is weed and let me just say first off that you know I've been disappointed with the legal cannabis industry I don't talk about cannabis very often at all but cannabis is a huge part of my life and has been for a long time I felt guilty talking about it years ago when I first started my channel because it was illegal and I thought I could get myself in trouble you know I had a bunch of plants growing even though I had a legal card to grow it I had a channel that was dedicated to growing just weed and I turned that into my philosophy Channel eventually but you know when I was smoking cannabis heavily when I was younger you know I learned a lot about it I was obsessed with it I mean I wrote about it in high school for my like junior report just out of my head didn't even really do any research I still got a beat but something's happened to the industry and this is what I figured would happen when it got legal am I surprised absolutely not but there is so much [ __ ] in the industry so I'm not here to talk about weed itself but to talk about all the [ __ ] and all the crap that's being sold to you as you know a lot of you are new to cannabis and cannabis is something that I've myself been smoking for about say 20 27 28 years now so I've been around and I've seen a lot of different cannabis a lot of different products and eased back over recent years on how much I smoke you know I've learned to really you know pace myself and I've learned a lot over the years about what works and what doesn't but the one thing that's and what inspired me to make this video well for example I actually had these capsules that I made a couple weeks ago now I took some old some cannabis that I'd grown in the past I processed it with a quiso method which is quick wash I suppose alcohol I'm not gonna go into detail but I did a quick wash i evaporated it off then I baked it in order to basically cook off it 240 degrees to cook off the you're what you're doing is decarboxylate in it you're converting the THC a into THC so it's orally available then I combined that with like half of coconut oil and made these little capsules and they're pretty strong I took two of them earlier to test it out and I was like wow and one of the beautiful things about capsules is that you have the whole plant extract when you do an extract like that now there are many different methods to doing extracts but then we have what here's what I buy in the store this little pen tip which is THC distillate okay it has a beautiful taste it's called Maui wowie I'm thoroughly disappointed with the fact that it's just a synthetic flavor and that's what you get usually when you're smoking this you know when you're buying these pens you're smoking synthetic terpenes or even if they're plant derived terpenes let me just kind of backtrack a little bit if you're not aware of what terpenes are whenever you smell cannabis the smell is the terpenes the smell are the different fruity smells the different berry smells citrus which is limonene or then you have mercy nor like the kind of nutty or nutmeg type smells so many different odors that you can get from cannabis and naturally there's an association with those odors as to the buzz in other words some lemon haze which is a nice sativa might give you a really cerebral enlightening buzz whereas some mercy and soaked you know heavy like spicy indica really dense nugs of some pure hashed plant might give you a really relaxed what they call a couch lock or a couch high but it's not that simple that's just like the general quick stoner you know yeah this is this is good for enlightening this is good for being low it doesn't work that way you go into the shop you can buy sativa you combine indica and sure you might be likely to have those effects but when you get into extracts you're talking about something totally different and that's the main point I wanted to make when plants in its whole form you're still getting a variety of different cannabinoids not just THC and CBD or even CBN and these capsules for example have a lot of CBN and CBM is only produced when cannabis gets old when cannabis starts to age certain molecules start to degrade into other molecules now before I go any further I'd like to talk briefly about why eating cannabis is different than smoking it when you smoke it you smoke it the THC is absorbed by the lungs it goes into the bloodstream and it has a short-lived effect an hour a couple hours few hours depending on how much you smoke and what you expect but when you eat it it takes about the same amount of time to come on as most people end up wearing off when you smoke it in other words it might take an hour or two in order to take effect when you eat it and when I eat these capsules it might take an hour to an hour and a half depending on how much I've eaten now each one of these capsules has about a hundred milligrams of THC and 100 milligrams of CBD combined but it also contains CBN because that was processed as a whole plant extract all the cannabinoids came out when it comes to this this is what they call it THC distillate that means that they basically reduce all of the plant material down to a perfect extract then they remove just the THC from that and then they what they call back blend terpenes which means they add flavors back to it and this is really the main premise of this video I'm very bothered by the fact that the cannabis industry has slightly just started pumping terpenes into th the distillate without anybody asking questions such as is this a synthetically derived extract like some of the raspberry ones are because it costs a fortune to extract you know a certain raspberry flavor so they do it synthetically are these synthetic compounds healthy to inhale but more than that I'm not as concerned about the health aspect as I am the fact that people are saying this is an indica hash pen and this is a sativa hash pen when the only difference is the flavor that they have added to it so here's what I'm saying we have two identical products you have one that's their most likely extracted from the exact same batch of cannabis because it doesn't matter what strain it is the sativa or indica aspect of it is by what they named it Maui wowie Northern Lights and they do this by adding certain flavors that they think would be conducive to that strain and the people say wow this is delicious it tastes really good Wow mmm-hmm it's like mango and and it's delicious it's very tropical I really like it it's delicious but the buzz flat and it all comes down to this it's placebo I believe that when you're blending terpenes into THC distillate any effect that's a sativa or indica like or high or low is placebo if it were as simple as just terpenes then that would change a lot of the foods we eat but it was also mean that you know do you really have to buy this for example could I just take any old THC and then smell some peppermint to get the same effect and believe me as an herbalist somebody who's fascinated with herbs and I love essential oils I've experimented with this tried to smoke cannabis and try smelling different essential oils because the same molecules you're absorbing into your bloodstream whether you're inhaling them or smoking them or consuming them and I would think that if you're smelling a very strong oil you'd probably inhale even more molecules than you would smoking it because some of them get destroyed in the process of vaporizing or smoking but well it's not getting to the technicalities of it we don't know and this is coming from a veteran stoner is that coffee over you know 27 years I mean that's not bragging rights that's something that I figure I'm obligated to talk about this this is important that I tell people that they're getting totally bullshitted by the industry and all I've talked about is just one little thing terpenes I haven't even gotten to the south the lotions that they want to you know that you can just rub it right on you'll be healed from all your internal illnesses I know they're not saying it that blatantly but basically people believe that they will be saved by rubbing CBD on their skin now look CBD and THC phenomenal phenomenal compounds rubbing them on your skin topically is only good if you have something that helps it absorb and that's why a lot of people use like arnica I believe you can honestly use essential oils but it's only good topically and what they call regionally or locally which means that if you have a sore muscle in one area sure you can rub itself and lotion on there you can include some CBD and THC whatever you want and that might help but really these things are being oversold and overplayed huge marketing companies are buying into this and giant companies are consolidating all of what we've always known is our comfortable little cannabis community I'm not surprised as I said it's just like what happened with looking alcohol for example look at what they've used to sell alcohol chicks and bikinis and speedboats and people happy and dancing and you know just this total [ __ ] idea that you're gonna be the socialite of the world go back and look at cigarettes you know I mean there's [ __ ] a there's a cigarette called cool in other people really believe that smoking cigarettes made you look cool and they were able to advertise to that and so my point being that anything that we do any substance we consume will be oh you know shown to be in some sort of a kind of you know I guess an association people will want to be like I'm I want to be like that I want to be that guy or that girl I want to be that cool person I want to smoke cigarettes I want to drink alcohol and with cannabis its they've turned it into the same thing and I've always been a respectable person when it comes to cannabis say look some people are predisposed to have psychotic episodes schizophrenia delusions depression severe anxiety these are people should not be using cannabis my opinion and people may say well you could use cannabis for anxiety it's great for anxiety look when you grow up and you smoked it for a really long time and you're really way where your anxiety comes from you might find that cannabis can make it worse it's all about the dosage and the right strain but today's cannabis is very strong and it does tend to lean towards just being very high potency THC cannabis which to me is kind of a disappointment because [ __ ] I love these things you know a couple of these capsules half CV half CBD half THC and then they've got the CBN and who knows what other cannabinoids I'm not I don't recall but I believe there's something like thirty to thirty five to forty five cannabinoids and in cannabis that lesser-known cannabinoids that we don't even understand how they work and many of these molecules can help us with it for example CBN it turns out is is the one that's really good for helping people with anxiety with eating problems or you know people who need to eat more build up an appetite and for sleeping and for pain the four main ones that a lot of people take cannabis for and the only way to get it is by aging your cannabis they haven't found a way to like convert anything to CBN in a hurry because it's an oxidation process that does take time so basically you leave your cannabis mi exposed to the air for like a year I would say a lot of the weed on the shelves in the stores is probably already there one of the things is that THC a converts them to THC over time naturally but they hurry it along by doing what I mentioned earlier the decarboxylation process but some of the cannabis I have is so old that you can probably just eat it as is it's already converted most of it over I make these caramels or did for a while that we're phenomenal it takes about 15 minutes to make them and the temperature all the conditions of making them means I can just take my cannabis put it in a crock pot make butter can take that butter strain it turn it right into these caramels and they cook just long enough to decarboxylate the cannabis the caramels and these things were really strong if you go in the store any buy candies usually they're regulated or any type of cannabis food it's usually regulated by milligrams and 10 milligrams is the average dose and if you buy a package they are usually 10 candies or 10 cookies whatever it might be and 10 milligrams each so in other words one of these capsules is the same strength as a package of ten candies that you buy in a store but it's great for people who don't consume a lot who don't know how to dose you know their proper dose in other words if a person who would never smoke cannabis before except two of these capsules like I did earlier they wouldn't even be able to top probably they you know it's it's we all adapt to the substances we consume and to me cannabis is nothing it's child's play if you will when it comes to drugs but I take it very seriously because I know that a lot of people take it too far and they smoke way too much and I take it as a very serious medicine something that's strong something that can overpower people so be cautious I'm gonna leave with that note don't abuse cannabis don't don't go out use it on the account that I'm mentioning it here I'm definitely not suggesting it's for anyone in particular I'm giving you my personal experience you know and I have to say that it's a harm reduction thing I want to see people use these substances safely and I've been saying that for a really long time and I'm really glad it despite all the things I mentioned the negatives about the industry even though they're selling weed with naked chicks it doesn't matter the fact is the fact is that people are generally using it responsibly there have been no major Rises and crime in fact crime is probably going down in many of the southern states when once they start legalizing and watch how this happens the cartels are going to lose ground what's happening now is the cartels are desperate down there they're trying to buy up houses and grow on the legal market as a cartel or as a group criminal group organizations they're trying to keep up because once it's legal there's no market for the crime anymore and that just shows you that the drug laws failed in this country and I've been saying that my whole life but I just felt like it was falling on deaf ears you know like Americans were just never gonna go for this but I always knew in my heart would legalize cannabis and I can't believe how [ __ ] far we've come and then last month they decriminalized mushrooms in Colorado or in Denver anyway I just Wow you know like things are really changing and to people who don't consume either of those they might think it may seem like the rantings of a druggie you know but I really don't care that's not how it is there are a lot of people who benefit from these substances in immense ways and cannabis is just one of many substances that should just be left alone and legalized I understand that we want a government to protect us from these dangerous drugs out there but you have to realize it's a it's a decision of adults to consume and if we are gonna ban substances which I don't believe we should I believe that at least we should leave the ones that are in their natural form completely alone that includes cannabis psychedelic mushrooms create them truffles things like this so um as far as the market goes it's gonna do what its gonna do we can't stop people from telling you that you know CBD is gonna cure your cancer overnight we can't stop the market from from you know people for example I had a company send me a product the other day and a lot of you might know my channel but I figured I mentioned it for those who didn't they guys sent me an email he said hey I have it because I have a separate CBD video that has like a hundred thousand views or something and I always get these emails about oh can you get good CBD products and I tell people the truth because it's called the CBD ripoff report and people are like you know yeah I've experienced this people are charging you know 50 bucks for 50 milligrams and all you know there's a lot of ripoff out there and then you have to wonder if even what they say is in the bottles in the bottle and a lot of them have been reported to not have the right content of CBD and then you find out CBG isolate doesn't work for [ __ ] on certain conditions and I know that's Greek to people who don't know the mechanics but put it this way CBD in its natural form in its plant in the plane within plant material or bud form with THC along with THC and other cannabinoids can have a much higher threshold of effect in other words a lot more can accumulate I guess in the bloodstream and and and have more of an effect on tumors this type of thing but when you take CBD by itself it's just nicely it hits a peak and it just drops off and that's it this was discovered recently about last year or the year before by a team of scientists in I believe Israel but you can look it up I don't want to get into the details but it's fascinating to me these are things that we need to realize that you need to know what forms you're taking so anyhow this company sent me this email saying we review this CBD product on your YouTube channel and I told them straight out I will but I'm gonna review it honestly and he told me it was a pure CBD product and when it got it is said hemp oil or hemp extract and I emailed him and he's like oh well it's the same thing it's just different because of its it is from this hemp and I just was ok I'll try it out tried it for a week didn't really notice anything I checked it out online and stuff was a hundred and twenty nine dollars a bottle look are you [ __ ] kidding me I'm sorry I don't care what company you are I don't care how good your [ __ ] product is if you're charging one hundred and thirty dollars for a product like that I'm just I'm dumbfounded I can't believe it it was less than a grams worth and yeah it is what it is people are gonna charge what they can charge I want to see people get this medicine people that need it I have had a ton of CBD cannabis at my disposal in the past and I gave it away to anybody who wanted it always because if you can benefit from this you know I want to see people benefit a friend of mine gave it to his dog in pain I gave it to my dog people have given it to their their dogs who had seizures and kids with seizures and helped them to illumine them and they're afraid to speak out because a lot of parents are using it illegally in states where they still won't accept these substances so really I'm a major cannabis advocate and I just wanted to get that out there if that ain't obvious already and and to know that you know for all the people who think that it just completely destroys your functionality you know [ __ ] I've been sitting here taping on this thing and before that I took to those capsules I mean put it this way you hear about the functional alcoholic and everybody has a friend who can drink and still like like you think if I drank that much wow I'd never be able to function it's nothing to be proud of it's the fact that a person knows their limits and when it comes to cannabis it's the same way once you've adapted to it we're smoking cigarettes if you've never smoked cigarettes and you have one you get a buzz you feel like [ __ ] my fall asleep or pass out well if you smoke cigarettes all the time it's just a normal part of your life and with cannabis it's the same and it's a matter of personal decision do you want that in your life and does it benefit you and what I'm saying is I don't want to encourage anyone to smoke cannabis who hasn't already somebody who doesn't know their body doesn't know their mind because it can actually hinder you and if you're not intelligent enough to know when to stop and no one to stop you stop yourself then you know use caution cannabis isn't very self limiting some people just smoke joint after joint and never stop I mean I can't give you an amount of what's normal I might smoke I guess if people were gonna ask I might smoke about a gram and a half to two grams a day myself maybe and that may seem like a lot to some people and others just like to say nothing of course you always hear these rappers talking about how they smoked a pound a day everyone was completely full of [ __ ] [ __ ] I just wanted to put that out there nobody smokes a pound a day and if you do your douchebag so nobody even smokes an ounce a day I mean you might be able to take an ounce of cannabis out and smoke it with all your friends but a pound of 16 ounces so I mean come on it's all talk anyhow I just wanted to get that out talk a little bit about cannabis I'm hoping I will get into my next video which is about muses amusement music but I'll still have that's about it I could talk about cannabis all night I have several books and about cannabis about growing the can of Bibles with all the different strains and I grew for many years I grew a strain called white shark which is my favorite ever and I'd love to talk about different smells of cannabis and textures and flavors forever but I really started out with that main point when I started making this the idea that those flavors that come natural in the plant I thank God I remembered this before because this is the main point I want to make really those flavors that come natural in the plant those terpenes it's my belief that those aren't what give you the effect so this is why back blending terpenes back into extract isn't the answer in my belief it's not that those terpenes combined with the THC or affect you because of them themselves but rather they are indicators that other cannabinoids are present within that plant so in other words a plant that tends to be more lemony might be a sativa one more spicy smelling might be an indica not always but that generally there's a lot of smells where you can generally tell smells and textures and it makes you wonder if it's something else in the plant that the terpenes are just indicators I hope you followed what I'm what I'm what I'm getting out here that even if you removed those terpenes from that plant those other molecules are the active ones because cannabis is so interesting nobody has been able to pin it down yet the whole industry has been trying to figure out they want to pretend they know but they don't know why certain buzzes occur with this strain and not this one because when you look in a lab report they have the same amount of THC same amount of CBD and then they try to extract both of these and/or all the cannabinoids and then isolate them and then they find out it doesn't work by itself it's not the same buzz it's not the same feeling ask any cannabis smoker you know what is the most well-rounded just kind of kick-ass high is it extract if you were gonna take one hit of extract or one one one bong ahead of really high-quality top-shelf cannabis the answer is obvious the high the helical if it was all about extract people would just smoke extract the high quality cannabis has something within it that is very undefinable difficult to replicate and I don't think my mother nature is gonna reveal her secrets all that easy so maybe it's just the all-around experience I don't know be well my friends peace and love thanks for listening to me ramble about cannabis be safe don't take any of my ramblings here is advice to start yourself that's all I gotta say be smart peace", "8EyQuIhFzfw": "[Music] oh hi are we on we're on we're on hot mike all right hey thank you for being here what a beautiful day we have it is a beautiful day yeah thank you for noticing that's very good look at it outside i know it's nice we got a whole bank of windows behind james and april yeah so sometimes they catch shadows on us well yes they cast big shadows hey welcome thank you for being here today is going to be a great day uh those of you who are looking for delta dawn i mean delta eight um i was singing delta dawn earlier we were if we were singing together we were i didn't know if you wanted to admit having some no i thought we did what's the flower you have on i know it kind of ages us just brings me back to the the truck the ford truck you know as a kid what do you mean with the little radio on there it's right out there not that far forget it okay okay welcome thank you for being here lots of resources today we've got questions all over the place we've got an r d lab set up you can see it right over my shoulder here and so we'll be migrating over there hopefully without any technical difficulties i think we'll do it it'll be good it'll be great great great hey by the way samuel gorton from ennisburg falls vermont vermont best bourbon yeah oh i re not to diss kentucky bourbons but vermont bourbons are really good samuel he won um uh what did he win t-shirt and some other goodies jared is saying here he won by doing one of our quizzes on linkedin so apparently we have quizzes on linkedin okay all right i wonder what we quizzed i don't know interesting i'll have to find that yeah hey congratulations samuel so check out the quizzes let me know how those are uh we do have live tours cbd jam sessions advanced extraction guides distillate guides calculators mini courses we've got all kinds of resources thank you for being here if this is the first time you're here there's a little red button on the top that will allow you to refresh the screen if for any reason you get frozen just hit refresh it doesn't take you out you don't have to relog in or anything that's really good uh this is a fun and safe place uh there are poll questions so i'm just going back to this bourbon question i think you know we should do a kentucky versus vermont bourbon smackdown oh that would be fun blind taste test i like get to it i do like that now i know you know vermont has some really good rye bourbons that's my preference i like rye bourbon so we'd have to kind of do wheat and rye okay all right that's fine and then do kind of two different flights yeah well that's gonna be a fun afternoon you know we were talking uh before about doing uh like a scotch tasting online yeah and it'd be kind of fun to fun to do that we should also do a scotch bourbon smackdown oh yeah well there's no there's no comparison i thought bourbon would obviously win we just noticed canadian whiskey didn't even make the but see a lot of the vermont rye comes from canadian rye no i like that that whiskers that you have wisers yeah wisers jp wisers uh is really good but that's a canadian whiskey it it is it but it is a bourbon but it comes via vermont it is really good but it is it is a canadian right anyway the more you drink the wiser you get all right we should probably not digress too much i guess what yeah we got a lot of ground recovery this is delta okay questions please introduce yourself um also ask questions no holds barred questions everything is going simple tough join the chat invite your friends there will be a replay there will be a replay there will be a replay all right um today's topic is everything delta eight yeah delta eight delta eight thc you know then you know we've all heard of you know what has happened with delta 9 delta 9 thc dhca we've got all that cbd a those are all kinds of things going pure thc so we've got a lot of things that we're going into on delta eight the questions are here and i'm guessing you have a presentation i do you have any tables i do he's got tables yes shocking i do i have a table and and okay so this is gonna be uh it's gonna be a lot of fun can we get going i think i think we have started okay you have it i thought we lost you there okay here's here's what happened okay so we went into like okay we're gonna make delta eight so we actually made our first delta eight this week kind of cool there's been a lot of buzz about it and uh so i spent monday in the laboratory and bam we got it with a little help from my friend uh shout out to jagger so thanks a lot for that he basically helped me along and i'm like oh do this do this okay whatever and so we're just going to kind of show you our results what we got how we did it it's pretty simple uh i was pretty shocked at how simple it was so i've got these like jager yeah all right not the mick oh that's the mc version different jagger okay let's uh so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go into just a little bit of the presentation and then uh we have a lab little lab set up rather than moving you know into the facility and having a gown up and everything it'd probably take five minutes to get it all done so i just brought the lab here into our studio and uh we'll just kind of i'll show you how i did it so i love that this is a picture uh whenever you say lab just so you know i always get a little worried because i i have this feeling that i'm going to be tasting something oh yes we okay i get a little nervous it just happened it's the anticipation yeah okay sorry go no no no i think we should okay everybody who thinks that we should have my friend randy here um to try out some of this beautiful oh delta eight do we have this that'll be fun because i've got meetings this afternoon do we have the puff bar where is the puff bar okay i i think jared had the puff part can we get that here just make sure i got it okay all right okay all right i don't even know what a puff oh okay okay oh shoot it said it was broke oh okay so okay whatever we we're we're probably not going to try on there maybe you dodged the bullet okay or whatever so look at this beautiful beautiful stuff usually it's it's like crystal white clear but jagger told me hey look uh it doesn't it people don't like to have it like super clear because it it like colorless okay because it doesn't look like real stuff so um if you you know if you process it it like gives you a nice yellow color and we got similar colors it was just a little darker because we didn't have time to distill it all so i'll but i'll show you what we got right over there awesome um so how do i advance this and while you're advancing bowden we agree nice bowden and jeff oh there we go nice okay so here's the outline i'm going to help you guys out because we've got a little bit of material to cover um tell you you know basically show you what delta 8 is from a chemical uh structure purpose i like that you use the delta sign rather than spelling it out that's that's pretty rad yeah you're you must be an analytical chemist phd um is is delta a a newly discovered cannabinoid oh it might work hold the phone what uh no okay so i'll just answer that in one question i won't work no okay uh how do i make delta eight okay we're going to go over that it's going to be pretty simple uh what equipment do i need to make delta eight how do i scale it up and how does delta a to thc affect me and is delta h thc illegal so there's a lot of material here to cover and plus i got a demo so i want to make sure we go quick pretty quick are you going to answer those last two questions before i taste it no all right here we go so oh wow guys this is this is like getting into some true chemistry okay this is great okay this is the structure chemical structure of cbd you can notice there's a couple different things uh that differentiated from thc which is right here you can see there's this there's this fused ring oxygen here right there and um yeah i think that that's basically it that's that's the main difference wow they're probably making some delta eight that's t-rex can you guys hear that okay all right so and then here's delta eight the main difference is that the location of this double bond here you can see that the delta eight and uh is over here it's switched sides it's switched sides right so there's really hardly any difference except for the location of the double bond but it is chemically distinct obviously okay so that's what delta eight thc is pretty simple i'm gonna keep this all really high level uh guys so we're not gonna go into very many details but a lot of people wanna know how to convert their cbd into this molecule and they want to know how to convert their thc that they maybe get out of a remediation process and convert that over to delta h so we're going to kind of go over those two two steps here um look at this okay this is a chromatogram this looks awesome what a chromatogram is is it's a separation technique and this is a hplc separation technique look at this green one right here this is my standard okay so here's um this is t uh cbda this is cbd and then this is cbn this is thc and this is cbc okay so those are my standards look how nice and clean they are they're all nicely separated from each other okay now look this this pink line here is actually some of the delta eight we made yesterday you can see that uh we have some little tiny bit of the probably some of the cbd here or i'm sorry some of the thc here you can see that but you can see there's all kinds of other stuff in there but this big lump here uh basically that's that's delta eight delta eight comes out right here in the in the chromatogram it's not just post thc it's just right after thc yeah so we're going to kind of go in about how to do that and then also we're going to kind of talk a little bit about these other minor products that are um that are produced and what they may be and what you need to know about it so is is is delta new is delta 8 a new phenomenon well it may be a new market phenomenon but it's not really new from the standpoint of people trying to make it out of cbd um this is a paper going back all the way to 1966. well i thought it was from 1400s this goes back all the way to 1481. it was the tetrahedon era yes that's great i'm sorry ah that's good i like that um okay so yeah 1966 so i was six years people have been talking about this um you know this is the machulum paper and he has tons of literature on there so um he was starting to do the same exact thing that i'm going to show you how to do basically you see you take cbd you put it into a vessel you boil it up with some this case he's using ethanol and hdl which is an acid um and it's it's an isomerization reaction that occurs he says it's a catalysis reaction and he does actually use catalysis okay um but uh there's evidence in his other papers that you don't actually have to use the catalytic materials and i'll go through what that is in just a moment but you can see he's using you know just normal chemistry techniques he's got some ether solution and uh yeah and then um he's drying it with some sodium sulfate so that's very very clear so it's really not um you can see it's it's not it's not new at all it's been around for a very very long time and all of the side reactions and side products they're kind of listed at them all in there but they're not um you know each each condition that you have might produce different uh reaction products so you're gonna have to know what those reaction products are before you sell your stuff or make it uh yeah you make it and then you characterize it and then you can sell it you don't want to sell something for example with a bunch of unknowns in it right no so that's that we talk about that all the time we do talk about that all the time and that that's one of the you know kind of the um techie type of bucket chemistry you go on to youtube you watch a video like this one try to go do it and then you try to use it you're you're basically creating um you know you got to look out for residuals number one and then you also got to look out for for other those other side reaction products that you don't know what's in there sure so this is another example of another paper um here he's using p p toluene sulfonic acid okay if you go online and you you read the techie blogs and stuff they're always talking about this a toluene sulfonyl acid right exactly um and you can see in this case it's two hours rather than 18 hours right so so they're using this as a lewis acid kind of catalyst it's in there at a catalytic amount meaning it's it's a very small amount um there was in this paper it just makes it go faster yeah they even talk about yeah it goes faster they even talk about the mechanisms in there if you guys want to go look at that knock yourself out you know um also other different types of uh you know derivatives of thc he's got a lot of a lot of uh you know papers on that i'm not gonna go through this but i'm i'm basically highlighting the fact that this is very old very well known there's you can see here he's using ethanol he's using hydrogen chloride for two hours he's got a different he's again boiling so you can you can kind of just precursor and read the literature and get an idea how to do this well use an acid use a maybe a lewis acid and you boil it up while stirring um and make sure that it's done in the hood so that it's not you know evolving you know evolving acid out into the air and make sure you're wearing gloves and good good ppe with your eyes and stuff so how to make delta hthc this is this is quite simple you dissolve yourself how to make delta eight thc you notice i'm in it the delta the black i did i like that and i even superscripted i did see that that now that is that is actually the way it's supposed to be if you look into all the literature that's the correct nomenclature delta to the eighth power yes i guess so so if you if you don't want to be an ignorant um no i can't what are you saying uh no this is how you normally would uh this is how i normally am is that what you're saying my big stop sign just came up don't say it don't say it okay hot mic i see i do have a filter okay so um rarely okay this so your first step is you dissolve cbd in non-polar organic solvent you can use a lot of different kinds of solvents i'll kind of go over in my table i'll show you some of the different options that you have so a non-polar organic solvent for people like me yeah it just means it's not cold [Laughter] it could be cold or hot but polar uh generally refers thank you for that joke i like that uh it just refers to its polarity so ethanol would be considered a polar solvent uh water would be considered a polar solvent but non-polar would be something like pentane or hexane or something like that just checking yep okay i got your back guys all right and then add uh add the acid whether it's lewis or bronsted-acid which is your acid okay hcl in the case of michelin he's using hdl use p he used the sulfonic acid right lewis branstad yeah yeah thank you sorry um and then um and then you stir in it's pretty critical that you get up to this uh you know 100 degrees celsius and i noticed i didn't superscript that sorry guys and then one to eight feet hours it depends so do you take turns stirring um yeah you know you get no we got a little star bar the stir bar stirs it's an automatic yeah it's an automatic stirrer yeah okay so and then you have a temperature uh hot plate so you can use a stirring hot plate for this and you can do it right on the bench um you know um and then and then basically there's some post-processing steps we tried different types of acids we tried acidic acid formic acid nitric acid we tried um you know like a solid support for the acid using a lewis acid like illumina for example just boiling up the acid in the alumina these are some things that i'll show you in the options it's no problem you get conversion with all of them it's just the fat matter of how fast it is and um how how quickly it goes how fast it is and then what the side products are so that's that's the main thing once you have obviously you have this acidic uh stuff over here um you're gonna have to dry it or neutralize it typically use a sodium bicarbonate you'll get you get two phases and then sometimes people extract with another polar non-volatile or volatile solvent like ether or something like that okay it is not out it's not necessary um you can just it'll wash out some of the color some of the products and things like that if you use a little bit of carbon in here you can also take out some of the color that you see you know in the first slide and then you obviously do testing so you're you're taking this pot right here that that is the stir and you're testing it and then making sure that after you wash it you know you're testing it again and you're testing it you're always testing it now this this final product is going to have delta 9 in it so you thought oh i'm going to use my isolate and go all the way to delta eight it'll be perfect well it's not really because you have to remediate it again right okay so now you're now you're back to thc remediation so and it's never you know it's not never so the conversion is not a hundred percent so you got to make sure that you realize that um actually i think i'm going to skip this this is my little video oh here i got a video here okay and this is my yesterday this is one of my reactions that i was doing this is 50 grams that looks like an automatic stirrer oh oh oh what in the heck okay i don't think it's working it's melting too much hcl and then something happened oh my gosh oh poor doug he's not with us anymore okay all right here i'm gonna i'm gonna go to the next one here and i'm gonna skip this one too because obviously our movies didn't work because i'll show you in real time that's better right yes okay so this is the sources of the raw materials you can use um a delta nine distillate um you know you want to make sure that it's not wind it's fully winterized distilled obviously um a lot of people like to use their isolate delta nine waist you know because you'll get delta nine uh out when you make your isolate cbd crystals okay and you'll have this delta nine and usually people just uh really get rid of it right um they can't sell it as a part of a hemp product obviously that's why they have they have that there so um that's the isolate way of using it um and probably what's gonna happen it's gonna be more complex because you're you know you'll have you'll be you'll be stirring with acid for basically everything right you're stirring it and then everything's reacting that's that's in that slough okay so it's kind of tough to identify what the products are the cleanest way to do it is just to use cbd isolate okay and that's something that you know a lot of people can do also this delta nine fraction would have essentially the same problems as this isolate delta nine waste but you can use this delta nine fraction convert it over to uh c are converted over to delta eight and then use the chromatography again to separate out the delta eight delta nine the stuff that hasn't converted over okay so it's it's pretty simple but again you would be using the same type of thing you'd use some sort of uh acid or lewis lewis acid along with a combination of an acid stirring in a non-polar solvent and you heat it up to 100 degrees to start that's it wow so it's pretty pretty simple um here's some examples of some acid washes and neutralizers that you guys now if you go look at the literature there's this boron trifluoride that's the um you know what mushulum calls a catalyst okay and it is a lewis acid catalyst and basically it's an electron vacuum cleaner it says okay i see electrons there i'm going to suck them up let's take out the electrons yeah that's right so that's all that's also the reason why alumina is is in this list here aluminum is also a lewis acid um and zirconia would work too um and then you have but you you typically would acid wash that so you can buy that all commercially you can acid wash alumina which is basically you're just you're just boiling alumina in in an acid drying it neutralizing the supernatant and then using it you know so that it's delivering the acid this is probably the easiest way to deal with um deal with the process because you're just dealing with a powder rather than a liquid and then you have this p toluene sulfonic acid alumina silicate washed acid and magnesium silicate washed acid uh these uh there's all of these reported in the literature and there's many more yeah like a lot so donald once donald that should answer your question if you've got more questions just let us right but i think that you know you can use um something as simple like we did we got conversion with just acetic acid yeah so we got conversion with hcl we form a gas so we got conversion it's just a matter of how long it took to get there so it's still still is converting gotcha um one thing about um acetic acid in formic acid is that they are soluble in your solvent uh in this case a heck uh alkane which would be heptane or pentane or whatever you guys are using there it would be soluble there so not all of these are soluble i don't know i don't think nitric acid is soluble in an alkane maybe someone can put that in there but i don't think it is but but certainly acetic acid is and you've got to use glacial by the way which is glacial acetic acid which is uh a very highly purified form of 100 and it'll go right into your hair sounds cold yes it's glacial into your polar solvent nonpolar solvent okay um okay so then you have your solvents obviously there have been reports i mean there's some solvents here that you just don't want to use or even have in your laboratory at all okay yeah don't don't don't bring benzene to your laboratory certainly they'll break toluene into your laboratory you know you can use some alkanes um the issue with the alkanes obviously just by the n alkanes which are the more purified form of alkanes you are going to have to worry about residuals okay yeah and because they will have them so when you um go to your laboratory to get your hplcs done to see how pure you are make sure you give a blank to them right any acid you use is going to have something that absorbs in the in the uv and it's going to show up there so i would also take and make sure that you're not just looking at one wavelength have them look at the entire spectrum meaning um have them do a scan from 220 nanometers all the way up into the visible like uh 300 and 350 nanometers okay what that's going to do is 20 to 350. yeah have them scan it they have a certain type of detector that they use for that and that'll allow you to identify if there's more issues associated with uh residuals and things like that so and we have we have several podcasts on you know just basically talking about residuals right we do and so you guys can go back we'll post them in the notes uh you guys can go back and take a look at that excellent um bronstead acids okay these are just acids and like i said we got conversion with just just a straight up acid we got conversion of combinations of acids i think you know in terms of the best one we just uh you know it was acetic acid um with this aluminum acid wash that's was the best one we just washed this uh aluminum acid in the acetic acid and then it worked out real good excellent so richard had a couple of good questions yeah this whole process that we're talking about is this an isomerization process isomerization isomerization yes yes that's that's correct that was close yes all right and then the other question he had a follow-up question is as we're using these does one methodology get a more consistent result than another um you know what i i can't say i have enough experience with it at the moment to really say okay hey this this is better than the other one we got like i said we got a conversion with any of these in it and if you just use these types of acids they're easy to remove um so when you scale up your process you need to think about a couple different things of course the cost of the process the cost of the consumables uh you're going to want to make sure that you have you know an easy way uh conversion wise so you don't have a lot of delta nine right because if you if you're just taking your cbd and you're converting it to delta eight but you have a bunch of delta nine there you're still not able to sell it right okay and that is unlawful that is exactly what happened in our case okay we had delta nine in there um which which then means you would have to um you would have to go and do some chromatography or thc remediation which should we have a another podcast on that you guys can go back and take a look we have a a whole podcast on separations and our pier 99 is a great way to do that absolutely so yeah so that's a couple different things there just so there's no real magic bullet you're always going to produce uh in a boiled acid reaction you're going to produce a whole bunch of different products there and you know you really should know what you're producing before you sell it and you should be my guest kind of have an idea what you're doing or it just sounds dangerous i already thought of that oh yeah look at that beware unknowns and residuals this would be the danger yeah it should be in red yeah okay so let's just kind of let's kind of talk this through guys okay if these are solid supports you you're gonna get residuals and leachables from those solid supports you need to make sure they're pure okay okay when you run your uh when you run your reaction you should run a blank reaction okay this this is just common knowledge you run a bank reaction you you work it up with not no active product and then you shoot it and see what you're you're producing see if you're extracting anything from those materials because not all the materials are equal okay i mean you you can go on to for example okay um a good example of that would be if i took the alkanes and i added you know like a luminol acid wash and i had some carbon in there and i boiled it up you would be extracting lots of benzopyrenes for example those are cancer-causing issues no who wouldn't know that that's what you do you would you would be doing that and the other problem with that obviously would be you if you didn't know what it was you wouldn't test for it you give your consumer i said say hell look at this it's all perfect it's good because you're not testing for it so yeah don't don't don't do that so don't don't be that guy don't be that guy okay same thing with yourself i'll come and bite you in the yeah you wanna you wanna okay i use distilled solvents or distill them you know and take all the water out of them and you can redistill them over like sodium metal is my favorite sodium metal yeah sodium metal i like that yeah with a little liquid nitrogen on the cool trap it sounds like that could be another music jam yeah we could sodium metal we got some sodium metal there okay um yeah it's a little sodium metal there yeah that's all right all right oh yeah yeah we got yeah that this is so this is this is just a little little break from the tables [Music] all right okay that was a little bumper music for the getting uh to the rest of the yes final one we do there will be a replay we have it recorded oh yeah fully fully fully no worries you think yeah okay whatever well eli almost beat me to it okay let's see here demand to see a chromatogram oh you know why i must have been a really good mood when i wrote this okay here's the deal like i can say look this stuff uh i can give you a chromatogram let me show you he's in a good mood right here look at this this is exactly what i'm talking about guys right here wow okay look at delta eight 95 percent oh wow what they didn't show you a chromatograph of all the other crap that was in there okay so you got five percent stuff that could kill you okay basically think about that and then you can see not tested for residual solvents how good is this stuff do you want to have this stuff i mean no way no you know what would be fun it would be fun to just do a show on reading coas yeah oh my gosh we could just do like 30 minutes of oh this is crap side commentary on coast everybody would hate me okay i gotta okay so then let me see here residuals may not be tested okay this is a good example demand to see a chromatogram number one what the heck is in there number two uh residuals may not be tested did they test for the unknowns did they test for the residuals and the leachables may be present those may be solid leachables okay in other words they may be ash content they may be they may be any number of cancer-causing you know residuals do not take a chance you guys got to know what you're doing okay so that's why i say we'll be smart we'll just some bucket chemistry here but just make sure be smart with it yeah and god i agree it's more sodium take a look at this so this is what i'm talking about you see all this stuff in here that we created so we took this beautiful beautiful uh standard it wasn't the standard it was just just beautiful pure cbd it was just this just this peak right here that was all you would see and then we made all that crap by by boiling it in acid okay and i was like wow well that's a lot of junk in there is like what is that oh well it's not even showing up you see it the times are not even showing up so we're not even identifying what the material is you see that so we just magically make it appear well through science yeah science and assets okay here we go this is what i'm talking about guys so so beware buyer beware number one consumer beware number two you got to know what you're doing number three uh it's not a magic bullet number four because you're going to be creating uh thc which is going to have another thc remediation process so this that's the realities of it but but but um uh this is the basic workflow for basically the conversion and once you come up with the right technique uh using the parameters that i've outlined for you and i told you what i thought worked best with the acetic acid and the alumina washed acid um here you have a reaction um this is this is basically just some timings when we did our work we did some timings to try to understand okay what would this look like in terms of you know is this a viable process from the standpoint of you know over uh overbearing amounts of of labor no the answer is no because most of it's machine time so you would just be you would put together a process where you do reaction neutralization solvent removal thc remediation and testing and of course you'd test at every one of these processes here but you want to put this together in a workflow where you didn't have inventory building up in between of course everybody's heard uh my to our talks on operational excellence you can go there's some stuff in the notes you should go take a look at it because it could save your business a lot of money absolutely just just spend an hour with me uh implement the value stream mapping tools understand where you know where your inventory is is falling and you can really save a lot of money and take money off your you know free up money from your balance sheet into cash absolutely that's converting yeah waste or inventory that's sitting there that you don't know what to do convert it into profit right we talk about that all the time yeah that's what we need to do exactly how do you remove cost and part of that is wasteful just sitting in inventory just an inventory you don't know what to do with right right and now convert that into something you can sell yes love it yes yes yes love it and i really appreciate you saying that we talked but it was it was your talk no we did we talked about it we did we did we did we did we did we did yes yes okay so here's the here's the uh workflow for cbd to delta a conversion and you know of course the the testing i would test at every one of these phases so here you of course you because i an analytical chemist of course i want a test tester is going to test the test is going to test yeah that's right we're going to do you got to say it right yeah here we got the reaction we're going to test that we're going to testify the neutralization in fact all the input materials have to be tested okay uh your cbd coming in your delta eight coming in whatever it is like you're gonna test you've got to test that you're gonna say everybody's contest okay you gotta test this me test you test okay we're all happy okay all right what equipment do i need you know a lot of people want to know that inquiring minds want to know oh yeah so um you need to have a stirred reactor with a heater condenser on it and i'll show you acquirer mines we want to have white film evaporator yes the way the only reason you need the white film evaporator is is to is to re reduce the color okay because if you really do it like at a really high temperature above 100 degrees okay you're going to get some really dark extracts i'll show you what that looks like did i bring some no i did not shoot what okay i didn't but i i got some really dark stuff yesterday and you know that might that might be good for a white film so if you have one of those laying around you should use it in this case um and then or you could do a short path too but i'm a known short path hater he is and that has come up several times yes short path later yeah i'm a hater on the short path but okay and then um preparative chromatography obviously um you know that's to get the delta eight delta nine out you know so um we're gonna do probably in a couple weeks maybe three four weeks among put that on our show list of doing a uh separation of delta eight delta nine um on with our p909 okay yeah i love it and then uh the uh hblc for analytical so just just let you know um this is what you the equipment that you pretty much have to have okay yes and heidi we're not trying to be testy what we're doing is we're trying to be a little bit quick so we can get to the lab he's so excited about getting to the lab i can't even tell it's like all this pent up energy okay he's just ready to go man and jason we'd love to do an article on oh yeah yeah we'll do an article how many articles do i i mean i feel like i haven't been writing you are quickly but you are quite prolific but but i haven't been writing a lot lately i know i have a slacker i have a big pile of papers april's got something that she's been working on tables oh jared's got that article you want okay here we go so how does the delta eight affect me okay look anybody can go on i need to study this hold on keep going anybody go online and find this information okay um there's i'm not telling you anything that's not readily available with just a simple google search um uh but um according to some of our actual uh user people that we have um okay uh lightly psychotropic lower potency than delta nine so it's going to have a lesser effect than delta nine um it does interact and metabolize in the same way so it goes it interacts with the same receptors in your body that delta 9 does which is really great so the kind of the mechanism of metabolism is known already and you know the quickest way to get the dose in is obviously an inhale inhalation it kind of bypasses the liver and all of that so um be very very careful obviously the same type of if you're taking it internally through the gut and um you know it'll eventually get to your brain but you in you know but you really need to um make sure you don't overdose okay so typically 10 milligrams per dose that's a that's a typical thc dose so um don't don't do any more than that yeah and we don't really talk about doses but that's about the range of what people yeah take yeah exactly so that's what you want to do there and then is it legal um there's been uh pretty cool we have let me see here oh yeah take a look this is a legal memo that just happened in wisconsin to this uh staff attorney to the yeah it's just a very month ago yeah recently and some people in the state wanted to know okay what the legality is um and this is from their representative and uh this this came from cush.com look at that that's funny but they they had reposted it um but you can see the short answer is that the substance meeting and definition of hemp is legal for purposes of state federal controlled substances laws regardless of its delta a thc concentration that is the beauty of it that's the official of it and that's pretty cool so um the same things you here's what you want to do if you're a hymn producer and you want to kind of get into this and take a look at it first of all avoid the states that are you know hemp is not you know uh looked on favorably or not legal okay oh idaho yes exactly i wasn't going to name the names but i wasn't either but i just was rooting for item that's all i love all their sports teams yes um and then avoid uh states where hemp derived oils are not accepted okay that's a good idea and then hemp drive oils oils are fit for commerce if they are derived from industrial hemp and have less than point three percent delta nine thc okay so um one of the things that i you know i was talking to our general counsel about this and we were just kind of going through some scenarios no we just kind of going through okay the scenario would be okay what if uh you know you have a you have a legally tethered product and then you put it out into the marketplace it has delta8 but it's derived from its derived and somehow you get busted yeah you're gonna have uh you you're gonna you know i don't know it it's gonna be a lot of money basically to uh you know to try to get out of that okay that it's legal yeah you're gonna have to especially with the chromatograms that i was showing you hang on let's go back up to that okay okay see this is so this thc if you have if you don't get a nice clear super separation right and uh you have a little bit of thc in there you don't really know how much it is okay that's something you need to think about so get all of your thc out if you're gonna do it just make sure you get all the thc up i don't know i'm the best thing i'm just cautioning people just don't bring your chromatograph with you whenever you use it well yeah just put it in the back of your car and then when you get stopped no no officer this is actually delta nine and see here's the vlog here you can just hand them that memo from the state of wisconsin here's my chromatograph and you can run it right there that's right yeah run it like yeah yeah that's that's weird okay anyway so that's uh that's that do you have a cup i can use [Laughter] how to measure delta eight okay guys this is really super simple delta a comes out right here here's thc intel day comes out right here so um this is a 70 uh 70 30 water group that's not a gradient it's just a isocratic phase i usually use point one uh formic acid in both of these phases you just run it straight out on a reverse phase column with hplc and it'll you'll get a separation so um and you'll be able to get more and more selectivity between the isomers of delta eight and delta nine um just by uh just by decreasing this amount so you go 60 but you see i was too impatient i actually want a two minute run instead of a four minute run i had to wait four minutes to get those results you were impatient oh man oh oh the other thing i want to tell you i can't even imagine okay you see this line right here okay there's a there's a huge peak that comes out like at minute 10 and a half okay really so i don't know what i have no idea i have no idea we're that means we're doing a field trip someday he's going to figure that out take a look at this guys i mean you just want to make sure that you have you understand what the unknowns are oh sure that's about it so okay um be smart i'm just going to show you a quick demo it's not going to be let's go um and then we can get into some of your questions and we can talk more about it but yeah we'll do a quick demo and show you how i did this all right oh my gosh this is awesome can you hear me okay yeah okay so this is like uh rogue rogue chemistry right can you guys get uh can you guys get a pan on this right here okay there we are okay there we are okay now we're cooking okay by the way this is a nice little piece of equipment um so this is one of the things you're going to need to do use for your little chemistry experiment here um this is called a uh well it's just a stir stir plate with a heater on it what's nice about this one is you can set the temperature that you want the process and it's got this little probe here okay and it's nice because it'll it'll always keep that temperature about what you want okay so here i have um cbd this is a isolate okay so i'm just gonna pour that in here this is exactly what i did guys it's not not very hard okay this is heptane so i just poured that heptane in there awesome okay i just splash around see look at that i'm going to start to uh yeah basically this is what i did super simple um this is some of my uh acid washed uh alumina that i did aluminium uh that i did right here so i would pour that in there and i'm putting it about about uh 14 to 20 by weight okay so uh yeah so just keep that in mind guys and then here i have a little acid uh little acid that i'm putting there okay and it's pretty good now this is not a volatile acid one thing is yeah which means is that we're not gonna we don't we can't actually smell it but obviously um you know if you're gonna use a volatile acid like acetic acid you're gonna heat it up to a hundred degrees celsius it's gonna come off so you're going to want to do this in a hood in a hood in the hood is where you're going to want to do this so and that's not wearing a hoodie no no that that is in like in a hood you know walk-in hood it's it's spinning yeah venting hood the venting hood okay so then all i do now is i as i change this here to 100 degrees watch out for that there here randy and i'm going to go ahead and do that i'm going to turn up this heat i'm going to turn this on like that it's at 100 degrees okay it's not going to heat up now i just set my timer for you know maybe three hours and then this will turn color like it'll turn this color in fact right here is that it yeah this is it i made this is yesterday you can see it's got um you see how it's it's kind of um it's got uh it's it's got a heptane in it so i haven't removed all the solvent from it yet but when you take the heptane out you need a rotavap or a fractron or something like that to do that then then then this stuff will all come to a like an oil so that's what that is so it's really simple guys but you're gonna get some delta nine in there and uh you know that's basically it notice it's got a little bit of yellow right there so that is it now i also showed you this once you remember i put that alumina in there so those are solid okay and you want to be able to basically filter all of that out so this is just a simple buchner funnel with a um you know with a vacuum on it and a sidearm so sidearm and then you have uh you have like a little adapter here this is a ceramic uh buchner funnel and then a filter paper okay if you were doing this at large scale of course you use a drain droid for that and then drain droid would be perfect for for that kind of purpose but um i think we got it i mean that's how simple it is guys it's really not really not that difficult and this is just to make a one-off batch make a one-off that's try it yeah you can send in the sample you can send the sample to us we'll run it for you um but but if you do that i'm gonna be looking for all of the uh unknowns i'm gonna tell you hey you got a lot of unknowns in there and things like that so that that's i'm gonna turn this off now and uh go back to our original position okay so um as we go through there sorry for that that was kind of fun actually we we had a little bit of a technical stuff uh here usually we do this right at the lab we were talking about doing it in in the lab itself um but here here here we are all right bam bam okay here we go all right so mike up hey okay now it's working i thought that was awesome oh yeah now and so this is a one-off uh and if somebody wanted to do this what would they how much would it cost us for that little setup there oh you got you got maybe uh 1200 he had the 1200 you got maybe one two three thousand three thousand bucks something like that three thousand dollars you can do some one-off yeah delta eight yeah if you're gonna you might have like a lot of people might have the um you know hot plate already they might have a vacuum pump already they might have a little bit and you can repurpose all that yeah right i think so so i i think that that's good what um if you want to do this at high scale at scale yeah do you have slides on that or is that something we can just talk about yeah we can just talk about that i mean oh okay so if you're gonna do um you know multi-kilos per time you're gonna need to have a large um you know reactor um which is a 50 liter reactor that's a stirred reactor that has a heater cooler on it okay and also uh has a um could you get that hooked up for him okay why are you worried about my arms no i just i just he's worried about me look at that first time for everything you know maybe we should get these things on a little a little stand that goes right here no these are more fun i don't know okay i was able to boom you i didn't i didn't hit you i thought about it but okay i didn't um yeah yeah so oh the acid is acetic acid guys uh that's a yep and uh no it wasn't sulfuric we didn't use any sulfuric acid in there at all yeah sulfuric is really dangerous by the way uh if one little splash in your eye you go blind seriously so be very careful with the uh sulfuric acid um yeah all right sorry he's remaking me yeah i'm i'm far away okay there we are oh and now i'm even further away awesome okay um so scale so if we wanted to scale this up yeah could you set this up as kind of a production yeah yeah so you could set it up as production um you'd have to have here's the workflow that i think you should have i mean you're going to have to have some sort of a solvent remover um you're going to have to have some sort of way to actually reactor so you'd you would never do a scale up like that you know you you know so you would want a host enclosed yeah you'd have a closed reactor um and if you're using solvents of course you have to have a enough um you have to have enough solvent there uh and you have to have a control area for that solvent along with you know approved containers improved storage and if you're going to use any type of motors any in there along with that it has to be a c1 d2 piece of equipment so you know doing it on the lab bench is great but for production purposes there are other requirements you need to be thinking about so you would you would need to have um you know probably a start a stirred reactor with an air motor or a inert gas motor um and then you'd have to have a heater cooler heater chiller on that okay um and you can buy those at a number of places we we uh we often quote those in a quote and patrick package um if you have uh for fractron you can use our fractron to do all the solvent removal um if you have some road of apps you're going to need to have at least a 50 liter road of app um and the reason i recommend to have multiple road of apps or a fractron uh simply because you're going to be trying to remove the solvent also you know and what's great about the fractron is it doesn't have it has two different types of falling film okay it has a packed bed fractional uh falling film and it has a tube and tube tube and shell falling film so you can actually isolate one of those uh vessels one of those uh you know falling film evaporators and just just circulate it in there if you want to use it for a single purpose so that it's super versatile guys very nice yeah so um that would be that and then you're gonna need to have some way to remove all of the um you know delta nine from your reaction pot right so that means uh you know some sort of chromatography or some sort of thc remediation um yeah something along those lines so and we have gone over the thc remediation there's there's lots of different ways to do it there's not just one way um you know you guys can choose a choose whatever it is but we can also put that together into a package for you um and uh you know you know see how that goes along with slps and and uh you know and then training and consulting to really make it happen so what we've talked about is being able to put together a kit for you on the smaller side so it would be a small batch kind of thing that you you can do um it'll be a little more than the three thousand dollar little lab thing that we have here because that's that's just a one-off that's really small so we talked about that but then on the large scale side if you really want to do delta eight you're going to need you know from our equipment side of it you're looking at the fractron you're looking at you know you you need solvent you need the heater and the chiller you need the pure 99 full chromatography and all of this can be repurposed for other uses post extraction right right right yeah that's right true yeah you would use it for other things as well you'd use it in your isolate process you would use it obviously in your winterization process so you're going to be using all that stuff anyway so yeah and then you know we would give you all of our processing methods as well as part of that um and you know we list on that if we were to sell that it's like just over a million dollars yeah that's what we do it's a pretty high throughput though yeah a very high throughput oh my gosh the fractron will do how much yeah so i mean you would have uh you would have a you'd be able to 20 you know deal with it like 20 gallons an hour yeah flow through right right but you'd be able to deal with it with a very low operational cost oh yeah because it's all automated and then the pure 99 you're we're looking at pure 99 pushing through how many liters an hour we're um well we're eight liters an hour or eight liters a minute sorry excuse me eight liters a minute yeah times that's times 60 okay that's a big number yeah eight liters a minute on chromatography that is full out optimized for thc remediation which is what you need for this and that's just post thc remediation right correct so you you run it you've got it um and that through that's a huge throughput so you can get you know delta eight at a high level what what is uh what is the market right now right now for delta eight you know what i i looked uh on a couple different websites and um it was wildly varying um you know when we we looked at some of the delta eight we bought some delta eight and um you know wasn't it has i think a lot of those other things that you see in the um you know chromatogram those are they have they affect the aroma and the flavor so my view of the delta eight is that it has a definitely has to be formulated okay you're just going to put in straight up delta 8. well i don't know if you really want to do that because it's not not going to taste very good and um you know and or have no taste at all i mean you know most people want to enjoy the flavor and aroma right um in order to uh in order to really enjoy it so that that's uh yeah so i don't know what the what the price is but i think it's it's well it's it's a lot yeah i've heard ten dollars a gram that's what i heard you're higher than that so yeah but that's that's a lot of that's a lot of coin so there's a way there are ways to do that and you know for that we're actually doing a special right now rather than one million five thousand dollars we're going to do we're we'll actually give knock 20 off of that so show special 799 000. wow but you have to put in the code yes what's the code dr john rocks okay all right i think that's a wrap and as an alternate the other is a delta 8 lab so you can use dr john rox or delta 8 lab i use that code and will actually even do that for you if you're on and you want it even better yeah we'll even give an extra five percent for the first three that sounds like a good one yeah so we could put that together for you and uh you know basically gave you everything you need with a little sheet here's how you do it and and uh we if you send the test into us we can we can actually test it for you so and we're we do this all the time so that's this is our world and we want to make sure we've got that for you and then we're going to put this other kit together um and so we'll put we'll post that somewhere i don't know where we would post that uh i think we're going to we have a store we have store link that we can put on we'll put a smaller kit together for you know the small batch as well but uh if you need something then go on our website we've got our bot and you can try to stump our bot the bot is the bot rocks spot rocks that's pretty good i like it and just ask the questions and then you'll either get a call from myself or elijah or q or manual or whatever we can and we can answer more questions for you on the equipment itself uh but you know this works for any extract if you're a processor right now let's let's go we can talk about this all of our gear will interface we're co2 on our extraction side but we have we're selling our fractrons and our clear stills and our pure 99s to ethanol processors all day every day yeah um and the drain droids i mean they're yeah it's all going dry and fractron so anyway this was a phenomenal show lots of tables chromatographs chromatographs chromatographs yeah i love that we went through it so so this is good and i don't think anyone else i think did we did we win a prize because i don't think there's another webinar you guys have sat on where there's a million dollar offering did we do it we have never we have never done that actually we've never and we don't usually do that but this is kind of a one-off thing we don't like to push our product but we we did want to give you a special for being here and that's where we're at sounds good so didn't mean to uh oversell but this was awesome there will be a replay and this was predominantly education that's what we like to do yeah and we love being here because we like to hear your questions we love to interface with you that's what we want to do and again congratulations to samuel gorton ennisburg falls vermont uh king of bourbons thank you and i know uh did you see bowdoin and jeff chime saying yes vermont i saw that and i wasn't sure you know yes oh that's right that's what's this you said visser's comes via vermont how does that work why is there native wisers yeah they're their neighbors it works it's good canadian rye is really good that's okay anyway that it is good um delta eight delta a thc we worked we talked about all of these we talked about lists of compounds cannabis components cannabidolic acid we there's a lot of things that we talked about that i have no idea how to pronounce isomerization yeah yes richard thank you for popping that into me i i did it and i was correct we have a lot of chemists who uh come to our podcast yeah we do chemists investors farmers processors we i just we really appreciate you we really appreciate your questions and just keep bringing them in always ask your questions we convert those into faqs all the time live tour cbd jam sessions we've got our calculators use them talk to us uh we answered a lot of stuff here this is really this was good we need to put together as uh like a conversion calculator first delta eight we'll work on that one yeah it's it's just kind of thinking out loud but we'll do that oh sure awesome thank you for being here we really appreciate you we went a couple over a couple minutes over um but thank you and uh sorry if this seemed a little hurried but we wanted to get through all of that for you today so thank you for being here and we'll see you next time thank you take care good job you", "21X3JqB2EBM": "welcome to the basement [Music] yes what's up new to guess what man we back today and today we're gonna do a review on something a little different got this little package today of course I got the little sticker and everything like that that always comes with to the phone's product but today we're gonna do the Twitter phone's be calm and not only we're going to do the favicon but it came in this nice case so then if you're gonna go and it says it's a travel case so I don't know if you could take you on the plane I'm not going trying to do that so this is the travel case this is the car this is the gelato number 33 to see what this bottle looks like is it thick okay thanks see my house is kind of cool right now got my a/c on it's 90 degrees outside and gorge yourself when I got this out the mailbox the box was actually hot so maybe I'll all use a little thicker but it still looks pretty good so I'm gonna start here of course we got the tweeter phone's battery that comes with it charge it that has the little tweeter phones logo on it which is cool this really looks cool it's rad so let's put this together and see we working here I know this thing should have some charge on it we're gonna test it out so it does have charge it has three voltage settings and the way you change the voltage you press the button here three times now let's see with a song okay that's green I think Green is the medium that's blue that's a lower setting and that's red so actually it's the other way around I think but whatever it is and you press it two times to preheat so now is preheating we're gonna stop that way I wanted to get to and not a bad taste not a bad taste tastes almost like it has mint in it and let's look at the it also comes with the letter to law enforcement of course I love having that this is how to here tells you how to operate that animals and this product has 65 point 93% cannaboids and the total CBD percentage is 65 point 87 percent Wow that's a lot okay so this is not the full special product or a broad spectrum so right now we're dealing with discipline so that's what this is all about right here so this product here is good to calm you down you know if you have anxiety or if you just want to relax this is what this is good for it doesn't taste bad I also want to try a few different flavors so I kind of like it me as far as the effects I'm really not getting too much of an effect in it that was my second time pulling on it so give me a minute I'll let you guys know how I felt but it doesn't taste bad that's the most important part I know I heard a lot of people complaining about I hate the way it paints and this one doesn't taste bad the Delano 33 pretty good good job three two forms I'm just waiting to see how that this affects me right now I've had anything today I didn't smoke any flower no CBD babe juice because I do they I'm starting to feel a little calm now all that CBB inside here it's not a work already yeah absolutely so it was definitely doing what it's supposed to do I'm feeling a little calm or a little better than what I did when I first started shooting this video so you know I got a weap calling this over meanness all we really do with this thing here man I like it so I'm definitely gonna be ordering some more cards from Twitter forms few other companies I'm gonna try them all out you know I'll let you guys know exactly how this thing goes be back with you in a few feet", "5ljRikoZgb0": "uh that's what it looks like this is what distillate starts out like that looks like a bucket of doo doo butter cannabis goes through a lot of steps to become nice clear distillate like this but you might be surprised by what is actually used to make all of your distillate pins and all your edibles and all your syringes i'm about to tell you how distillate is made right now on the strange show answers to all the questions you've ever had about wheat distillate is a weed extract but unlike other extracts distillate goes through an extensive process where everything is stripped away from the plant except for one specific cannabinoid if you're new here my name is matt this is the strain show and this is the channel for adults and patients where i teach you the answers to all the questions you've ever had about week if you want to learn all kinds of fun facts about weed don't forget to subscribe and you can put some nuggets of knowledge into your strain brain now distill it looks awesome but it doesn't have much of a smell or much of a taste the distillation process removes all of the terpenes and leaves you with only one cannabinoid usually thc or cbd this is a glass syringe with a one-to-one ratio of thc and cbd oil this stuff doesn't have any smell at all and when you dab it it looks super duper clear [Music] and it doesn't have much of a taste either you can't really taste it i mean you can taste it but it doesn't really have a flavor and this sucks because most of the medicinal benefits of weed and most of the high you get from weed is from all of the cannabinoids working together as a team in what's called the entourage effect sometimes they will add these terpenes back into the distillate at the end of the process and sometimes weird things are added to distillate like synthetic terpenes or maybe terpenes from another plant like lavender to give it a good taste but one of the biggest uses for distillate is making edibles almost all thc or cbd edibles are made with distillate and that means that none of these edibles are going to have any of those important cannabinoids or terpenes they're going to be just thc or cbd although the finished product of distillate is pure and potent it's usually made from the cheapest weed leftovers available to the extractor since all distillates look about the same at the end of the process you can use low-grade trim leaves like trim from a trimming machine to make distillate and it won't really matter with other types of extracts low-grade weed will make low-grade hash but not with distillate that's why some people say from trash to hash when talking about distillate the first step of making distillate is getting what's called a crude extraction oil uh that's what it looks like this is what distillate starts out like that looks like a bucket of doodoo butter this nasty crude oil is usually extracted with bho like most other concentrates but since we started off with such a low grade product this is what we ended up with but this crude oil has a lot of impurities that we're gonna have to remove before we can begin to separate this oil down into its specific cannabinoids and we're gonna do that in the next step which is called winterization in this step the crude oil is mixed with ethanol and that mixture is then placed in a very cold freezer for 24 to 48 hours while this mix is in the freezer all the impurities like chlorophyll plant waxes fats and lipids they all stick together and sink to the bottom of the container after a day or two of being in the freezer all the impurities are filtered out and the ethanol is evaporated with something like this rotary evaporator so now it looks good but it's not exactly very potent yet all cannabinoids that are in their acid form even thc have to be decarboxylated before they will interact with your body the way you want them to in the third step the oil is heated to 220 degrees fahrenheit and this removes the carboxylic acid group and that converts your thc a into thc now this stuff will get you high but it's not finished yet the last step of the process is the actual distillation process itself all of the different cannabinoids in the oil have different boiling points and different molecular weights so in this last step the extractors use vacuum pressure and heat in very precise amounts to evaporate off exactly what cannabinoids they're going after and at the end of the process sometimes they'll add terpenes back into the distillate sometimes they have the terpenes from the same weed they made the distillate from sometimes they add terpenes from different weeds sometimes they add terpenes from different plants and sometimes they add synthetic terpenes so if your distillate is flavored like a great popsicle you can probably bet there's some synthetic terpenes in there now that i know about it i'm ready to dab it so i'm about to go right here or if you just want to learn some more fun facts about weed i got those videos right here and yo don't forget to subscribe for good vibes i got them nuggets of knowledge because when you watch the strange show it's like going to weed college", "WsI2zwisEH4": "hi I'm Caitlin Garvey and I'm with Delta separation now today I met watch that distraction here at Salt Lake City and right now what I'm going to talk to you about is the ethanol extraction process and I want to go over as much detail as possible as I can cover so I'm gonna start very first with kind of an overview of the process and I'm gonna compartmentalizes so you can look at the entire process basically in three large steps so the first being extraction this is achieved by our cup 15 or cup 30 systems the second being evaporation of the solvent and this is achieved by alcohol until systems or rotary evaporator as well and finally you have a distillation step and that is performed at our roll-film system which is behind me or a similar distillation setup now those are the three big primary steps to compartmentalize that a little bit further before I go into detail on these steps I want you to understand that there's to tertiary steps in between these three lines so between extractions our cup system and the falling film or evaporation what we need to do is we need to filter that solution so we're going to be removing out of particulates and in some cases even lipids in fact the second tertiary process happens between the falling film we evaporation and prior to distillation on the real film system here and that's decarboxylation which is the process of converting the acidic cannabinoids that the plant produces THC a CBD a into the ones that are useful for us as consumers and manufacturers is THC and CBD so that is the decarboxylation step and then usually the final step is a distillation as I said that produces a distillate so to go into detail here a little bit the first thing that happens is your biomass or your cannabis or Hamptons in put it into your lab what's very important is that you make sure this is milled and homogenized you don't want or batches to be inconsistent because this is harder to track data while process so most large-scale facilities the first thing they do is mill or grind and homogenize their batches so the first thing then once we've milled and homogenized is on our cup system we're gonna pack that biomass into a mesh bag then these bags are about 80 micron forest size and what happens in that biomass is packed into the bag and then frozen at this point I do want to make a distinction that ethanol processing overall can be done with one room temperature or warm solvent or ethanol but for most people in most labs it's most advantageous to do this cold so you need to chill your solvent most often to something around negative 40 degrees Celsius prior to extraction and this cold processing is also the reason we pre freeze our biomass prior to extraction so once we've had our bag packed we've got that biomass pre frozen and we're gonna perform my extraction so we've got our ethanol cold at that point in the cup system we put our bags in and we fill it with ethanol and we do an agitation this is the formal abstraction where the ethanol is gonna grab the THC the sea Dee Dee and the terpene compounds and this is very largely depend on the solvent temperature once that extraction or agitation is done the centrifugal process of the cup is then initiated and this spins that bag very quickly and uses that centrifugal force to remove the residual amounts of solvent from the biomass now once we've done that we have a solution here of ethanol and our cannabinoids are compounds we want our CBD and THC a actually in that example and at that point that solution needs to be filtered and another point that should be made here is that solution isn't fully saturated meaning it can hold more THC and CBD and because the evaporation process down the line is very energy intensive we want to make sure ethanol is it as saturated as possible so in most labs after that initial extraction what they'll do is they will really saturate that ethanol or they will use that same volume of ethanol to wash or extract multiple bags on a cup system for example so once that ethanol is fully saturated as I alluded to at the beginning here it needs to be filtered prior to evaporation and this is to remove particulate more than anything little bits of plant matter that were left behind from the extraction process so once we've filtered it through a nuclear funnel or lenticular filter of some sort at that point then we're good to move that on to the evaporation process which is going to occur in usually a rotary evaporator or Delta's equipment we have a fall in the film evaporator so this evaporation procedure essentially involves applying heat and vacuum to the system to get the ethanol to boil off the key concept here is that the ethanol is going to boil off but our cannabinoids are target compounds the things we want our CBD a THC a are not going to boil off at this point and we can collect them and REE collect our ethanol now as I alluded to at the beginning there that crude extract prior once we've collected it from evaporation prior to distillation we need to decarboxylate and what this is is it really boils down to just applying heat to that crude extract and this is most often done on a hot plate or in a large glass or steel reactor at scale what happens there is again the plant produces the acidic compounds thca and CBD a and what we want especially for consumers but prior to distillation as well as we want the non acidic form so this is THC and CBD the more recognizable cannabinoids so the decarboxylation process just applies just involves applying heat for a certain amount of time to get these acidic compounds to convert to their non acidic forms and then at this point we have a decarboxylated crude extract and this crude extract generally speaking is the Queen 60 and 70% potent or 60 or 70 percent by weight cannabinoids are CVD or THC and the final step in him is distillation and that's performed again on a machine like this one behind me this is the rolls mill distillation unit of deltas and what we're going to be doing here is very similar to the following film we apply even more heat and even more vacuum to boil off and separate certain compounds and at the end of this process we're left with what is very recognizable now in the industry and what we call distillate this distillate depending on if we started with CBD or THC biomass is approximately 90 percent or 90 percent in CBD or THC respectively in that distillate and then that cements the process some manufacturers will take that distillate and will isolate the cannabinoid compounds as well but primarily we have from biomass extraction filtration of the solution evaporation of the solvent decarboxylation of that crude extract and then a final distillation of the crude extract to end or result in a very potent cannabinoid distant", "JpgapkpDzRI": "[Music] when you're buying a CBD product really the first thing to look at is to see whether it says its isolate or a whole hemp distillate but really what you're dealing with there is if it is isolate it may be perfectly good the reason that they did it that way is because you don't know what it was originally in it it has been purified in that regard but everything else is gone as well what you're really looking for is a hold him product because there's so much about this plant that we don't know one of the theories is that what it's called the entourage effect that they're all of these different cannabinoids there are the other ingredients terpenes flavonoids so on that we don't know why they're there and what effect they have what is clear none of them are toxic and certainly they're not there in sufficient quantities to be harmful as a part of how this plant has evolved over the millennia that it has been used by human beings and it survived as a plant in all kinds of different environments this plant will grow almost any place in various various forms and it has been used for thousands of years and we know the of course from our immediate experience it has all kinds of possible medicinal properties the idea of simply taking one cannabinoid whether it's THC or CBD or whatever you really don't know what you're losing by not having it in a whole him solution to look at that and see what's there if the only thing that it's listed is the ingredient is CBD you know that they are basically isolated that that's fine but you really true I think you get the whole hemp plant and this is not immediately obvious because you would think oh this is pure CBD whereas the other has all this other stuff but the other stuff as far as we know could be the good stone certainly is going to hurt you you", "fYMCA_Tg_vk": "Welcome to Endoca's beautiful organic\ncannabis fields. Come I'll show you Well, in order to make a good cannabis extract\nyou need good starting plant material. In my hand I have a cannabis plant it\nsmells fantastic. In order to make a nice extract you need to obviously dry the\nplant material first. Come let's go to the lab I'll show you how to make an\nextract. Welcome to Endoca. My name is Henry Vincente and today I will show you\nhow to cannabis extraction using ethanol We will use cannabis material which is\nthe leaves and the flowers all in one Very important to use organic so that you\nknow there is nothing inside that can harm you. There are over 4,000 different\nvarieties of cannabis now the one I chose has a lot of CBD inside. You could\napply the same method or what kind of cannabinoid eschews so called ethanol\ntake a ball put the plant material inside so the process has to be very\nfast. You don't want the ethanol to touch the plant material to a long time. If it\ndoes you get a lot of other stuff inside which you don't want. You just use enough\nethanol to cover so that we can separate the plant material from the cannabinoids. You need to be fast in this process because we can only stir for three\nminutes so I use a plastic spoon. You don't use mechanical devices because you\ndon't want to create a spark. If I create a spark now everything will burn. You mix\nwell then we have to separate the ethanol from the plant material. I do\nsimply by taking a sieve and put it in another Bowl. It can drip a little bit\nyou know there's still some alcohol left This was the first filtration now we're\ngoing to do the second filtration in order to remove the plant material you\nhave left, and we do that by using a simple coffee machine\nIt can heat your material and it can filtrate and we start with the\nfiltration part coffee filter, take your spoon you take now the material on the liquid\nand you pour it into the filter paper and you see the process starts. In order\nto accelerate the process we change the paper, every time a single filtration has\noccurred if you have more material you just continue until you don't have any\nmore, and like this and it's dripping beautifully. Now it's time to cook so\nwhen you cook at home you can use many different things I have here an example\nof a rice cooker which works fine a pot and a heating device works also fine and\na water distiller. Now my favorite is the water distiller because if you cook with\nany of these methods we need a cleanroom box like this for those of you who\ndoesn't have a box like this you can cook outside but to make it all easier\nlet's use the water distiller. Now this is the process where we separate the\nethanol from the cannabinoids. The time it will take for the full separation\ndepends of course of how much material you put inside I use a bowl to collect\nthe pure ethanol that's going to come out here because you can you reuse it\nagain and again we give it some juice and we wait so now the question is when\nto stop I can see I have 80% of my original ethanol volume so that's\nindication that it's time to see what's going on inside you open the lid slowly\nand look inside and you can see that is very little material in my case this is\nthe time to stop just to be sure not to breathe it here we go and be careful\nwhen you pour because there's very little material you don't want to lose\nit and now I'm going to show you the final step using the coffee machine what\nwe have to do is remove the remaining ethanol from our extract put it on the\nheating device turn it on and we wait best is to wait for 24 hours so that\nyou're sure that no ethanol is left I already did this and as you can see from\nall the work with it we have very little material the final test is a quality\ntest we do it by using a paperclip dipping it into the material and you use\na lighter you light it fast and see what happens if there is a spark you know there is \nstill ethanol left so you can see comparison see it's burning then you\nneed to put it back on the heater but in our case it was well done. To make a\ncannabis extract at home you need a lighter\nfilter coffee machine some small bowls, two bowls\nsieve plastic spoon coffee filters alcohol cannabis. Put the cannabis into\nthe bowl cover with cold alcohol steer three minutes with plastic spoon filter\nthe alcohol through the sieve filter again through the coffee filter it still\nuntil 80 percent of the initial alcohol volume is gone pour into a small ball\nhit the small ball with the coffee machine for 24 hours to remove the\nremaining alcohol. To check if there is any remaining alcohol use a small spoon\nand the lighter if there is any remaining alcohol the product will\nproduce sparks when burning with a lighter keep heating until you don't get\nany sparks anymore Enjoy your cannabis extract Stay tuned\nnext time I'm going to show you how to purify the extract and turn it into pure\ncannabinoids in my hand is 99% CBD beautiful crystals See you next time", "sd7m0t5GptA": "[Music] happy Saturday people as your boys CBB slope dark then I'm back with another review and today we're gonna be reviewing a CBB full spectrum

that this lid is kind of is a little thinner than a lot of other cards also so when you pull it you're getting a lot of smoke I mean you're getting tons of smoke almost like when you take a dad yes yes and I taste like a hint of banana a little minty [Music] and of course you taste that royalness that you know it comes from a plane so you have a hint of that inside as well I really like it it tastes good [Music] well rule to let the sing huh so I like that and this is very good for you guys that's on the go and you need to little CVD fix ego is full spectrum so I'm definitely already

really enjoying this thing guys [Music] [Music] good she's really good I like it a lot like [Music] so as you just see as it heats up this baby is moving around a little bit more now and the flavors really post not a him he is flavor richest [Music] real good suppose you have a good battery you can control your temperature this thing right here is the bomb so a day you have a god this is for warm

they're nice jupiter-c sell cartridges and they also offer a really nice battery it's a self-drawn o button and it holds a great charge it's pretty good I don't mind it I generally hate non push buttons but this battery works for me it comes in a full gram cartridge and right now I believe they're 49.99 and we offer an exclusive discount code through the hemp bud form its hemp bud forum and I believe that will save you 10% off your entire order at black ties [Music] so if you've ever tried distill it it's got that distilling flavor but it also has some natural or carring terpenes in it that were present in the hemp that was used to make the distiller just distill it by itself does taste sorta bad so if you're not familiar with what purity to distill it tastes like unflavored sort of like burnt rubber maybe a cache bowl just generally just kind of gross ish this has a nice herbal base a bit of pine hints of lemon citrus notes pie a little bit of distill if not terrible tasting not the best tasting cartridge around the effects are fantastic as it's pure distill it at 60% CBD full-spectrum all the other cannabinoids are present including a small amount of THC I believe the effects for me are just spot-on with what a good full-spectrum CBD does it calms me relaxes me slows the anxiety down that I fail relieves tension generally in my body that's what I use CBD for and

talk cbd creams and oils for topical pain relief i'm dr donald fabio cbd from hemp oil is what we're going to be talking about today and how it's used as a topical pain relieving liniment it's very common it's available everywhere just about all 50 states right now i believe over the counter and again it's a hemp oil extract which means there's very little thc in there there's no psychoactive effect so let's be clear about that we're not talking about the medicinal marijuana we're talking about hemp oil extracts cbd so how can you tell if it's going to be a beneficial for you well you got to read the ingredients and once you read the ingredients you can determine if it's going to be a good product you look at the concentration you look at what's in there and you look at what your goals are so right now our goals are pain relief that's what we're talking about so i just have a couple of creams randomly chosen cbd plus oil gold formula full spectrum hemp extract which is what we talked about so that's good it has the ingredients 100 milligrams of cbd we don't know how much per serving but the jar is 100 milligrams and it's got sweet almond oil beeswax and glycerol stearate and a bunch of other ingredients on the bottom here but no artificial dyes or scents so that's good no artificial dyes or scents it's got a lot of emollience a lot of things that are going to soften your skin with cbd which means it's going to set on your skin probably really good for someone who has a skin lesion like psoriasis or eczema something like that i don't think it'll be really good for pain control because it's not going to penetrate through the skin beeswax sweet almond oil those are oils hemp oil it's an oil it's going to sit on the skin so might be good for skin types of things where you want moisturizing and healing but i don't think it's good for pain control cbd clinic pain relief ointment oh now we're going right after pain they're claiming this relieves pain let's look at their ingredients cbd hemp oil good so we know it's it's there it's safe 400 milligrams so um this is 1.55 ounces this is 1.3 ounces so there's a lot more cbd in here um there's peppermint oil tea tree oil eucalyptus oil clove oil so lots of good oils in here um we look at the label however under active ingredients and it lists camphor 11 and menthol 16 wow that's really high so you're going to get a lot of icy hot you're going to get a lot of counter irritants menthol will give you a cooling effect camphor kind of gives you that cooling heating effect so it's an icy hot 17 percent icy hot is very very strong so this will give you a counter irritant effect i don't know if it's going to decrease the inflammation but it doesn't really address the pain directly it dresses it into correctly because it irritates the skin with the menthol in the camphor and then therefore the brain doesn't sense the pain in the area so it doesn't go after the cause but very strong stuff the next one we have is phytozol transdermal phytocannabinoid complex serum uh what are their active ingredients well it's a 100 milligrams of micro encapsulated time released photocannabinoid complex cbd so the cbd here is encapsulated well and what it's encapsulated in dgme which is a transfer agent so here um there is no menthol there is no camphor there is no methyl solicitolate it's just cbd which is an oil which is encapsulated surrounded in dgme which allows it to get through the skin into the deeper tissues um i do know this does not get into the blood by the way i did research that it doesn't say it on the label it just stays in the in the superficial tissues so this will actually penetrate through the skin it won't sit on the skin so if you're in the cbd gets into the skin through the skin and once it penetrates then it can become an active ingredient at the deeper levels and it binds with the endocannabinoid receptors in your body going after the cause of your problem and suppressing the pain and inflammation that way so a transdermal agent that goes through the skin and doesn't sit on the skin so the active ingredient goes through the skin only company i know that has that whether it's cbd or not cbd that just sits on the skin with emollients cbd with counter irritants so you feel the icy hot so you know something's working but you don't know if the cbd is working so the bottom line is what are you looking for do you want to go after the pain and inflammation or do you just want to do a counter irritant if you just want to do a counter irritant i would say skip the cbd and just go to a really high concentration methyl salicylate menthol camphor formula that you can buy anywhere as well if you want to use the cbd it makes sense to do the phytozol because then you're going to be able to get an ingredient that penetrates through the skin scientifically proven to go six times deeper than other companies penetrate there's the information now you know i'm dr donald fabio thanks for tuning in", "USaTmfTOxpo": "we got in there so this is a full-spectrum distillate this is internal tracking milli years you can see how many grams the CBD percentage CBG percentage you can see it's pretty high potency starting to crystallize here up on the top going along the glass and a lot of crystals down in here so that's your full-spectrum market prices right now we're probably around 2,500 and then this is for another client this is a broad spectrum that we just pulled out it'll start to crystallize pretty soon that's similar what you used in my broad spectrum yeah they're stunning yeah very similar 0 2 HC on this one and this is worth about double with this one is right now does it so look so consistent mm-hmm yep yep and you tend to get a like a bit of a darker amber color with your broad spectrum as opposed to a full spectrum which has all the other cannabinoids a little bit more of a heavy flavor even if you were to put it in a teacher we actually got some more of that stuff [Music] and this is where you do my creams isn't it this hashing that used that measures out the creams and fills our little airless jars this is where everything goes down this is the Boojum lab removing fats lipids that's right here that we're pulling off all my dad's yeah my goodness and we haven't done color Remedios [Music] it's fantastic cold oh yeah requires cold for the chemical process the require is cold in order to get the the fats and the CBD to separate they form a pretty strong bond and put it through a short cop unit and extract before winterization a lot of those fats are all going to collude with the CBD so in order to take co2 oil and remove those fats it's a three step process so you do it once the room temperature take it down cold filter it again take it to a smaller micron taking it and folder down to around negative 65 degrees in a while music these are all waiting for sociation Wow thanks to the tour of the lab and this is where you do the THC remediation yep talk to me about this screen yeah so this is a flash from at ography you know from bio todd if we were to go take a look at it you want to look at 3d take a second what are we seeing here so these are all different cannabinoids at these different various Peaks so we have to go in and we have to actually separate those so this is a first pass separating out the CBD and the CBD which collude together and then the THC and CBN which go together and then we'll do another pass which creates even more separation between the tea to make sure we're at zero and non-detect levels so this gets your CBD safe this is what keeps it below the legal limit and non-detectable if that's where the customer wants right correct yes", "3G-7XwYV6ls": "of this material we used is about 90% of CBD and 0.3 of THC or less because we know how to sometimes during the shock of this relation that each C can rise up and we know how to deal with it that TG will never go up and we know how to clean this up which steps you are removing that hitting those technologies so and also with this bucket you see we can do it like remove the THC from here and this is this is now a 78% of CBD we can make it it will be having 90 percent of CBD and the THC will stay as it as long as it is so 0.19 and it is so simple things so easy that I just cannot tell you now because everybody will know it it's so easy point 0 points 9 0 1 1919 so less than 0.2 my customers eagerly to have that yeah I know it", "jitbOekk6bk": "you so this first portion can be very slow we just want to make sure we get nice and easily over the stretch the band [Music] well we're pulling out a whole mess of aromatics we're not going to see much activity we want to make sure we're chasing with our one in Class B manual as we increase the temperature it's basically increasing its so as like a thermal mass inside of the classic heats up it's going to overshoot the minute so we just want to chase it so it's a [Music] good bit of action so I think right now it's probably predominantly moisture maybe secondarily a little bit and as more collects will definitely be able to see that based on you know the oil in water theory seeing which of the piles will be increasing now I'm looking to make sure that you'll see a little bit of I guess splash right here but just making sure that no just because I want to minimize the actual functional contamination I'm looking for activity down here to match we're currently at 110 degrees Celsius on the side of our blank plots and the interesting thing is we're actually seeing a peak indicative of something called fool's gold we can actually clear through this both both feet right now before we could turn main body and that's actually one of the ways that we'll be able to tell that we're in main body made bodies what's that mean really hello I mean I can't believe I'm a complete 172 Sweden stuff where I start together it's me your transition without ground like pushing in portions of convincing and the left-hand side shows nothing which makes sense so you can see our distillation a lot of activity so over here we're definitely getting a lot more likes these are things that would be traveling through the vapors dream pass this freaking dense station point so these are going to be like you know like terpene slash so what I'm looking for is eating off the condenser and evaporating off all of the heads that come in contact and then as the mains start to make their way into the vapor stream I want to watch those when we condense that's a pollutant in the condensing wall whatever had to make in there from vaporizing staying in the vapor stream and ending up here this inevitably once we're into mains on this sensor will see a cannabinoid piece we'll get into and then we'll see on the right the latter end of our interaction I guess we'll see the appearance mains around 170 seventies and then we'll probably cracked open you know result depending but you know we'll see we'll see why the tables come through luckily we can see it's basically going to assist in the promotion of the I guess low to mid weight mid molecular weights to get basically pushed room the flax it's like almost like you're nearly it's definitely the only a good bit of that thing that's continuing down the stream and then this first activity getting a little bit so we're not finishing up to 170 a little bit switch over to dry spell pump that's been provided for us and then run it back to the last ramp of heads into means [Music] whoa now you've got like straight-up hamburger now which also makes sense here 170 170 give it a good well we just turn that sweet box so that means a hands no they're not dropping the name [Music] also I think it's boiling pot sustain and for curious no there's nothing like you're not look out to see candle it's like real you're basically seeing the same thing that we've been seeing our time we saw the cannon with a little wild with its resting on the side of the tube right now so for 16 18 be progressive and employed better are gone like there is there is some compensatory things intentional and that's the way to that oh yeah we went to drop back down in temperature we're going back up if you had just kept going long on it usually but you can actually see this stuff you would actually see Adam tuning the temperature back a little bit bring it in five minutes I can find it to make sure yeah you're getting a little bit the make body right now like you mean the lottery now that's just because yeah that thing's it's just it's just never actually washing out the old hand in the lines now finally we're actually gonna love an actor and we're approaching 1/7 is it is very satisfying once you are into the mains though because it's literally one of the best it gives me a lot of ease of operation ease of training instead of being like okay see this striation that you like okay this is you can don't look so worried does to be I'm not seeing any so we're guys so we actually might be a little bit him a lot of 460 like I said looks like but that's why I'm saying more down mommy also look at how much your poor technique is going CPI and your game for Coco's poor Cody and regrets variation voluntary center needs except for seeing like everything going we got mine right now I was seeing those both with CBD indicator the bads indicator and cortical all it's going through this thing right now know somewhat I expect to see is that all that other crap that's like basically in the system when we wearing re excellence ebony like this is basically all this stuff just what expectancy is this this this probably to actually go down a bit I don't know so yeah what we would expect to see hopefully so we're going to see this go up and these to fall down but we're not going to see that until after we open this valve like let's be open this valve after we clear this out that we're gonna see eventually the middle peak go down and everything else stay here and we're gonna see this just get a lot of the poor sakes Marvel Nestle doesn't want to see we're City on this and then everything else do everything Louise want to see their daily up there it is I guess you can see those striations striations are you doing something along the lines of ripples or waves so it's going to be change in density variations so the significantly more dense cannabinoid and or heads I just bumped it to 176 just so we can start actually pushing into and pushing into me burn me like we're pretty much in your past your heads right now we're just about yeah we're hoping that this this 460 pica is up right she helped me to see the other stuff drop down I'm not sure we're gonna see drop guns I bet you are actually Co evaporating all this stuff and then it's gonna all of this still until we get some more action but you see that reports it to me gate that's it keep going up in relation to the other piece so we're definitely looking for I guess increase in the 460 feet get increasing resolution of the 460 feet and decrease in its shoulders Oh we would hope especially that 410 feet and step four 10 is it is going down but it's not going down by a long right now and I think it's because look I'm like you could literally see me mad giggling pigs that being said baloney opens you want to try it not like so what we're at quite two-month-old we're at 200 Mike Maronna you like try it yet let's start it look right there it's not fortunate it's going through the mean mine hooking rootsy like a slip of the [ __ ] are made by classy and everything or you know going to travel with something that's not oxygen pretty much there I think you're pretty much there too it doesn't look like that's going to be the flames are let's get that burst the ocean is it's gonna go flowing without all the oxygen nitrogen whatever is in that surround bump up straight up yeah look you want to open that everything that's in there but definitely sneezing I mean a good thing yeah look at a single I think mostly your 468 so I think we're just ever being a lot that 410 yeah that's nice for safety we want to see and on the right hand working change I - you can see less about 410 feet you know they portend that shoulder in the hunting maybe that's it starting to go more and more business happenings now we're actually seeing less scuff the line we're still thinking about the mannequins and the word end which I guess you think that probably disappearing underlining no I think that we just got like pretty much almost only that 460 we got a little bit important in there but that's not a matter you are getting more for tenant left leg look at the record salivating oh girl I see we had so most of the can't go it's going here and then now everything a drop not signal to the horizon before 10 which is great come are saying basically no for 10 on this side the only thing that mean out of this talking about like a month things and names but what you eat your tails are gonna see that meat for 16 it's gonna start moving for 500 okay but I prediction is that was when you're in your calcium that's the first movement we can definitely push a little faster we 13 Lister signal for dropping because problem that we see the signal start increasing with oceans recently that's problems is the signal increase motive means we see no change we got some murder latest movie sit here for the rest of the time a guy I'm honestly the the best operator right now in the practice finder like saying we're doing everything by this day is pretty much the same I made sure now you want to see a little bit higher but honestly like good body issues good same thing throughout it's the same throughout my specially you're convincing you're happy this position kind of sucks for hot tag come here I'll show you you see how much globe we have right there that's why it sucks you see how much flow we're getting right here if you went to you look at this look at how much pulley right there that's why we like this position I mean isolation valve makes us somebody flash transfers without having to deal with a bunch of crap this is kind of the essence of hot convincing right here is we have all of our means you know I can Avenue up to this point moving down traveling down here passing our first time tune right here that's where you can see this can happen on peak weathering for city just a little shoulder a heads there that now condensing out here and this is not this is basically what can't condemn sin this high temperature this is 174 and the condenser and it's pushing everything past directly into second ball very much very valuable I think I guess for now or based on the in stasis only in the sense where the other things we're gonna be altering are the temperature is the actual condenser great fraction finder currently is primarily stagnant just because we don't have much blow bias we don't have much I guess at this point it's just because I want to make sure well I guess we wait for it up until this point it's because I was wanting to make sure that I wasn't getting a little off into the heads class I'm seeing a little bit of burn cannabinoid coming down in here and like kind of making what was the snot layer straddle it going through this little adapter that you guys provided us and I also saw an increase on the right fraction find here at 469 readers right there so the 460 peak from significantly drier and now it's reputed or I guess employed through a period now it's kind of sticking after but it reappeared because we ended up pushing a little too fast when they ramped up musically condenser so the people on the background so we can definitely assure that this is a pretty live demonstration of what's going on in here because this is the highly non viscous high-temperature cannabinoid sector that's coming down you're like actively flowing into this flask right so we see a good bit of activity you can see even just the condemned condensing reins right there like I mean it's not super hard shipping this is first passed and soju ticket best minis not a big deal what we're doing so like I'm telling you look look here's where he gives like 5 to name which are left and now we're like 5 years we're like shift into tails right now we're in the bill to transition I mean I bet you if I go it's the peak intensity to rising so the intensities rising over time but CBD CBD in the care that we use that just in case ever going to tales and we've been in tail sense for actually we could have pulled like if this was a true run where we were not doing the secondary polish you could pull like 10 minutes ago and you would have actually had like some really really nice first pass and just pushes all that away from the pump also make sure that you close that line back so you want us to go back but no look so like you can actually see it like real obvious now zip me think about we still had some Mane's right here so it just we get the second pass in tomorrow they'll give you dude we are working through our finals now we have about 100 we got a whole bunch of color in here yeah very doable or indicative of tails if you come on down here you can see it the path passing our second fraction finder which is visible on our second screen and you can see the actual beds and striations down in the flats here so you got heads tails and if you look at the fraction finder which we're gonna see here is pretty traditional tails you're gonna see shifted to the right Peaks oh you're your campaign Authenticator is now shifted there right which is you know your tails indicator mostly you actually see this very big 5:30 peak because there is some lipids in this crude and you actually see a chlorophyll peak because since we're at a higher volume point right see a lot more chlorophyll coming through our system right here like small little bumps on this very large tails background and this is a very like it's inside the tail end the tails you get very large tails background right now no it'll end up main bodies will be a screenshot of that act I mean we'd have a whole lot of blow-by so what screaming - the same thing that we perceive the last like sense the end of heads actually but it was extremely helpful for the member and even up tweet and you can see your shifted like 20 30 nanometers actually zoom in you can see that you're like shifted a a good bit now from where you were you can see that you have a small little bump for your form 462 peers from CBD in here but you get this huge broad background peak and you ITC of 530 bombs underneath this broad background people just roll up its feet and that's like I gotta bury in you can indicative tail all right past distillation of the CBD dominant first past history we finished yesterday offer CBD dominant through from our so we're at five Cs for the class we're eating up the condensers we're a hundred thirty one see ya - sweet bell just to see if we're getting any so far obviously nothing no activity we shouldn't see pretty pretty hot you know they're at 140 Celsius so we are actually honoring the convention that we are on the boy the class so whatever is boiling in volatilizing off in the flask and then going through there's no chance of making it through this condensing and it's getting recognized right after it shows we're going into through star than it's pretty slow we did not free winterize for free scrub or really do much of anything there was like no solid dude there was literally no free process whatsoever it was solely with impurities in our main three we it kind of seems like a little bit you know that's a good demonstration as to why are condensing is approachable because you can dial in your temperatures at least in a rough capacity during your heads fraction and then why it is affecting because nothing except our cannabinoid portion kenri condense in high temperatures after now we're just we get a bunch of bullcrap real quick just as it actually has to flow through and start actually sending out a little bit I mean so we just got like a reservoir that's like dumping over that Center I'm just saying base like there's some CBD signal right there with signal received actually sink pre much the same thing that we saw yesterday which kind of means ever gain the same heads out that we got yesterday also you can kind of her coiling a little bit to reflect to a lot of CBD in this and also we see a lot of 3r sorry for 68 contractions velocity V so if you want to look up and here you can actually see the straight line of cannabinoid is CBD rolling down the condenser and stuff and that's right here at this threshold is past the point where it's no longer being heated to 160 Celsius and the heads can be condensed so bring it a mixture of heads and maids right here Vinson coming down has this sensor which is giving us the reading both if you notice it looks like the port 10 ish peak is actually kind of raising an intensity to the 465 it's pretty much the same right now you still have a lot of this the CBD that was in that system and so do you look in here see the reflux on the tip of the tip of the grenade right here yeah it is definitely much more clear than any of the yellow that is being presented down there so one thing you can do is since we are reporting to data you could actually pull it up later it's like that for 10 peak is on the same level as the 468 puts the overlay which if you come over the black like it was below 246 feet so yo we're often near these now getting more than heavy eggs like the actual camera that's nice you can see like real good so like that for 60 peak is like hella it's not super high and if we're not talking about like huge variations we're talking about change into 4 degrees Celsius but I'm saying like that's the thing we can see you're just relative concentration changes in like 4 degrees Celsius in line right now does it look like we have definitely increased our heads volume significantly well we had initially crested over 165 the mantle ran up to 168 so the overlay is actually looking at closer to 160 like threshold on 166 167 and then it dropped back down where 164 in system coming back up to 165 so it's just significantly drop number one the flow rate of all the heads Mane's mixture we were getting and then it also significantly dropped the amount of means that we're getting into our heads so if you come in here check out the fraction finder the peak on the right is gonna be our main speaker and I guess the outside shoulder right there and the peak all the way to the left is our head speed and this is the current so we have significantly dropped the concentration of Mane's and significantly increased the ratio of heads I'm just gonna keep working through this head fraction so we really inevitably see that heads line hopefully go down or at least a similar intensity while they can have it away peak drops and then we'll start pushing me to the last part of heads and finish off main strong I definitely learned a lot from Hobbes yeah I mean future 4200 been really good resource but I think just like individual scientists like Hobbes have been really really really good at I guess pioneering all of this or everyone else in the industry and they got really glad that I was able to apply a lot of you know his another's research to CBD I guess it's something even I guess remotely novel but it's nothing new and I'm really glad to use you know information for others and they try to come up with something it's extremely valuable for pretty much every walk of the Shore craft life it's really you know if you can secondarily refine product that you are already trying to separate on the primary why why not take that as an option it's really the only thing to pay attention to with hot condensing is making sure that you have five passing you're convinced but you always want to have it acting as a condenser for your mains you just don't want anything else to coconuts with it really really good at boosting boosting purity as we're approaching means and we're pushing more vapor inevitably through the system itself we're going to have much more I guess momentum or kinetic energy to push the compounds it'll still be trapped in the vapor phase farther down the line but currently I just turned up the condenser heat five more degrees just to start pushing this sweatband farther down the line into and past our inevitable veins collection point so the goal of hot condensing will be to have all of our liquid mains fraction come through here and condense as a liquid from the vapor phase while keeping it just high enough energy for all of the impurities and follicles that would inevitably Co condense with a colder condenser to stay in the vapor phase and push past just past where our collection means is sure we don't turn it up too high because I'll be able to cool it functionally after else we actually start pushing mains look in the flask right here we still got a good bit of material to work through which is song into means now for tension yeah hiring using the forty six feet yeah oh actually next so we should see an increase in the 462 the portal for energy also say that correlate expect to see more condensing into the top center which at this point there's a small little Street we're seeing some drippy trips I actually just watching the drippy drips so yeah you've seen the port 16 degrees to the portent just ever so slightly right now it's like it's Plateau it's like a little bit now used to be like they're on the same level not just ever so slightly higher and I can't wait to stuff this process meet the girl a bit different actually using the ratios yeah at least to just you know like because we're still getting a good bit of hazing recollection down here so I didn't want to correct it and see if this is the 460 go ahead nip just cracking so slowly and you want to actually increase the pressure there I think I mean you're gonna have a leak rate right now here that's fine I mean you're not gonna see it on this fact what fails then actually do you look at that look at nag you're getting less for 10 more for 60 on this side I mean that does have a significant and unless 410 like look you're getting barely any 410 now little tiny side bump as opposed to being the mass dominant key and now it's going on on the right fraction I mean you're probably just looking like the fluids that were flowing through things that were built up right here like pop troops at the vacuum I just got like okay so now you see a lot more than 410 because most of the like the cannabinoid like the 460 which is let the CBD indicator is going to this class but you can see right here like right here that's 460 it's a little bit 410 in there and smidge so it'll look nicer if I see a whole blast of it I mean we're getting better flow we're getting about two or three times the drip you're seeing here this is just a consistent pusher it's all just running down this line then that actually might be why we lost some signal too because it's now running down this portion and then probably making its way down to here pushing in are we are pushing for 60 now yeah she's she's working through a reading section I just continued to turn down the condenser now we're set to 125 see yeah so predominantly we're just making sure that our condenser is cooling and if to keep up with the amount of I guess vapor phase cannabinoid later that we want to reconvince into the condenser and then consecutively into our mains class excuse oh we're making our way through we have almost a leader in our maids looks good no striations good color we're gonna hold it here for a little bit until the condenser cools down just a little bit more we want to see this condensation line you guys push it back a little bit just so that we can make sure we have the allowance needed to push it farther on this end we're getting a lot of like early recompensation in here like streaking of the cannabinoids down the column and then you're seeing that even still here like at the end right there you're seeing drops appear and recondense from the vapour line clear section as well so as the condenser cools it will move that line back basically just assure us that we're not missing and yeah reconvince and cannabinoid past our collections were transitioning tails that's what that is on the left hand side on that and on the range effort in there the up tech at the end is always what means that you're following details if you notice the 460 feet is now like not I mean it's still pretty prevalent but we're seeing like a shitload of this 510 right here and you see a 530 which is the lipids progressing any chlorophyll trees that we've left it all on the tails flats from the last class but like 510 that little bump right there and that's not a huge focus because vit did a pretty good job of making sure we got most the tails I yesterday that 510 is basically what you're not you don't want that and that was this big blob goes through here and I see a big increase and a lot of this stuff that's the tails right there that's like what happens woods want to get like straight wings tail super second piece yeah you see I do everything shifted to the right how I keep saying like you'll see that peach ship to the right well if you're doing like traditional high speed not not convincing like that becomes super obvious in lines imagine it you're not condensing everything and letting it fall to the secondary line or like another like you know you're not keeping everything in a vapor okay wait you're condensing everything zone like Europe main Tosca you just see that shift that you just saw in real-time but that was crazy how much you saw that [ __ ] pretty wild we ran this whole dad thing you can see the big tails clubs that were coming through at the end so basically that like little indicator up that's basically like this thing being able to take that peat shift better than your I can wow do you look know that's the lipids right there you see how much lipids like actual bands just straight fats or coming it's crazy because it's just you just have like a big glob of tails that ran through at the very end of this thing that then Adam heat gun basically just to make it go through and look at how this goes through like how this actually evolved on the fraction finder and what you basically saw was this was before we keep getting through the tails and you just watched everything just march to the right as we went through basically by degraded cannabinoids to lipids to like straight waxes and some of the heavier colorants like you can actually see the chunk the front part is known for delta-9 like that's what our expertise has been and you know coming up here and actually working I have a farm doing like a CB dis CBB distillation is great it's invaluable like we can show people how to make really good clean CBD oil with the fraction finder with you know even the added complex speeds up how do you do hotness like how good things can make it so you can get really pure all right there are more variable and I mean this answered a lot of questions about hot condense again just standard CD distillation in general free money just a lot of ranges yeah any of us have the total definition and clarity of it kind of nuclear to make", "viV5KZCIbpY": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "pW66iiVNJtY": "hey guys it's Nick with precision here and today I wanted to talk to you guys about the fundamentals between co2 and solvent based extraction what we want to talk about is the fundamentals of the solvent we're gonna start with co2 so co2 typically in the atmosphere as you guys probably well know is a gas right it's all surrounding us everywhere but in order to make it a solvent it needs to go into what's called subcritical or supercritical phase right and what happens with a supercritical phase is you're compressing and you're heating that gas in order to make it into a fluid form right so typically called supercritical fluid extraction or and if it's at the lower end of that range sub critical fluid extraction now this technology has been around for years right it's been used in coffee it's been used in vanilla types of artisanal extracts it's really really good for decaffeination they use it in dry cleaning right so the technology has been around and about 10 years ago when cannabis really started getting large and people started looking towards cannabis extracts they said hey why don't we try this supercritical co2 so the history of the solvent is that it's been used very widely and people look to repurposing it into the cannabis industry right which they started to do maybe you know eight nine years ago and it started to really get big about six or seven years ago right so all these supercritical co2 applications popped up for cannabis specifically and when you look at the fundamentals of the solvent right the the difference between co2 and a different solvent like hydro carbon or ethanol is co2 doesn't do a great job at actually extracting the cannabinoids right so you've got your your cannabinoid structure that's contained within your trichome right and your trichome is a a mushroom like shape on the outside of the leaf of the plant right and that's what contains all your goodies that you you know your turf beans your your CBD your THC your cbn your CBG all those things are contained within that mushroom trichome structure right so what we want to do with the solvent of any kind is dissolve that structure right and isolate those molecules now supercritical co2 can do this right but it's a very weak solid so if you think of a solvent and you think of a molecule like like a Lac on one side and a key on the other you want to find the perfect key that goes into the lock and you're kind of sliding it in there you're turning that turning that lock and that that that door is opening right away right now with supercritical co2 it's kind of similar to trying to jam a screwdriver into the lock right it's going to work right but it takes a lot of a lot of power a lot of pressure right which is why you see these systems that operate between 1,500 to 5000 psi and because of the nature of the solvent right the solvent has to be repeatedly passed over that trichome structure right so we're continuously passing this this solvent that doesn't have great solubility with cannabinoids and with that trichome structure of the plant over this plant in order to get our goodies out so to speak right so that's why co2 units have a long cycle time typically what you're gonna see is anywhere between on the very low end to hours which will diminish your yield and diminish your your returns on your actual processing and you're also going to see longer cycle times the more material that you put in there generally right so these can be manipulated in a number of different factors a lot of the co2 companies have drastically improved upon the old days you know the old days it was eight hours per run right they've improved that by running things like subcritical running things like a higher pressure sometimes up to 5,000 psi but it doesn't change the fundamentals of the solvent right the solvent is is is not the best key for our lock in order to get those cannabinoids and those those chemicals out of the plant that were that we're desiring right so that is a fundamental overview of why co2 technologies aren't as applicable now when you look at the equipment side of co2 right obviously it stands to common sense that if you got to have something that's going up to you know 1,500 2,000 5,000 psi right you can imagine at scale it's simply not economical or feasible in order to have those technologies at scale right because if you think about a gigantic vessel that needs to go to 5,000 psi right think about the amount of engineering that to go in there the shell thickness the the valve the safety precautions right obviously when you're working at those types of pressures there's a fundamental safety concern now if it's properly engineered equipment of course the machines operate safely there's not a thorough history of accidents or things like that but that it takes more dollars right which is why dollars two dollars when you're looking at co2 equipment the equipment is actually quite a bit more expensive than solvent based right so what really happens with with with all this total scenario right as you start weighing out all these variables between co2 and solvent based against the equipment against how how you're going to scale what's right for your business how you're going to apply these technologies to your end products right and that's a lot of what we do here at precision is we we look at our client's needs we understand what it takes for an end-to-end process to integrate and that's part of what differentiates our company is that you know we our end-to-end process integrators not just somebody that's gonna sell you a piece of equipment and walk away right so so what I'd like to do is really is compare that with you know the the fundamentals of solvent based extraction now right and when we talk about solvents we'll talk about the three most popular which would be butane propane and ethanol there's a lot of other solvents out there that work there's a lot of other solvents that that may come into play in the future but we're gonna focus around the primary three that are that are used today in the cannabis and hemp industry and we'll talk about how those apply more readily to large scale especially in CBD production and hemp production so on the other side of this coin I want to talk about solvent based extraction right I want to talk about how it compares with co2 specifically so let's go back to our lock and key analogy right our lock and key analogy is we want to find the the perfect key to go into the lock right and on this side is our molecule that we're trying to extract and on this side is our key our key is our solvent right and we've not found generally a better key in the history of extraction over the last decade or so then butane and propane right so butane and propane are nonpolar solvents with light boiling point right and what that's going to yield is it's going to it's going to go in there it's gonna bind to all of your cannabinoids or terpenes and the desirable aspects of the plant right so if you ever look at our teas '''l type of products most of them are made with butane and propane right you get that really beautiful light color that terpene rich smell right which is very very applicable to artisanal cannabis markets and it's also very very applicable to moderate scale right different types of manufacturing and making different products right now we start to make a little bit of a paradigm shift right because butane and propane as most of you probably well know are flammable solvents right so and they also contain a little bit of pressure which means it costs a little bit more money to engineer the equipment right the shell thicknesses on the equipment have to be a little bit thicker but not like co2 right at co2 we're talking about 5000 psi butane and propane we're talking about anywhere from 50 to 150 psi so much much lower pressure is much safer working environment over all right but we want to keep these vapors contained so they're not ignitable right and you want to stay in a class one division one room and take all these proper safety precautions now our company has done thousands of installations of hydrocarbon equipment across the entire world at this point and we can we can honestly say that I think we're experts in hydrocarbon extraction and we understand that hydrocarbon actually does pull the best terpene profile the best cannabinoid profile out of the cannabis plant however at large scale you can start to see where the actual hurdles come in so to speak right so now how do i process you know 2,000 pounds a day with hydrocarbon on a large scale it starts to get very costly and very engineering heavy let's call it right because you have to have all of these different vessels everything has to be under pressure everything has to be class 1 division 1 rated right so it's not really feasible for for large-scale CBD extraction or large-scale hemp extraction and what we like to usually say is is you know if you're an artisanal brand that means you're processing about a thousand pounds of input biomass per day or less right once you start crossing over that threshold the cost of engineering the equipment the cost of the redundancy and the batch equipment and and the cost of the hydrocarbon equipment becomes prohibitive right and it's why you see a large trend towards ethanol so let's talk about ethanol from a from a chemical standpoint for a minute right so going back to our lock and key method ethanol is also a very good key for our lock right but the problem with ethanol is because the polarity of the solvent it's an extremely polar solvent right so the extremely polar solvent yes it will bind to our cannabinoids and our terpenes the problem is is that it's also going to bind to chlorophylls and to other water-soluble or undesirable compounds within the plant now traditionally what everyone has done to combat both those water soluble molecules are those chlorophylls is they've chilled their ethanol down so those of you that are watching this video that are experienced you may very well know if you run your ethanol at negative 40 or below generally you're you're able to bypass a lot of the chlorophylls you're able to bypass a lot of the a lot of lipids and the phosphide profiles right things that are going to gum up your process downstream right but the problem is is that how do you chill now all this ethanol on a massive scale so we're in a different a different era now so to speak right how do we use ethanol a scale for CBD that we're doing 10,000 pounds a day well it comes down to properly engineered equipment right it comes down to proper mass balance it comes down to proper post processing procedures where you need an end to end in engineered solution which is what we've done with our KP D Series right so it's not just pouring ethanol over plant matter right there's refinement of the product there's variabilities in the biomass there's there's all sorts of things that are coming down the pipeline right that affect your yield they affect your your distillate quality they affect your crystallization right all these different variables that you need to have a thorough understanding of right so processing at scale it can be done you just need to have an understanding and a strong team that understands all these variables and how to combat but from a from a fundamental standpoint of scaled extraction ethanol is fantastic because you don't have the pressures there's absolutely zero vapor pressure which means none of your vessels are under pressure you're not operating under pressure it has significantly less flammability than then hydrocarbon and it's significantly safer than co2 and the fact that it's not pressurized right and people like ethanol because they know most of us go out to the bar every Friday and Saturday night and drink it right we ingest it it is a relatively safe solvent generally recognized as safe from the FDA so let's let's talk about an overview of the common misconceptions that come with solvent based extraction right people tell you all you extract with a solvent you extract with butane or propane you're gonna have residual butane and propane in your product that's absolutely not true so what happens is once the product is extracted there may be trace amounts of butane and propane but it goes through a heating and purging process right typically that's done either in vacuum drying ovens or in decarboxylation or in distillation right that's going to remove that solvent and there'll be zero parts per million of any sort of residual solvent right same thing with ethanol ethanol is a little bit harder to take off because it has a higher boiling point right it's not as volatile doesn't make Verizon's easy but the same thing right it's going to be pulled off and decarboxylation or in in distillation and it's ironic because a lot of the people that that preach anti solvent extraction right there in the CBD market and they realized once they get to crystallization that they're forced to use pentane H pentane is a group D hydrocarbon and you know needs to be purged needs to be dealt with in the class one division one room needs to have all these parameters so again understanding your process and and working with really I could say educated people not believing a lot of the marketing hype that's out there because everybody wants to sell you equipment but in the end of the day do they know how to integrate your process and and do they really understand the science of what's happening behind the process and have they done it before did they have a long operational history so these are things that I would definitely you know ask the people that here that you're potentially doing business with a lot of what we do here with our R&D team is that we test these processes we test new parameters we're working on ways to optimize the extraction process you know our company while we're an equipment manufacturer where a process integrator but we always focus as an innovative technology company right so we're always looking at disruptive disruptive technologies what's going to change in the future market trends what's going to happen to these markets how do we get the scale for lower cost and we look at all these variables and that all starts on the bench right which you guys can see the lab behind me we work with our team very closely and we're always working to find a more efficient more effective process right while still being able to integrate the existing processes and making them work really well right so I thank you guys for listening today you know you can shoot some comments below or shoot us an email give us a call if you have questions we're happy to help and we've got a large staff that can that can help you guys out and thanks for watching the video appreciate it [Music]", "mdQq-gVtids": "what's up this Bam Margera here and you're watching venom 4/20 right back that's a weed station I don't smoke weed how do you know it is 4/20 what the [ __ ] think of me well no I'm dumb hello I'm Benna 4:20 and today we're gonna be looking at how to dab CBD isolate the things you're gonna need are gonna be some CBD isolate torch banger dab rig you're gonna need something to scoop up the CBD isolate so either some type of dab tool or a little scoop you're gonna need a carb cap a q-tip or I actually like to use fold it up a paper towel some rubbing alcohol always helps to have a thermometer to know exactly what temperature you're doing things first thing you know wanna do is warm up your Bangert if it's glowing red-hot you're going probably close to a thousand degrees easy so give it some time to cool down if you have a nice thick banger like this one is it might take like 30 seconds or so I say the optimal temperature is right around 600 to 700 degrees somewhere in between there we're gonna say hi to the Panda where's my cat Pandora and we're good so we'll go ahead and grab a scoop here like that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] nice and the stuff I got that tastes like pure it's a sweet like sugar or something then you're just gonna want to take a like I said I have a little paper towel I just like to kind of tighten up and fold up and I ducked it in some rubbing alcohol already you just wipe it out like that and you were good to go so that's basically all there is that was a nice low temp one I did there I mean it was not harsh at all tastes amazing the benefits to dabbing CBD are awesome I absolutely love having this stuff around really good for anti-anxiety it actually makes you really relaxed it's good for pain relief for sleeping it has a lot of the medicinal qualities of like smoking a bowl except for you don't feel stoned at all it also tastes amazing it's enjoyable to smoke as well plus I have a lot of friends who don't like to dab something don't even like to smoke pot and is really fun taking dabs with them like it's [ __ ] awesome I would highly recommend it like I said I will always keep some CBD isolate around just to have I'm ever not feeling super cool like like I said I don't wish anxiety on my worst enemy so anything to combat that I am all for between that and having something that my non-smoking friends can dab with me that's just [ __ ] awesome I highly recommend you do your research and get it from a trusted company I got this from IHP refinery like this one from I HP comes with a [ __ ] lab testing and all that [ __ ] on each individual batch I mean make sure you know you're getting there's a lot of shiftiness in the branding of CBD products check out my video on CBD and I go kind of into detail about that way more otherwise I highly recommend it and I can't recommend this stuff enough like it tastes like [ __ ] you [ __ ] sugar dude it's crazy it tastes like [ __ ] amazing like dad and cotton candy or something it's great [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] anyway I'm venom 420 be sure to check out the Instagram check out other videos [ __ ] subscribe or don't I don't give up [Music] [Music]", "rgEezZKRToc": "[Music] [Music] [Music] Chris here with prism have this is our thin film white molecular distillation unit you can see we've got great output right now it takes a whole lot to dial this in and get it get it to rain like that but that's pure amber distillate coming out it's about 90% to 92% cannabinoids almost all CBD raining down and then collecting in our vessel here even though it drips a light yellow once it gets into the vessel a little bit of the reddish darkness will come out of it but this is some really magnificent flow Chris here with prism ham what we're doing right now is actually winterizing our crude what we do is we have a large Buechner funnel filtration system the material inside is around negative 50 Fahrenheit or about negative 45 Celsius you can see how cold it is it's actually creating frost on the outside of the class this here is a receiving flask we keep it this cold to help remove the fats and waxes through the top filtration element so when this is all done we will actually have a whole layer of fat wax this is how we separate our oil before we go into the later processing stages and in this case we use a super low solo freezer to help with that winterization Chris here with prism ham were right at the end of March 2009 2019 this is our rotary evaporator our 50 liter you can see this is what the material looks like going in its a bright amber color after heavy-duty filtration this is the column itself we open it up see it's sucks it right in under vacuum and that's CBD oil that will eventually be distillate we're reclaiming our ethanol there and we have our full system in place with our vacuum pump chiller and the whole works", "b44rkf89LII": "[Music] short fat distillation is almost the end of line in cannabis product manufacturing we have basic manufacturing of extracts and then we have distillation than you have chromatography and a high in analytics which tends also can go back in a distillation afterwards short path distillation has been shown to be an excellent solution in providing the maximum yield of the highest quality product and so we worked very closely with manufacturers in this industry and listen to what they had to say with a rotary evaporator without being able to control the cooling the rotary operator won't work it'll overheat and shoot the vapors right in the room so when you're running a rotary evaporator you're gonna have a hot bath a cold column and high vacuum without keeping that column cold the vacuum just going to pull vapor right through the system it's gonna rush out into the room the Pau science chillers that we supply with our customers are so heavy-duty that they never shift from a degree and they're able to keep the temperature on point every single time and they don't start going up in the middle of their run where vapour starts to escape the system they're able to control it and keep it all the way in the road about there are many areas in short craft distillation that require precise temperature control from heating the product to areas where you need a slight level of cooling of the product and then extremely low temperatures for the cold traps to maximize the longevity of your vacuum pumps and get the purest product possible so when the factors are making product a couple years ago even longer they were not aware of how clean you can make a product so in the process of distillation and even when the chromatography andrey distilling the product for purification we can remove a lot of the inactive compounds that serve you no therapeutic purpose when you're consuming cannabis there's parts of it there are therapeutic of the cannabinoids that are they're helpful in turbines and there's parts of the plant matter that's dissolved like fats waxes proteins lots of numerous things including bad flavor you can remove that and create a flavorless product that's very high in purity and actually clean and safe to consume if you're chiller is down you're not making money so people have really come to rely on poly science as a reliable solution that will maximize your yield and also keep your system up and running poly science allows us to control a lot of the equipment that's used in this process we have a lot of heat and a lot of cooling if those parameters are off you can be selecting different molecules or you could be having clogs in the system or you can be damaging your pumps so none of our equipment we manufacturer would be able to operate without cost nice choice [Music]", "8crfZn8fQaY": "[Applause] [Music] we'll be hearing from dr. alexei peshkov chief who

he will be educating us on water compatible cannabis extracts nano emulsions that's a sentence dr. al s alexei peshkov ski everyone [Applause] good afternoon and thanks for the opportunity to present for being here I'll be talking about what a compatible cannabis extract manner emulsions some people call them water soluble formulations I'll talk about their benefits and how to make them our business model is to enable our clients to make their own so you guys can do what you do best making the finished beverage products out of them there are many ways to deliver cannabis into the bloodstream everybody knows what those are we don't have to go through them but long story short you can eat it as an animal you can vape it dab it smoke it put it on your tongue in your eyes even rectal deliver exists you know all these different methods exist and perhaps a big reason for why these things coexist is that there's no clear winner so far where there hasn't been one every method has advantages and more importantly disadvantages so you kind of decide what you want to do but if you could just drink it like alcohol then why wouldn't you just do that nobody vapes alcohol nobody uses a rectal delivery for it you wouldn't put it under your tongue I mean I wouldn't put anything so with matter emotions you can basically do just that as most people by now already know so I agree with the previous speaker and others who basically think that it's gonna take over I also believe is going to take over there are some hurdles to overcome probably on the business side on the regulatory side but it's gonna happen and it's gonna take advantage of the entire culture so it's probably gonna be pretty big this is what a nano emulsion dosing looks like when it's properly made it's translucent so in this case it's 20 milligrams per milliliter cvd not a lot and you put it in water give it a swoosh it disappears into it it'll be stable it'll never separate it will not lose potency unless you expose it to UV light or something like that not an animal related stuff and then very importantly its translucent if you want it to be so you can make it that way you won't alter your beverage visually and it will give you the benefits by availability increase the onset time shortening and easy compatibility with beverages basically bringing it closer to what alcohol behaves like alcohol is fast it absorbs completely and everybody knows what to expect from it if you ate versus you didn't eat there is a difference but basically you know what a drink will feel like so narrow margins although they're not truly rigorously speaking water soluble formulations may be behaved as if they were so for all intents and purposes it's the same thing there are several types of water compatible formulations out there Macker emulsions are something that everybody knows about is when you use a basic surfactant phospholipids lecithin or something and use a basic mixer and just mix oil and water that way they make large drops they don't really give you all of these benefits maybe a little bit but they separate them so they don't really need to be considered it's not a product that you can really use micro motions are what the pharmaceutical industry used to use before they figure out nano modulus actually work better micro motions are it's an unfortunate choice of terminology Micro doesn't mean they're micron size they're actually nano sized and many people call them nano emulsions although it's incorrect the way they work is you need to use a lot of surfactant generally harsh surfactants so much that you change the properties of water and oil basically dissolves in that or you can create my cells which can swell with the oil going in in sight so it looks a bit like a nano motion but it just uses ten times more surfactant and the choice is limited so before there was an option to make nano emulsions the pharma industry used micro motions because it works but you have to be very careful with the surfactants and the regulations kick in and stuff like that now the difference between them and nano modulus the reason and our models can get away with using a lot less surfactant is that you will use mechanical energy some sort of on preferably an ultrasonic liquid processor that creates a lot of shear that will break the droplets apart mechanically and that doesn't stay in the product unlike the surfactants if you use the chemical action to do that right now in between the two there liposomes liposomes are great and many people call their formulation liposomal technically liposomes are for water in water formulations they have water on the inside you can see that there is a blue kind of interior that's water and outside there's also water and it has kind of like a biological cell it has a skin layer so the oils can go in there but the loading is low and so you can't really deliver a lot that way plus they're pretty difficult to make and the choice of surfactants also limited nano emulsions if you have the equipment basically let you avoid all of these drawbacks the amount of surfactants is a lot lower less than oil actually you can use very mild tasteless very compliant food grade surfactants to make them and they're not really difficult to make if you have the formulation so it is something we offer so if you go in in that direction no R&D is really required although I'll talk a little bit more about that basic components of nano motions are there's gonna be a carrier oil preferably about twice as much as your cannabis active that needs to be there for a number of reasons there is your bio active so Sheba DTC or whatever it doesn't even have to cannabis-related it just be a hydrophobic drug that you want to deliver you will need a surface active agent to stabilize it after it's made and aid in making it so those are surfactants most likely more than one we recommend using some preservatives for microbial stability something mild something food grade and a nano emulsion is there are many definitions of what is an animal and what's not a good one in my mind is the one that requires it to have medium draw the size distribution under 300 nanometers it turns out that at that level things become stable so nano emotions with let's say 250 nanometer g50 it's a common method of measuring the entire distribution that's the that means 50% of your material is in droplets below that size and 50 bar so when that is are about 200-250 the nano motions tend to be stable they don't separate anymore if you want them to be translucent then everything has to be below 100 nanometers it just so happens that at that level at that size they don't interfere with light so the light can travel unobstructed therefore you get progressive translucency and ideally for good level of translucency and complete transparency after dosing you want the formulation to be about 50 or below between 20 and 40 maybe 50 nanometers in d50 now we talked a little a little bit about this before it's worth mentioning that nano motions are not new the terminology might be new but nano emulsion formulations are very familiar the English breakfast tea is actually based on the distribution is exactly the same as what a good nano motion would be coffee McDonald's coffee is actually pretty nice and symmetric this is beer Corona beer it's it's kind of funny it's it has two nano Muslims and one it has really small droplets probably micelles of some sort surface active agent in a beer and then something around a hundred probably will extract so they have been around beyond that in order to bring nano Mullins in order to bring hydrophobic actives into your into your body into your bloodstream or any fats for that matter a body creates something called mixed micelles I'll mention them a little bit later mixed micelles are also kind of like a non emulsion of formulation internally produced by your body with the surfactants that are present in the small intestine phospholipids and bile salts so we are a carrier of manner modern technology even if we don't even if we don't know it this is what happens with the reduction of droplet sizes things become more translucent so when you're above a hundred nano motions our milky milk is a typical nano emulsion that is milky being milk then once you get under 100 you can see light going through it a little bit at 50 it's going through this is concentrated so once you dose it it'll be maybe slightly cloudy maybe not and then when you're below 50 things become practically transparent very quickly we have some samples another table 60 so I can show you how the dose it and what it looks like by availability so this is a huge question very important to answer it properly I'm not aware of any studies done specifically on cannabis that would demonstrate exactly what happens with the by availability as a function of droplet size but it has been done for many other bio actives for pharmaceutical agents and it seems that the the increase is roughly the same no matter what drug you are considering and that's probably because it's not about the drug it's about how you're going to deliver it so it's more of a property of the vehicle of delivery and in that sense we can make indirect assumptions about what it would be for the cannabis delivery so this is a very very good study they created a bunch of nano emulsions and measured the blood concentrations of our drug so it 400 nanometers you can see that you're about five times lower than you are at 25 nanometers so the bioavailability increase or at least the intensity increases about a factor of five compared to that but if you compare that with just straight oil it would probably be another increase of sorts so you can expect somewhere between five and seven some people claimed nine I think it's a bit ambitious I would stay with about five or roughly speaking the bioavailability increase compared to just straight oil as an arable for example delivery now a little bit about the mechanism we don't have to go through this whole thing but it it's important to talk about the the blue part I don't think I have a tweener the way I don't know anyway just look at where the the drops are the yellow drops and the blue background so when you consume an oil or fat it arrives in your small intestine as a big drop or maybe several big drops now at that point your body can't absorb it because it has to be at the wall of the small intestine but there is something called an stirred aqueous layer that goes along the walls so it has to be able to travel through water to get there and it can't because it's in the oil and it doesn't mix with water properly so your your body has a light basis basically enzymes that will digest the triglyceride oils making them able to travel but they have to have the surface to do so so what happens first is you have to emulsify it yourself in your small intestine before it can be properly digested so surfactants come in some phospholipids bile salts come in and there's some peristaltic motion of the small intestine which makes an emulsion as soon as that happens lipases can get in cleave the glycerine from the triglyceride or remove a couple of fatty acids so from triglycerides you'll be making free fatty acids and monoglycerides those get assembled with the surfactants into what's called mixed micelles and this is basically the whole point we don't have to go beyond that mixed micelles are small droplets of about 10 nanometers in size or so with some distribution that are water comparable they're not dissolved but they look like they are and they can travel through water and get to the absorption site get to the entire site cells after that they can get absorbed and then a couple of things can happen they can go into the lymphatic system or into the blood and we can get into that but I think for the purposes of today or at least for now this is all the explanation that we need the reason that edibles takes so long to kick in and after that they're so gradual and only build up to the highest intensity after four hours or so is that this process has to happen first and it's a very gradual and slow process and then for an hour there's nothing after that they start slowly coming in because some of the mixed micelles are made and they got to where they need to go more is being made so you are feeling it but more is coming in so it's not a flat it's not a jump it's not like having a beverage an alcoholic beverage and having the alcohol all come in at once it's gonna be very slowly coming in after an hour and a half two hours you probably think you've been taken up and you take another dose then you're probably in space you know following Apollo so and and if you don't then then you still have to kind of wait forever and you're never really comfortable because you pass your comfort level then it's too much and then it stays in you because the liver is getting rid of it but more is still in your small intestines still coming in so it's it's a mess but the beauty of the Nano emulsions are is that they are essentially mixed micelles once you drink that you don't have to do any post-processing internally they can just get absorbed which is what alcohol does kind of accept alcohol is even better it's really it doesn't need mixed micelles it's just the individual molecules traveling but it's close enough so you consume basically a predigested oil that's what it really comes down to so it acts really quickly and it goes in completely and all at once ten minutes one set or so depending on who you ask and if the eight or not and little things like that but maybe ten maybe five maybe fifteen or so goes up stays flat after three hours gone this is what we offer for people to be able to make these things themselves basically there are two pieces of the puzzle you need the high shear equipment to be able to create the droplets and you need the formulation with all the components that I mentioned before which we offer in this pre-mixed state which we call the Nano stabilizer it has the carrier oil and the surfactants everything is food grade everything is very compliant completely tasteless so if your extract has to taste we will not interfere with it we will not change it we will not remove it either so what you start with is what you get we don't do masking at this stage but you could so between these two things you don't really have to do any rnd it's it's a plug-and-play situation the system comes preassembled you don't really have to learn anything it's basically like a food processor you just have to know what to put and where and what ratios so we give you a description of what to do mana stabilizer removes the need to develop your own formulation but if you want to develop your information by all means we don't prevent you in any way from doing it we don't require you there's not a stabilizer it's just there for convenience and we suggest a ratio that we believe is a good ratio of nano stabilizer to your active ingredient to use but if you're willing to live with a slightly bigger droplet size a little bit more a little less translucency for many people it's okay depending on the dose and where it's going then you can use less nano stabilizer so you can play with costs and things like that but basically it's all done and we make it as easy as we can possibly make it for our customers to do it without them having to have any special background this is what a system looks like this is our medium system it can make up to 25,000 doses per hour so five liters of nano emulsion at 50 milligrams per milliliter if 10 mixes is your dose so that's 25,000 doses you can make in one hour that's not counting prep obviously and cleanup and all that just running time we have three levels of these systems so the the lab scale system LSP 500 that's for basic R&D it's not a production system then the medium scale system is been scaled production the one I mentioned our large scale system and we have some pieces of it here you can look at it make up to $100,000 an hour which is generally enough for even large companies this is what the process looks like basically the droplet size distribution evolution with time as you process so in this example 20 liters of nano emulsion at 20 milligrams per milliliter of CVD were made with the medium system the famous kill system and nano stabilizer and you can see that as the droplet size it starts above 100 and then it progresses all the way down to below 20 19 millimeters and you can see what happens with translucency it starts milky and as you go along it becomes translucent so in our system we incorporate a side glass so we recommend that you have one there that you can just watch what happens and while it's milky you need to keep going once your translucent to a certain degree you can stop otherwise if you were always milky you would have to use specialized equipment dynamic light scattering or something and that's pretty expensive with translucency luckily you can just see it you can also see if it's losing its stability I haven't seen a case where it would there's no reason why it should but if for some reason it did it would become cloudy because the droplets would grow so it's another kind of simple level of quality control obviously if you need real numbers then you have to measure it and we are now starting real bioavailability studies it's a slow process there's a lot of stuff to get through but we do have some volunteer data where they would just be reporting high how high they feel what would they feel based on four different formulations so the first two the red one and green one is basically inedible or similar to an arable it's MCT oil with 10 milligrams of THC consumed by five volunteers in a capsule so we make sure that it got swallowed properly and the difference between them is the fed versus fasted state so the red line is a fasted State so empty stomach and you can see that well there was a delay but it try go in just the intensity was really low so the red line kind of it wants to go up but then it just kind of doesn't on an empty stomach edibles don't really work very well edibles might because the edible itself will have the oil but if you just consumed cannabis in a capsule it for us we would just need a much bigger dose the bioavailability of doing it that way is extremely low so we allowed people to eat after two hours and you can see what happened it went up and then I was already going down and to nothing and then once they ate it actually kicked in and it became a normal edible on a full stomach the Green Line by the way is what happens on a full stomach there's a delay after two hours it starts really coming in at Peaks at four as expected so if you start it on an empty stomach at an eight it kind of goes into that and also so it's hanging out waiting for food it's trying to go in but it can't without the oils and fats now with nano amalgams not only do you get higher intensities although intensities are not really fair to compare here because it's just self-reported high it's really not a very solid number but you can judge the onset of action it's very quick and in in our experiments we were actually surprised to notice that it doesn't even really matter if you ate or not so the blue line is fasted it goes in very efficiently very quickly lasts for a couple hours and then is gone on a full stomach the onset time is just a little bit slower and it's probably due to gastric emptying so things don't really get absorbed through the stomach they just don't the alcohol does a little bit but oils don't they need to be in a small intestine so one if you ate the food is sitting there and waiting and starting to empty into the small intestine and it happens on stages so that probably creates a bit of a delay once it's there it goes in quickly but the reason that the lines are different and we're gonna study this in detail is probably because once if you are absorbed on an empty stomach you go into the blood and then the to deliver the bioavailability is probably a bit lower the area under the curve is clearly lower and that's because you first go into the liver what you see it's a little more complicated I mentioned this before because you make hydroxy eleven as a first metabolite and you liver and that has its own psychic activity so things get a little bit complicated but if you do have food in in in you first that creates something called chylomicrons in your entire site cells in the absorption cells in the small intestine and those channel cannabinoids into the lymphatic system that goes around the liver so there is just more cannabis available to you and it lasts longer and still after four hours approximately it's over so in that way it kind of mimics an alcoholic beverage except a bit in Reverse so alcoholic beverage replacement manufacturers should have that in mind take it into account because on an empty stomach alcohol hits you more and I don't know if it lasts longer but that I always feel like it does on a full stomach you don't feel it as much and it's kind of like more manageable and I think it lasts less with cannabis it's it's the opposite you're gonna need to know that and with this thank you for your attention and thank you you", "sDho7zOsSNY": "hi today we're gonna talk about how to use the 99% CBD crystals [Music] now there are many ways to do it you can eat it you can vape it or you can mix it with other ingredients and we're gonna show you today how to eat it and how to mix it with other ingredients such as a carrier oil hemp seed oil or coconut oil and we're gonna try to make a recipe so that when you do it at home you know exactly what to do and how much you use of what so if you want to eat the crystals it's a kind of simple situation you just take a spoon mmm and putting them out I used to hold on to my tongue as long as I can and let it just dissolve now today we're gonna mix 99% CBD crystals with the coconut oil we want to create a 10% tincture in order to do that we'll use one gram of 99% CBD crystals and ten gram of the coconut oil all right if you want to make a stronger oil you can use double the amount of CBD for example 2 grams yeah and you will have a 20% or you can use half amount of the coconut oil you will have a stronger oil but today we're gonna make a 10% so just follow the recipe all right [Music] [Music] you can do it in oven you can do it on you know frying pan whatever just make sure to take a thermometer and measure that it's at least 70 degrees Celsius right 70 degrees Celsius I see here after 20 minutes only that it's all it's all transparent meaning that the CBD has dissolved and you can actually take it off or outside the oven or whatever you are heating it you can put it in a you know any container you want just make sure to put it in a cool place like a fridge then you can keep it for at least one year if you're gonna use it in one month or a couple of weeks you can just put it on your table doesn't matter now when the oil is like this you can cook with it you can put it on your hands you can eat it you can do many things fantasy well that's the only limitation now I stay tuned next time we're gonna show you how to baby we're waiting for some equipment so when it arrives I'm gonna show you how to do that it's also a very simple thing you're putting the device and your baby see you next time [Music] you", "6IwnGd6qlbU": "so now i'm going to show you how to get the d8 into a usable state so as we talked about and as you saw earlier the delta 8 whenever it is at room temperature it will never move you can take a dab tool in it and it gets stuck in there so to get it to a usable usable viscosity um i usually set my heat plate to 140 to 160 depending on how patient you are but 140 degrees is kind of the most ideal temperature with or without terpenes infused if it is infused with terpenes don't go more than 140 because you risk losing those terpenes that you've you know the terpenes are the gold part you risk losing those so right now our water temperature is 144 degrees it's been sitting at 144 degrees for about 20-25 minutes now with 400 grams into so as you saw before versus now it's ready to use viscosity of this couldn't be you know more perfect for prep whether it be cartridge prep or syringe prep so now once you get your delta eight all to 140 degrees there's no solid spots in the center anymore it's a homogeneous mixture ready to go ready to test ready to sample ready to use uh we really like the all flex syringe i've got them in 25 mil and 50 mil options the 50 mil option only does one gram at a time up to 5 grams the 25 mil does uh half a gram to 2.5 grams at a time in half gram increments so depending on which one you need if you're doing half creme carts you'll never do them with this we do a lot more than one gram carts but half grams are nice so to do the cartridge we use a 12 gauge half inch tip lure lock syringe that goes on the end of the gun our temperature on our heating element on the pid controller is at 150 degrees you can get by at 130 540 but it's going to make it a little more difficult 150 is perfect it's in a sealed environment we've not had any issues with lots of terps or whatnot inside the syringe and then for doing the cartridge filling how we do the cartridge fill is a male to male lure lock adapter so it just goes on the end of your syringe gun and then you take the cap off of this it goes on the end of that you click it and you fill it super easy this right here is going to make your life 50 times easier when it comes to filling these if you're doing it where you're heating your oil up on a hot plate or on a griddle to somewhere between 140 to 180 you your quality of what you're going to make isn't going to be quite there so we take a lot of pride in the correct temperatures the correct times doing it quick and doing it the right way and if we can pass on the knowledge to those buying from us and bulk we would you know that's what we're here for filling the cartridges same way 150 degrees 14 gauge needle tip on the end one mil clicks fills it all the way up you get a precise measure of you know accurate measure of uh of total content and then doing the syringes super easy so terpenes whatnot if you have any other questions you know feel free to check out more but this is a great introduction to d8 at home the right way you", "SgHizpsoBjw": "hey what's up everybody Jason with cheapest vape supplies

there is school stressing you out your job giving you anxiety or can you just not fall asleep at night well this just may be the video for you the use of cbd could be an effective and safe way to alleviate anxiety stress and improve your sleep but what exactly is cbd cbd is short for cannabidiol which is one of two compounds found in cannabis the other one being tetrahydrocannabine or thc for short what you may notice is that the chemical formulas of cbd and thc are almost chemically identical but they both elicit different reactions within the body the chemical structure of thc that is found in marijuana is what gives you the feeling of being high while the chemical structure of cbd which is also found in marijuana doesn't give you the feeling of being high but affects the body in different less noticeable ways cbd is known to elicit relaxing and soothing effects without the feeling of intoxication that is usually associated with marijuana marijuana and hemp are two types of cannabis plants marijuana contains a high concentration of thc with some cbd this contrasts kemp as hemp is bred to remove the majority of its thc content leaving the plant as only a good source of cbd this means you cannot get high off hemp derived cbd oils but how do we know that cbd is effective in treating anxiety one study outlined an experiment done on 65 men and women that were classified to be obese majority of the participants were in their 20s to 40s in this double-blind experiment some participants were given hemp-derived cbd oil or an olive oil placebo daily for six weeks alongside their normal diet throughout the six weeks the participants were asked about their feelings of stress as well as other factors including their overall well-being anxiety levels and sleep quality participants were also asked to complete physical activity on a regular basis the study found that overall participants who were given hemp-derived cbd were coping better with stress experiencing improved sleep quality and quantity and showed improved pleasure in life amongst many other benefits so how have people been using cbd cbd oils and creams are currently being used topically to reduce pain and inflammation teas coffee blends and even cbd infused beer help with anxiety relieve stress and help with sleep cbd has also been used to help with withdrawal symptoms panic attacks insomnia depression as well as ptsd although there is little to no side effects of cbd use as well as no proven tendencies for abuse or dependence potential cbd is still relatively new on the market cbd studies are still in the preliminary stages as long-term effects are still unknown so please before trying anything new we recommend you speak to your family doctor and inquire about cbd and find what works best for you if you are interested in learning more about the use of cbd research currently being done or the science behind it please refer to the links in the description of this video [Music] you", "IG7c6hI7jAc": "you probably already know that cbd oil is one of the most popular and convenient ways to take cbd but what is cbd carrier oil we've talked in previous videos about how cbd is extracted to form either refined oil cbd distillate or isolate given that cbd isolates a crystalline powder and distillates a thick honey-like substance how do these relate to the cbd oil products you see on the shelf today a key element here is the carrier oil this is a separate ingredient that can be mixed with a concentrated cbd to form what is commonly known as cbd oil not only does this make the cbd easier to take into store but the carrier oil can deliver benefits of its own a carrier oil is a simple plant-based oil that helps to ensure the active ingredient the cbd compound the cbd compound makes its way into your bloodstream and to your body's tissues and organs mct is one of the most commonly used carrier oils for cbd products not only does it help to deliver the tbd compounds to your body but mct oil can offer its own health benefits reinforcing the benefits of taking cbd so what is carrier oil if we read the label of the packaging carefully you'll realize that cbd products contain more than just hemp extracts notably manufacturers include carrier oils as one of the major ingredients in cbd oil typically these are either vegetable oil or glycerin and it is essential for the efficiency and absorption of cbd into your body essentially the carrier in the cbd products allows your body to process and absorb the cbd a carrier oil works because it's a fatty plant-based oil it contains the kind of fat molecules that your body is used to and accustomed to processing the fat molecules in a carrier oil directly bind to the cbd compound allowing the body to easily process the cbd this in turn improves the absorption and bioavailability of the cbd so you might be asking why use carrier oil with cbd simply put karaoke was used for carrying the essential ingredients and active compounds present in the cbd formula so that they can be absorbed by the body it works by binding to the cannabinoids and speeding up their delivery to the bloodstream there's no denying that an effective carrier oil is vital for the efficiency and potency of cbd and other cannabidoids using a solvent to carry the active ingredient to better target a part of the body is not a new concept carrier oils have long been used with essential oils cosmetics and hair care products even using soapy water to dissolve and remove grease from your dishes is essentially the same concept here the main difference from cbd and other products is that cbd can only be dissolved in fats or oils so basically you can't use water to dissolve the hemp extracts found in the cbd products furthermore specific types of carrier oils are used as they have particular attributes that makes them ideal to use with cbd let's take a look at some of the main reasons to use carrier oil for cbd number one you received improved cbd absorption the reason why manufacturers add a carrier oil to cbd products is to enhance its bioavailability in other words the carrier oil can make it easier for the active ingredients that's the cbd and other cannabinoids to travel to the bloodstream and be absorbed by the body it's important to know that cannabinoid and other cannabinoids are fat soluble this means that they can only be dissolved in fats or oils the sooner they break down in your body the easier it is for your digestive system to absorb the essential ingredients let's look at how this works our bodies can absorb water and fat soluble compounds the water-soluble compounds such as minerals and nutrients enter your bloodstream through the water-soluble pathway the process for the fat soluble compounds is a little more complex though unlike water-based minerals fat soluble compounds like cbd do not enter the bloodstream and from there travel to your body's tissues or organs directly from the gut they are instead converted into small particles that make their way into the bloodstream and through the lymph system our body has to break the cbd down into tiny particles known as micelles if you take cbd products together with a fatty substance like vegetable oil your digestive system dissolves the ingredients quickly this allows your body to quickly and more completely process and absorb the cannabinoids number two it's easy and accurate to measure the dosage if you are dealing with cbd raw products such as distillate or crystalline isolate measuring the correct dosage would be virtually impossible for most consumers given the tiny quantities and level of precision involved imagine trying to measure 8.5 milligrams of cbd ice to their crystals for example an accurate dose can however be easily measured if you dilute the product with a strong carrier oil and so this is one of the reasons why manufacturers use a carrier oil with cbd products the cbd oil that contains the no concentration of cbd makes it easy to measure out the correct dosage this kind of product can easily be measured by counting the number of drops or using a measuring spoon of course an accurate dosage relies on a quality product that's accurately labeled number three is extended shelf life cbd products typically last for one to two years and carry oils play an integral part in extending the product's shelf life carry oils such as mct oil can help to preserve the freshness and potency of cbd and other cannabidoids in fact one of the main reasons why manufacturers add a high quality carrier oil to cbd products is to allow the product to have a longer shelf life without losing the effectiveness or potency of course the shelf life cbd products also depends on how they're stored storing them properly generally in a cool dark place is essential to ensuring that you get the maximum shelf life out of your cbd oil or other related products for those reasons many premium manufacturers choose to use mct oil as they carry oil in their products mct is not only commonly used with cbd but it's also used in a range of fat soluble products manufacturers use carrier oils to allow cbd to be effectively absorbed into the human body mct is one of the most popular carrier oils as it is highly effective in aiding with cbd absorption extends shelf life and has a number of benefits for health and wellness well everyone we hope to enjoy today's video if you're looking for cbd oil broad spectrum that is on our website we sell cbd bomb oil and capsules

extract lab today i'm going to be talking about top 10 reasons ethanol extraction is better than co2 get ready for this one let's get started so here are the top 10 arguments against co2 extraction number 10 low solvent power number nine long cycle times number eight low throughput number seven it's not safe because co2 processes a high pressure number six co2 is not scalable number five co2 equipment is not reliable number four co2 needs ethanol for winterization number three solvent residuals are no big deal number two co2 equipment is too costly number one co2 is too costly all right so what we're going to be doing in the next 10 slides is we're going to be going through each one of these arguments and busting them so we'll start with number 10 co2 has low solvent power ah this one may have some credibility listen ethanol has the solvent power there's no question about that if anybody's ever drunk a scotch okay it will dissolve your tongue the great thing about ethanol is it will dissolve everything basically it'll dissolve pesticides it dissolves undesirable plant materials waxes polyaromatic hydrocarbons as you roll it over your carbon it'll dissolve terpenes and any other millions of organic substances so ethanol does have the solvent power and it's much more stronger than co2 no question about it ethanol is not the perfect key however for the cannabinoid lock okay it's more like the universal key for every organic lock okay so that the whole key analogy is more of a selectivity thing than it is a solvent power thing that's why you need to talk to you know separation scientists like myself because we know about selectivity okay so co2 has the selectivity and the way you really talk about selectivity is you talk about it in terms of pressure and temperature so solvent strength for co2 is highly dependent upon the pressure that's what's so awesome about it the solvent power and the co2 goes away as the pressure is released leaving nothing but pure oil co2 has adequate solvent power at elevated pressures 5000 psi at 50 degrees to extract 90 cannabinoids in about an hour so who cares if it has a greater solvent power if you're getting the job done i think it's kind of a red herring actually a low pressure and low temperature co2 has less solvent power compared to high pressure and it's used selectively to extract terpenes in terpene-rich mixtures so actually you can use that selectivity to really make like terpene soup sauces and things like that so actually that's pretty cool you can't do that with ethanol and temperature pressure and co-solvent are tuned in practice to make co2 more selective so that's what we do so co2 really has that selectivity and ethanol has that solvent power sometimes you can combine the two ever since we started making our equipment in 2015 we've always had a like a solvent pump on our system for you know like coal solvent so if you want to add a little bit of solvent in there to get it to you know go faster or to improve the situation you can add a small amount in and it makes a huge difference i think this one is plausible co2 absolutely does have low lower solvent power compared to ethanol but i also think that selectivity trumps solvent power and when you talk about separations selectivity is the name of the game let's move to number nine co2 has long run times this argument is really predicated on their previous argument that since co2 has low solvent power it has long run times now historically co2 has been run at low pressures and in those conditions yeah it's really it's pretty slow you know typically run times of four to six hours for example depending on your pressure and your temperature and sometimes actually those methods are quite desirable so under certain circumstances you want to have a like a terpene soup or you want to selectively get the terpenes out that's a really great way to do it you can't really do that with ethanol by the way so it's not true however when pressure and temperatures are elevated so you can really shorten up the run times also if you run a d-carb material it's also a lot faster so if you decarb your biomass like we do we decarb it and get out all of the beautiful terpenes out ahead of time so they're not being degraded during extraction you can basically go even faster so it's actually dependent upon what material you're extracting and also it's also dependent on what the temperature and pressure is just to give a blanket statement that it has long run times isn't really fair so you really need to think about that because ethanol has a very high solvent you know power it is pretty fast too so i don't i don't deny that and it makes sense that it is fast um you know the issue with ethanol is your recovery of that ethanol and then the cost associated with the recoveries and then you know the ethanol loss and really driving up the costs and do a comparison between the ethanol and co2 on the extraction cost but it is misleading to compare the solvent power for two solvents for a given solute without specifying the pressure the temperature and the composition at which the comparison is made yeah it's just not fair you're saying oh well one is uh much faster than the other well you have to specify the conditions otherwise it's just not fair so number nine i think is busted number eight co2 extraction is low throughput again this argument goes back to low solvent power and at long run times therefore it has a low throughput you know we just don't see this bore out in real life i mean we three of our 180 machines can process one ton of biomass per day and they're very small space they're like 26 square feet per machine so 75 square feet probably under right around 240 amps three phase you know it's for low power low space very very inexpensive to run the co2 is basically nothing you know four cents a pound so one thing is that you can say that it's low throughput but you know we're running a five ton a day facility in less than four thousand square feet that's our basically our extraction area actually it's a lot less than that so i don't really sure if it is low throughput i mean we're running of course higher pressure higher temperature methods i don't think anybody in the hemp or cannabis industry would say five tons a day is well throughput just just saying so throughput is important but throughput per what is important like for example through put per unit cost or throughput per unit operating cost or throughput per unit space or throughput per unit facility cost i mean you really need to put throughput in context so throughput is important but you throughput per is actually much more important i put this as busted because you can go look at one of our other youtube videos where we have a tour of a five ton per day facility and we don't we're running in an f2 uh facility which is an f2 occupancy you don't really have all those problems associated with ethanol and large amounts of solvent around it's really nice so let's go on co2 at high pressure is not safe oh my gosh co2 is going to blow up right this is what some of the ethanol and actually butane propane people are saying which is kind of actually ridiculous it's kind of almost dumb i don't know of any catastrophic event that's happened with co2 extraction equipment i don't i don't think it's ever been reported there may be um you know injuries of people getting their fingers hurt or like a fitting going off or something like that but i don't know of any physical you know where someone catastrophically like they died or a plant like blew up or a fire burned something down that just doesn't happen with co2 so and it's not only our company but there are a lot of other co2 companies and it's used industrially so you know certainly there's lots and lots and lots of people who have used co2 and uh you know the equipment itself is quite safe there has been issues of uh asphyxiation with people who have left the co2 run and then they suffocated that has happened uh but not in our industry it's happened in other people's industries so you can go to osha and you can look at all those things and there have been some instances of those yeah you have to make sure that your co2 is safe so you know you can use alarms you can put them on and we have alarms on all of our equipment you know if if you get a leak or something like that and you don't know the leak is happening your machine will basically shut off so that's one thing and you know our co2 cages which are basically our co2 you know conditioning equipment those things have a vent right on them with a contact closure if something happens if the if the co2 goes up above uh you know like 5000 ppm you know the fan turns on invents it so that's pretty nice but anyway um butane propane ethanol you know even ethanol has caused fires in this industry and they're pretty well known you don't have to go very far in the literature to see issues with butane and propane as well so um i think that there are safe ways obviously to do all these techniques um and so really we're talking about the exception versus the rule but it's kind of ridiculous to say that it's not safe to have co2 at high pressure that's ridiculous i have a pressure washer at home and it is 5000 psi pressure washer and my kids use it it's it's not a problem just the fact that you have 5000 psi does not make it unsafe it's that's ridiculous so i say it's busted okay let's move on to number six co2 is not scalable this is absolutely not the case i mean i can show you pictures of a 5 ton per day facility there are many large industrial co2 extraction facilities all over the place large scale co2 extraction is very old it's very well known it's safe in terms of scalability when you think about that in terms of a facility you want to make sure your facility is scalable so that you know basically you can start off at a low volume and then increase uh your production capability without having a tremendous uh upfront cost so that's what scalability is i consider that to be more of a a facilities characteristic in our case you know we have we made our system so they're modular you know like you need if you want to do like a half a ton a day you can use one of our 180s approximately a little less than half a ton a day or you know 500 pounds something like that if you want to do a ton a day you can you know take and add another couple of those units actually as you increase your biomass you're increasing your output you're getting more profit you can afford more equipment so you know the way we typically design facilities is so that you can scale it up over time and so that's a really great way to think about scalability but co2 is absolutely scalable you don't need to have huge huge huge vessels to scale up i mean we're using you know 40 and 80 liter vessels those are not huge vessels um in um or vessel volume rather and yeah they're just not huge so actually they're um they're all at uh you know chest level like this and you can uh you know put in the biomass in there it's really not it you don't need huge vessels so i don't know where that came from um tour our five ton today facility you can tell me whether or not it's scalable or not that's what i recommend but i have to put this one as busted it is co2 is definitely one of the more scalable techniques that's on the market number five co2 equipment is not reliable well i have to say that you know in the last say three years i think that all the manufacturers have really upped their game on reliability i'd say maybe four or five years ago you know a lot of the manufacturers were using like haskell pumps and you know they weren't really made for you know the cycle duty that they were applying them to so a lot of people had to have like extra pumps sitting on the shelf i don't think that that's the case anymore a lot of the pumps are pretty reliable and the pump that we have is extremely reliable i mean we have been running you know 24 hours a day for many many many years on single pumps and they're pretty reliable pumps i i really enjoy them they're basically they're piston pumps um they're actually diaphragm pumps excuse me and you have a diaphragm it's a ptfe diaphragm the fluid comes in through a check valve and then exits through a check valve they're really really reliable the other items that you could say are not reliable uh maybe of the seals you need to change out the seals and those if those are done on a maintenance schedule you know like once every three months you shouldn't have a problem so i wouldn't say that co2 equipment is not reliable there are some people who start with cylinders just single cylinders of co2 and then they try to run an operation and they're always running out of co2 and that's not the way to run a co2 extraction operation okay so that also is one of the ideas that might make you think that it's unreliable because you're always running out of solvent like you're always running out of co2 small the cylinders we have a product called the co2 cage and we recommend that you use the co2 cage because you can get a fill for example from a beverage truck or a large bulk source it conditions all the fluid delivers it to your extractor and it's quite nice because it's always going to keep it at the right pressure always at the right temperature and yeah it's just a preconditioning a piece of equipment so we've taken co2 tech to the next level and i think the whole industry has basically kind of kind of stepped up the plate on that i don't really have any fingers to point at any of our co2 competitors really we've really dialed in reliability i think that that's the case i also think that the like the pumps that are being used the low pressure pumps with ethanol i mean those are pretty unreliable too they have issues we've used a lot of those like centrifugal pumps or metering pumps they got problems and so i don't think it's a really a universal thing like oh hey co2 equipment is not reliable and ethanol equipment is reliable i think that mechanical systems have problems period so that's something to think about so i would have to say this one's positive co2 extraction needs ethanol oh my gosh yeah well this one's plausible it's absolutely true if you're going to do some co2 extraction at a large scale you're probably going to be one running some sort of winterization process now with an ethanol extraction process they they kind of run winterization within the process so you're running the winterization no matter what but with co2 you have it's almost like a separate process you get the oil out and then you winterize it okay now the deal here is that co2 does this winterization process but the ethanol usage is way way way less way less i mean it's not even close so it's really not on the same level so you don't don't really need to worry about for example having to lower your costs of solvent loss or solvent reuse or anything or even the power you don't have to worry about those those costs really because you're using so little of it food grade ethanol you can use that even though it's more expensive and it's not going to be really you know contributing a large portion of your cost and ethanol reuse is still subject to the fda gmp practice for change out foundation specification requirements so um the bottom line is i have no problem with ethanol uh or food grade or organic it's just we use it for winterization i just don't like denatured ethanol i think that's a really bad idea so i have to say that this particular one is plausible yeah co2 does need extraction yep co2 does need ethanol to make it work what i'm really sure is a big cell what i mean co2 uses a lot less ethanol like a lot so it's not the same even in the same category as ethanol extraction in terms of its ethanol usage so it's a big so what all right let's talk about number three solvent residuals are no big deal i totally disagree and everybody knows that i disagree the butane and propane people had been talking about this they say if you have a properly purged solvent properly purged oil shouldn't be a big deal the issue is that a lot of people didn't quite get that process down and so there were widespread knowledge of residuals in a lot of the you know for example shatter i don't think butane and actually propane is that big of a deal to eat pretty non-non-toxic but when you start talking about denaturants that are added into ethanol that i really have a big problem with that because you know we see samples that pass like tests the solvent test the four or six nine usp test for example and you know they still have heptane or they still have acetone or they still have you know different denaturants in them there are no long-term toxicity or carcinogenity studies on many of those solvents in the class three which is ones i just mentioned and so they know that they're less toxic but they're only know that from the short term like for example if you look up heptane this is a good example people are adding heptane to ethanol to denaturize it okay there's a 5000 ppm limit on heptane but the fda has basically said that they don't have the data for long-term toxicity or carcinogenity or heptane that's a problem and they cited one single study and they said okay it's okay at 5000 ppm well i just don't like that so residual chemical solvent impurities are entirely avoidable using co2 production methods that's absolutely true so why take the risk with solvent residuals they kind of are a big deal because there's a lot of unknown potential consequences from them and a lot of it hasn't been studied cognitive function effects on cognitive function effects on endocrine disruption in the endocrine system there are a list of all these areas of science that we have basically uncovered and know a lot about since 1981 and we have a pretty antiquated limit on heptane for example basically on the basis of our known amount that's in there so i have to put this one at busted solvent residuals are a big deal and you know you can entirely avoid them just using co2 production methods so i say busted let's go to number two co2 equipment costs too much well i have to say you get what you pay for co2 equipment is definitely more expensive but trade-off for that is that co2 equipment also has the lowest operating cost period co2 operations will generate cash faster thereby paying the needed increase in equipment cost and driving value for business for years so one thing if you really look at the numbers and you look at the operating costs and not just the initial equipment costs you're going to come up to a very different conclusion when it comes to the added cost up front for co2 we offer extreme value in use in other words as you use our product and the way we use it with co2 and the co2 cost itself is so extremely low if you look at that in that sense our products are ridiculously inexpensive just do the numbers and you'll know what i'm talking about so i'd have to say that this is busted and now for the number one argument that ethanol is better co2 extraction cost more than ethanol that's just absolutely not true take a look at these facts number one co2 uses four to six times less power than ethanol extraction we don't have to take and you know evaporate huge amounts of ethanol that's a big power cost so co2 wins liquid co2 is 4 cents a pound as compared to ethanol which is 4.71 cents a pound that's 117 x less cost that really drives a huge impact on if you have ethanol losses that's going to cost you a lot if you're going to try to do organic you have got to buy organic ethanol and that's going to cost you even more so loss of co2 per day is about 211 bucks for one ton a day compared to ethanol which anywhere is from 4 000 to 7 800 a day easy depending on what kind of ethanol you buy co2 is the liquid startup cost it's about 211 whereas the ethanol startup cost is anywhere from 7 000 to 15 000. so it's less co2 if you're going to build a building say 5 000 square feet co2 is housed in an f2 versus an h2 occupancy those costs are published by third party all over the world 68 bucks a square foot typically average cost versus two over 200 square foot for h2 occupancy buildings so extraction facilities are less costly and co2 extraction facilities have low cost insurance compared to ethanol absolutely true my advice to you is don't mortgage your company's future value by operating a high cost operation you need those profits to grow so the number one argument i think is busted hey thanks for watching we have many

you\nneed to know about any if you're looking for again five different types of CBD\nthat you need to know about if you're looking for CBD in your skincare hi my\nname is Christy and I've been treating a client's I'm a licensed professional\ntreating clients with acne hyperpigmentation and other skin\nconditions for over twelve years and now I have taken early retirement from\npractice and I'm only doing online consultations so if you're interested in\nthat there is a link below you can just find out more information to see if you\nare the right candidate so moving on we're gonna be talking about the five\ndifferent types of CBD so if you haven't caught any of our series of what we're\ntalking about beauty and skincare I do want to clarify because I only mentioned\nit in one video that CBD is not the same as hemp seed oil so the CBD is actually\nextracted from the cannabis sativa plant so there are two totally different\nthings so we're gonna be talking about the CBD as an extract in your skincare\nso the first one is CBD isolate and this is actually consisting of 99% CBD it is\nTHC which is the hallucinogenic agent free it's very consistent of most of the\nmanufacturers that use CBD in their products uses the CBD isolate and all\nother plant actives are eliminated so the next one is CBD distillate and this\none is not as concentrated it's still 80% CBD the other is rest is other minor\ncannabinoids and terpenes and all the other rest of it is plant materials and oils okay so the next one is full-spectrum\nCBD and that consists of 60% CBD and 0.3 percent THC it also is taken from the\nentire plan including the flower so it does have the plant flavinoids the it\nhas the minor cannabinoid such as CBC CBD\nand CBG as well as other phytochemicals so I do have one caveat I've read\nseveral different articles and I read some that come across that say the CBD\nisolate which is the 99% is more effective and then I also have read that\nthis full-spectrum CBD is more beneficial so there seems to be I don't\nknow if it's conflicting or they just have difference of opinion but just to\nlet you know that when you start reading literature on CBD those are some of the\nthings that you might come across so before we get into the last CBD type if\nyou're finding this information helpful please give us a thumbs up and like this\nvideo letting us know that this is the type of information that you are looking\nfor and don't forget to hit that notification bell to let you know when\nour videos come up we would love it if you would subscribe to us so now let's\nget to our last CBD type so the last one is water soluble CBD in our last video\nwe talked about the fact that the CBD is actually naturally lipophilic meaning\nthat it loves oil or oil soluble well when they make it water soluble what\nthey do is they basically shrink down the molecule so that it actually can\nmix with water but when you do or you mix anything with water it can dilute\nthe potency and in this case it can dilute the potency up to 30% so here\ncomes the pro tip when you see hemp seed extract it's more than likely hemp seed\noil and don't mistake the fact that there's only trace amounts if any of the\nCBD in hemp seed oil so it is not the same thing so now that we talked about\nthe five types of CBD we're gonna briefly talk about what skin condition\nworks best with some of these different types\nnow the links of some of these studies will be in my blog in which the blog\nlink will be in my description okay so the first one is acne so there was a\nstudy in 2014 in which they found that CVD\nactually reduces the amount of lipid that is being produced from the SIBO\nsites and that's basically the cells that create the sebum and then in study\ndone in 2016 and actually showed in addition to that it actually reduced\ninflammation in the sebocytes and inflammation throughout the skin and in\naddition to that and also they also found antimicrobial and antibacterial\nproperties which then also can help with fungus related skin diseases as well as\nacne so for those of you who have sensitive skin or dry and sensitive skin\nor just dry skin you may want to listen up to this part so they have found that\nthe full-spectrum CBD that we just talked about with its powerful\nphytochemicals and flavinoids can actually help reduce not only\ninflammation but it has the essential fatty acids that a lot of the lipid poor\nso basically dry skin is lacking it can help serve as an emollient and\na moisturizer with these essential fatty acids of antioxidants and the\nphytochemicals a lot of times the types of products that you will see the full\nspectrum CBD is in oils such as massage oils salves\nbalms lotions and creams so some of the skin conditions that are lacking a lot\nof the lipids or essential fatty acids CBDs actually has omega-6 and Gamma\nlinoleic acid which can help for those of you who have psoriasis eczema and\nsystemic sclerosis I mentioned in an earlier video that also has by\nantioxidants such as vitamin C and vitamin E so it can help neutralize the\nfree radicals and there was actually a study that was done that actually helped\nwound healing cells so basically helped healing of\nwounds including acne lesions so this is by no means an exhaustive list of all\nthe benefits of it and what you can do with it what skin types obviously this\nis just to better help you read the label of your skincare products because\nremember makeup is an art and skincare is a science thanks for watching

Today I want to talk to you about our Syringes for filling oil cartridges. When you have a vaporizer (or personal vape) such as the MiniVape2, you can fill your own cartridges with CBD or other oils. The way most cartridges work is that you unscrew the mouthpiece to open it, and then you can put your oil in. Now, a lot of these oils are fairly thick -  they don't pour easily and you get about an eighth to a quarter inch little gap here to try to put it into the tube, which is pretty maddening and usually you end up making a mess and spilling more than you get into the cartridge. So the solution to that is use a blunt tip medical syringe. Okay... We have them in green and silver, and they come in a little box like this. And when you open it, you get the syringe [mutters under his breath]: Of course I opened it for the wrong end - I always do that! You get a syringe and a little needle adapter. Now... the way these work -- just like in hospitals they have what's called a luer lock on the end. This is so that you can just twist and it's a Quick Connect. So you can just connect it into tubing when people do IVs and things like that... The blunt tip also just snaps in. So now you have a nice little precision fine point tip that you can stick into the cartridge to fill it. You can put it in and draw... and then stick it back in and Push it. OK... The other thing that you can do is -- these do come off if you pull them off -- and you get just a glass blunt tip. This can be used for dabbing oils directly into a hot banger. Our syringes are made of borosilicate glass and stainless steel plungers. So there's no plastic in this, so you can take off the plastic Luer lock tip and you can directly dab into your hot bangers and you're not gonna melt anything. You can easily just snap it right back on. Okay They come in green and in silver.  And they make filling cartridges a breeze! I'm Eric Robichaud from Green Goddess  Supply!

capsule [Music] next we're going to smash 14 grams of blueberry number seven in a nug smasher 14 gram 120 micron bag and we're gonna smash this using bottle text style meaning we're going to invert our corners to make sure they overlap [Music] next we're going to load our nug into the bag [Music] remember to be mindful of negative space in the bag rosin can get trapped in there taking away from your yield go ahead and lower the plate so that the opening is about the height of your bag [Music] so [Music] here we go [Music] you know where are we [Music] here we go grab your nug smasher everything tool and collection plate go ahead and remove all of your rosin off of the parchment paper [Music] tell me [Music] know [Music] next we are going to add one gram of our cbd rosin to our rosin pot [Music] heat your plates up to 240 degrees fahrenheit [Music] once the plates reach their desired temperature throw the decarb capsule in there and let it decarb for about 40 [Music] minutes [Music] here we go carefully release your plate pressure to see if your silicone rosin pot is still expanding inside of the decarb capsule [Music] if it's still expanding reapply pressure with the plates and wait a little bit longer as you can see we have done this about three times once all the pressure has been released you're going to want to grab a towel or an oven mitt to pull the decarb capsule from your machine [Music] during the decarb process rosin will liquefy making it much harder to collect throwing your rosin in the freezer for a couple of minutes will allow your rosin to return to a state in which it is much easier to collect we added 12 fluid ounces roughly 200 milliliters of honey to our beaker and we set our hot plate to 100 degrees fahrenheit one important thing to remember is that honey's quality and taste will start to degrade at 110 degrees fahrenheit be sure to stay at the 100 degrees fahrenheit mark go ahead and stir your honey while it warms up this will ensure that all our honey will heat up evenly [Music] while our honey is heating up we'll head back over to our freezer to collect our cbd rosin and get it ready to infuse with our honey once your honey has reached 100 degrees fahrenheit go ahead and stir in your cbd [Music] you may need a spoon to stir the honey and help the infusion process along when all of your cbd rosin infuses with the honey you're all done the process is very simple it just takes a little bit of time go ahead and add your cbd infused honey to your tea and enjoy let us know in the comments below what you plan on

advanced extraction guide distillate guide calculator library is live you guys it's live oh my god they've been burning it up burning it hundreds of people on there so it's been it's been great and we're we're adding the and uh mini courses to come so good all right all right so uh yeah so let's uh let's get into this this is probably uh one of those uh one of those sessions where we're we're it's kind of more loosey we see uh so i only like no i only have the others work i only have like three slides and a couple tables oh awesome yeah okay they didn't see you i know okay i was i was showing you my eyes glazed overlook how do i get how do i get my wonderful presentation up here because people are going to be excited about these calculators if they're at all making tinctures and then we're going to get into some tasting and then we're going to make our own you're going to make me taste the bad stuff i'm going to make you taste it no i'm going to make you taste the good stuff okay i got cuts i got cow leaf i got holist stuff here remember last week you said ooh this is horrible taste this okay okay that's that's what i'm expecting okay uh number one number one guys uh if you're gonna make your own tinctures you gotta make sure your biomass or your cbd oil has been decarboxylated first okay otherwise it's it's not going to be able to be absorbed into your body um just to let you know that so what that means i didn't know that yeah what that means is that you you need to bring it through a process of decarboxylation so um you know whether if if you have a distillate it's it's very likely already decarboxylated almost all of distillate is decarboxylated for sure okay um if you have just like for example some uh some some biomass you're going to want to kind of warm it up you're going to want to cook it at 150 degrees for about an hour that'll decarboxylate it um or if you have some crude that you've taken from like an ethanol tincture or something like that you're gonna have to remove the ethanol and cook the living daylights out of the oil okay so that that and that that will basically decarboxylate it okay so first step in making a tincture obviously is decarboxylating either your biomass or your cbd oil just so you guys know that it's very important otherwise they're not going to be there's going to be what they call mal absorption oh yeah not going to be very good okay if you're using cbd oil you can follow a recipe that you create using our kick calculators kit calculators kick calculators yeah they're really great uh if you are using cbd biomass you need to extract it so we're gonna go over some of those calculators and then once you have this wonderful uh oil of some kind and we'll go over different ways to make that of course you guys there's different ways to do that um then then you can calculate your dosage using our dosing calculator okay so this is going to be a lot of fun and then step four obviously is enjoy it awesome so that that's pretty great that's that's my favorite part there's a small list okay so a lot of people ask us in the past you know what uh what cbd should we use in tinctures should we use isolate should we use distillate should we use winter eyes should we use broad spectrum ethanol all of them are perfectly fine to use in a tincture it's just you might get some uh different uh different things uh happening with that so like for example with isolate isolate is the most straightforward one to use within a tincture okay and um um what's nice about it is that potency is pretty high but it doesn't have any terpenes so you'll have to add some of your terpenes that you gather up in in a different process uh and you need to add those in i'll give you an example what that looks like here here you can see these are pure uh pure terpenes uh they come they come from a decarboxylation process which is essentially uh vacuum distillation and so they don't they don't have any thc or cbd in them but they are they are straight from the hand plant they have all of the a full spectrum of uh of terpenes there so you can add those into your isolate to make uh like dabs you can add them into your isolate to make no smell great they smell crazy good crazy good um yeah so terpenes um there are some you know sometimes with isolate depending on what isolate you are uh you know extracting from typically you will always have some miners in there like if it's 99 pure uh cbd you'll probably maybe have one percent miners or you know and when i say minor cannabinoids i mean cbn cb cbc cvg you know some of the miners will also be in there but they're very very trace they're very low low level they're just because the way isolate is processed you do have a residual risk so i'll be very careful about that i am a total anti-anti-residual type of person um so the way that it's processed with nonpolar solvents and stuff like that i i don't i don't like it so i don't prefer an isolated tincture i prefer something more natural but a lot of people use it because um you know like if you use a crude or winterized or bots broad spectrum you're really talking about the natural flavors of the plant in there so you know um you know a lot of people want to mask that and overpower it with like a strawberry flavor or a chocolate flavor or something like that people also use distillate and when you use distillate and you're in manufacturing you just have to correct for you have to know how much cbd is in your distillate right otherwise you wouldn't know how to dose it and i'll show you in a calculator that we put together for manufacturing and what that really means it's just suffice it to say it does have some of those minor cannabinoids it does have some of the longer chain longer longer isoprene the larger um the larger terpenes in there so yes it does have some terpenes in it but it doesn't have the more volatile ones which are the diatribes uh things like that um and then a residual risk if if you there's always a residual risk with distillate we've we've done a pretty large study on uh you know um distillates and and you do see some of those residuals making it all the way through the distillate even if they are volatile organic solvents so um but it's uh it really varies about 25 of the manufacturers that we survey their distillate had some sort of contaminant in there so when you buy distillate you just want to make sure that you are basically contaminant and solvent free um and then winterized decarboxylated oil um 50 to 70 percent of course terpenes yes you got lots of terpenes in there it may also have some miners in there um you're not going to have a residual risk if you if you are using co2 oils and you're using food grade oils that don't have residuals in them you might have a ethanol digital though so you want to make sure that that's all taken out of there um broad spectrum is basically a thc free distillate typically you would take the distillate and you take the thc out of it you do that with either chromatography or solvent techniques one of the two you have to decide which one you want to use you know we use chromatography here because it's more clean than using a solvent so we try to stay away from acetone heptane hexane or anything else that's going to get into your body with unknown consequences to the to the endocrine system or to anything else you know you're trying to get to the point where um where where we're not taking and eating chemicals we're trying to do that that's a good thing better living through chemicals only applies if you live in the laboratory um and then uh ethanol extract yes you can do we're gonna show you how to make a t-shirt like uh with an ethanol extract the definition of a tincture is uh essentially an ethanol extract okay it's it's or it's a uh if it's it's an active with uh in in ethanol okay and most people don't like to have tinctures like real tinctures because they burn you know oh yeah yeah yeah they really burn they don't taste very good because they're overwhelmed by the burn so sure a lot of people don't um you know for example you know make tinctures but they are medically used all over all over the world sure so and uh in the pharmaceutical world so all right so that's the type of cbd used in the tincture which one is best um i think that they all you can see that they're all um they all have different different things to bring to the table like the ice lit would be used if you want to have overpowering like berry flavors and things like that and you don't want to have any plant flavor in there if you want to have some plant flavor in there you know you're going to have to either hit the distillate the winterized oil of the broad spectrum if you're not going to want to have any thc in there you're going to want to use broad spectrum winterize is probably the best or crude oil could also be used and that's the the closest to the plant obviously so you can take winterized oil directly out of or i'm sorry um co2 oils directly out of crude directly out of a co2 extractor that has been pre-decabox lid and you can use that right in your tincture in my view that's the cleanest possible but you're also getting a lot of uh plant uh plant flavors there's a good flavor but it's a lower potency yeah it's a lower potency also but you can make it you can make the potency however you want because you're diluting obviously with uh with oil so got it that's what that is and so basically what's awesome about this is that if you have you know 50 flavors you have uh different types of isolate you have uh you know different types of terpenes really there's a lot of different combinations this is where cbd formulation gets a lot of fun because you're able to test and try you're able to come up with something unique there's uh you know any they're 100 factorial different you know different combinations so your combination can actually be unique and you know if you like it people like it they'll taste it like wow this is really great so yeah we've we went out we we bought a whole bunch of tinctures we tasted them some of them were like you know own natural yeah and they were a little bit tough uh from the standpoint just didn't taste very good right so we i always kind of like okay i like to i like the stuff that tastes really good and i do like the natural hemp flavor too so that's just my bias um so what's a does an extraction method for cbd uh why does it make a difference well uh just to just uh just to summarize it for you have purity is important unknown and known residual solvent should be avoided so this this is where um if you're on the market you're buying for example crude oil you're buying distillate um and they give you a report that says hey this is this is really great i i would i would test that um because i i don't trust residuals your laboratory will not test for unknown residuals that's a big deal and if it's not on their list they'll say it's pure it's clean it passes and that's a problem i i think it's a huge problem it is a problem it most definitely is a problem okay because you know there's just an infinite number of things what if i used something that wasn't a list you know like methylene blood or dimethyl bat [ __ ] oh oh dimethylpatch it do you have that okay or and organic is better organic is better it is just this because um you know it it's it's made with agricultural practices that that don't use pesticides or insecticides and so you're really reducing or eliminating that risk so hey anything you can do to make your cbd tincture the most healthy tincture possible is the best way absolutely period absolutely and the residual thing i mean i i agree with you the residual thing is is bad and we've talked about this in ad nauseam in previous episodes but if you're taking multiple doses a day of cbd or a tincture or taking that over time oh my gosh you're you're ingesting way over the limit that they want right over time right and that's just bad stuff right right exactly well yeah and they don't have any basis for the limits in the first place yeah so there's there's you know there's no studies and so their their modus operandi is interestingly enough oh we don't have any data on it so 5000 ppm is okay you know that that's you guys have heard me rant about that a lot and you know whatever you know does it actually happen in practice though the answer is yeah it does all the time yeah it does we we've got a whole bunch of extracts we got a whole bunch of you know distillates and stuff yeah we see the stuff in there you can see it yeah look we we analytical chemists we can see everything yeah okay there's no hiding yeah and we've got by the way we've got chemists from europe we've got chemists from ohio congratulations nicholas and edgaris hopefully i said that correctly and we've got barney here i mean we've got questions coming all over the place so thank you for being here it's awesome right thank you so anyway so that's that i think um let me see here so people always want to know how much to take okay so it's based on body weight it's based on delivery method and it's based on that condition that's being addressed okay so um you know like for example with some forms of epilepsy i know that uh you know the dosage is quite high like really high wow so um what's cool about the cannabinoids is that you're not going to die from it okay nobody has ever died for example from uh from a cannabinoid overdosage that i know of i don't think that there is if someone knows please put it in the notes that would be interesting but you know people have died from alcohol people have died from other things but they haven't done that you could you could be you could be you know you could be uh taking so much of it that it you know you you would have an adverse reaction that's not what i'm saying i'm just saying dying from it that would be a male reaction yes yes so that would be a male reaction okay so let's get to some calculators and then we'll get into the fun stuff which is basically uh sampling and mixing crazy awesome so let me see here it's on the website technical we're we're we're moving it and and this is awesome by the way um uh also as as we're going you know one there's a couple of questions that we're coming in as we're moving to the calculators and that is can you process just with pressure or do you need to process with a solvent um i wonder what that means uh it's it's tough to understand what that means if i mean okay we talked about methods last week okay and methods are basically you have your technique plus your temperature and your pressure conditions right and that's put putting those together with a piece of equipment that has been calibrated and has operating procedures and trained personnel that's a method okay so um if you are going to talk about different ways to um change you know like for example i could i could increase the pressure or i could decrease the pressure i could change my solvent i could use a different solvent sure um yeah there's there's lots of different options for me so yeah you look there's the sky's the limit when it comes to uh when it comes to making your different methods sure all right and we can talk about that um and and for barney if you want to watch the last episode we did on processes and things that would be awesome it's in our blog and you can connect there or on our youtube channel that would be good and then we're talking about i think we addressed some of these where you get all of the cannabinoids and flavonoids in the processes and where they are and what they would need yeah yeah um yeah so okay so yeah we can we can talk about that i'll talk about that as we're tasting and perfect stuff like that all right all right good good thanks for the questions by the way all right so um look here uh here's our calculators page you can go to our website uh calculators are at the top and then uh scroll down um scroll scroll down how do i scroll down here buddies that's just a pointer i know i'm looking to scroll here you got the whirling circle of i do have the army [Laughter] let me see here do you want to try it that's fun okay uh also again um it's really good to see you guys from europe from all over the country this is this is good stuff and um we are going to announce our topic later in the show but if you have any topics you want us to cover let us know for future episodes um and you know maybe there is a prize in it if you that's what we're gonna do next week because yeah i'm i'm held i'm been bound i can't speak right till later on the show right so we're good i still am terrified i'm gonna break something oh that's all right hey you know what we can do the calculators later look i can just look it's it's there's some technical difficulties that we're having which uh it does happen actually this is the first time that that's happened over all of our bodies oh my gosh i have technical difficulties in my brain all the time okay all right well let's let's i will narrate them and then we'll then we'll take it from there how about that guys so hey uh so what i'd like you guys to do it's gonna be it's gonna be a lot of fun i'd like you to go to the calculators page and if you scroll down to the bottom there's two calculators one is a dosing calculator and the other is how to manufacture a tin shirt calculator okay and i'll go through the dosing calculator first let's just kind of you guys open that up yeah i mean i'm gonna wait i'm gonna do it from memory extract lab.com e-x-t-r-a-k-t-l-a-b dot com forward slash calculators right right right right okay let's do it uh okay so uh let me see the dosing calculator let's talk about that one first your the dose that you would have is really dependent upon the weight of your of the weight of your body okay so um if you put in that your pounds how many pounds you are uh you have to convert it if you're in europe to kilograms um i think it's just divided by our time 2.2 i think so um and that'll give you your kilograms weight uh you need to put in your weight in pounds so that's uh let me see it's a so if you're 200 pounds or 100 pounds you put that in there and then you all then you decide uh what what uh dosage your um tincture is so if if there's a usually the tinctures are about 30 milliliters okay and um and they have usually they're about 33 milligrams per milliliter or 33 milligrams per serving and a one serving is typically right around one milliliter okay um yeah so uh you have to put that in there and then um you push the calculate button you got to put in some stuff and it'll tell you how you know basically what the maximum amount you have um it'll tell you what your dosage is for high medium and low dosage it'll tell you uh for example um what is your um you know how many milligrams you would take per day it's got a whole bunch of figures in there for a high medium and low dosage so how we doing james and and we're we're close one of the things that are is our technical difficulty is we are in the r d lab yeah i think that's uh that is we switched it at the last minute oh man yeah and so we've got usually in the other studio we've got you know plug-ins and everything and now we're going kind of wi-fi yeah okay so all right i know that that's part of the issue all right so and quick quick question yeah okay so when we're talking about body weight um my weight is about 165 right when you add my ego it's about 300 rounds okay it's like all right three clicks hey the calculator that's up is the wrong calculator did you know that oh you didn't know that okay he doesn't know true what are we doing when i when i mention those kinds of things you know i'll know whether he's paying attention to me he didn't hear a word i said no i didn't i didn't uh that's when i get away with so much [ __ ] i can't even tell you man why didn't i ask a really good question i don't know hey i've got a really good client who needs a discount okay sure he hears that i hear that okay all right let's just skip this because it's not working so all right we're gonna skip it sorry guys i all that all the calculator mango that i did this morning it's uh it's all there for your enjoyment so go ahead take and explore it and uh and we'll we're just gonna start trying out some things okay so what this means is this is rather than the calculator it's just trial and error and i'm the guinea pig am i the test you're the test oh you're the test thanks so okay just so all of you guys know in the room here thanks okay all right so let's let's do some tasting first okay um so this right here here there's some different pictures here that's that's a holistic tree right there this is a holistic tincture yeah what does it say it says key lime key lime we got strawberry okay i'm gonna try a strawberry 16.5 milligram serving of key lime this is look there's a brand spanking new okay this is kind of interesting if you can take a look at this so uh you can see this is almost clear it's got a slight color to it um let's see here if you can see that and then um yeah it's it's see it's strawberry so let's see if i can taste it all right this is typically what you do is you hold it under your tongue for like 30 to 40 seconds i hold it for two minutes it's it's better two minutes yeah two minutes i can hold my breath for two minutes i won't do that now actually it's kind of funny watching people take pictures i thought i'd just go oh key lime you know what that needs what little mango you know what if we we are going to be so relaxed in like an hour if we if we sample all these i don't think no way no way challenge challenge accepted okay then try the mint then try them in try them try them oh this is okay that other one was 16. this is 33. okay so this this is which one is 16 oh this is 16. yeah yeah 16. oh that's that's sweet so this is this is nothing so this one is a og kush so this one right here is cuts um this one is made up with uh terpenes like natural terpenes so um yeah let's try it all right oh yeah you can see the difference i mean it's definitely got definitely got a lot also it's got a nice little graduated cylinder oh same here look at this see that that's pretty sweet look at that okay i'm not going to take much i'm going to take a quarter a quarter quarter yeah yeah just a quarter is it quarter two bits you know what that's definitely got some oh it tastes great what do you got mint try that one okay try that one oh that's got flavor that's terpini does it really oh yeah it's got mint and terpenes mint terpini full spectrum hemp flour oil okay here let's check that out and it's uh heavy duty oh this is it's got 2 000 milligrams in this bottle yep i told you didn't i tell you yeah it's good it's good oh it's got that mint with a little bit of oh yeah but there's a good aftertaste yeah it kind of blends on the tongue and just kind of grows right under the tongue and just kind of comes and gives your tongue a hug right with terpenes so okay so so there's a couple different things you can swallow these tinctures and it'll go into your gut basically um and you know it'll it'll kind of it won't be metabolized as fast right it'll go it gets metabolized through the liver if you take them sublingually basically it gets absorbed um you know under the tongue and so you have to have a carrier for that and that's why typically alcohol is used because it's a good carrier directly into your bloodstream and there's some arterial a blood that goes right under the tongue and and it has a more direct way of getting into your bloodstream so um yeah oh that's good yeah oh that's good yeah oh and look certified pesticide free no reason here's a great vape too this is a great babe this is a pretty good one great babe yeah great babe that that's a do you know that ages me because i remember grape grape that was a great thing great bush you see this has got this has got more like a real cannabis flavor with no um you know with no um let me see no no like berry flavor or bean flavor it's just straight up you know og kush yeah it's great well the other thing would be the 2000 the other thing with this one is it it's got a thicker viscosity almost on it a little more oil base i like that oh mango sorbet oh my totally gonna try that one [Music] you're on a mango kick i i like i like berry flavors what can i say harry berry all right here we go i'm gonna try it grape ape i wonder if i'm gonna get any work done this afternoon boy we got we do have work don't we randy wow i i taste it definitely has the mango it's very smooth but it definitely ha it definitely still has that cannabis background in it what oh this one again it just kind of there's this little grapey flavor just slight it's not like drinking it's not like you know drinking a shot of welch's right but but then it's just slight and then all of a sudden the terpenes just kind of kick you yeah bam pretty good bam okay i think we've had enough we're gonna fall asleep i think we've had enough oh we're good all right well thanks we got that we got some conditioning are you kidding me yeah yeah okay so all right i'm i'm looking at uh questions here good uh maxum thanks good guys good uh barney cool thanks and look for that uh the blog will have a lot of that on there barney so just make sure you look right um matthew uh good to see you richard good to see you uh let's see questions um [Music] i think there's a great opportunity yeah there's one of the things that we have been noticing on our sites just because of this dude here um we have a lot of phds and chemists on staff and we speak chemists oh yeah oh my gosh yeah we kind of do yeah for us you know business and sales geeks yeah it gets old it never gets old i'm sorry did i say that out loud did i have too much cbd um i'm relaxed i don't care anymore oh good see now this is awesome but i think we need to do some uh very like this one was very good for chemists and i think the only thing that we didn't get to were the calculators but go your chemist you explore right do r d go to extract lab.com calculators and find those calculators because they're awesome yeah and in the blog we have several posts how many white papers have you written on distillate and that would be very chemist specific boy um how many white papers well we do blog posts we did guide our blog posts and then there must be at least we wrote uh we have at least 40 pages of faqs yes which are you know are very digestible because they're just adding okay and just so you know the faqs are not like a one or two sentence answer okay i mean they're exhausted it's a white paper okay yeah we make we make a white super faq i think i've seen citations on some of those yeah our guys go can we just make this into a blog article instead of an faq oh yeah sure whatever yeah whatever but leave it as an faq because people want to know this answer yeah all right exactly all right now one a couple of things that i wanted to show here just because it's cool um you know we got bigger beaker beaker all over the place okay okay that's fine no yeah bigger bigger bigger okay so there's some really cool stuff so why would you use this yeah or these little those are cool those are volumetric flasks yes these are volumetric flasks okay i apologize to all the chemists out there but those who are not chemists don't know this stuff so yeah let's let's make some stuff here so let's let's do some stuff let's let's make it all right so what do we need to do well okay i was going to start off with just uh just kind of an ethanol extraction of some of some uh bombings okay okay because a lot of people who want to do diy stuff at home yeah they might have some biomass and they take some water no no no that's fine oh okay so uh first thing you do is you start off with some everclear just take a shot and then start yeah so you buy it and you take your pork up this is the reason you start off with everclear is that uh it's a food grade uh alcohol it doesn't have a lot of water in it and uh you know you're not you're not dealing with residuals except for like a lot of alcohol okay and it is going to extract the um you know the biomass okay um a lot of times what people do is they'll they'll take some biomass they'll put it into a jar like like this okay and then they'll pour the everclear in there and they'll let it sit for you know a week and they'll they'll stir it and they won't really get it's not very efficient technique so you're not going to get out a lot of the cbd or so you might just continue to put some more everclear in it usually you want to start off with something a lot smaller you can also by the way this is from our own farms that worked out pretty good this right here shout out to nevada crest farms uh these guys are in nevada obviously um they had some pretty good blend that they sent our way oh nevada crest hey try to try that out shout out to nevada yeah yeah it smells great cool that smells really good yeah yeah and nevada crest they're looking at expanding their yeah facility yeah eli just talking to them oh really yeah cool sweet yeah all right so we're gonna take some of their stuff and we're gonna we're gonna take and do a little bit of an extraction so we're going to put a little bit in here first of all you see this is called a buckner funnel or a buchner funnel um and it has a paper in there you can see that that is a filter filter paper you put that in there and then you have like a little apparatus which is a this is called the sidearm vacuum flask you can buy these on ebay you can buy them on amazon or uh you can just not buy them at all and use like a coffee filter or something like that yeah that would be fine as well um and so you put a little bit of usually you want to wet the paper a little bit so i'm gonna take this is not normally how we would do stuff but we're gonna we're gonna do this diy here today so we're just gonna pour a little bit of that on there kind of wet that paper smell that yeah okay you all remember ever clear in the wapatooli college put a little bit of that in there [Music] all right we're gonna put a little bit of that in there all right this is great for like pre-rolls and things like that um and or you can just extract it straight out so usually what you would do is you would know for example the potency of that and then you would measure out the amount of alcohol you'd be extracting it with it's you still wouldn't really know what the end extraction would be but you can make some assumptions say if you have like 50 recovery or 40 recovery then you can kind of calculate okay i have i have uh calculate how much is in there so here we're just going to add it in and you can see now this is this is a really great illustration as well the issue with uh with with ethanol extraction and that's because now all that biomass is sucking up all of our alcohol okay so you need a lot of it in there and now we're just gonna kind of roll it around there and you can see down here there's uh we're getting a tincture out yeah now a lot of people want to just soak it that's fine too this we're just kind of doing this in the short term and then we're going to try i'll let you try it you're awesome yeah thank you it'll be great we're gonna get all those terpenes out of there and stuff like that so while that is cooking okay i'm gonna put this over here that's that's what you would do and you can put it into a jar and then you can decant it and filter it off and this would be considered to be a tincture a kind of an all-natural tincture okay oh yeah so you can see it's coming down so now when you do this approximately you know if we do this if this is you know what potency typically would that flower be so that would be either you know anywhere from five to fifteen percent and most likely right around ten percent okay yeah so if you're doing it this way yeah how much cbd will come down yeah not a lot not very much i mean it you so you maybe get most of it is stuck in that in the matrix there you know so that's why a lot of people soak it for a long time okay um you know so again diy uh do it yourself at home get a bottle of everclear but you can see there's it's definitely pulling some out yeah it's very green it's yeah cool yeah i can't wait to taste it yeah we're gonna we're gonna taste it and we're gonna taste it like real soon as soon as we get this all right so and then um let's kind of go over some of the flavors i was going to kind of show you guys some flavors here that yeah um you guys can pick up um any kind of flavor you want now these these okay let me just talk a little bit about terpenes and what makes a difference with turkeys okay not all terpenes are equal some terpenes are are synthetic some of them are say fruit derived um and some of them are steam distilled some of them are solvent distilled um and some of them are like i said purely synthetic and some of them are also derived specifically from say hemp these ones come straight from the ham plant they're they're they're not uh they're not cut they're not uh they're they're just natural okay so this is kind of what you want to have if you want to have uh you want to maintain that hemp flavor and that m taste and stuff in fact these terpenes right here are some of the terpenes that you that you um that you tasted in this oji kush okay okay so those are the og turkeys right there okay so that's one way to so when you say that it's right that's the flavor you're you use that stuff to flavor your tincture is this is this like when you say it's right from the plant that's pre it's pre-processing pre-processing processing all together yeah so you would use a a terpene trap yeah and uh and with that that terpene trap would allow you just to just to basically take the terpenes directly from here and and get them into there got it okay that's the chirping trap we have a product that that does that for because a lot of people do that and capture these post extraction yeah but they're not good they're not as good horrible yeah yeah yeah so these we call angels tears right yeah they definitely are angels tears and it's good stuff so you want it right from the plant yeah if you do it afterward uh in other words gather those uh these terpenes up afterward they just taste they're horrible they don't they don't smell good they don't taste good mostly because you have to really cook it in order to get it out right so and it's been processed like three times already by the time it gets out and so they're degrading and all that stuff so you want to make sure that you have some good uh you know nice terpenes um we also uh so that's one one particular flavor i would consider if you're going to make a tincture for um you know that's based on hemp you'd want to have a little bit of like terpenes in there so we taste you know something like the hemp plan um some of your clientele however is just going to like something like the holeless products like um there i mean i couldn't taste any like the key lime or the strawberry or the mint i mean was there any hemp in those at all terpenes that was a flavor was there a little bit yeah maybe i didn't taste it wasn't as strong as it was in the and some of them they were they were stronger in some than others yeah so the strawberry one i couldn't taste that at all so maybe that's just like almost free um so yeah um and then uh let me see then you can use different flavors you can go to amaretti um or you can go to you know different sources like here for example is uh we have usd organic these are organic tinctures that we have by the way so you want to make sure that you have the organic label um which means that this peppermint oil was grown organically extracted according to the organic principles and then to us in this beautiful package here that then we could put into an organic product to show hey look we're 100 organic i love that yeah it's good it's great and so this is very very concentrated peppermint oils you can also get non-organic and those would be like in fruity flavors and things like that um like for example uh here's here's lemon oil terpene less lemon oil here's some cassio oil for example that's more like cinnamon cinnamony chocolate cream look at here's sassafras oh yes that's the fresh fruit and then we've been doing a lot with like um you know like hot flavors like i think i really think that um you know like fusion you know like you know you know the fusion cooking yeah i think that that is really a great way you know to have that in like tinctures and things so i mean if you can you can mix and match like hot and yes the four essences you know uh sweet sour um earth air fire water i mean you know i mean something along those lines so you can have that in there and where it would you know develop over time so yeah uh the taste and all the flavor okay and by the way samantha loves our geek okay your geek not my geek your geek okay all right let me see here we got uh isolate here okay this is some of our raw products so here's some isolate so that's what that looks like it looks beautiful white and it's uh and then we have it's kind of fun when they dry it and they just there's some here's some distillate okay so that's some distillate so we would we would make that up and uh here's some winterized oil so again all of these are decarboxylated here you can see how they're kind of flowing there um then this is yeah and then that's crude crude you know smell smell this cream oh i just love the smell of co2 crude is so smells so wonderful it just does it it just really smells good yeah look how thick that is oh my gosh i i just like okay it looks weird for me just sitting there smelling it but if i can oh yeah you know what if you move it around you can really see yeah crude smells so good oh and then you know the winter eyes again it just kind of you lose a little bit of that beautiful um so if i was to make a tincture um you know making like making it with like food is actually a really great great idea so hey we got we got ourselves are we making it yeah we got ourselves a little bit of alcohol here you can see that little tiny bit of alcohol tincture here that we're making okay you don't have to use uh only alcohol in fact let me talk to you a little bit about what the difference is between an alcohol tincture in what is known in the marketplace as a as a tincture usually um people don't use alcohol because it's their shipping issues and all that stuff and so what they use is other excipients like coconut oils like mct oils or sweet almond oil or they'll use glycerin or something along those lines okay usually you want to stick with an oil we can use hemp oil too we have a whole bunch of hand boiled danny kemp oil here um that's a really great way to do it too usually the hemp oil is green and you know it comes out green that's the organic stuff but most people i mean if you look at the labels and you read the labels most people are using an mct which is a medium chain triglyceride and you know it has its own actually mct oil has its own health benefits you can go up on on the web and look those up so a lot of people are using those um it doesn't always have to be alcohol it it solves a lot of problems if you don't have to you know store a lot of everclear or food grade up ethanol so um okay so uh so how are we making this well i i don't know i think what we're going to do first of all we're going to just taste it okay and then and i'm going to use one of these a little bit yeah we're going to take yeah so here it is here's the so let me take a look at this if you can real quick so this is the extracted material and you would it's not fully extracted for sure but you can see that all of that ethanol there is still stuck in there yeah in in the matrix there it's really hard to get out so you'd have to centrifuge it or something to get it out of there i can't wait to go to the matrix matrix here we go oh well um i didn't smell that like a chemist you want to know how the chemist is supposed to smell stuff here i'll show you yeah there you go you got it you got it that's how it goes yeah so okay here you get a little beaker and i get a little beaker i want half of it and you can have it and then we're gonna use that as our base to try out some stuff here okay i'm having fun i don't know about everybody here i i know i see there's a lot of people on on the show sorry but i'm having a lot of fun i hope i hope you guys are okay okay well bottoms up man yasu okay a little tiny bit under the tongue maybe i i think i'm gonna do this instead what yeah i'm gonna try this i'm not gonna try that what no way i'm gonna try a little bit on my tongue if you want a dropper there's a drop over there really okay here we go oh my gosh that warm oh it's very hot can you reserve the cot for me wow that's a that's what they call extreme burn excuse me sorry wow look at something else okay so are we wimpy or i mean we don't drink everclear we drink whiskey but not every clear wow i mean okay i that has great flavor though i mean other than the everclear burn but i you can really taste the flour you know what i think that is i think what that is is that the oils that were on our tongue i think that they're now desorbing and redissolving into our mouth or that's just my tongue i think you're dissolving your tongue all together that's from all right okay so okay okay this is not oh man this is killing it oh no he's gonna do it okay you got it done okay you could do that okay now what we're gonna do here i did it it's you did it what do you wanna you wanna pin or something high five okay okay you know what we don't have is something to clear our palette in between or like i did actually i had some water earlier oh really yeah i'm going to try this before i tried this i cleansed my palate it's totally unsuitable it must just be the dissolving of my tongue in the everclear but you know after this no one no one's going to join our show again all right are you kidding me everybody's going to be on all right here we go now we're going to do some mct stuff um i think i think i could do here if we lift something i could go you just pull that up pull this out yeah pull it pull it out no no pull this up right here yeah there you go pull this up yeah just pull it up i'm trying yeah okay pull it all the way up okay go there and i'll push it down how much just give me a little bit i don't need a lot there you go yeah okay there it is i need some of that okay then i'm gonna make a i'm gonna it's just kind of like a uh it's kind of like a buffet so you can just go ahead and make i'm gonna i'll tell you what i'm gonna i'm gonna put a little crude in there and uh oh my gosh now this crude is probably right around 60 percent so you know whatever i probably i probably have about a quarter mil in there so it's not a lot let's don't put that in there okay and then i put a little bit of i'll put a little bit of terpenes in there [Music] i love it when he opens this jar wow how would you like to have gallons of stuff just give us a call pick up the receiver we'll make it i tell you what our terp trap kills i mean and you can do that and that is money money money okay you don't need a lot no you don't want to overpower it right no i mean you should smell this i mean cross contaminated how many kinds are there so you can see it's not dissolving i don't know okay so it's a little bit we can we can do one or two things well obviously uh you can heat it or you can do it you can chew it you can also do a little bit of this yeah oh look at that okay i know exactly what to do we'll put this in a little centrifuge too oh okay we're going to mix it all together and we're going to make it into one homogenous solution i feel like a homogeneous solution oh yeah look at that do a little mixing it is not dissolving that's it i might i might have to add some ethanol to it to dissolve it possible oh you can see it is dissolving it is dissolving a little just need some more time and some heat probably it'd probably be some heat maybe you just pour some of this in that's plenty of pour some of this in go ahead make your own go ahead and make your own i'm going to blow something up here this is some sweet almond oil i like the sweet almond oil jared's there yeah blow something up blow something up you can make a isolated one i'm gonna make a crude one go ahead okay all right here here's this oh yeah put some sweet almond oil in there okay i'm gonna totally put a little bit of peppermint in there and then uh what do you say and then maybe put a little bit of peppermint in there what do you say whatever you want whatever well i don't mind but i mean am i am i like that's kind of fun okay that's that's enough of that i i we don't have heat but that's how you would how would you dissolve that uh first of all if you were using like vegetable glycerin you have a very hard time getting it in you'd have to heat it up and it's not it's not really it's not really soluble very because it's not very soluble in vegetable glycerin okay so um you would need to do something with it within mct oil though you can see it's it's dissolving but it's slow it's going to take a little bit of time to do that um i'm going to i'm going to actually take it out and then and then fortify it with some isolate okay all of these really cool tools i have no idea yeah i'm gonna smell it first well that smells great okay now i'm going to um there's my slight i'm going to fortify this with some isolate i think it's boiling and there's no heat oh man what occasional listen what are you doing don't blow up the r d lab yeah they they will not let us in here anymore they kicked me out a long time ago i remember when we were doing our vape formulations we're sitting here all weekend long this whole place if you just you couldn't see anything you're like boy i'm really relaxed we go outside we take a nap come back in okay i do think at one point down the road we need to take you out really good and maybe next week we'll make popcorn in the gemco oh yeah we can do that alvin we have to pre pre-pre-look at that all right so in this i have the peppermint i put a little bit of our uh flour tea from nature's crest by the way and then i put a little bit of distillate in here and i know distillate is so see what happens yeah now normally you would be taking notes you'd be measuring everything out like like a good chemist would do so that you would know what i am not a good camera we'll see this has got a lemon terpene uh mct with it should be very terpene i'm going to try it it's all for fortified did i did i tell you that you don't need a lot of peppermint that's a lot of peppermint okay i won't have to brush my teeth for like a week i think you'll be you'll be burping uh peppermint peppermint yeah here we go i'm gonna try this one now what'd you get i made it in the right proportions dude did you yeah well this is good is it yeah um will it cut the peppermint a little bit no it's got well it's got let me see here what it's got it's got uh lemon oil terpeneless lemon oil it's got a little bit of these terpenes you know uh one thing about terpenes is is that they do have a burning characteristic yeah so you always have to limit them this is especially when you're doing your vapors uh you want to make sure you limit your terpenes otherwise you're going to have a lot of burn that's that's that's very lemony it's very limiting can i try yeah sure maybe that's quite the dropper did i make it that's kind of flails that's good lemon this definitely has it's got a little bit of that lemon rind it takes to it because i can taste in the back like you know like a lemonade okay okay that's not lemon rind it's zest for those of you who cook it's called zest okay all right yes that's what you make oh that's good yeah it definitely that was good it definitely is way better than mine way way better this is this is basically a isolate fortified um crude oil um mct with a lemon no yeah lemon zest it definitely has um it has limonene in it for sure and it's got a little little in it little which is kind of a little which is a terpene it definitely has it say that five times okay all right and i put some of this in there too i know but see that is sweet thank you for being here and thank you for enjoying our tincture creation mad scientist r d lab here so this is awesome let's do a recap okay okay first uh first we had a uh a wonderful uh presentation that i put together yes yes it was really four slides you said three what was it it's kind of a bait and switch and then get the calculators go go on the calculators give us some feedback on them uh things like that please do that um and then we tried you know we did a an extraction basically an ethanol extraction using everclear and some stuff uh and some of this uh some of this blend here you can see it's still it's still in there you might want to extract it again and again but yeah you can do that with really good tea your friend does um golden water turtle tea and you can you can fuse that like seven times so that's probably the same thing you can do here you can just keep pouring and running and go yeah and you can use um in terms of uh so that's one way to do it if you're doing an ethanol extraction you can use distillate you can use crude you can use isolate um and then you know the and you can totally get this stuff online just yeah like amaretto has all the flavors i would okay there's some couple different things when you buy amaretti flavors be careful you want to buy the oil soluble flavors you don't want to buy the water-soluble flavors because they they are not very miscible in other words they won't really go into the cooking and you so you might like oh i like that flavor i like that flavor and then you have a whole bunch of them and they're like water-soluble so don't buy those i'm just say i just saved everybody a hundred dollars oh there you go don't buy the watershed oh hey barney has another quick question um he didn't know terpenes burn oh he did oh yeah yeah why would they burn well they're well because they're organic just like any anything else organic will burn like mct oil will burn um you know if you light you can light distillate on fire obviously so so he's not talking about like every clear burn that burns when you taste oh yeah yeah okay he's talking about you can light it on fire oh yeah you can do that too you can do that too so it's a good thing we don't have anything hey hey you know okay so i don't think i was involved in the formulation of these um well let me see here some is that about to change but the strawberry one is actually quite good and i still have a lot of lemons so if i if i took this would i have lemon strawberry yes of course i'll have peppermint strawberry i'm gonna have peppermint spaghetti for dinner tonight probably strawberry fields forever straw oh i still want to sing oh that should be next week's episode no sing along karaoke okay all right okay so then um an optimum thinner for people looking oh okay thinner to vape oils be very careful with thinners okay that you do you guys remember the um the vape crisis yes okay yeah um like for example um a lot some of the compounds used in the thinners that were used uh which which are terpene thin thinners essentially uh we're but the vitamin e acetate which was a problem so be careful about what you're using look at the ingredients and a lot of times people will say oh they'll say okay here's a terpene thinner for you they won't tell you what it is you can't use that because you don't know what it is and someone might actually uh for vape you know sure might get in trouble so don't use anything that you don't have like you know what everything what it is sure so yeah just just and there's a just because it's healthy to ingest doesn't mean it's healthy to vape that's correct that's correct and the other thing there is that if yeah i mean people died because they took that vitamin e acetate which is an oil yeah you know and they were vaping it so yeah so be very careful with the thinners because they're proprietary and people don't want to tell you what's in the thinner you should never use that so don't do that okay thank you for the 100 samantha awesome and uh chris has a quick question about nano emulsification still use oil based not water based um okay so using water-based you can use uh like a water base with a nano emulsion that's great i would do that um we have some water-based you know like one shots or something like that we can do that this time but we we could have and basically sounds like a future episode yeah yeah you can get all kinds of fruity flavors in there um so um those are typically uh used in like uh like water formulations like uh you know like sodas and uh seltzer waters and and like shots like energy shots and things like that i know people also sell them as quote-unquote tinctures uh you know why not you can put it in the tees and things like that so that also works um and there's a lot of different ways to nano emulsify okay a lot of it involves like equipment basically you need a high pressure homogenizer or medium pressure or a low pressure homogenizer and you can get with a low pressure homogenizer you can get down to the micron level your um your water is going to be a little cloudy and you're always going to taste it a little bit on the back of your tongue um but yeah it works sure yeah and then as you go down into the nano size and the nano emulsions that are occurring sometimes people use a combination of of emulsifiers which are chemicals which i'm not a big fan of but you know they're used in foods and things like that um and uh what else there and also high shear homogenization sure so that's like equipment plus chemicals is what you need there and it'll work it works just fine um we have done formulations that way we have some great formulations along those lines we could probably try try some of those okay yeah so i love it okay um so one of the other questions and by the way chris said they are using water sweet good good chris okay so next week we need to announce what our topic is for next week yeah i'm getting late and here's what are you thinking i don't know okay one of the things that i've thought of i mean these are things that we need to do we can we've been in the r d lab here now um what about going outside we could what about shucking and bucking we could do that yeah i mean that's an option yeah i mean you know most of the crops are in now right yeah but that where that would probably be uh like a harvest thing right so that would probably be what they need to be thinking about yeah we could do that yeah what what they need what the tools are that are coming up whether you're indoor or outdoor because now they have to start budgeting and thinking and what they're doing and you know you want i'm a planner yeah okay that's fine i mean that that's something we could do we could do that um the other things that we can do is talk about you know um protocols between the rooms yep i mean there's a lot of things we can talk about venting we can talk we could even go into you know some of the condensing potentially i don't think anybody you know are our super technical topics yep those are those are those tend to you know there's uh we could do some of those but i think we just want to do like demonstrations and things like that so what do you think yeah yeah okay so what what do you what do you what what is your music any thoughts out there we'd love to hear from you yeah okay so otherwise it'll be a surprise we will be announcing it in a couple of days what we're doing right and it's one of these three topics right so let's go all right well done great show thank you for being here look at all our resources calculators mini courses our blog posts white papers everything they're out there for you to use congratulations again

an acronym for one of the cannabinoids in the cannabis plant honestly as far as medicinal value all of the cannabinoids are medicinal but the association of THC is generally the fact that people use it to get high CBD does not get you high yet is known to relax you nine times out of ten the people that are using CBD really lead CBD medically elite focuses on CBD we do everything from breeding the seeds all the way to the extraction and purification process our products go through the gambit really from things that you could combust to skincare products I personally have been a cultivator since 1996 and so I've had a lifelong passion for the plant guy came from an IT security background ended up running one of the world's largest team of computer hackers and during that time I was still cultivating cannabis but the real birth of the company to where everybody quit their jobs and said this is what we're gonna do professionally was when Colorado legalized in 2014 our laboratory space is approximately 2,000 square feet it's in a former cleanroom environment all right so we start with stripped plant material and then we load that material into a column that crude extraction comes out as an oleoresin it goes from that into a alcohol bath and that basically precipitates all of the waxes fats lipids out of the solution and then we have to remove the alcohol from the oil in a rotary evaporator you're using controlled heat lots of vacuum and a condenser once it is through that process we fractionally distill the oil which removes impurities through a boiling point process and essentially the purified substance crashes out of solution it took us about 50 pounds of raw material to get to this one kilo of purified isolated it's basically organic chemistry 101 you're dealing with rotary evaporators you're dealing with Buechner funnels and vacuum assisted filtrations you're dealing with fractional distillation stills so yeah the labs pretty advanced especially for a cannabis industry the benefits of CBD are still being discovered on a daily basis you know generally speaking it's an anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic it's a neuro protectant people are using it for everything from breast cancer to epilepsy to aching joints and stress relief so we've seen CBD change people's perception of what cannabis is on a significant level I mean barring any unforeseen federal intervention I see the future of CBD as largely limitless right I don't even think CBD necessarily belongs in a dispensary environment I think the future of CBD is in everybody's home food and or medicine cabinets it'll become more and more commonplace as people realize what it is and what it can do for you [Music]", "kwNe1LBbEjY": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to make kind of brownie using distillate so let's get into it [Music] all right so the ingredients that i need to make this recipe would be a quarter cup of water a half a cup of vegetable oil and two eggs what i'm going to do is i'm going to replace the vegetable oil with a half a cup of peanut butter so the first thing we need to do is make our can of butter all right to make my peanut butter i'm going to be using 1 gram of banana kush distilling so what we need to do first is loosen the oil so i'm going to get some hot water and put my discipline into that bowl and let it sit for about one to two minutes but let's get into it [Music] all right guys so while your discipline is sitting measure out your butter [Music] now add a teaspoon of lecithin [Music] and now at your discipline [Music] now i mix everything together all right guys so now what i'm going to do is put this on a pot and let it simmer on low heat for about 10 minutes so well let's get into it all right my can of butter is now done so let's start working on the brownie so the first thing we want to do is add our brownie mints i'm going to be using dark chocolate brownie mix [Music] now add your eggs [Music] add a quarter cup of water [Music] add a teaspoon of vanilla extract [Music] add your peanut butter [Music] now mix everything together [Music] once your mix is fully incorporated add it to a baking tree [Music] hmm [Music] hmm [Music] all right so i recommend purchasing a baking tray that have these dividers it's going to make sure that all of your brownies are the same size so just keep that in mind but now i'm going to put this in the oven so let's get into it [Music] so [Music] all right my canon brownies is now done so at this point i can eat my brownies like this if i want to however i want my brownies to be a little bit stronger so what i'm going to do is infuse some chocolate and add it to my brownies so let's get into it turn your stove on high [Music] add a pot to your stove [Music] once your water begins to boil reduce your temperature to low heat [Music] now add a bowl to your pot [Music] now this is what we call the double boiler so now what i'm going to do is add my chocolate to this bowl i'm going to be using chocolate chips but you can use regular chocolate if you want to [Music] now we're just going to wait until our chocolate begins to melt all right guys my chocolate is starting to melt so what i'm going to do to expedite the process is i'm going to get this spatula and just stir my chocolate [Music] all right guys my chocolate is completely melted so now i'm going to add some can oil to my chocolate i'm going to be using keep oil but you can use peanut butter or regular kennel oil doesn't matter but um let's get into it [Music] now i miss everything together all right my infused chocolate is now done so now we're going to add it to our [Music] brownies [Music] [Music] [Music] alright my kenneth brownings is now done thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe peace you", "jbn9-JQgw28": "[Music] what we have here is a sample of what we would get out of a supercritical run pressures of about 1,800 psi you can tell the consistency is a little syrupy kind of thick so harden up a little bit if you've got it in a fridge but what we're going to do now is go through the process of taking the plant waxes and fats out of this and come up with a sample that looks like this and this sample is good enough to pull up into a syringe and load it up into a vape pen we'll start the process here we'll go through the steps and see what it takes so first what I've got here I'm warming up some alcohol this is 200 proof pure alcohol we find it's a little easier to mix these two together when the alcohol is warm got a hot plate you can put it on a hot plate and use that as well just for convenience I have this sitting here so this is what we did I'm dry off the bottom we're going to take this over to the scale we're going to weigh it with this sample and what I found is about a ten to one ratio is what's been working well you know ratios you could use but ten to one seems to work really well for us so what I've got here is about 800 milliliters so that means I'd use about 80 grams of extract here so we'll stare that out zero the scale and we will dump in about 80 grams of this all right close enough and now what you want to do is make sure that you've got this sample stirred together as well as you can there's methods for doing this as well just for our sake right now I'm just going to stir it up it's the same stick here that I've put it in with but you want to get a blend here you want to get this whole thing blend together so you don't see a mix here at all they self they actually sell plates you can stick this on that will warm this up with stir sticks on them as well so that you can sit there and have it automated and stirring a product for you but you definitely want to get a good mix on that so you don't have any any clumps or anything like that I can see clumps on the bottom so make sure you get all that off mix all that together as well as you can okay well after we've gone through that process what we're ready to do is I like to throw a glove over the top of that just to keep any contaminants or anything from getting into that and at that point we're ready to put that into the freezer take a look at the sample that we've had in the freezer now we recommend 24 to 48 hours is a good time for for the separation to happen so let's check the freezer its head to the funnel we've got the funnel in the freezer as well the main reason we do that we don't want to shock the sample with heat or with a vast difference in heat so if we freeze the funnel we get that closer to the temperature we're able to preserve some of the oils that might otherwise get damaged with heat let's grab the funnel and the filter now with this process you're going to need a little rubber stopper here that actually just is like a spacer between here and here which creates a seal because we want to hook up a vacuum line into a vacuum pump I'm going to have that in there with a good tight seal and then I'm going to lay my filter in all right back to that and we've got a little spray nozzle this is a spray nozzle alcohol I will take this and I'll pre soaked this filter just to make sure we get a good seal with the bottom of the funnel you see the bottom of the funnel has holes in it and when we turn on the back you're going to see that suck that paper right down to the bottom of that funnel and that's what we want that way we keep the edges filled so we don't get any of that oil to go past or 100 needs of our filter and back down into our sample once we have our sample ready and we're pre soaked here we've got a seal just start slowly slide that to the top of the filter and you'll start to see it come through first they're poor in the church with his blow pressure then they're taking that out and putting that in the oven and be carving it bring that back in the system is running it at higher pressures you can get everything else flood and then reintroducing it sir boil to the other one so that's for the guys who are hardcore enthusiasts you want the cannabis Terps reintroduce back into you can see what's happening here see the difference here yeah got some liquid here on this side saying salad but here I mean look at all that guys save this and it'll still have a small trace amount of THC in it and they'll take you to make that into lotions or so it's gonna end of my sliced ice cream right looks like though they don't seem what's good left until it's light job scope and with this process and actually refrozen of sample this is you can do this and they save up to three times probably I saw that on your video yeah like two or three times yeah if you wanted to get it receive a lot of very small a lot of times via satellite that rolled and I ran through this yesterday the same process I took this yesterday and I want to see what's going like that it came out real nice and clear see the floating same man so even when it came out real clear looked fantastic and I thought you know there can't be anything left in there sucking in freezer again overnight and there still is so it's really funny I feel like if I ran through that process one more time to go shut down pull the back in and there you can see don't come any to check always what okay so that's what we've separated there with that process okay from there we are going to take it to the rotovap data is really important so you guys are going to do trial and error so the only way you're gonna be able to figure out where you stand is by collecting data yeah right so I'll show you an example of a worksheet that I have that I use of the information that I'm collecting I'm practically and you guys can figure out what works best for you but we found that you know collecting all the data you can just helps give you a baseline and to improve your product and repeatability is such a big thing you want to be able to repeat the same quality of last year this is a two liter flask and it's a standard ground glass joint so you guys wanted fish them last way or anything okay fine tip it down alright and you you want to explain the advantage of this oh sure well we'll see what we're when we're pulling it out depending on the viscosity of the oil when you're finished it can sometimes be very thick yeah and and then it's difficult to get it out of the area what we've done before I'm seeing people do is put the bottle upside down and let it drain we've seen people use a heat gun put it in an oven you know kind of warm up the oil and get it rating that we were doing it the top after we took it off the root of that so it actually flowed out pretty well what this bottle does is it has an adapter piece this isn't f1 it just gives you a wider mount so just easier to get a tool in or anything if you are doing anything nice we'll see getting it out you know these are the standard bottles like I said getting it before out of here if you all becomes very thick this is difficult and you may have to add you know something using the heat gun you don't want to do too much you have a hot spot designing the oil industry yeah so you know you're gentle but at the same time you want the stuff and back into like a hot water bath you could just a warm it up people to get that gentle warming and then put it upside down we just we took it off the rotovap it was still warm and we put it upside down and it was able to flow out okay you know but I'm using it practice it is when you start right yeah yeah it makes it easier use it and really if you're learning from multiple samples of the same things don't worry about getting every last drop out of it it's when you go transferring between different strains something like that yeah you know you're going to have to clean that out even in that case you're not going to necessarily lose at all because you can wash it with alcohol and then have an alcohol flask let's just say let's go between down now that I hear that good so we're going to take this sample though we use a little photo here industries you could use a bigger one if you like I'm singing a Phillies big moment that that whole combo I think Nick was talking about is on the website the combo includes the funnel and this flat for 550 I think Oh to that angle yeah yeah all right the winner will go to the rotovap and this is really easy setup here good thing see how that threads in and out Josh so we're going to bring it out here a little bit got this lip on here it's going to go underneath this clip right here and take it here see it just clipped so what I'll do is I'll start to thread it up a little bit till it gets closer where it won't fall back down just kind of hold it up in place felt like that when we turn the vacuum on the vacuum you don't want to tighten it too much I've too much data and that lip on that is kind of rounded so if you did it was kind of it might have sexy to pop over this know what I mean uh-huh so you just get up there snug like I said when we turn the vacuum on vacuums going to help hold that on there you know so flashings in place now I'll go through this real quick here it's pretty simple easy up and down buttons are up and down up and down for good gonna hit the head ultimatum gotcha okay if I want to say I've got this shows your bottom and solid stop for your bottom basically we're going to come down yeah so it came down and stopped at five point nine okay and you can adjust that just hold this button to set that and then that says here right there kind of like what not good that was probably at the right depth right there to you when you say tool and what I did is I change I changed my zero day the heart stops at zero to say zero yeah yeah so then you can walk around the mic dial dial until the point and if you put it in five point nine then press and hold it then it'll say five nine there that's the new zero well then it will know that and that way you just can't bottom it out you try to hit the bottom of the yes okay so that's up-and-down for that temperature set is right here you have switched up here and now I'm controlling temperature here what yeah I we started it yesterday at sixty see guy Celsius yes and so once we get that set to where we want it and click this button right here that's on and off for the bass there I think Roland just turned it on because I just shut it off so what's happening with this blanking right here to show you that the bat is warming thank you yeah and once it gets to the temperature 60 it stays it okay I said a sample that we came up with her yesterday all those and alcohol says stop condensing then this is a simple and that's when you said you took it and that's about the consistency we're gonna get that okay great and stuff we got with a lot of very hot if that were true sorry this shirt give me that so we started with a message right cool Oh dance hall said yeah that's right there is definitely a nice consistency and quality for putting it so they as realize exactly that's what wind up with this this KNF unit is a fantastic city was great yeah a little bit okay right then I just have one more question for okay just because we're using a different machine you know for ours when you take this and you take this and you hook it up the way that he did on the end of there mm-hm then what would I write there yeah you can have a disconnect at or this is just a hole for us I'll do it I'm just gonna break vacuum on this with this is just the boss I mean so you can disconnect this if you wanted to put you know a key in line if you were going to be doing it on a regular basis you know we didn't want to have to keep pulling this off oh I can say I know a piece of - even though I'm able to - sighs but that's all we've done then I just you know so now there's no vacuum on this you see the get alcohol ooh got yet no nothing so when we do that then we just turn this on 100 I'm hydrated for vacuum for vacuum filtration and the concern is what we're talking about before you don't necessarily want to pull as strong a vacuum as you can because you'll start to pull down you can rip the paper or start to tear those sounds and things down through the paper and then you're gonna have to do it you know another filtration and seventy-five to a hundred it's a little bit of a general you know you don't our machine 75 to 100 okay you don't need to pull all the way down to a you know a descending vacuum for filtration you you just want a vacuum assist just help me counselor how we looking Roland getting down then let me get to either will it stops dripping you know right now pretty much got yeah and that's the question to its you know you're saying it's much thicker so the question is how much alcohol you want to take out do you need to remove all of it well for face you think yes and that's a question what you're doing you know what you're going to do with this afterwards yeah put edibles we'll just take it straight out of the first one take all the wax out right if you don't have to do those steps you know I don't know that's awfully push it is easier to work so Nick this morning that a lot of guys can take our customers have been taking some of this extract straight out of the cup and then just mixing that diluting that and there's solutions out there PPG are probably propylene glycol isn't like that they using e-cigs right but and then this coconut oil a more natural approach right so the guys can take that right out of cup and mix that with that consistency that's good enough to go into a pen right so a lot of guys are doing that just like that the problem becomes you're cutting the concentration of your extract so right you're you got the plants and are the the fats and waxes mixed in with that too which will cause some issues in a bait pen right yeah so you're cutting concentration risks you're not so and then also they introduce terpenes from other plants you know terpenes are common throughout the plant families after you have like say this right here would be fantastic because this is just your straight oil we haven't cut this with anything right - alcohol I see how that is turning the syrup and you can just kind of see the syrup in that normally the one that he gets moved after huh you can do that yeah you just unscrew this one we can I counted this it comes with both oh it does yeah come come both yeah so you'll have at least two flat all right this is Swiss made a mess German to release the back yep so over here about to hi Todd but not yes yeah it's been ticket row yeah okay push and hold that long I push the stop button first I hit I'm in just push and hold Vince out come in this and come back up yep there you go right you transfer it out of this would be a lot easier I like to wear the gloves it gets sticky your stuff is tough to get off your hands right you really only need to get real crazy with cleaning like that when you're going to change strange writing you running different materials and you want to make sure you don't have any cross-contamination then that's when you need a about cleaning right this is one and they've got they've got this too but they got the two liters right that's correct yeah so this is a three litre usually gonna be a bit smaller than this one it will still have to hang tight yes the opening here so you could definitely get in there with a better tool and get that clean down so much is good yeah exactly and again washing that off if you're going to change samples washing that off with alcohol real well and saving that alcohol and a flask that is just for that sample will be the way to do that and this fits right on - right this fits right onto here yeah it is funny so that's it okay same setup the only other thing I didn't really show you on this is a the ability to adjust see what this is doing is tilting the whole thing and so that's so you can figure out how to get the majority of this into the water right so for your flute sitting here you can adjust the angle great exactly just depends on what you've got in there so you got the ability to do that in the end okay I think you guys will have no issue with any of this equipment and this is probably more complicated than that so I don't think you'll have any issues with that you know as far as a cleaning process hey did I really just say that it's first cleanup or anything else on this maintenance wise do we have anything if they have to standard maintenance you know there is a two-week sit if every splashing there's a tube that runs through here and there is a seal in the top here we just take this office here that you know there's a problem with the seal it won't hold vacuum so see how this comes apart I'll do is if you could hold this so that way I don't have to take any of the coots or wives or or even the bottom off okay okay so that that's all together okay this comes off don't think your name to rubber seals holding that in place on inside there's a button underneath I'm sort of doing it okay okay cuz otherwise this your spins can't press the button underneath and then locking blue okay now this is a yo-yo Scotty so this is the part that will wear out over time but we shouldn't be talking about any time in the near future so now you know to me again but we have these available and I think they're about 60 bucks and then it clicks into place so where this could have lights in you I see that oh yeah yeah so that seems easy to take out and clean as well if you have to where you get the bump we're talking about is oil carryover then you can see how this comes before it yeah why would you have that much maintenance if you do it the right way you do it later yeah after cleaning itself yo this girl is actually on first yeah you kind of feel just by rocking that around where that needs to be all right that's it let's just for just four stakes here figure out what the dump the rest is in here and we'll go get an idea on how much of the alcohol we actually uncovered that's about where I started it is amazing when you watch that we just had this nasty concoction of stuff put together with this and we were able to make it look so clean right alright well what's happening is I mean alcohol is a different boiling point then then the other oils too so even water so I mean when you figure out what that temperature is with the vacuum it makes the process extremely you're going to leave that much in there but again gets you a little spray bottle with your alcohol and then just spray it down and then I like to just give it a shake shake everything up try and cook the whole inside of it and then just clean all that up and save all that into another flask lay down label it whatever if if you're not just dump it out reuse it just dump this out and just put any sample in here if you got the same sample there's not much worried to clean it like that well I think that about covers that you guys [Music]", "n89hueeyme4": "I want to get some special infused honey for the Pakistani desert that Fatima's gonna be making so I'm meeting up with David Bond villain who makes these really fantastic little infused honey Spears and he's gonna show us how to make them David we're gonna be having an infused Pakistani dinner and for the dessert we wanted to get a really special kind of infused honey because Pakistani desserts use honey and a lot of really tasty waves heck yeah so great let's do this we basically just takes some distillate so we got a bunch of CBD distillate here so basically four thousand milligrams of CBD is what we're working with yep and we mix agar into it and on the magnetic stirrer so agar is like a thickening agent right yeah it's like you know it keeps it more vegetarian so you're not using just regular gelatin I love those magnetic stirrer yeah they're cool we got AB organic kinky butter we will mix in the ghee and we'll give it a little more heat so now we have a good blend of our butter and Annapolis yep now we have some acacia honey and a little bit of sunflower lecithin what is the Leveson do it's an emulsifier so it helps everything bind together so into our ghee and our distillate we're gonna put a bunch of honey honey and then a little bit of that sunflower lecithin we like using sunflower because you can get non-gmo so now we just wait for this to warm up a bit and then that's our honey butter mix basically we mix that with a little bit of distilled water and agar once that's blended bring it to a quick boil let it cool and when it's at 120 degrees pull it up in a syringe and we drop it in the cold oil but as they go through to the bottom they'll cool they'll solidify we'll leave them in there for a minute pull them out of the oil so now we let them sit in there for a minute can I try one of these yeah grab one big guy you know honey smear mmm right yeah

[Music]", "JxmiRvJ0SS0": "people often ask the question what is the difference between cbn cbg cbd or what is cbn versus cbg versus cbd i like to put them all into the natural health products box although cbn cbg and cbd are all cannabinoids they are all different in that they have specific characteristics and therapeutic properties today we'll talk about those differences so that you can have a better understanding which will enable you to pick the one that most fits your needs the rules regulations and even beliefs for medical marijuana have changed vastly over the last few years hence the surge in studies being done on the therapeutic properties of cannabis let's start by looking at cbd what is it its full name is cannabidiol it is a cannabinoid found in marijuana science has discovered that cbd helps in the treatment of symptoms of anxiety pain insomnia epilepsy the therapeutic benefits include anti-inflammatory analgesic anti-anxiety and seizure suppressant properties cbd is also one of the few substances that has a proven neurogenic factor yes cannabidiol can help your brain grow brain cells even in the adult phase it is easily extracted from cannabis hemp oils are cbd rich concentrates with 0.3 percent thc or less have been labeled for essential use in this covid19 pandemic and are even legal on a federal level now let's look at cbn this was the first cannabinoid to be identified by scientists research into cbn is still not as developed as in thc and cbd studies but it's evolving all the time there are a number of indications that cbn is a potential treatment to a myriad of illnesses it also has many essential properties mainly antibacterial anti-inflammatory anti-convulsant and appetite stimulant and research also suggests that cbn can play a role in bone healing and growth it doesn't have as much psychoactive effect as thc has and in fact some say it has none it comes from aged marijuana strains and some say cannabis age as well like a fine wine i guess it is debatable whether the older strains like cbn have more sedative properties than the younger ones opinions are split on this one lastly there's cbg its full name is cannabigrol also known as the stem cell of cannabis it is an acid that is present in marijuana strains in the early stages of development of the flower its decomposition forms a variety of other smaller acids and these acids formed from cbg can turn into either cbd thc etc similar to stem cells that can transform into every other cell of the human body cannabigrol has similar properties it can turn into a wide variety of major and minor cannabinoids it is intriguing to both scientists and doctors and is also in high demand for many people who are prescribed with marijuana based treatments especially for neurological and psychiatric issues research tells us that cbg boosts the bliss neuroreceptor and andamide the neuroreceptor plays a role in pain depression appetite memory and fertility it is also being evaluated to treat huntington's disease cancer and bacteria like staphylococcus it's completely legal and safe to use as well as a non-intoxicating cannabinoid for more information on any products derived from cbn vcbg vcbd look on or around this page for links to information and places to make a purchase of these products remember to consult your doctor before using any products mentioned in this video now that we have a better understanding of what the three cannabinoids are else should mention that there are in fact over 100 different cannabinoids in the hemp plant the ones we are discussing are among the most popular cannabinoids the key difference between the cannabinoids depends on how psychoactive they are for instance cbd and cbg are not psychologically active whereas cbn and other cannabinoids vary in their level of psychoactivity cbd is the most notable cannabinoid and has significant anti-anxiety effects that also counteract the mental side effects of thc the receptors in our bodies become reactive when exposed to cannabinoids meaning they're able to affect key body processes including mood memory appetite and pain cbg is thought to naturally increase dopamine levels which help to regulate sleep mood and appetite and is also thought to obstruct gaba uptake in the brain and block serotonin receptors both positive implications for the treatment of anxiety and depression cbn even though it is derived from thc doesn't share the psychoactive properties of thc meaning you won't get high from cbn alone it has been studied extensively as a helpful compound to improve sleep health as some studies show it acts as a powerful sedative with effects comparable to common sleep inducing pharmaceuticals like diazepam you may find yourself a bit overwhelmed by all this information on common cannabinoids and wondering how you can find the cbd compound that's right for you and your body needs well with so many cannabinoids to choose from there's likely one to address nearly any concern you will just need to narrow down your choices so start with your symptoms for many common ailments including pain inflammation anxiety sleep issues eczema and acne cbd is an option that's effective and readily available in a wide variety of formats from topical applications to gummies and pills i hope you find

i'm gonna be using one foot gram of discipline next we also need clarify butter and you need some type of container or plastic mold to pour your butter into for me i'm gonna be using a marijuana mold to pour my butter into so what i'm going to do now is add this to hot water just to loosen up the oil [Music] while your discipline is sitting in the water measure out your butter [Music] and now i had a teaspoon of lecithin and now add your discipline [Music] [Music] now mix everything together [Music] all right guys so now what i'm going to do is put this on a pipe and let it simmer on low heat for about 10 minutes so let's get into it [Music] [Music] all right guys so every few minutes you want to stir your butter after 10 minutes remove your glass cup from the pot now mix all the ingredients one more time [Music] all right your ingredients should be fully incorporated so now what we're going to do is add our infused butter to our molds [Music] all right guys once you fill your

capable of doing one milliliter shots it comes attached with a heater controller this one currently I got set to about 110 set it a little bit higher because you know you have the heater on the outside that's wrapping your inside barrel and sometimes a little bit of a heat differential I have some prepared oil here I also have that on a heat pad and then I have some cards right here too so just to start with it you can clean your components and all that kind of stuff but it comes with is a 14 gauge tip it's already pre bent and we also have an extra plunger that goes on in the setting gun in the event that may be soaked in an alcohol and you damaged it you replace it shouldn't need to though it's very easy to disassemble and clean you just unscrew from this end it's very simply product so you install your tip it's a little lock tip Luther locks you know we can buy them all different variations and sizes so you don't have to worry about whatever I give you if it doesn't work for your products you can pick them up and get a bag of 100 of them for 6 bucks the cards I have right here are 1 ml they're also sitting on a heat pad I like to kind of keep my tarts a little bit warm when I'm doing this stuff too so to fill it it's very simple you just make sure you plunge it down into your liquid and you pull back slowly as you're filling it the nice thing is this will stay warm why are you using it ok grab my cards here you want to make sure you depress on the handle entirely sometimes the first shot is a partial shot just because the gun may have not been filled up or backed up all the way but there's my full shot there you just kind of keep moving along pressing the handle all the way there's notches on the inside of the plunger and those notches will ensure that you don't over pull it but if you do under pull it you will get a half shot but it allow them make sure you can fill each cart exactly the same every time we will also have these available in point 5 ml increments those will be coming very soon just gonna finish up this last one all right thanks for watching", "oa-HfwJCqTg": "so today we're going to the labs to see how we can make crystals and other interesting things today I'm gonna show you how to make pure 99% cannabis crystals now it doesn't matter if you make THC or CBD it's the same process here we're making CBD right now in the lab the process is very simple you need a two you need some sand you need some liquid take the extract put it through the column put some liquid inside apply some pressure and there you go you have to wait now if you don't apply pressure you're gonna wait for many days but if you have the pressure it goes very fast you need do it a couple of times in order to get the purity so to get this pure beautiful crystals sometimes up to five times depending on the raw material you have now we have been working very hard to find a way to do this on a coffee machine but I can tell you that I haven't figured that out yet however I think we're gonna work hard on it and in this method you know it's not that simple because you can't buy this everywhere in any supermarket it's very specialized if we look at it in a perspective of CBD and THC first this will be CBD and this will be th see there's a small difference in the molecule so CBD will come out fer first and then teacher will come out so it's very simple just to optimize you have a column okay inside the column you put some very fine sand now you put the mixture of different molecules on top of the sand apply some pressure and the material the sand material will be the filtration material and we'll separate small molecules from big molecules because the small molecules will travel fast so through the sand and the big molecules will travel much slower and some will not even travel if they're too big okay and this is chromatography very simple I'm gonna show you how it works with a color so what happens when you put the extract through and extract you know it's not so colorful you're not gonna see that much but I'm gonna put some color inside so you better can see how it travels through the column now we take the color and we applied in our chromatography machine put the lid on apply the pressure [Music] so the question is whether the crystals appear they will be deluded in your liquid then you have to put it on the coffee machine to evaporate and you will have your pure crystals in the jar simple so let's look at the big machine this machine here is the same as the tube you saw upstairs just much bigger and the pressure system is much bigger here but the principle is the same take the extract this time you take more of it put it into our container and put through the system where we have the sand the small sand yeah and then you get most likely pure can have no it's out in our case pure CBD after doing this process several times next time I'm gonna show you how we do on big scale in real production that's big it's even bigger than this one because to make kilos you need volume you just have to make few grams maybe this will work but we need two kilos so we need a bigger factory for that we tried to make this process simpler and we tried also to develop a method of how to do this in a coffee machine still not working we're working on it how to tell you that and if any of you know how to do it well give us some hints cos we have tough time doing it all right but anyway once we have the solution of how to do it with a coffee machine to pure 99% crystals we will share with you

you're good to go so chromatography explained it's gonna be good i have been anticipating this i've been i've been i've been just rare to go i have too and you know what i learned what'd you learn i learned that hplc is not just the name it's it's actually high performance liquid chromatography wow i had no idea that's great okay dark have you ever seen a dork fan money yeah yeah because i saw you fan money [Laughter] this is 100 million dollars for anybody who wants to know 100 million yeah and we're touching it right here yeah that's right you could you can have your picture we use it for this fake 100 million we use it for bets we do that's exactly what we bet don't we who who who can make it the longest in the gemco [Laughter] no we don't we don't do that honest without hr the secret isn't i i don't have the heat we heat you up what yeah when you get in there you cheat is that what you're telling me that's what it happened you wonder how high you are it's hot let's see if we can get let's see if we can decarboxylate i have been decarboxylated a couple of times okay and that's even hard to say but you can say chromatography yes chromatography column high performance liquid chromatography we should just add those as little buttons here i know right because this is cool anyway i know you i'm guessing just going out on i'm guessing there's a table there's a table there's a table there's a table you did it you guessed it so i got a presentation i went i get the hundred million dollars we ain't bad it's not fair i still got the 100 million i don't care it's just money okay so thank you get your questions in we're going to talk i know you had some opening remarks that you wanted to talk about some preamble on chromatography yeah yeah well i just wanted to basically say i'm really excited about this topic because it's one of those one of those things that we've been um you know i've been i'm a trained chromatographer um it's kind of my credentials i've been doing it for over 20 years and um you know it's been it's been a good ride separations of various kinds but specifically in chromatography so column chromatography happen to know a lot about it and i like to kind of teach about it so it's fun to do so chromatography is your jam yeah it is my jam right so has been for a long time is that is that like doctor jam doctor chromatography dr chromatography john john johnny chromatography dr johnny t chromatography i like it that's totally incorporated okay okay whatever okay so what i do have is uh is a presentation of course yeah well you know really just to get us going so let me aren't we excited when we started so this is only only like 50 slides it only takes five minutes don't worry it's it's uh where are my sound effects oh no turn that sound effecting off we gotta get rid of that sound effects for you nope okay they're here okay so here i'm going to share they taught me how to do new things here i'm going to share my screen all right here we go who said you can't teach old dogs new tricks uh yeah it looks like that is yeah now i want to make sure that i'm going to stop sharing here one one moment here i actually want to share an application window that's what i want to do all right share all right there we go all right i'm gonna share it technology there we go all right um so let's get started uh we're gonna talk about chromatography um united science as you all know is a um is a company that produces equipment brands um pier 99 co2 cage strain droid track lab carbon x which is a nano structured carbon material it's a one of our flagship products we started back in 2009 2010 that's what we were doing uh igw lab which is a software hardware combination for um you know for basically laboratory uh limbs which they call laboratory information management and quality management so that's that's a hot product and uh people are of subscribing um people are buying the hardware it's pretty great because it's made specifically for the hemp and for the uh you know cannabis industries and clear still and frectron these are our distillation offerings so we have a lot of a lot of things to offer someone who wants to get into the business of hemp extraction and the pure 99 is our flagship chromatography product and really it's it's aimed at those people who want to do larger scale what's called preparative chromatography uh you know in other words they want to take the thc out of the cbd okay i always ask them what do you do with all that thc after you take it out of the cbd and they never say see i wonder why yeah they never say and i well whatever how do you think we got this hundred million dollars they're coming for us come on okay let me see here i'm going to advance this thing here um but it's fake 100 million so uh blast from the past uh this is essentially uh a slide that i took out from a presentation that i gave at canacon okay i think it was in seattle in 2015. wow yeah where do you see a bc 2015 bc and uh this is when we were we were this is this is actually in cannabis timeline i mean it is i mean it's just kind of you know grown and grown and grown so it was a millennial very it was a long time ago like cannabis years like dog years you know cannabis years and human years they're different okay i love it they're different anyway so we were doing this quite a while ago um you know we were um really looking at you know what what how you would really engineer a formulation and so what we decided to do is buy a big chromatography column because we are chromatographers and we decided to start doing separations and we were we were separating out large amounts of thc from cbd at that time and we were putting them back together in ratios okay so this is what we were getting we were getting starting off with uh 15 cannabinoids and like a dewaxed type of um you know winterized material and then uh basically using hplc in a large scale injecting you know 30 30 you know 30 grams 40 grams at a time onto the column and then changing it up so you'd have both thc and cbd let's kind of advance then i'm going to talk to you a little bit about what is chromatography let's get right into this okay chromatography is a separations technique that separates out compounds of interest into their individual components um meaning if you have you know different uh components in a liquid mixture and you want to separate out compound a from compound b you can do that with a liquid chromatograph um this right here is actually a kind of an illustration i think it's a movie here let me see if i can get it so this is a illustration of a chromatography process first you have your sample in the solvent and you put that onto the column uh and most of the molecules are stuck on the column but some of the molecules which don't interact with the column at all are discarded in the first vessel i have it labeled their waxes then they put a second solvent on there the second solvent basically interacts more with the solvent than with the column and they're eluded into a separate vessel and then you add a different solvent yet a different solvent and cbd then interacts with that solvent more than the vessel uh more than the particles and it goes into a second vessel so therefore you have a separation and that's what's great and some of this kind of and when you're when you talked about the column the chromatography column right is is that kind of what we're looking at here on this slide so what is it what is it the column let me narrate it okay so yeah i guess here this is the column you can see the little particles in there okay those are typically five uh or 10 micron particles that can be larger if you're using a flash column flash columns are typically 35 to 60 63 microns in diameter so they're not what they call mono disperse there's a whole different variety if you have a column that's got like 10 micron particles usually they're all pretty much 10 microns wow so that's what's called mono disperse okay and typically what they do is they pack those into a column now this is all low pressure type of column here that's being illustrated but fundamentally um the the concept is the same where you have uh this set of eluents here or this set of analytes here you're trying to separate it out from this set of of analytes and so you add it to the column and you can see the green ones stick to the column and the red ones elute right away so you are now eluded diluted analytes yeah and you do that with this so yeah so anyway that that's how that goes so um they're separated out as a function of time okay so typically the combined equipment and technique they're it's used all over the world i mean in every industry you can think of except for maybe technology which is like uh you know software or stuff in the cloud they don't they don't really use that but if you have something that's real you know like any kind of food or you know pharmaceuticals nutraceuticals mining anything along those lines you're going to be coming in contact with some sort of chromatography because people want to be able to measure and control you know their processes so that's exactly what's happening here um many different types of chromatography you got gas chromatography gc gc yeah and uh yeah you use that for measuring volatiles for example um you know people would use that to measure like solvents uh in in an oil for example um or liquid chromatography they would use those to measure or separate out you know different kind of analytes that are in the liquid form and then there's thin layer chromatography and then there's other forms of chromatography too but i'm not going to really talk about those here i'm going to focus on column chromatography at this point okay and um so like i said it's distinct from membrane separations it's distinct from liquid liquid separations if anybody wants to take a look at some presentation we made what three four weeks ago on different extraction techniques and all the different permutations of different extraction techniques that you could you could use and do you're welcome to go ahead and take a look at that video so let's advance on to the next slide here um again here's a here's a basically the same slide we saw before just to just just to illustrate now what we're doing is we have a mixture here of thc and cbd and we're actually separating that out in time this is a time axis here and if i had a little um jar here and i collected just this time all that would only be thc you see that gotcha yep and if i had another jar a separate jar and i only collected out this that would be than just cbd so that's exactly what's happened here and here and you can see that those are um breakable um yeah they're yes yeah he went for the he went for it couldn't help himself okay you teed it up all right so there it is anyway so yeah so that's what that is it's very clear okay so um where is chromatography used in hemp and marijuana processing okay first of all uh analytical uh chromatography is used to measure like potency purity and identity and that's used basically at most all of these stages from uh you know from the quarantine you receive it you're checking out you know maybe the farmer tells you he's got 10 percent and and you measure in your lab he's he's actually got five percent or maybe 12. maybe he's got 12 in there and you're you're doing pretty good um in quarantine you're measuring things like okay does it free from metals is it free from pesticides and you're using chromatography to do that so and then that's the hplc yeah that is the hplc absolutely and then same thing with the decarboxylation process you would measure like the ratio of acids to to neutrals so again at every step of the way you're using some sort of chromatography whether it's a hplc or gc okay but here's what we're really talking about today and what we're going to be focusing on is is how do we create a broad spectrum a preparative chromatography okay and there's a couple different ways to do that you can you can feed your broad spectrum distillate with this with with basically um distillate so you would feed the distillate into the broad spectrum distillate and you would get you would use chromatography then to separate out the thc from the cbd and or you could you could basically crash it out and isolate and then clean it up with with your chromatography there so um you can see here what i have is this this progression and that's really where it's used that's excellent and just so you know out there questions are coming in they're flying in so i just want you to know where we've got a team that's answering a lot of those questions we don't interrupt this presentation because this is a little more detailed but uh keep asking the questions and we've got a team answering them as we go sweet all right good deal um so let me advance to the next one so why do we need chromatography i'm going to attempt to answer that you see that beautiful leaf back there um that's uh all those beautiful trichromes chrome's trying to remember what you call them they're little little mushrooms i just like just remember a mushrooms little mushrooms they're they're trichromes resinous mushrooms and you you know if you take and you squeeze the flour your your you'll get some of that resin on your fingers right and it'll be a little sticky so um yeah that's where all of the cannabinoids lay in there and the deal there is in that trichrome you have resins you have terpenes that are made there you have you know different phytonutrients that are in there there's different chlorophylls for example that are that are in there or xanthophylls and you want to separate out all those things and and make it pure so that's why you need chromatography in the hemp world okay okay this is a illustration of why you need to have chromatography specifically for hemp okay okay this first pie graph is for hemp and you can see here this is a unextracted hemp and say it's got 61 percent by weight biomass and then you have cannabinoids at 12 percent and this is um let's say that this is a compliant with a farm bill so it has less than 0.03 percent uh by weight thc so this would be fit for commerce this would be sent to the extractor to extract now as soon as it gets extracted and you start talking about distillate which is the center now you're talking about you can see how the the concentration of thc now has increased because you removed all the water you removed part of the waxes you removed part of the terpenes and now you have the biomass so as a percentage weight per weight it's much greater and here you're actually concentrating the thc which is exactly what extraction is supposed to do right okay um okay so then when when you want to basically remove that thc you use chromatography or you use an isolate technique or what's called thc remediation to basically remove that thc and make this which is called broad spectrum and you can see the broad spectrum now has gone to zero percent thc or non-detect thc and the cbd is there so this would be fit for commerce and in fact a lot of people are actually desiring and they want the broad spectrum versus the distillate because they don't want to have the thc in there that's right so in this in this slide you've got raw yep and you've got full spectrum full spectrum distillate yeah and then your broad spectrum which is the same but with the thc removed right exactly and and this arrow here is what chromatography does or or other what are called thc remediation techniques okay and there's several of them and i'll kind of go over what okay awesome yep cool so let me kind of move on here so that oh there's a there's a beautiful ball jar of this is a very large one-liter jar we i think we have that here uh what is it last week that was before last i mean it's a really big jar um well you made me taste it yeah we did was it good yes okay is that the right answer i don't know i don't know i don't usually go around tasting things randy like that uh but but yeah no it was uh basically a broad spectrum thc it's called thc nd thc non-detected because because it's not really thc free there's always a very trace amount and you know analytical chemists they see everything and so you know it's not technically correct to call it free because there always be a molecule in there so at some point in the future that's a good point because at some point in the future um there's a the the ftc or the fda will be coming down on people who talk about tea free stuff it's really yeah that's already that's already happened so yeah and they have um you know we'd like to call it something else but uh the preferred term from the fda is thc non-detect non-detect so use non-detect not free right because it's not free right right there may be a couple molecules in there or three four molecules or whatever so you can always see it um just like just like solvent residuals you can always see them you know so whether you like it or not yeah okay um a lot of people want to be able to use like short path distillation or they want to use their white film distillation to get the thc out from the cbd and it kind of makes sense they're saying hey look here i have i have this thca here or i have the cbg here and you can see the boiling points a lot higher for thc and then look at where cbc is and cbn you think you'd be able to use distillation to do this cbd thc separation because it's on boiling points right so why couldn't you well the answer is you you can't um because it's the resolution is not so good in other words you're only taking out classes of molecules so um it's kind of like a broad ax it's it's not it's not a scalpel it's not precision okay and everything's kind of smearing together as it comes out so you don't really get that clear concise uh you know separation the way you do with chromatography so um the answer to the question about whether or not you can use your short path apparatus or work on some kind of white film distillation to do with cbd and thc separation the answer is no you can't do that um it just it isn't uh hasn't been hasn't been worked out yet because they're pretty close i mean yeah in that center column there yeah here's cbd and here's thc and typically for like molecular distillations you have to have 20 30 degrees celsius difference and you know it's almost there but it's not quite there if you wanted to separate out like acetone from cbd that would be very easy to do with a short path or a white film but um that's because the boiling points are so different okay so that makes sense so yeah that's awesome yeah so that's why you need to use um chromatography so what makes a good separations technique you know a lot of people have different uh different views about um you know which technique might be good for thc remediation and you know this is kind of a list of check boxes that i go through when i think about what is a good technique yeah i would say that the economical factors are probably really really high up there even though they're occurring low on this list i mean it has to meet the criteria of being viable economically right absolutely if you're not going to if you if it's going to cost you too much then you can't do it at all so forget about it and what i'm talking about there are the operating costs capital costs typically are not impacting your bottom line to the extent that operating costs are they're impacting it through depreciation okay a different topic for a different time but really if you really want to think about you know improving your gross margin improving your net margin proving your profit cash flow really what you're talking about is making sure your operating costs are low so absolutely um that's i would say that's the number one thing but you know there are some other things you know like you want your method to be non-toxic right you don't wanna you don't wanna you know you wanna have good solvent removal if you end up using the solvent remove the solvent and then um you know high mobility selectivity and this is kind of a big deal we're going to be talking about selectivity here and again in the next couple slides so um so that's that's that so these are the kind of the criteria for what makes a good technique also low waste you know that's a big deal if you have a technique and you have a whole bunch of waste um it just isn't going to be you know that costs there's a weight there's a cost to the waste if if you're if you have for example um you know a lot of biomass and it has a lot of solvents in it that's a waste that you have to pay someone to get rid of okay so um you know you got to watch out for those costs that are waste so what are the steps for chromatography separation um well let me let me kind of go through them with you one one of them every chromatography workflow that i've ever seen always starts off with some sort of sample preparation so you have a sample you want to make sure that it's it's cleaned up a little bit before you put it onto your column so it's actually the separation before the separation okay and um and you know sometimes like for example um you wouldn't want to you know if you had trying to think of a good example but um trying to get oh well like with thc and cbd that like if you're coming out of your uh system you might have waxes in there you want to make sure that those waxes are out before you do your chromatography and that's why people use distillate or isolate to feed the chromatography system so a lot of people actually start to they go they crash out they'll make isolate and then they'll take the isolate dissolve it and then they'll do the chromatography so a lot of people do that wow they filter you typically you want to filter it you don't want to have a lot of uh you know gunk in there or free from foreign matter and debris is what typically you want to do so typically you want to have a drain droid for that drain yeah because that'll get you um you know that'll take your sample which is a you know large it's on the order of um you know typically you're talking about um you know 20 to 100 liters at a time that you're making up right and you want to make sure that you have that's a lot yeah it's a lot that's nice you want to filter it all okay so you want to have a big enough filter and then you want to have the right concentration of the input on the concentration and then you want to have and then you also want to have some some methods uh prepared we've had a couple of technical issues that's funny and i was just pointing out the fact that his battery is running low on his computer so we we may or may not run through here we go the the the slide so anyway we we just needed that minor thing so as you're asking about that the question that i have is crash out you you use the term crash out yeah and that was when they go right from that was when when you take a distillate and you would crash it out in other words you would um try to make isolate out of out of the distillate okay yeah so some people will like um they'll start off with a distillate they'll crash out the cbd and then they'll run the the stuff that's not crashed out okay they'll run that to get rid of the thc and then they'll put them back together oh so that's actually a really great way to do it um it's a little bit less um it's it's an easier separation to do okay um you know the other thing would be if you wanted to uh look only at you know taking that isolate the stuff that has been crashed out and not make it so pure and then you know more or less just uh just just put that through your chromatography machine so yeah so um also so then you got to prepare your method you need to make sure you have a method okay you've brought methods up before yeah yeah we have if you want to learn about methods you can go back a couple uh weeks ago we were talked all about methods right all the different variables on methods yes i know i'm sorry that was me that's good it was good okay and uh you know all the variables that you need and it is it is so vital to have those methods yeah and and also that they're validated exactly so um yeah anyway so you got to have the method and that typically will include a column it'll include it solvent it'll include um you know all of the all the parameters here your temperatures your pressures all of that okay and then you run your sample and you test your fractions with hplc so uh high performance liquid chromatography that's correct you are correct sir i can say that five times really fast try it high performance liquid chromatography high performance liquid chromatography high performance liquid chromatography high performance liquid chromatography higher performance click with chromatography oh boy that's good sorry did i take you off your game no no it didn't at all that was that was good good um okay uh so you run your sample and then you test the fractions with the hplc okay what do i mean by that um let me see if i can give you an example here oh that was a table here i'm gonna go back here i just want to go back through here you're such a tease i know terrible oh right here okay this is i i didn't queue it up right in the presentation but right here oh yeah right there okay those will be every time i see the road of apps okay so but what if i what if i took a little sample of of this here and i took a sample here and i took a sample here and i took a sample here those would all be like 100 pure thc right yeah what if i took a sample right here i would say that'd be like 50 50. because both cbd and thc are there right so i know that because i take these samples along this timeline here i know when the thc is done and when the cbd begins gotcha okay and a lot of times you would use hplc to help you do that and that's how you would take the samples and and make it happen so let me go forward here so sorry i just had some transition music okay this is this is good this is a good one this is a good one i like this we've had our technical difficulties but you know you're going to have to get used to it if you're going to deal with hplc right that's true that's true as with dr john and i and that's why i have sound effects okay so then you're going to optimize and then you're going to remove solvent from the fractions with the following film okay so you're going to have a bunch of pure fractions but you're also going to have solvent there and you're going to want to make sure that you can get rid of that and the following film is a great way to get get rid of the solvent in that case um you could there's a lot of different solvents whenever you say following film i i hear in my head these little screaming molecules as they're falling that that's probably what's happening um what happens when they when they transition from for example the little molecule transition like it's in the liquid and it's being pulled from the liquid don't do it no no it pulls out and it's pulling out and then it goes away oh it's just like a black hole we did we did a podcast on falling film yes if you want to see it we went into this in great detail okay so remove the solvent and the techniques were pretty fun test the residuals with uh gc headspace gc gc gas chromatography all right so there we go i'm i'm just oh it's a table so here we go we finally made it we've arrived we made it to the table okay so there's lots of different ways to remediate okay and i instead of going through each of the different ways to remediate in detail which may uh may be a future podcast and everybody's they'll see what comments we get on that they'll probably be no way don't do it okay but uh column chromatography there's degradation in other words you can take and get rid of the c thc just by cooking it in in the presence of light and the thc will go away wow but so will your cbd that's unfortunate oh yeah there's also liquid liquid separations which are basically um you know partition chromatography or counterflow chromatography they are basically liquid liquid techniques they don't have a column in them um they're solvent techniques essentially and then there's the crystallization technique that we just talked about so um when you use this crystallization technique along with the column chromatography you can see you're getting high high high high so that that's pretty good so that's why people do that okay yeah and you can improve your throughput and you can prove improve your robustness so that's that's kind of the reason why why it happens so let me just kind of go through how i'm comparing these okay um first of all one of the main advantages of column chromatography over say liquid liquid or degradation for sure crystallization is that you're going to get a much higher recovery okay it's it's never going to be perfect like 100 um you know because you're always losing you know even even with transfers you're losing and things like that but your column chromatography by far is a very very efficient technique so if you have 100 cannabinoids coming in you're going to get 95 out okay that's the kind of thing that you're you're looking at um as opposed to like degradation which which means that if you take the thc and you're like i'm gonna try to destroy you and i'm gonna put you under light and i'm gonna put you in heat and i'm gonna try to convert you over to cbn or something along those lines which people do you're you're also going to be degrading the matrix it's going to be like a black sludge and also you're going to be degrading the and changing the cbd so your cbd is going to go down that's what happens to my self-esteem when you put me in the heated gym co yes right yes you're trying to trying to work your way to get out and and i'm just turning up the heat i wonder how long he's going to stay in there okay we do have fun it's all in good good fun it's all in good fun the liquid liquid uh obviously has a low recovery it's not as good as a column chromatography and the crystallization also is not as good you get a lot of what they call cold precipitation that can happen so um you're not getting out you know 100 of the cbd you're not getting it all back okay so you're getting less of a uh of a recovery the selectivity can't be beat with column chromatography and that's that's a big deal because that can really drive your throughput okay so um selectivity really means how far of a separation can you get between your two peaks cbd and thc oh okay and like for example um with your you know you can't really get that good separation with the distillation stuff that we just talked about um so that's not a very selective technique right okay so um column chromatography you can really get that selectivity in other words you can say okay i have i have cbd and cbd only in this in this can and i have uh thc and thc only in this in this time frame okay so it it really is it really is selective the degradation is not selective okay that's because it's degrading everything right so that's not selective okay it'd be great if you could just heat it up and thc would go away into cpn everybody no one would have any problem there'd be no use for chromatography but that would be a problem but but that would be a problem because everything is degrading it's not selective liquid liquid has some selectivity but you get a lot of cold precipitates or get a lot of co-extraction that's happening liquid liquid is a lot like you know bulk extraction essentially um and then same thing with the crystallization you get a high selectivity with crystallization you know you can but does not vary the recovery is not so hot so you get a high selectivity but the recovery is not hot so okay um so these this selectivity here really drives a throughput how much can you put through you through per unit time so here you have a high throughput here for the column chromatography and some people would say well look i don't i don't agree with that at all because uh because my chromatography unit is really slow well you just have the wrong chromatography unit or you have something that's too small for what you're trying to do so you just need to get a bigger unit okay bigger better faster stronger sounds good and um you know on the throughput you know with the degradation the liquid and the crystallization those are all like stir pot techniques so you just get a big pot you can cult all your stuff in there you stir it you know you you control it yeah um liquid liquid there are pieces of equipment that do centrifuges and they have partitioning units and uh they call their craig machines is what they call those um there's there are those machines out there but they're you know i don't know about i guess i don't know the exact throughput number for a cpc machine so i'd have to check that out but but uh they can be pretty high nonetheless um and then the cost per gram the reason i have the cost per gram for column chromatography is so low is because the recovery is so high think about it you're starting with a distillate right and if you the the more distillate you lose i mean that's really costing you a lot because it's a highly refined if you're talking about losing you know two percent of a hemp biomass okay that probably doesn't make any difference because there's hardly any you're not losing hardly anything right but when you're talking about losing you know five and ten and twenty percent of a highly refined uh oil like distillate those costs are very important that you that you are keep those in mind so that's why i have at such a low low number there it's a low cost per gram because the recovery is so high as opposed to degradation which is a it seems like it would be super simple right and super i'm not very costly because um you know you're just heating it up on a hot plate how simple that could be that doesn't cost a lot right no but you're degrading all of the product that you just made so that that's no good and the same thing here with the liquid liquid and the crystallization these ones are primarily driven by solvent costs so that's the one thing now this also can be driven by a high solvent cost if you don't have um the pier 99. the pure 99 is a is a piece of equipment that has an automatic recycler to it so it recycles all the solvents so that's pretty sweet wow um you can see here that column chromatography gets a medium score for the robustness and what that means is that uh your you know if you do what they call injections on the column and you continuously repeat injections again and again and again to try to do more and more separations over time um you know eventually that column is going to kind of wear out sure okay and you need to change the column right with our particular unit that we have on the pier 99 you can the user can go ahead and change that out on his own so he doesn't have to he doesn't have to call us and order another computer or sorry another another column he doesn't have to order he can just come he can order the particles from us and we'll send him the particles and he can just go ahead and so he basically repacks the car yeah he repacks the column himself yeah rather than going back to the manufacturer because it's very inconvenient and expensive oh yeah you know a lot of people are trying to come up with very selective materials i'm kind of in that business myself because of the carbon x but with the selective materials extremely selective materials what they're asking for is very very high costs of your column so you have like the molecularly imprinted columns would be one example i in fact i back in 2014 i was talking about molecularly imprinted columns as being a possibility the issue with that is just it just it's too expensive i can't get up to high pressures with it you know there's you know polymeric supports things like that that really limit the technique technique so and of course we were always interested in doing um co2 so um here we got degradation uh robustness oh this liquid liquid in crystallization it's pretty high the robustness because you're just talking about stirred vessels so they're very robust sure and the liquid liquid partitioning you chromatography you really don't have um you know like the possibility of a column going out gotcha so that's why that's why the robustness is but i would the robustness scores are the way they are but i would say overall i give column chromatography pretty high scores on the recovery selectivity and throughput okay and you got to really be careful about the robustness so if you do really good sample preparation your columns are going to be pretty robust and that's going to reduce your cost for changing out your columns so that that's the main thing and the reason i have the cost per gram so low is because in my view uh and if you run the numbers it's absolutely true the cost of really this recovery is really what's driving a lot of the cost well so if you can't recover a very highly refined distillate in a very uh you know to 95 plus you're you're just throwing away a lot of money so the advantages on column is really in that recovery because it's the only one listed at that rates at high right right right right okay yeah so that but the the negative to that obviously is the robustness so there's a trade-off every one of these different techniques has a trade-off and you can see like uh the degradation i don't know anybody who would do that but it is really simple you take a beaker you put it in there you put it on hot plate there you go but you've been gonna get rid of the thc but in traditional column chromatography that robustness would be medium but because you have the ability to repack yourself yeah you've lowered that cost lower the cost dramatically and then you can also the particles themselves can be reconditioned so you can have a program and recondition those particles too which makes it more robust yeah which makes the pure 99 even higher okay good cool so we have we have um you know i would say that yes but if you're talking about comparing it to a technique that that does not have any column at all it just you can't it's not that it's not uh so it does have that thing where you do have to do some extra steps to take care of the column so yeah that's the way i look at it okay thank you for that table yeah no problem brilliant so look at here there's the this is the this is the try this is the try constraint the trade the trade constraint the trade trade constraints yeah so trio of constraints yeah recovery selectivity and speed it's like if you can get you'll pick two you can't have three okay so you want high recovery and speed you're going to sacrifice selectivity you want selectivity and speed you're going to sacrifice recovery so this is this is what you in any of the techniques i just talked about what if we enter the fourth dimension or the fourth dimension i love that all right you get it all here folks okay yes fourth dimension okay um the purity of the input materials first pass versus second pass so these are factors that affect the throughput everybody wants to know how much can i put through it sure okay um believe it or not we have calculators for this really yes we do where would those be they're not online uh but we are making them so we'll put them up for you guys so that's awesome but you know it's actually a simple it's simple math and if you follow our methods and everything which we give you um you're going to be doing a certain throughput okay um the amount of thc in the input simple math for doctor chromatography well okay well whatever but here's the things that can affect it okay if you don't like we there's some things that we can't control right with our methods like we can't control the purity of the input materials right yeah can't do it um we can't control the amount of thc in the input material so the more thc you know generally the slower you're going to go yeah you bet okay so um and that really depends on the method that you're running and all of that okay the selectivity of the method of the separation for thc and cbd you can change um you know for example your solvent composition and separate out those a little bit more but you're gonna sacrifice speed so you know you can you can trade off uh you can trade off selectivity for speed and you can trade off selectivity for um uh speed and recovery or you can think of this recovery as purity also so that would be another way to think about it oh wow yeah like i want all three it's impossible okay so if we were to choose recovery and selectivity yeah and how how long would it take to remediate a seven percent thc uh how much well because you would be doing you know you you'd be injecting several hundred grams per pers you know per injection okay and you know your runs take anywhere from three to five minutes so yeah so it's it's constantly going times that many yeah right so there's a and then depending on how many shifts you're running and how much uh what the percentage of thc is in there okay um if there's a lot of thc it'll be more than five minutes in time okay um if it's a little tiny bit of thc all you have to do is slice off a little tiny bit of thc and get rid of it then then you can do a lot faster okay so there there's a continuous set of trade-offs a lot of people want to they're like okay well just give me a number well it's actually a range of numbers and it really depends on what you put into it so input equals output so then they want to model all the inputs and outputs that's kind of what we do in our calculator for you right give your ranges um what you need yeah all right high performance liquid chromatography and we're talking about chromatography columns oh look at here i even have some method stuff on here oh what is the chromatography method well that's exactly what we need okay so now we were just talking about methods and how to optimize them obviously you have your technique which is chosen you got your gas gas the gas liquid in this case we're doing liquid liquid separations with the column chromatography um we we make sure that it passes that criteria for economics right and make sure that it's all all set for our residuals and our purity um we choose our solvent we develop our method then then there's some things that we need to do after that we run it uh we make sure that all the variables are are selected the time temperature pressure cycles all that stuff we make sure that we have enough selectivity for the throughput that we want and then we have a method and we test it's reproducibility and reliability and then that method becomes validated wow so that that's basically what a chromatographer is trained to do and what we have done for you guys is we've more or less done all of these steps these techniques are all chosen for you the method has been developed the variables have been selected and we basically stop right here you have to validate your own method okay because a lot of people have their own method um you know correct validation criteria and uh has specifically something to do with your quality system okay so um you know that's how that works so it should be it should be pretty good anyway i don't think we're going to go over this we went over this last week but this is kind of the idea of how you may tailor uh and some of the other reasons why you may want to do separations in the cannabinoid or the hemp world so that is to take out all the other different chrome uh different cannabinoids separate them out and then put them together into an engineered like a tincture or something like that so in this case you can if you have pure content of pure thc pure cbd prcvn pure cbc pure terpenes you can now create um uh you know you can create basically an engineered component you know what i mean custom formulation systems formulations yeah so it's kind of the future i think and you're still uh because you're getting a lot of the phytonutrients that coalu with the plant you're still maintaining a lot of the plant it's not like powder isolate so yeah and that's that's basically all i had here other than um let's see here yeah and then here's some beautiful pictures of some formulations so that's yeah this was awesome yeah i i i learned a lot today here you you you earned 100 million dollars okay so you earned that but i owe you 100 million so you can take it back that's right awesome okay so i'm going to stop the screen stop the screen share that's good so we covered a whole bunch of stuff we talked about thc remediation we talked about we talked a little bit about the difference between t free and t non-detect yes because um again t there's always some thc in this so it's non-detect as the terminology you really want to use right we've talked about the difference between uh t free you know full spectrum and broad spectrum right we talked about t free hemp distillate which is right t free hemp distillate is a chromatography for you know basically um treated distillate yeah yeah love it and then we talked about how does chromatography enable designer formulations because you can dial it in yeah right yeah i like it all right that's that's good we and then oh what we didn't talk about was how to tailor formulations for specific indications oh yeah okay yeah so um okay so for example that question came in and so we want to talk about that yeah okay that sounds good so we we kind of um i had a slide last week that really was uh really talked about the different cannabinoids and how they would really address different disease states or different indications um if you are in the business of of uh selling cbd you cannot make any claims no any medical claims correct for any indication unless you have um been approved uh under an nda which is a new drug application with the fda okay but um you know everybody knows that um it has certain benefits for different things we know one of the main side effects of for example cbd is sleep so a lot of people will take cbd as a natural way to you know help them sleep yes absolutely which is what everybody's doing right now after we get on the okay we need we need a caffeine jolt now that we got i think that happened a little bit when we were in our r d lab making our own we were potions we were we we were smoking wasn't it we were smoking we did we did a lot we made our own concoctions and tinctures the best ever uh yeah and by the way you know i've kind of been mulling over the idea of making like a um a do-it-yourself kind of kit wouldn't that be fun would you guys like that yeah like okay a little little bottle of um isolate a little bottle of distillate a little bottle of broad spectrum you know along with some different flavors and some media and stuff like that you know kind of like a um what do they have those like kind of sewer kits or um sommelier kits for wine i like it why not yeah tasting kit tasting a tasting kit uh okay i think we should do that why not i like it you guys like that i don't know who's in oh nobody's answering crickets okay okay that just goes i'll chalk it up to another one of my failed business plans no i think that's great no i i love this everything we talked about with chromatography i learned a ton and making sure i mean the biggest thing that i learned is you know that you're always doing high performance liquid chromatography as you're testing for potency right throughout every step in the process whether you're a grower whether you're a processor at all that's what you need to know yeah so you need to have that in your facility uh it doesn't make sense to send out like in-process samples is a lot different than for example uh you know samples that you'd send out because you have just made a formulation and you want to get a test right okay because a lot of times the in process samples are the ones that you want to okay is it decarboxylated or not or is my extraction as efficient as i thought it was or you know it do is are there cannabinoids in my residual uh in my you know distillate i want to make sure that i'm kind of tracking those down making sure they're not going offline from a process standpoint so yeah that's what we use uh chromatography throughout our system we have a laboratory here we do hundreds of samples a day we do yeah because it doesn't shut you down you're not waiting for other tests so that hplc is a workhorse potency potency potency that's what that does yeah and when you need more then you jump into a gas chromatography or a larger system or send it out to a third party lab right to do your um final testing final testing give you pesticides it might give you metals it would give you all kinds of stuff yeah and sometimes you know like we have uh we do pesticides and metals here too along with uh we do you know solvents and things like that i think it does make sense for someone who's doing you know if you have a solvent based uh extraction technique uh you should have a gc head space in your facility just because so you you know okay hey look i i don't want to send out samples to customers without knowing number one and i don't want to send out samples to for example even to the um you know to the laboratory and then have them not pass it right so i'd rather i'd rather know before i send it out yeah that's a good thing and i think that that's good okay well i this was a great show well done all right well thank you well done thank you for being here thank you for uh coming through uh there there will be a replay make sure you invite your your friends uh and we've got we covered all of these questions there's more questions still coming in thank you for that and you know our team has been frantically busy busy busy answering away so that's good make sure you set up a cbd jam session if you've got something very you know there's there's a there's an embedded base out there who's been around for years okay and you're running your facilities and you're thinking about what do i do for chromatography what's that next thing how do i do custom formulations this is what you want to do you can set up a cbd jam session with us anytime we can go through answer any of your questions look at those show you where those calculators are everything yeah right exactly so and we're you know there's nothing too small again even our cbd jam sessions ask anything our team is ready to answer that yeah so yeah we'd like to interact with you um you know we're we're we've got a new guide coming out um on solvent removal which is kind of cool that's awesome yeah and so yeah i think we're yeah and then our product tours are coming out they didn't get launched this week yet and i've been really like chomping at the bed for them but they'll be they'll be here product tours and we do have our live tour which is nice but then if we spend some time one-on-one with each one piece of equipment that's really been helpful for people whether they use our gear or not it really helps from a learning perspective what is the foaming film what is the white film technology what is what how do you do a winterization yeah filtration and de-waxing how do i make a formulation how do i make a formulation how do i make a tincture what what do i use right yeah yeah what's the difference between supercritical and subcritical extraction we've been we've been talking about all this stuff haven't we i know yeah it's been good i know my my brain hurts i'm gonna have to bring one of those monty python ted wraps no we're good you", "bjas_HLEspY": "[Music] hey guys steve here from pet relief and we wanted to talk to you about CBD isolate if you've had any interaction with us over the last three four years you have probably heard us give you the absolute pet relief promise that we will never ever use CBD isolate why is that the reason that we will never ever use CBD isolate is first and foremost is that over ninety percent of it comes from China they sell it by the kilo and it looks like yeah one of those things that's normally sold by the kilo the chemical processing involved with making this product is pretty nasty they take dirty hemp they use either butane lighter fluid or acetone fingernail polish remover or they'll use industrial grade ethanol any super harsh hydrocarbon to leach the cannabinoids out of that hemp there's so much dirty other stuff in that hemp with the leads and the things like that that that hemp had been consuming out of the soil conditions that was grown in that they can't sell that direct CBD oil hemp oil they have to then put it through a basically a chemical burn process using pentane typically or hexane Google the carcinogenic properties of pentane when you have a moment that alone probably will tell you why pet relief will never use a CBD isolate in any of our products but the fact is even if you used our USDA organic hemp and turned it into CBD isolate the science is clear 100% of every single clinical study of their findings has come to the same exact conclusion CBD in its single molecule isolate form has at most at most 15 percent of the efficacy versus a what's called full-spectrum oil that's what pet relief uses is a full spectrum oil so we have all of the cannabinoids of the plant you must have all the cannabinoids of the plant present in order to receive the benefits of CBD itself so you'll here see the Islip called things such as kind of like the other things that look like this have all kinds of street names so you'll hear it called 99% pure CBD THC free CBD crystal things such as this any of those buzzwords or slang terms are all going to be describing the same nasty product so again you're hearing it straight for me is president co-founder of the company we will never ever ever use CBD isolate in any of our products and we hope you never do", "Q4SzpaHq-u0": "[Music] so I'm in a massive cannabis field right now and we're not in Colombia or Colorado we're actually in China near the Himalayas local farmers have been tending this field for the past five months and today they're ready to harvest the fruits of their labor they're about to top down 24 tons of cannabis the whole mission their company about how the heart cannot be you'll find your plan the whole woman the ha she knew and by the way it's like some that whining flu a few months ago this clot was all tobacco in court but now young Lou who manages this field says they're growing hemp a strain of the cannabis plant known for the increasingly popular non psychotropic component CBD the CBD market in the US will grow by 700 percent this year and be worth more than twenty three billion dollars by 2023 in China wants a piece of that fields like this in Yunnan Province are now a part of a growing CBD boom in China research analysts say UN and Heilongjiang provinces alone produced just over 11 percent of the global CBD supply last year the extract is taken from these plants then sold in the US demand for CBD from China has ballooned because of its supposed health Frenchie's consumer products increased with CBD like coffee bath bombs and gummy bears claim to help with pain and relaxation whatta man the CBD honey would go Edie ones yeah oh wow kind of sweet and fruity in a way wonder chefs here we're in Quin being here dozens of startups have sprouted up to capitalize on the cannabis and CBD boom in the u.s. the city has become a trailblazer for cannabis much like Denver after marijuana was first legalized in the u.s. Chinese entrepreneurs are convinced they can turn their country into a cannabis superpower China already has the infrastructure and the know-how since it produces half of the world's industrial hemp that's mainly used for textiles and paper but here's the catch in China cannabis is actually a very sensitive topic junsu PCL ba you fool tryna shop that's because it contains not only CBD but THC the psychoactive ingredient that gets you high I feel very safe in my new outfits anyone caught selling products with THC risk spending the rest of his or her life in prison or worse face the death penalty and by extension CBD consumption in the country is also illegal so when we visited one of the world's largest CBD extraction plans it actually felt like we were touring a prison here there are dozens of surveillance cameras barbed wire and every door is locked with a coat oh wow looks like a Star Wars control room in here but what's illegal for the country turns out to be big business and authorities aren't stifling that instead they've put in place very strict regulations on CBD production will mention condom a girl who should say go onto the King Kong Shah Jahan I want to know do you have tests for your employees like drug tests taken I sure go on tea time away gg-get you're not so this apparently is CBD it's kind of muddy looking it kind of looks like a black bean paste or something this factory runs 24 hours a day seven days a week pumping out 1.5 tons of CBD a year so this is what the world wants pure CBD extract and the most pure CBD can be sold for 8,000 to 10,000 dollars per kilogram we went to Shanghai to meet a Chinese entrepreneur who sees this raw material from Yunnan as a golden opportunity to sell CBD Shanghai you have a dollar debt not sure rockefeller count all Summer Sun leads the Chinese branch of CII acts an American financial firm that analyzes companies in the US for Chinese investors when they looked at the CBD boom they decided to open a company in China one may watch other Hayashi be the to me my own son says to really win big it won't be about just selling to the US eventually he hopes one day he'll be able to sell these products inside the country so Chinese entrepreneurs like son are starting to educate Chinese consumers he's selling CBD free products that are legal in China this influencer is testing one of sons products it contains other extracts from cannabis plants but he's marketing products to Chinese consumers as CBD it doesn't have any CBD is that misleading jungle vine hemorrhage at all tension the PR DVD shriveled up see my logo for some beer [Music] as companies anticipate the CBD market in China to open they are starting to invest big in the cannabis of the future - Oh Madonna Mia don't really match the home the country is quickly catching up to the US and Europe and entrepreneurs believe their country will eventually surpass competitors as a CBD powerhouse in production but most importantly consumption yoga since in the trainee at the Tantra pompe oh ho Chun Chiu geranyl woman shampooed on the tree most Wakana shaman a fan for that room to come here time at sea for sure young leo says China can only succeed because he expects the country will do to the CBD industry when it has already done to dominate other industries like smartphones plastics or clothes what can you make voice in

join me in welcoming Ruth Bertrand I will now turn the presentation over to her hello and thank you for attending my webinar on the efficacy of high CBD low THC for better patient outcomes in medical marijuana treatment programs at the end of this presentation there is a YouTube video for you to watch on CBD THC just click on the far left of your screen today's learning objectives are understanding CBD THC ratios in medical marijuana and using high CBD low THC cannabis products to treat disease processes there are at least a hundred and thirteen cannabinoids and this webinar is going to address two of them that work together to provide our bodies with synergy that's high CBD low THC strains of marijuana and how they help patients who use them CBD and THC interact with each other and by using them together patients may find that the effects of THC are lessened but prolonged there are many patients who just cannot tolerate the effects of THC while there are many others who smoke THC in order to relax another factor to consider is the way in which marijuana is consumed such as smoking tinctures edibles and topicals cannabinoids are better absorbed by the body when ingested on a full stomach CBD is intrinsically safe and there is no way to tell if you have had enough as with THC you would just be too high combining CBD and THC causes a reduction in the psychoactive effects of THC CBD will also help to lessen the sedative and appetite appetite inducing effects this is known as the entourage effect where both compounds work best when they're used together these two molecules are a perfect complement to each other in January of this year the medical value of cannabis was recognized by the world who health organization the therapeutic potentials of cannabis and cannabinoids has been acknowledged for the first time since 1954 by this group they have proposed new international scheduling moving towards efforts to increase the potential for countries to provide legal safe access for medical use of cannabis and its research the organization accepted the public's comments on the scheduling of marijuana until March 14th of this year I of course posted my thoughts on the website and implored them to seriously consider removing marijuana as a schedule 1 drug cannabidiol or CBD is a component of the anibus plant that may have enormous therapeutic potential although it doesn't make people feel high like THC CBD is causing quite a buzz among scientists health professionals and medical marijuana patients who are using CBD products to treat a wide variety of conditions including chronic pain cancer Crohn's diabetes rheumatoid arthritis PTSD cardiovascular disease anxiety and antibiotic resistant infections multiple sclerosis schizophrenia and more academic research centers around the world are currently studying effects of CBD on these and other ailments scientists refer to CBD as a promiscuous compound because it confers therapeutic benefits in many different ways while tapping into how we function physiologically and biologically on a deep level extensive preclinical research and some clinical studies have shown that CBD have strong antioxidant anti-inflammatory anticonvulsant antidepressant antipsychotic antitumoral and neuro protective qualities cannabidiol appears to change gene expression and may be helpful in removing beta amyloid plaque which is the hallmark of Alzheimer's from brain cells what is THC CBD and THC are the power couple of cannabis therapeutics they appear to work best together for example CBD is believed to boost th C's pain-killing and anti-cancer properties CBD can also lessen the side effects of too much THC including anxiety and rapid heartbeat relaxing but not intoxicating is how some people describe CBD rich cannabis products CBD and THC both appear to stimulate neurogenesis the creation of new brain cells and adult mammals which may prove helpful for stroke and Parkinson's patients products made from industrial hemp that contain little or no THC are currently being market widely but recent scientific studies suggest that the products made from hemp or synthetic CBD maybe less effective therapeutically than cannabis based medicines because they lack critically secondary cannabinoids and other medicinal compounds that interact with CBD and THC to enhance their therapeutic benefits scientists call this the entourage effect numerous cannabis compounds have medicinal attributes but the therapeutic impact of the whole plant cannabis seems to be greater than the sum of its parts it still seems that patients are looking for the most part the high THC low CBD products but I feel as a nurse that they would be better suited to choose the high CBD low THC products for medicinal purposes it just seems like the high CBD has more benefits for most medical patients CBD binds with CBD receptors in the body and helps to regulate appetite pain management and immune system function such as inflammation Harlequin sweet and sour widow Stephen Hawking Kush ac/dc canna tonic and Pennywise are some of the most popular and common strains of high CBD flour it is not so much that CBD makes you feel good but that it makes you not feel bad and since it's a cap cannabinoid coming from the cannabis plant it is often confused with THC which is a psychoactive compound and people expect to feel high from it it's imperative that we educate patients as well as the public to the fact that being high as they say on cannabis cannot be compared to being intoxicated on alcohol or to the ill effects of most pharmaceuticals such as opiates benzodiazepines antipsychotics and antidepressants with a CBD high you won't feel sedated or groggy for most people it takes about 20 minutes to feel the effects of CBD when taken on an empty stomach if taking on a full stomach it's about an hour there are many studies that find inflammation as the main contributing factor in problems of the brain such as anxiety brain fog depression autism a DD and ADHD CBD oil is proving to be an effective treatment for social anxiety and is naturally calming side effects from cannabis are dose dependent high CBD low THC therapy should always start with low doses increasing slowly so that the patient can find their individual dose and unwanted effects can be avoided CBD also interacts with THC by taking CBD and THC together individuals may find that the effects of THC are tempered but prolonged slightly some people can hardly tolerate any THC the wide range of reaction to THC rich cannabis may be influenced by genetic factors that may be one of the reasons why some people find THC rich cannabis to be unpleasant while hundreds of millions smoked it to relax this genetic variant exists among 20% of people in the European and Middle Eastern population of Caucasians meaning one in five or THC averse less than 10 percent of Africans have this genetic variant and among Asians it's less than 5% how does CBD benefit the human body CBD shows promise for helping to subdue the symptoms of anxiety which most of us about 30% suffer from it produces effects via molecular molecular pathways CBD enhances activation of serotonin to impede disorders such as anxiety it has been found to be a natural anxiety calmer and works very well in the treatment of social anxiety in addition to fighting inflammation in the body CBD oil may reduce anxiety by directly affecting the brain studies have found that CBD actually lowers activity in the amygdala and increases prefrontal cortex activation to parts of the brain involved in anxiety is also evidence that CBD is able to activate new neurons in the hippocampus this accent activates CBD 1 receptors which has a positive balancing impact on gaba and glutamate levels associated with reducing anxiety doctors often advise people with chronic anxiety to avoid cannabis as THC can trigger or amplify feelings of anxiousness and paranoia which is true I think for a lot of people that paranoia is definitely a side effect of a high THC product however authors of a review from neuro therapeutics found that CBD may help to reduce anxiety in people with certain related disorders according to the review CBD may reduce anxiety related behaviors and people with conditions such as PTSD general anxiety disorder panic disorder social anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder the authors noted that current treatments for these disorders can lead to additional symptoms and side effects which can cause some people to stop taking them no further definitive evidence currently leaked CBD to adverse effects and the authors called for further studies of the compound as a treatment for anxiety anxiety and depression or pathologies affect human beings and may aspects of life including social life productivity and health CBD is a compound of the cannabis plant with great psychiatric potential including use as an antidepressant studies involving animal models performing a variety of experiments on the above-mentioned disorder such as the forced swimming test the elevated plus maze and the global conflict test suggest the CBD exhibited an anti-anxiety and antidepressant effect in the animal models discussed experiments with CBD demonstrated non activation of neuroreceptor cb1 and cb2 PTSD or post-traumatic stress disorder is a psychological ailment that is beginning to gain the attention of CBD research PTSD exhibits and individuals who have experienced trauma and/or abuse in their lifetime the disorder is most noteworthy and military veterans and accident survivors CBD has proven beneficial in relation to PTSD as it reportedly helps curb manifestations of both depression and anxiety without the debilitating side effects of pharmaceuticals CBDs effectiveness concerning PTSD is evident in the fact that states like Arizona are now recognizing PTSD as an ailment that warrants legal access to medical marijuana CBD has the ability to lower cortisol levels at slow down muscle growth the reason body builders need to work regularly to maintain continued growing their form is because our bodies do not grow muscles naturally in fact our endocrine system produces catabolic hormones such as cortisol which break down muscle mass in order to use the amino acids for other functions to counter this dilemma someone who wishes to build muscle would have to take catabolic supplements and this is where CBD comes into play studies show that cannabidiol can lower the number of catabolic hormones in the human body meaning that muscle game won't be lost so quickly and it makes it easier to gain muscle mass quicker keep in mind that CBD should not be taken with caffeine at least not for this purpose caffeine promotes the production of catabolic hormone so it would only counter the effects of CBD many medical patients tell us that marijuana helps their pain neuropathic pain also known as nerve pain is a unique type of pain that is caused by injured dysfunction or irritated nerves the pain tends to be chronic and severe with no known cure or remedy the individual is left to try numerous strategies to try to find something that works some of the most common sources of neuropathy include diabetes injury cancer infections alcoholism and autoimmune disorders have been human clinical trials that support benefits of THC and CBD for nerve pain there have been fewer studies examining just CBD in an animal study researchers found that oral supplementation of CBD led to improvements in neuropathic pain in rats back pain is one of the most common forms of both acute and chronic pain acute back pain tends to call be caused by an injury such as a fall or by lifting something heavy chronic back pain is that which lasts more than three months and is often caused by a ruptured or bulging disc author itis osteoporosis scoliosis or nerve pain some back pain is partly caused by inflammation and numerous preclinical animal studies have found benefits of CBD for inflammation three possible reduction in both nerve and inflammatory pain CBD may help relieve back pain the main mechanism by which CBD is thought to help mediate pain is by reducing inflammation largely by blocking inflammatory mediators it is also believed to potentiate glycan receptors which help to regulate pain at the spinal level this suppresses both neuropathic and inflammatory pain CBD has been found to exhibit enhancements in treating pain both when used on its own and when used in combination with THC when used alone CBD is largely best for inflammatory pain such as that caused by arthritis or injuries in one animal study on arthritis pain it was found that the topical application of CVD led to a reduction in inflammation and pain another animal study found that CBD helps to reduce neuropathic pain through the suppression of chronic inflammation CBD does not directly bind to the receptors found in the endocannabinoid system so rather works to modulate the effects of endocannabinoids found naturally in our bodies as well as working as a cb-one antagonist when searching for the best cannabis strains for pain relief you will first want to consider how much THC and CBD is found in the stream generally you will find most relief from a string that has large quantities of both CBD and THC with a high CBD THC ratio this is because CBD can help to mediate the side effects of THC while also providing additional anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties some researchers have found that CBD may prove to combat cancer authors of a review published in the British Journal of clinical pharmacology found evidence that CBD significantly helped to prevent the spread of cancer the researchers also noted that the compound tends to suppress the growth of cancer cells and promote their destruction they pointed out that CBD has low levels of toxicity and they called for further research in its potential as an accompaniment to standard cancer treatments type 1 diabetes results from inflammation that occurs when the immune system attacks cells in the pancreas research published in 2016 found that CBD may ease this inflammation in the pancreas this may be the first step in finding a CBD based treatment for type 1 diabetes a paper presented the same year in Lisbon Portugal suggests that CBD may reduce inflammation and protect against the delay or development of type 1 diabetes initial research published in the Journal of Alzheimer's disease found CBD was able to prevent the development of social recognition deficit in its participants this means that CBD could help people in the early stages of Alzheimer's keep the ability to recognize the faces of the people that they know this is the first evidence that CBD may slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease across the board it would appear as though CBD is a natural wakefulness promoting compound because of this it seems smart to recommend to take your CBD supplement or full-spectrum hep extract supplement in the morning so as to keep you alert all day and not to interfere with falling asleep interesting enough when subjects do this it appears that not only do they stay alert and awake throughout the day but they also fall asleep at night more quickly without any additional sleep aid and stay asleep longer this would appear to be because CBD is known to modulate the microglia activation of the inflammatory cycle keeping your body in a less inflamed state and lowering your stress in a review of studies done on chronic pain patients the reviewer found adequate evidence to correlate CBD oil consumption with improving multiple sleep biomarkers including sleep onset which is basically how quickly someone falls asleep the study also saw repeating incidents of lower dream recall and CBD subjects which is very interesting it's difficult to point to a mechanism here since very little is known about the nature of dreams in the field of neuroscience however this does point to the idea that dream recall may be regulated by the endocannabinoid system to some degree the same study also saw a decrease in insomnia symptoms among subjects it appears as though CBD is positively correlated with improving sleep patterns but funny enough not actually by making you sleepy as it is a wakefulness promoting agent and not a sedative like THC in fact it appears to promote sleep improvement due to the fact that it can lower stress levels as a powerful antioxidant where it benefits controlling free radicals in induced inflammation are well-documented this is great news as you can consume your CBD supplements in the morning to keep you stress-free and relaxed but focused throughout the day and then you may fall asleep more quickly and stay asleep longer throughout the night using high CB low THC to help quitting smoking some promising evidence suggests that CBD may help people quit smoking cigarettes a pilot study published in addictive behaviors found that smokers who used inhalers containing CBD smoked fewer cigarettes than usual and had no further cravings for nicotine a similar review published in neuro therapeutics found that CBD may be a promising treatment for people with opioid addiction disorders the researchers noted that CBD reduced some symptoms associated with substance use disorders these included anxiety related symptoms pain and insomnia more research is necessary but these findings suggest that CBD may help to prevent or even reduce withdrawal symptoms children with autism spectrum disorder seek significant improvement in symptoms and less reliance on other medications after treatment with tecum ohlins ever deagle medical cannabis as confirmed by a new study published in scientific reports the two-year study followed 188 children with an average age of 13 diagnosed with ASD the patients were treated with tecum \u00f6hlins high CBD low THC medical cannabis strains which have been specifically cultivated and shown to provide symptom relief for ASD and related conditions with minimal psychoactive effect at the study's outset the most common patient symptoms were restlessness rage attacks and agitation after six months of daily cannabis treatment with at tecum olan's clinics in israel 80 point 1 percent of the patients reported improvement of their symptoms with only with 30 point one percent reporting significant improvements other key findings included of the 27 patients who had epilepsy 24 reported improved or disappearance of symptoms 34 point four percent of patients decreased other medications and 20 percent of patients stop using anti-psychotic medication autism is a leading condition of concern worldwide so this study couldn't have come at a better time says dr. Annabelle manola PhD who is tecum olam scientific director this data showed that autism patients can improve their overall quality of life utilizing a high CBD low THC strain and most importantly that young users can safely and effectively benefit from medical cannabis with the study cannabis is shown to be an effective choice for parents looking for the safest and most neuroprotective treatment the side-effects to cannabis treatment were minimal the FDA recently approved epidemics as a medication for children with refractory Caeser disorders and the DEA classified at the dialects sched as a Schedule v substance on September of 2018 epidemics would surely command a lot of off-label attention if not for the potent price tag and just as surely a huge unregulated market for hemp derived CBD isolate will continue to flourish in a tenuous legal environment an already massive consumer demand for CB products has far outpaced the gathering of clinical data on cannabinoid interactions with pharmaceuticals for pain cancer autism heart disease and many other chronic ailments concerning the product that the fda approved to treat two types of epilepsy researchers noticed the following adverse effects in clinical trials liver problems symptoms related to central nervous system such as irritability and lethargy reduced appetite gastrointestinal problems infections rashes and other sensitivity reactions reduce urination and breathing problems the patient information leaflet notes that there is a risk of worsening depression or suicidal thoughts it is important to monitor anyone who is using this drugs for signs of mood changes research suggests that a person taking the product is unlikely to form a dependency the long-standing Berry to research is a Schedule one status of cannabis a category reserved for dangerous substances with no medical value according to federal law but the paucity of federally sanctioned clinical research a consequence of cannabis prohibition should not be an excuse for physicians or patients to shun non-lethal cannabinoid therapies which show promise for a wide range of conditions when drugs do not have FDA approval it can be difficult to know whether a product contains a safe or effective level of CBD unapproved products may not have the properties or content stated on the package it is important to note that researchers have linked marijuana use during pregnancy to impairments in the fetal development of neurons regular use among teens is also associated with concerning memory behavior and intelligence CBD is just one of the many cannabinoids found in marijuana and it is not psychoactive smoking cannabis is not the same as using CBD oil and using CBD oil was not the same as smoking cannabis a person can use CBD oil in different ways to relieve various symptoms if a doctor prescribes it it's important to follow their instructions CBD products come in many forms some can be mixed into different foods or drinks and taken with a pipette or dropper others are available in capsules or as a thick paste to be massaged into the skin some products are available as sprays to be administered under the tongue recommended dosages vary between individuals and depend on factors such as body weight the concentration of the products and the health issue the studies done on CBD oil have a pretty wide dose range anywhere from a few milligrams to hundreds of milligrams it's suggested to start at the lower end around 10 milligrams and slowly increase over a few weeks or months to see what works for you some people also do well with splitting the dosage throughout the day instead of taking the dose all at once it is always a good idea to talk with your prescribing doctor if you are on any medications CBD is generally very safe but there are some pharmaceutical medications it could potentially interact with an increase or decrease the pharmaceutical drugs effectiveness some CBD manufacturers have come under government scrutiny for wild and defensible claims such as that CBD is a cure-all for cancer we need more research but CBD may prove to be an option for managing anxiety insomnia and chronic pain without sufficient high quality evidence in human studies we can't pinpoint effective doses and because CBD is currently mostly available as an unregulated supplement it's difficult to know exactly what you are getting if you decide to try CBD check with your doctor if for no other reason than to make sure it won't affect other medications that you're taking using CBD THC compounds in concert has been shown to help mitigate side-effects and enhance efficacy with CBD + THC showing more benefit for some conditions and THC alone studies have confirmed that CBD helps to counteract some of the sedative high feeling anxiety and rapid heartbeat that's associated with THC consumption it also has been found to extend the half-life of the THC which may help to extend the pain relieving benefits this has allowed the use of higher doses of THC in clinical trials for the treatment of pain caused by multiple sclerosis peripheral neuropathy intractable cancer pain and rheumatoid arthritis when used in concert a greater efficacy in treating these types of pain has been observed you may be wondering what is the ideal balance a ratio of CBD and THC every strain of Bud that you purchased at a dispensary will be labeled with its THC and CBD content and that's helpful when choosing a strain for pain relief thus far based on the observations regarding the ride spread use of cannabis flour and full spectrum cannabis oil it does not appear that there have been many problems because of cannabinoid drug reactions to the extent that there have been problematic drug interactions with cannabinoids these have involved high doses of CBD isolates not cannabis in general even though THC is an intoxicant and CBD is not the fact that people tend to use much higher doses of pure CBD makes it much riskier player in the metabolic drug interactions 10 milligrams of THC in a cannabis product is a hefty dose for a naive patient and sufficiently psychoactive for the occasional recreational user 10 milligrams of THC combined with equal amounts of CBD in a sativex tincture hits the energies exploit spot in clinical trials there are moderate doses compared to the amount of single molecule CBD administer to epileptic children in clinical trials up to 50 milligrams per kilogram with CBD doses as high as 2,000 milligrams not uncommon among patients who obtain CBD isolates from internet storefronts and other unregulated sources THC has its own built in guardrails consume too much and you'll know you've hit your limit with CBD there are no guardrails no dysphoric feedback loop that says you've had enough CBD is intrinsically safe but when extracting from the plant and concentrated as an isolate high doses are necessary for therapeutic efficacy unlike whole plant CBD rich extracts which have a broader therapeutic window and are effective at lower doses in a single molecule CBD drug interactions are much more likely with high dose CBD therapy than other forms of cannabis consumption physicians and patients should be concerned about this given the current regulatory regime with privileges CBD isolates over artisanal plant-derived multi-component formulations the legality CBD is a cannabinoid derived from the cannabis plant cannabis is legal for either medicinal or recreational use in use in some American states other states have approved the use of CBD oil as a hemp product but not the general use of medical marijuana some state and federal laws differ and current marijuana and CBD legislation in the United States can be confusing even in states where marijuana is legal there is an ever-changing number of states that do not necessarily consider marijuana to be legal but have laws directly related to CBD oil the following information is accurate as as of May 2018 but the laws change frequently however state legislators usually approve the use of CBD oil at various concentrations to treat a range of epileptic conditions a full list of states that have CBD specific laws is available different states also require different levels of prescriptions to possess and use CBD oil in Missouri for example a person can use CBD of a particular composition if they can show that three other treatment options have failed to treat their epilepsy they can provide information about safe CBD sausage sources and local laws surrounding uses anyone considering CBD oil should speak with a local healthcare provider it's also research your local state laws most states require a prescription my own state of Delaware has a medical marijuana program that currently has close to 7,000 patients thank you so much for watching my webinar on high CBD low THC product efficacy for better patient outcomes in medical marijuana programs I'm Ruth betrayin from Wyoming Delaware I have worked as a nurse for the past 13 years where I come face-to-face with various disease processes daily I'm a member of the American cannabis Nurses Association Delaware normal and the Delaware cannabis advocacy Network I have been an advocate for marijuana since 1975 and I've lobbied at state and national levels for the past couple of years we hope to legalize recreational cannabis here in Delaware this year the legislators in my state decide the fate of marijuana so the only way to make change is to speak to them personally 61% of Delaware again support legalization of recreational cannabis I am by no means an expert on this topic but I recently worked in one of the medical marijuana dispensaries here in Delaware and I know of the pain and suffering the patient's endure for years before they finally get their doctor to agree that marijuana could help it's my hope that patients everywhere are able to utilize marijuana as a first line of defense in their medical treatment instead of it being a last resort I'd like to give a shout out to Jay and Riley mendler of Riley sunshine and thank them for all the hard work and dedication and their continued support of pediatric medical cannabis worldwide I'd also like to thank Delaware Normal and the Delaware cannabis advocacy Network for the continued work towards legalization I'm going to close with the video done by a friend of mine Tommy Lyons he is a veteran who lives in Maryland and he's a medical marijuana patient thank you for watching hey everybody my name is Tommy Lyons and I'm a good friend of Ruth wanted to come on here today and talk to you about why I use CBD products from the cannabis plant specifically I'd like to state that I'm not representing any industry and I'm a registered and approved msec patient which means I have safe access to cannabis in Maryland I'm a service-connected disabled veteran and I use cannabis to offset various symptoms that come along with that I find that the CBD really helps target the symptoms from PTSD major depressive disorder and it helps me just kind of regain my calm I enjoy ac/dc I'm smoker and ac/dc is great it is very high in CBD and almost next to nothing in THC what that does for me is just give me a clear slate just makes me feel alright no high really but I'm not it's hard to say the word high anymore because it does different things for everybody but what we're finding is that the one thing it's doing across the board is providing an increase in quality of life and that's why I like cannabis and CBD it is important to use THC with the CBD to create what's called the entourage effect that was explained to me by a good friend of mine the old buddy old pal bill that CBD Rides and THC drives so you're in the car you've got THC and CBD working together CBD is kind of navigating telling the THC where to go and then the THC is like mmm just kind of takes off and then it's like a little bit too much so the CBD is like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa come back here come back here get back to the speed limit so if you ever have too much THC for any reason use some CBD the CBD teamsters the drops that you put under your tongue that's a great way to medicate people are finding that to be very effective as a source to get the CBD into their system I usually recommend a ten to one texture which is ten part CBD and one part THC when it comes to THC and CBD in regard to dosing they're called Colorado doses ten milligrams of THC is one Colorado dose one milligram of CBD is one Colorado dose you can have as much CBD as you can intake you can't have too much CBD which is great you can't have too much THC or any other cannabinoid for that fact but the more you intake of certain cannabinoids the more potential you have for psychotropic psychedelic effects that you might not be looking for if you're looking for medicinal relief in regard to anxiety stress depression cancer looking for tumor reduction looking for symptom relief with HIV ADEs gastrointestinal issues post reconstructive surgery or any kind of surgery for that matter there are bombs THC and CBD bombs that are great for spot application for example if you're having elbow pain rub it right on the elbow there are compounds that are transdermally ingested so those are same things bomb and if you're having spot pain then you rub it on that and then you always rub it on your wrist where the skin is really thin and Venus because the compounds can either be spot application by themselves for spot application with transdermal properties so when it's transdermal and you rub it on the thin part of the skin it's gonna go full bloodstream which is going to give you a better chance for relief and fighting symptoms I've had a great opportunity to learn about cannabis I work as a dispensary technician at nature's care and wellness I'm also a patient consultant so I've worked with I have 3,000 patients that come into the store and I've gotten an opportunity to work with most of them and what we do is come up with plans in regard to how we can help figure this out come together get on a med excuse me get on a medical regimen and then find relief and it's working people keep coming back I've been working with people for over a year now and it works so it's really great to see people coming back people getting relief people's scams coming back clear people are kicking opiates I mean from going going from 280 milligrams a day down to nothing cannabis it's not just about the THC and CBD either there are many cannabinoids there are over 200 identified cannabinoids there are also terpenes which is the flavor and scent there's tart beans and everything stripping's and oranges tomatoes it's all over the place it's plant-based wellness and bringing these things together in an effort to find wellness as possible so it's great there are our CBD vapes CBD heavy vapes that are cannabis for example some strains that are really good are penny wise hardly sue tsunami harley quinn ac/dc shark shock blue dream blue dream is my favorite I've been using blue dream as my meds when I smoke they're the prettiest CBD buds I've ever seen and I mention that because I get relief when I open the bag smell it you know I take the milk out or break it open and just looking at it just makes me go I love that that's one thing about cannabis that you're not gonna get from any kind of prescription medication you're never gonna open up a bottle of pills and be like no it's just it's not like that there are capsules that you can ingest to get CBD and THC into your system there's also RS o which is Rick Simpson oil another good strain what CBD is a ray of sunshine and I've seen that in RSO tubes with a thousand milligrams total cannabinoids 600 milligrams CBD and 200 milligrams THC which is an amazing ratio because that's not going to get you too high but it is gonna get you some serious medicinal relief especially during the day the best way to consume that is called front lining it's a term that I coined basically dry out the inside of your gum with a paper towel have your meds ready pull the paper towel out so it's dry line the gums with the oil it's viscous and then let it sit there before you know it it's full blood streams called sublingual ingestion and it's really helping people alright everybody thank you so much for watching my video if there's anything I can do to help please let Ruth know and I'd be happy to follow up again my name is Tommy cannabis saves lives and that's what it's all about have a great day Thank You Ruth for that informative presentation I'd also like immigrants for making today's educational webcast possible as a final reminder our speaker will follow up with any questions you've submitted via email that's all for now thank you for joining us and we'll see you next time", "urBi1xewboE": "i'm craig henderson here at extract labs in boulder colorado i founded this company about 19 months ago originally in my basement in Arvada Colorado and then about three months later we were fortunate enough to go to move here in the boulder the original business model was to just do toll processing for heme farmers and give them back their oil I soon learned that hemp farmers don't want their oil back they just want to grow plant material and sell it so we went from being just a full processing company to a products company we started off just making tinctures and bulk isolate and then from the marijuana side of things I saw that shatter and crumble was a huge industry so I found a way to make CBD shatter and crumble so it wouldn't be limited to any one state it was a shatter crumble that could be sold across the country my background is all co2 processing that's what we primarily do here co2 processing we also do some alcohol and hydrocarbon the co2 is really what separated us from all the other CVD companies we use my Tallis that's what we started with well in my garage I started with you know a small alcohol extraction it just wasn't enough it didn't make very clean oil so once we got connected up Vitalis and got that machine now we've had for a little over a year that's really what took our business to the next level it makes a lot cleaner oil it's a lot simpler to use everything that comes out of it is just liquid gold you know alcohol is still nice for just going I slit if we need a winterized oil or a distillate or somewhere in between something they've put in our own products it's all co2 it's all from the Vitalis today we're doing about 700 pounds a week in put pounds we should be about 1,200 pounds in the next two months our goal is to be at 2,000 pounds per week in put plant material so if we put in 2,000 pounds you know a percentage of that will go to winterized oil you can also take it to distillate ice lit we have flash chromatography they can remove THC so we can make THC free distillate you know there's 120 some cannabinoids out there th C's one of them that everyone's focused on we're gonna focus on the other 119 of them I'd say our shatter and crumble is what most people would probably look at us like we I feel like we were kind of Raiders or founders of CVD shatter the top five biggest CVD companies shatter companies online or all are shatter just white-label for other people but really the body cream and muscle cream is what I feel like I'm personally most proud of it's what I use the most of just tempering the body cream or the muscle cream to get it to the right consistency using the right ingredients trying to keep it very simple if we get our hands on good industrial hemp like the cherry wine strains we have we can pull off really nice terpenes and put those in our products so our cherry wine is something we pull off in-house and then put back into our products and then we just discovered a really cool method for making a really legit water-soluble isolate or full-spectrum water-soluble haven't even released it yet but we should have really nice water soluble products in the very near future you do everything in-house we're not outsourcing really anything that I can think of everything is made here it's processed here it's shipped from here everyone feels like they're kind of part of something you know that's changing the world and I think there's that super-high passion as well as separating us from some of the other companies you know I've had other jobs in the past and they just didn't share the same vision so you're working around a whole bunch of people and they're just not on the same page here I'm working with 25 people that are literally sharing the same vision they wake up excited to the same thing as me every day so I think just the passion and the fact that we do everything in-house we're not reporting to a bunch of guys in suits that you know aren't part of what we do you know it gets scarier the more people you hire the more you start feeling like a large corporation I don't want to lose those small company that that high passion I want to get big but I don't want to lose you know what we have today so it's kind of a balancing act my biggest fear is that Big Pharma will get involved manipulate it over regulate it and change what it is today and make it to where it's impossible for people like me or other small people to get into this and then it just becomes another big pharma problem there's a lot of pharmaceutical products today that I think hopefully get pushed by the wayside they're really not that good for you they're covering up small things are causing bigger problems be nice to see in five years what cannabis can do for people I'm curious to see where that's gonna go you see how big we can get and try to keep it like I said keep that passion alive keep it um just owned by us when I stepped into CBD and him I thought I was taking a step down I thought I wasn't good enough for the marijuana side of things you know and I feel like now the hemp or the CBD side of things is gonna far outdo marijuana I think marijuana in a few years is gonna be a small niche in the realm of the cannabis industry so I feel like I really got lucky you you", "Re1VZwJavR8": "today really just I was about to do a distillation for meditation over the next couple weeks and thought I would try and do a better video than some that I have posted trying to go through the process a little bit at least with what I do you know this mayor cannot be right or wrong he's given the equipment that I have so one thing I wanted to talk about here was the difference in Chinese glass box or glass I guess that's one thing that was passed in one of my other videos and they mentioned that there was an article mentioning toxins in the glass now personally I've been smoking for probably 20 years or more this is something I've never heard of I've used bikes from the cheapest finished glass you know two bucks at the convenience store to the more expensive types of pipes like 80 90 bucks a head for just a basic plate you know I could see a difference a lot of it I've never heard of the toxins I've never read about we seen anybody to mention it in the article that I didn't read about it it was like somebody who you know I'd say they probably had an idea but it also didn't apply to laboratory glassware they were speaking specifically at players now I don't know about toxins but one thing what I do know about the Chinese glass for the office was causing problems but stuff like this work comes down to his tolerances and inconsistencies in the glass like you're gonna have you know the glass is not going to be you don't want thickness it may not be the best quality of borosilicate either it's they probably use something cheaper but if you use the types of soft glass mention in the article in this type of application the heat would absolutely destroy it so the other problem we've got with the Chinese type of glass are these ground joints here where they may not may not make a perfect steel you know you'll never really see it unless it's really really bad but if it can't make a perfect ceiling here you're gonna end up with say maybe this is just a little bit longer than it should be so the tolerances will be will be different they'll be way out a lot more than what you would see and say american-made glassware they're tall matches are gonna be really really close so that's one that's one of the issues were running to there and what happens when like this is too long or especially too short as this heats up you know it expands and then this joint will actually it'll fall in just slightly and as it cools down it'll grab that and it basically you know prevents that swipe from ever coming out again that's where you went into less of those problems with american-made glass also there's there's the the sealing ability here now you always need to use vacuum grease on these but with a really good quality Canadian or American made glass from a reputable company you would find that you could get a vacuum seal without using any grease or additional stuff in there but that would not be good because again you'd go back to welding your joints together and things like that so you always want to use a greasing so that being said this is just the quote-unquote cheap distillation unit you know it's not it's made by some offshore company so it does the trick but it could be better like I'm pretty sure I run into packing leaks and things like that there's no insulation around globe flasks and other such things like that where you see improvements like that on the American stuff also your electronics in here these are very cheap electronics so it doesn't have the accuracy in temperature it does about the same plate control that something better would happen where this just controls the temperature by a thermal probe and basically turning the heating on and on and off repeatedly you know to maintain a temperature a more professional unit will use wattage control where it'll actually just adjust [Music] the amount of current going into the heating element instead of turning on and off it's actually regulating regulating the current that's feeding it so that you have a more accurate more steady temperature so not all being said now I would like to get this [Music] I just like to every night at the back you pump right [Music] and I've reached over my shoulder down to zero so I [Music] another thing I wanted to talk about here is the back in Greece I started off using this Dow Corning's but the person I think it's garbage it's thick it's it's sold us back in Greece but it seems to leak through the joints no matter how little I use or doesn't create a perfect seal if I don't use just the perfect amount you don't need a lot anyway what I've started using here is krytox GPL 207 which it's a little thinner it's not marketed as back in Greece but it's a parent induct and a fighter temperature resistance so when you're using this stuff you really don't need a lot a little little dab on there just a little dab will be it's hard to do with one hand and then so on your joint you would just apply a little bit of that is down the edge there just like that even that looks like quite a bit there I don't like to come all the way down to the bottom on this piece just because this doesn't see a lot of the heat and I you know I don't like the trip to seep into the joiner end up running past now but how do you pull the vacuum this will thin out it'll really in the filament will pull into the rest of the joint you do have to make sure to actually put enough on there though otherwise you'll still end up with joints that are hard during just put a little bit on there like that and you stick that in the joint you just spin it back and forth until you get a nice clear joint seal showing that like it's easier to spend titles so here's how to properly grease the join now I've got a nice thin little coating on that side that side put it in there carefully just minutes with the devil corny grease it tends to make the joint nice and clear I've noticed with the cry box it doesn't clarify it as much they just spin it there and you shouldn't feel any any glass grinding together get you just feel smooth all the way around that's nice and snug and stay longer I'm actually gonna clean house and as is your joint don't forget to put a cat clip on it there should be plenty enough grease one thing to take note up here do not forget your [ __ ] stir bar because I do this just about every time and I have to take this out plop it in there and we grease that joint make sure you put your spare bar in there every time I'm about ready to get this started now I get my cold trap cold and for anybody wondering what the purpose of this bowl here is the goal trap will collect any of the vapors and they'll drip down into this blast now the extra cold will help also condensed extra [Music] boiling installing cycling so with everything hooked up greased up everything's cold vacuums been running for a while and gotta like glasses together so the first thing I'm gonna do is run it back to you and don't worry about that little dog this is the flash don't fly called a joke this I mean it will cause some certain problems as it will also try to boil and want to vaporize compounds that are still in it but that's already distillate so this should be pretty negligible and yes I should have taken the time to clean that better but the other two that will collect everything are clean much better and as this is just for personal use I'm okay with this yeah I'm not too concerned about that right there so the first thing we're gonna end up doing here is turn on a vacuum gauge also this PVC pipe isn't hooked up that was an experiment before I was going to run in public that PVC is just not the way to go it off gases and a week too and it just there's there's too many points of leakage so it's just not word that maybe some Dale gold stainless steel but right now that's just not you know it's it's not in the foreseeable future so I'm just using the government roses and then [ __ ] everything up or whatever I need at the time the vacuum regulator just hooked up because for other purposes if you did that great out of the way out of the back and pump through the table into the vacuum regulator - bull trout so whenever I need to use anything else I just I just unscrew that fitting there screwing whatever appropriate fitting I need so right now for for the distillation I'm just going to do turn it on and set it to pull back in because we don't need any regulation here it's probably isn't the greatest pump but I'll worry about these problems a little bit later down the road for us to change the oil I just changed out while the singular form works next another the dryers as well [Music] smells pretty clear to you this is just a reservoir [ __ ] chambers in here so question they tell you almost impossible through here [Music] missiles you gotta be careful in your film because we have company [Music] so just be wary about it got one of these pumps right now I'm just pulling you back c'mon I'm gonna let that pull down as low as it'll go before I even start heating it up as you can see is kind of slow with this welcome other part of this problem is my lines could be dirty so you know there's terpenes and stuff collected absorbed into the lines and they're gonna be vaporizing and off-gassing as well so that's another thing that'll affect your vacuum level another thing that I'm aware of and we'll try to address in the future see what I can do about that so I'm aware of some of the problems that I have here another one should be this should be robbers I guess in some tip while I'm not really sure what I should wrap it with I'm going out there how quickly you're done oh yeah but how does of great now like when this is running this is just acting as a condenser as well I'm going I did try packing the head with stainless steel steel wool I wasn't really sure how much of there's also the condensation that bill here which is an issue running degrees so that's another thing they're going to take care of possibly wrap that up so there's there's key things that I'm aware of that I need to fix that could improve the distillation overall we'll see how long this takes it's just about one o'clock in the afternoon I'm hoping to get started here by one o'clock and see how long it takes to get through this whole process thing so right now we're sitting at 1,200 with this particular batch I have done more filtering on this than dispatches okay I kept filtering it through stage one and full of a stop boat that I really freeze up to 24 hours again we filtered it through stage one and I kept doing that if there was nothing coming through in stage one there are nothing getting left behind the filters to stage one which I wasn't doing previously and I probably should have been actually I definitely should have been alive and I repeated that through stage two and stage three as well so what's in here is has been more filter than anything that I put in previously so I'm curious to see what kind of an effect last thing you have going with this with this current class of distillation and what's in there right now is just to put exactly 1,000 grams fully winterized and filtered plenty of oil they you know make thanks to a closed loop system actually made to a terminator style system so here we are at 9:20 so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna let that just sit for a while without backing pull-down we'll come back when that's that's not a star I've been holding steady at 860 for a while got a pretty good boil there I mean realistically I'd like to see it not boiling but someone's car cleaning it up now [Applause] I'm gonna heat up to 50 degrees you're running before I start turning on the starboard point of advice if you want your driving school last a little longer one thing that makes a good seal not let any moisture in there because it hit moisture freezes and then encouraged to do a block of dry ice to do is just stuff it all blankets or towels or whatever in this remove all the air space that you tend from the dry place and this will last the cooler I'll have this pool of dry ice in a couple of days and I constantly use it topping this thing off making sure it stays cold that's the process for now it's just going to be one once it hits 50 degrees start going up by 30 degrees so then I'll heat it up as soon as it is 50 I'll ramp it up to 80 and then from 80 I'll go to 110 and so on and so forth like that usually once I get to about 180 I've seen a bit of reaction from water and other call the files and stuff up here and ahead so I will hold it there at that temperature for a while we'll let that stuff collect into the ship blast so I haven't had a bit of an opportunity here and I see we have boiled up a little bit [Music] but it's not 60 degrees right now all should be 56 overshot that's already pointing system so at this point now since it's not Ronnie Emma on the skewer because we see over there 1,050 [Music] the pressures come up because the vapors in here well this is the first time ever you do this to me only goes so fast that we're gonna stop [Music] except this 286 the other thing too is this is a PID so it's gonna learn it know if I want to get to 50 I'm gonna end up going up to 80 anyway so I guess it's kind of learning that it came to order shoot the temperature a little bit stupid [ __ ] but this is where your this is the difference between your basic PID and something that actually controls the wattage right now I'm pretty sure that's just collecting water and ethanol but only mostly ethanol what was left after the evaporation process the reclamation so this unfortunately won't be reclaimed it will just be thrown out I just about at 180 now pretty vigorous reaction going on I'm honestly not sure if it's supposed to happen what this right now this isn't anything good this is just the about earlier least I think it is anyway so in this pointing I've been told these puffs of smoke are not good [Music] I can't remember the reason why and I'm not running entirely correctly with myself can leave your song [Music] so I will just hold this here for a little until this reaction stops basically distilled all out just got pure stuff here over the right now we're in 860 so it's been just about an hour come up to this temperature get here of course that our like it's gone up to a Nazi 1200 [Music] gen-i smoking stuck there too Nessa's tough innings of is out there the bus now if I had a secondary cold trap on there I'm sure so I know this server stuff didn't like - all this hold America last one during about ten minutes later you're taking the reaction up here stock for the most part I stopped collecting stuff as a pastor [Music] [Applause] start turning because this would take a while [Music] hormone when this to exchange so slope is still down at 790 microns now [Music] about 220 now and [Music] after twenty twelve hundred microns was lower I was starting to see a little bit reaction here so I've set the temperature up to 230 and I want to stop it when I start having a reaction here 46 degrees at the head I'm going to junk this is starting to get a little bit more yellow kind of a bit a little bit thicker oh I also set this up once this hit [Music] so probably by the time this event of 225 or 220 6w3 in addition to 25 right now with 154 point two degrees and temperature dropping at the head well 50 micron 2-minute 86\u00b0 I'm actually going to hold that right there that is now 240 in the afternoon when I started this about one o'clock from here I am our 40 minutes in see this is running by the Chinese stuff that's gonna overshoot the temperature not measuring correctly as to why to swing hysteresis I only seen a really big clean reflux rate in this setup once or twice I mean no one wants your twice but I mean just to replicate it every time I probably turn around run for a bit michalak [Music] so it's 3:45 started except one I had the temperature such as a little too either to 35 and it's kind of boiling over but it has gotten to the fraction looking for I think it looks pretty good the most part yeah some kind of something's showing up I'm not sure what it was but so far this looks pretty good here another got this stuff coming down before coming down it was little green colors like this because he [Music] I'm so willing to do now is I'll rotate this over and begin collecting this fraction and collected in this separate jar here yeah rotated cow turn the temperature down 230 actually keep this one 2:33 instead so collecting distraction I think I have noticed that I've got I mean you see it down there very well little bubbles right there in my class I'm sure how they came about or where they came from [Music] I believe this is the hearts hearts fraction I wanna say but I don't know also not really sure with those little bubbles I run I think it's just an air bubbles I want to save all this I hope it is it looks like it is [Music] I'm sure this looks like animals [Music] and there's old that's collected someone that will be I guess wildest one and then I put this stuff into it our container later right after all the same process I gotta collect all the garbage and let it sit this fraction that off [Music] [Applause] and so far so far just looking like the nicest distillate I've produced out of this which I attribute to the extra filtration that I'm wrong see how it looks on collects an alert so while 280 degrees when we got eleven fifty microns not ideal I was able to pull a lower vacuum on this and the temperature would be much lower than the same results right now it's five o'clock now so that's been going for about four hours a couple hours since I actually started to cover it it's another nine hundred and sixty microns now we're degrees up in the head to put it 32-bit 50:33 it seemed to be working pretty well so bit of oil over but in the most part I guess it's working okay this what's already here there was at some point there's a little white cloudy [ __ ] showing up I'm not really sure what it was but it's not there now it's not showing I'm done here this in a second distillation with help I'm not sure what that [ __ ] is it keeps showing up in here I have never shown like one of my other videos I'm not really sure how it started why it started it's not something that I've always seen and quite frankly and really saw in flesh and doing all the filtration so that's what confuses me the more but I don't see anything down here and now right from there we are a couple hundred grands who goes [Music] this is actually pretty clear the stuff that you see in there there's a lot of air bubbles it's hard to see on camera but you know what right there right there a little I feel swirl thing that's that murky [ __ ] that I was we play those bongos across there down from the top goes over there [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and that seems like a lot but I eat about five or six grams probably about 10 grand you're just eating this [Music] 20 up there 6 evening now and I'm pretty much just gonna wrap this up on you there's a bit left in there I'm sure there's a lot I could collect still I don't feel like letting it run all night it's director slow down and get a lot of character so [Music] Kangra doesn't really show it too well there's there's a lot of stuff on the outside of the glass that's showing up in here there's some air bubbles and what's dirtier than it really is but it's not it's not that very this however this does look a little bit cleaner still less air bubbles it's a higher heat yeah I did turn this up specifically so I would get a higher boiling right but even now I can see it's starting to slow down there somewhat so it's about at this point I'm just going to shut it off here and we got we're at 10:50 so I find pretty disappointing a lot of times that dullness I've been able to achieve a lot lower results in fact a couple of times by this point I've been down to probably 200 or less microns so I've definitely got some issues here and I'm welcome some of these got some suggestions or nonsensical help me out I call that some people suggestions and done what I hadn't but at this point I'm not sure just too much too much more I can this is certainly clogged up you got a goblin come down there you want some [ __ ] that's one thing that having problems with usually that starts happening at the beginning it causes trouble the whole way through but when that plugs up the boiling air stops I'm going to give it a little bit water - for sure color week too low 6:30 6:40 [Music] now you can see where it blocks where it becomes plugged and stops the boiling across it's still going there's not a click still a bit in there I'm just a little pressed for time this evening unfortunately so [Music] well I do when I shut this down I just turn the temperature way and just back down to zero and I'll let this cool down under packaging all still running because if I unplug this right now if I disconnect a vacuum right now this will fill up with smoke I don't really like doing that I don't like it and smoke in there it's all about you're in a while to cool down and then disconnect all files and applause playing out with the next and four blasts into the jars did you make a medicine so I just released a vacuum on that bye I loosened up this time I just kind of pulled it that'll do with support so I want to collect that stuff my trusty heatgun here [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] when you're cool enough heat gun to mine has a cool setting [Music] any rate when you pull off your heat gun you're always going to want to put it up like that will maintain the light to your heat gun and be less dangerous because unless the heat escape up inside that's just a this is a little FYI I'm gonna turn the pump in here there we go we'll call now today I said I'll just pull these once it's out here like so and before I have to you know wipe up the grease inside there and we have I'm not gonna lie I'm not gonna try and you know I'm not gonna be anything I'm sure I could have better results I just don't know how I would love to have better results perhaps I would be able to consume less of it on a daily basis but for the time being it is what it is this is pretty much what I did it looks pretty golden and nice when you look at it you know in a syringe or in a little on a little jar something like that piece of glass until the drunk did it take in there like I said I'll recycle that that plainly stuff in the bottom yeah I love your backs and that's kind of stuck but you know it can be recycled it's gonna be cracked and so I just don't like waste and if I can waste as little as possible I will should we got that up I'll set that to uh turn off for about you meter the condenser so I'll take that part this is some little and that's it for today that's just from that distillation thanks for watching everybody", "q4maAFJSWAA": "[Music] I'd like to welcome everybody today's presentation on CBD in the treatment of Alzheimer's addictions and mood disorders I'm your host dr. Donnelly Snipes in this class we're going to talk about how we can use CBD in the treatment of addiction CBD and its impact on mental health issues CBD and its impact on neurodegenerative issues like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as hit a real high-level overview of CBD adverse events toxicity and drug interactions that is going to be really important because a lot of our clients may decide to try to self-medicate with CBD in addition to other medications and I'll just foreshadow for you CBD oil or CBD interacts with just about every medication out there so we do want to make sure that they're aware of that and hopefully agree to if they're going to try to start taking CBD do it in a physician supervised capacity all right cannabidiol is promise for treatment of substance use disorder CBD is short for cannabidiol and recent models implicate major brain circuits involved in reward salient C so how were warding something is motivation and memory and learned associations in substance abuse we call those triggers in maintaining addiction which may be largely modulated by the endocannabinoid system or the receptors in our brain that respond to cannabinoids and that includes THC as well as cannabidiol the endocannabinoid system or ECS modulates dopamine that's really important to recognize it also has an effect on noradrenaline and Sarah but we'll get there when we talk about addiction though one of the things that we have seen with addiction and try to avoid saying we know because we don't really know a whole lot for a hundred percent certain but one of the things that we've seen repeatedly with addiction is that addictive substances and addictive behaviors cause a dopamine surge the endocannabinoid system is there to try to modulate that dopamine so you don't get those surges quite so much alcohol nicotine and THC which is not CBD it is another cannabinoid that's in marijuana but alcohol nicotine and THC all increased dopamine levels via nerve terminals modulated by the in endocannabinoid system important to recognize that when people are using these addictive substances they are activating that endocannabinoid system the endocannabinoid system including receptors cb1 are which you don't need to know that for the test or anything but there is a particular receptor in there that represents a necessary contributor towards cellular adaptations in the transition from recreational substance use to a use disorder so when this CB 1 R is activated it causes changes or it facilitates changes in the brain cells in the system that facilitate the move from recreational use to dependence and and tolerance and all those other things the ECS mediated synaptic plasticity may facilitate emotional learning and memory processes in increasing emotional responses to substance related cues basically what that's saying is the enactment endocannabinoid system encourages the brain cells to be a little bit more flexible to be a little bit more receptive and responsive and which facilitates learning when though systems are activated that kind of primes the brain for learning based on memory so now they're in this wide-open situation think about a classroom you know when you create a classroom you want it to create an environment that's conducive to learning so you do certain things in the classroom and you don't do other things in order to make it so most people are comfortable there they have the materials they need to learn they are not distracted the same sort of thing goes on in our brain when our brain has the right environment to learn it is much more receptive to things and the endocannabinoid system facilitates that condition in the brain antagonism which means shutting down locking off turning off whatever you want to say antagonism of that cb1 are receptor reduces alcohol induced sensitization and nicotine relapse so they're finding that CBD may reduce the people from developing tolerance and sensitization to ethanol and it tends to make them less likely to relapse on nicotine CBD is non rewarding it doesn't have the psychogenic properties of THC that is super important to remember especially for people who are in recovery because CBD is not going to get them high it had acts on other receptors in order to facilitate other processes it acts on a number of receptor systems including the opioid system the serotonin system and the cannabinoid system so when people take CBD they are modulating those symptoms systemically administered CBD which means orally or intravenously by a doctor I guess but generally we're talking about oral systemic lis administered CBD regulates mesolimbic dopamine act that's important to know and potentially reduces substance-induced dysregulation so when people take CBD orally it keeps them from having that dopamine spike that may occur when they take substances because when we take substances that dopamine system gets dysregulated it just goes wide open and CBD seems to modulate that a little bit treatment with CBD blocked the rewarding effects of morphine and heroin and prevented drug and stress induced reinstatement of condition place preference lasting up to two weeks post administration so that's really interesting now conditioned place preference why do we care about this when somebody receives a reward receives a stimulus gets that dopamine rush in a particular place that place becomes associated with pleasure in substance abuse counseling we talk about this as you know a trigger being in that place being in a bar or if you you know use heroin when you're at home you know being at home could be a trigger and when people were given to CBD it seemed to block those memories and reduce the preference for certain places that are associated with use which is really awesome so it kind of reduces those urges a little bit and it lasted up to two weeks post administration CBD reduces a lot of different things and as always in this presentation all of the hyperlinks will take you to the Articles that I got this information from just to keep it clean I do the hyperlinks but CBD reduces in most people the overall level of alcohol intake the motivation for ethanol it's keeping them from becoming tolerant to it but it also kind of takes some of the rewarding effects out of it since its modulating that dopamine release it reduces anxiety and impulse which is helpful not only in alcoholism but a whole host of other mood mental health and even neurodegenerative disorders alcohol related to ptosis and fibrosis in the liver is also reduced because CBD reduces lipid accumulation so reduces that fatty liver it stimulates Auto Fei Jie so the liver the body starts eating consuming getting rid of whatever you want to say bad cells and it modulates inflammation we know that alcoholism causes inflammation in the liver and CBD helps modulate or reduce some of that inflammation now this isn't a pass where somebody can take CBD and then drink all they want I don't want them to start thinking that way because the addicted brain will go there but it is interesting to notice that CBD may be able to help reverse a little bit some of the liver damage done by the intake of alcohol CBD also reduces oxidative stress by inducing death of activated hepatic stellate cells this is again something you're seeing that autophagy oxidative stress is when you have byproducts and residual residues of things that have processes that have happened in your body and they can build up and be toxic which is why the stress part and CBD actually causes some of these cells that have gone a little wonky to be consumed to be gotten rid of it also reduces alcohol-related brain damage preventing neuronal loss by it's antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties okay when people drink one cause of brain damage is due to lack of enough thiamine because alcohol blocks thiamine uptake and results in where Nicky korzak or Korsakoff syndrome CBD doesn't seem to help with that so that's one issue but the other issue is that the ingestion of alcohol leads to systemic inflammation and CBD because of its anti-inflammatory properties does seem to reduce the inflammation and reduce the damage to the brain cells because of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory processes CBD in stimulant disorders CBD has reversed toxicity and seizures induced by cocaine not saying again this is not like taking naltrexone or something that with opioids that is an automatic reversal but they have found that it has helped heal the body some when somebody has used cocaine and had had toxicity or seizures it reverses behavioral sensitization induced by M FET amines and it reduces motivation to self administer cocaine and meth we're speculating again that CBDs function in modulating that dopamine and keeping it from you know going wide open is what reduces motivation to self-administer because the high is just not so good it's just like CBD also increased the extinction of cocaine and amphetamine induced conditioned place preference just like I said on the last slide or the slide before because it is reducing the rewarding say reward salience of those places and of those things then what when it's administered then by administering that you're also reducing the trigger salience you're reducing the urges to go there mechanisms involved in the protective effects of CBD on addiction to psycho stimulant drugs include prevention of drug-induced neuro adaptation hopefully it's preventing by addressing that that receptor it's preventing that neuroplasticity that encourages people to move to problematic use it encourages somehow they don't know how exactly but it does encourage the eraser of aberrant drug memories so it helps with some of those for some people they say it helps with their drug dreams that they have elimination of cognitive deficits induced by psycho stimulant drugs so it helps the brain become a little bit healthier an alleviation of mental disorders that are comorbid with psychostimulant abuse you'll learn in a little while that CBD interacts on opioid serotonin dopamine and norepinephrine systems so it is impactful for just about everything in the DSM for not everything but just about cannabis and mental health disorders anxiety social anxiety depression especially depression related to anxiety when somebody's just stressed out for so long they start to develop this sense of hopelessness and helplessness all of those have shown extreme promise for treatment with CBD CBD has many additional targets within and beyond the an endocannabinoid system it's not just that one system it also activates 5ht which you remember our serotonin receptors adrenal receptors so that's your norepinephrine system and your mu opioid receptors those are your pain receptors your heroin opioid related receptors CBD interestingly has the opposite effect of THC in the prefrontal cortex which is where we have our higher-order thinking and our impulse control and in the amygdala when people take THC a lot of times it increases their respiration it increases their heart rate and it activates their amygdala it activates their stress response system CBD seems to have the opposite effect which is interesting when we get down in a few minutes to talking about the implications of treatment of PTSD with CBD CBD either as a mono therapy or added to regular antipsychotic medication improved symptoms in patients with schizophrenia with promising effects especially in early stages of the illness in terms of garden grown marijuana again it's really important to recognize that THC is a major component of your garden grown cannabis it's really there are special seeds special plants special whatever you call them hybrids that you get theoretically to produce hemp which is where the CBD oil is extracted from so garden grown cannabis may not have the same effects because it does have those higher levels of THC now remember some illnesses some conditions actually respond better to THC but we weren't talking about that in this particular presentation so I left those out but do think about the fact that CBD and THC have some opposing psychological effects in one study I didn't find a whole lot of studies on CBD and PTSD but in one study 91% of patients experienced a decrease in PTSD symptom severity as low as evidenced by lower scores on the pcl5 at 8 weeks post treatment as opposed to their initial baseline well that's pretty encouraging again we want to look at where is this coming from since the PT up since PTSD does involve hyper activation of that amay d'leh and it does involve a lot of those other the serotonin system and other things it seems like the endocannabinoid system specifically CBD helps modulate that and kind of get it back to normal I've used the analogy repeatedly of a warm bath and when people are really anxious angry stressed-out hyper vigilant it's running like running hot water wide open and when they're super calm it's like running cold water wide open and it seems like the CBD gets in there and kind of monkeys with it so it's an adequate not too much as getting through but enough is getting through Alzheimer's and dementia cannabidiol or CBD is a phyto cannabinoid which is helpful as an antioxidant to reduce oxidative stress an anti-inflammatory and an agonist of dopamine and serotonin remember antioxidants we talk about all the time we want antioxidants to prevent aging we want antioxidants to help help fight cancer we want antioxidants to help prevent the degeneration of neural pathways and development of Alzheimer's and dementia so antioxidants not only in food but also in CBD are really helpful at reducing oxidative stress Aunty means getting rid of and oxidant means those ox that oxidative stress we already talked some about CBDs anti-inflammatory properties and then remember agonist means increasing dopamine and serotonin so it increases the dopamine and serotonin systems Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are both characterized by inflammation systemically and oxidative stress CBD is also helpful in patients with epilepsy restless legs and multiple sclerosis now with restless legs that has a a lot to do with dopamine imbalances with epilepsy and multiple sclerosis the CBD generally is used in epilepsy for seizures and in multiple sclerosis for tremors CBD as opposed to THC did not negatively alter cardiovascular parameters body temperature psychomotor or psychological functions nor did it induce a catalepsy or a trance-like or seizure like state like THC does in some people it doesn't put them into this zone it really doesn't have much of a psychogenic effect at all based on his pharmacology CBD may be useful not only in Alzheimer's and dementia but also in other mental health and behavioral conditions that have symptoms such as agitation self-injury anxiety aggression like autism spectrum disorders for example so based on its pharmacology CBD may be useful for reducing agitation anxiety psychosis aggression depression pain plaque formation in the brain and oxidative stress all of those things we work with to some level everyday now CBD is not typically strong enough if you want to use that word to really help a lot with sleep unless the person is having difficulty sleeping because of their anxiety or agitation it may help there now I didn't specifically research CBT and you know sleep or CBD and insomnia but it may be helpful as an adjunctive to what the person is currently doing again CBD interacts as does THC cannabinoids interact with a whole host of medications so it's really important to with your patients if they are going to try it because some are just determined that they want to try that and get off prescriptions or whatever that they do need medical consultation other things that CBD does it helps with pain obviously inflammation is an underlying cause for pain in a lot of people autoimmune to see diseases cause systemic inflammation in the body so when people have something like Crohn's disease or fibromyalgia or you know even diabetes is associated with systemic inflammation depression interestingly enough is correlated with systemic inflammation and I have a video on the YouTube channel on leaky gut and gut health that helps explain you know how depression and stress actually can lead to systemic inflammation and vice versa how systemic inflammation can lead to depression and stress asthma now that's not typically associated with mental health issues so to speak but when people are asthmatic some people have anxiety I know my daughter when she was little she had breathing problems and she was terrified to go very far away from home she was terrified to go out hiking and do fun things because she was afraid she would have an asthma attack so there is a certain amount of agoraphobia or anxiety that can be associated with asthma especially bad asthma but that aside if somebody has asthma they found that CBD is an exceptionally potent bronchodilator so it does help open up those bronchioles so people can breathe easier and osteoporosis interestingly enough that's not really associated with inflammation but I didn't have another slide to put it on as people get older especially women as we get older and our estrogen levels change we become more susceptible to osteoporosis cannabidiol CBD as well as some other cannabinoids stimulate bone growth and may be able to help prevent osteoporosis so that's something to look at again why do we care for a mental health from a mental health perspective well because osteoporosis can be painful bone broken bones broken hips from osteoporosis can be painful and debilitating and as we if we feel ourselves getting more fragile it tends to impair our self-efficacy and impair our our mood and our outlook to answer your question Robert all CBD mixtures are not created equal CBD is not regulated by the FDA with the exception there is one drug that is used to treat seizures in epilepsy that has been fda-approved but anything you get over-the-counter is not regulated by the FDA it is also not supposed to make any claims about being able to cure or treat any diseases additionally if you get your CBD oil from acme calm and you get get it on in June and then you order again in August from Acme com same manufacturer same place same even same size jar you may not get the same potency of CBD there's also a lot of variation between producers in the actual potency of the CBD in the tincture that you're getting or the oil or whatever method you're getting it in so no all CBD products are definitely not created equal and you can't even guarantee that you're getting the same dosage even if you get it from the same supplier every single time do be aware of that it's just like all of the workout supplements and stuff that are on the market there's a lot of loosey goosey nests which is it's very frustrating and it can be very scary additionally the dosage for CBD when you go to one manufacturer they may recommend XYZ dosage you go to another manufacturer they may recommend something you know five ten times higher so the recommended dosage is all over the place or the recommended serving size they can't call it a dosage is all over the place which also means you don't know what potency in many of these studies they were very careful to either not say or give a range of the dosage that they used because you know we don't really know yet since cannabic an avid aisle is so new on the market we don't really know what the appropriate and helpful and therapeutic dosage is yet which is again why you need to get a naturopath or somebody who is very familiar with CBD involved in the process if somebody is going to be taking it so what are some of the adverse effects in toxicity and I note here that all of these symptoms can be seen in people when they take CBD at doses higher than recommended for human consumption but like I said the potency is a little bit loosey-goosey you know between suppliers and the recommended serving size varies dramatically between suppliers so the dose that is quote recommended for human consumption really hasn't been all that well established yet but the FDA has weighed in a little bit but when people take too much they can have developmental toxicity so it can impair physical and cycle development if they are still growing embryo fetal mortality and we're going to talk about that a little bit more in a minute but it actually prevents or inhibit implantation of the embryo and it can cause birth defects central nervous system inhibition so and that's the same as a lot of your depressants it can cause slow to reaction times slow breathing slower heart rate to a very bad place neurotoxicity you're too much of a good thing even though it Fioretti helps regulate a lot of different systems in the brain if you take too much just like anything else it can be toxic hepatocellular which means liver injuries and abnormalities we need to be aware that yes it can't help heal the liver but in doses that are too big it can also overwhelm the lip liver and cause problems itself spermatogenesis reduction so the development or creation of sperm is reduced so that sperm count is gonna go down male reproductive system alterations and it goes into you know the size and weight of testes and other things if you want to read about it the articles in your class hypotension so low blood pressure diarrhea vomiting and fatigue however you know I'm putting that out there so you know that CBD yes it's natural but it also can be harmful just like a lot of other natural things that are out there there are a lot of positive effects if used appropriately and it's important to just be aware and and be cognizant of this and yes Logan the seizure medicine is epidemics CBD adverse effects cannabis and CBD use is rising among pregnant women in one study an estimated 4 to 20 percent of 18 to 24 year old pregnant women were using some form of cannabis products now that included THC as well as CBD but that's a that's a lot of pregnant women CBD inhibits embryo implantation and placenta development remember they need the placenta to get the nutrients in order to develop appropriately and prenatal cannabinoid exposure not just CBD but to any of the cannabinoids potentiates the harmful effects of alcohol increasing the risk of the development of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and craniofacial malformations and eye defects really important to recognize that not only is CBD potentially harmful to a fetus and cannabinoids potentially harmful to a fetus we know that alcohol is potentially very harmful to a fetus when you put them together they potentiate each other so it's I mean it's even more powerful than like one plus one is two it's like one plus one is six really important that pregnant women are not drinking definitely not drinking and using CBD or cannabinoids or cannabis marijuana concurrently and preferably not using cannabinoids either so let's go down to drug reactions and there's a lot of them remember I told you that CBD interacts with just about every drug on the market hmmm well here you go let's go through this laundry list and talk about why we care the first one is sort of a easy go by guide but it doesn't cover all of them however any of your clients who are taking drugs that have a grapefruit warning on them like boosts per\u00f3n or a lot of the antipsychotics those drugs are metabolized by cyp2d6 which is inhibited by CBD so if they're taking that medication then the metabolization of those drugs may not go the way it's supposed to which means in most cases the drug levels are going to bill up to toxic levels in the system way too quickly so it's really important if there's a grapefruit warning on their drugs not to take CBD that's you know just one of those rules but that warning is not on a lot of medications steroids and corticosteroids are used for things like asthma arthritis and other inflammatory conditions we need to ask people are they taking steroids or corticosteroids when my daughter used to get sick she had she was born with lung problems and so every time she would get sick it would go to her chest and she would either develop bronchitis or pneumonia just like that and she would have to be on a nebulizer in order to reduce the inflammation in her in her lungs sometimes she would even have to take oral steroids if it got that bad why do I bring that up because some of our clients may be you know not taking any drugs at all you know any medications at all taking CBD and then they get sick and they get prescribed steroids or corticosteroids it's important for them to recognize that oh this new medication I'm taking might interact with the CBD that I'm already taking they need to let their prescribing physician or physicians know if they're taking it statins these are the drugs that people take for cholesterol most people I know unfortunately who are over the age of about 50 are on some level of statins and you know we could argue whether they need to be or not statins also have some interesting effects on mood just as a side a side effect but if somebody is taking statins CBD will interact with those CBD interacts with calcium channel blockers those are the medications you take for high blood pressure certainly don't want to be monkeying around with that remember CBD can in high enough doses can cause hypotension so if you're taking medication for your blood pressure to reduce it and then you take CBD with it guess what your blood pressure may go through the floor antihistamines interestingly enough HIV antivirals and immune modulators because the CBD is it's in and of itself a immune system modulator sometimes it works with sometimes it works against the HIV drugs and you know depending on what cocktail the person is on is really important to know the interactions I'll put all three of these together benzodiazepines which are your anti-anxiety medications antipsychotics which is like your seroquel and your house all and antidepressant medications and herbs including things like st. John's wort all interact with the gaba system the serotonin system and/or the dopamine system your antipsychotics typically are responsible for reducing dopamine levels so if somebody is taking CBD which increases dopamine you're kind of working against yourself here antidepressant medications increase serotonin and potentially dopamine and or norepinephrine CBD potentially also increases all three of those and so you may put people into a position where they are at risk of things like serotonin syndrome serotonin syndrome is deadly if people get too much serotonin it spikes their body temperature and results in tremors vomiting potentially loss of consciousness a lot of really bad stuff and it can happen after just one dose it's not something that has to do that they have to do you know for a week or two weeks or months at a time sometimes we see when we talk about serotonin syndrome a lot of times we're talking about when we're talking about serotonin and serotonin syndrome we're also talking about when people take it with antidepressants when they take two different antidepressants together or they take antidepressants and opioids which actually both increase serotonin or they take antidepressants and this is a favorite one of the teenagers dextromethorphan which is a cough suppressant a lot of teenagers for a while don't know if they're still doing it we're taking mega doses of dextromethorphan rectally in order to increase the rate of absorption and the dextromethorphan actually increases serotonin levels and they were some of them were getting so much they were developing serotonin syndrome so serotonin is really nothing to monkey around with if you don't know what you're doing like I said herbs were looking at 5ht as well 5htp as well as st. John's wort anticonvulsant like klonopin or clonazepam beta blockers another thing that is used for blood pressure proton pump inhibitors which are things like zantac and there's one that begins with a P and I can't think of it right now but you take it for stomach acid and even oral diabetic medications any of these all of these interact with CBD and it will affect the amount of circulate that certain amount of that medication circulating in your system or the absorbability or availability of it in some cases it reduces and in other cases it increases the point is to know what what the interactions are now one interesting place you can go is to drugs calm and they have an interaction checker see if I can get it to come up okay so to answer somebody else's question as well as to show you how the drug interaction thing works you put in the medication or medications that the person is taking and then it'll tell you drug interactions for this one it says statins and cannabidiol cannabidiol may cause liver problems and using it with other medications that also affect the liver such as statins may increase the risk of liver damage so that's what that's all about so that you just go to drugs calm or search for drugs calm drug interaction checker and I've used it with a lot of my clients to help them understand the side effects of some of the medications they're taking as well as to check for side effects of the medications they're taking with other things like herbs over-the-counter drugs even alcohol CBD is showing promise as an alternative or adjunctive treatment for a variety of things ranging from Alzheimer's and addiction to Parkinson's and schizophrenia I mean if you go to PubMed and I'll go there in a minute you're gonna find tons of articles in your classroom I think I have in the additional resources section I think I have about 17 articles that I cited in in this presentation there's just a plethora of information and I'm really excited that this is coming out but right now they still don't have good recommendations for dosing and even if they did if you're getting the CBD over-the-counter you can't guarantee that you're actually getting that dosage of CBD in that formulation CBD does not have the psychogenic effects that THC does however THC has been found to be more effective at addressing certain issues over-the-counter CBD is non standardized so dosages even from the same manufacturer but in different Lots may have different potency CBD interacts with most medications so it's vital to consult a physician prior to using it the dosages like I said of CBD in the literature varied widely currently there are a couple of CBD based medications that are FDA approved for the treatment of seizure disorder finally remember that CBD oils may also have traces of THC generally not over 0.3% y'all know one of my favorite things is pubmed and I can never remember the long address for it you just type in pubmed cannabidiol and we'll just do an PTSD and i guess i stumped it because it took a long time you can go over here and you can shorten the window so you only see stuff from the last two years I always have free full text checked because I like to read the actual article not just the abstract and you can set additional filters like species I always have mine checked on humans because I'm not as interested in what it did to the rats but then all of these you can you can look at of somebody asked about cannabidiol and insomnia so let's see proof of concept there so then going with just the abstract that one hasn't been done yet they're talking about what they will do result 72 adults had primary concerns of anxiety and poor sleep anxiety scores decreased in 57 patients and sleep scores improved within the first month in 48 patients but fluctuated over time and CBD was well tolerated in all but three patients so theoretically this may be something that comes out as a newer intervention that is less harmful to the brain than Anna histamines and some of the barbiturates that are currently available for insomnia something to keep your eye on now all right let's look at let's look for that see if I can find anything on the FDA on CBD yeah yeah potential harm of CBD the FDA really doesn't like CBD they want to tell you about all the scary stuff so right now like I said in the research the dosage a lot of times wasn't even noted but other times it was there was a very wide spectrum of what they were offering for it no the research studies that we looked at or that I looked at did not talk about CBD isolate full-spectrum or broad spectrum we can look at those real quick let's see it appears all of those have THC removed but in the full spectrum and broad spectrum they have some of the other cannabinoids that exist in the marijuana plant in there and you know THC is the psychoactive one so if that's what a lot of the drug tests measure for but each one of the cannabinoids has its own independent properties and usefulness and things so I can see why some people would look for a broad spectrum CBD in order to get as much benefit an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects as possible without the THC but you notice neither NIDA nor stomps I had anything about that on them what isn't interestingly it appears this article on the National Institute of drug abuse is quite positive about the potential promise of cannabidiol for therapeutic use so I'll put that in here for you guys to read in-depth let me answer your question Logan let's see yes I would say Logan the I mean anything with dextromethorphan that is being taken in addition to a CBD can't have a potentiation effect and the triple triple sees themselves or dextromethorphan alone can cause can in high enough doses can lead to serotonin syndrome so it is that is one of those things that can be really scary oops No oh hush here is a video I did do on serotonin syndrome if you're in Florida and you need medical error prevention you can get CEUs for it but if you don't care about that then you know just watch the video if you're interested in learning more about serotonin syndrome and what the symptoms are are there any other questions I've really enjoyed all your questions about CBD I am still learning about it obviously along with you guys but I was I really enjoyed going through the research and yes I saw somebody else commenting I'm not sure where you're seeing the ads at there shouldn't be any ads during the during the class but unfortunately Google is creepy aware of what you do I swear sometimes they just hear what I'm saying and I'm not even looking online and I start getting fed ads about it so you probably will start seeing some ads about CBD oil one thing you can do if you want to there are some free open-source ad blocker programs my husband has them on his computer because he really hates ads to no end but you can also install those if ads bother you I usually just kind of ignore them but they are distracting for some people alrighty everybody if you have any other questions please feel free to email me at support at all CEUs com otherwise I will see you on

the first video in a three-part series here in the first video I'm going to go over setting up fractional setting up a fractional distillation apparatus we're going to talk about the concepts of simple distillation fractional distillation short path distillation and vacuum distillation so we'll discuss these concepts from both a chemistry and an alchemical perspective in the second video we will actually perform our distillation and we'll talk about how to keep good notes and how to use a pressure temperature nominal graph to calculate the actual temperature of our distillation I'll show you what that chart looks like and we'll also talk about the concept of molecular distillation or separating out different molecules based on their different boiling points in the third video we'll remove our distillate and we'll transfer it from our receiving flask here on our distillation apparatus we'll transfer it into some labeled canning jars and we'll clean up all the other glassware and we'll get it ready for our next distillation so the third video will be about removing the distillate and doing the cleanup so to begin the first video I'm going to disassemble my still here and I will have the pieces laid out on the counter and then I will go through with you the reassembling and we'll discuss we'll discuss each piece and its function we'll put the vacuum grease on all the joints and some teflon tape on on the smaller joints here and and we'll fill up our chiller bucket here with some ice and some water and we'll also put some dry ice in our cold trap around the bottom of our cold trap here in the first video I'm going to discuss the art of distillation as it relates to alchemy and to chemistry where it falls in where it falls into the alchemical process of transmutation the seven stages of alchemy we'll go over a simple distillation and how that differs from fractional distillation we'll talk about the concept of short path distillation where the where the the distillate just travels a very short distance and we'll also talk about vacuum distillation and how the how you can use much lower temperatures when you're using vacuum distillation and by using lower temperatures then you'll be degrading your your your distantly lesser you'll be degrading or material less less damage is done to the material so we'll get this completely sit up setup and then video number two we'll begin with loading our material into our flask and that'll take us through the entire process so the purpose of this video is to help aspiring chemists and alchemists to help familiarize themselves with these concepts and equipment and another purpose for this video will be to get some feedback from more experienced chemists and alchemists on how I can improve my distillation technique I've literally watched a hundred videos at least about short path distillation vacuum distillation and and I've noticed that in the comments that there's there's a lot of name-calling and ego tripping so I just wanted to remind everybody before you leave a comment let's remember to be kind to each other and keep your comments on the level so I'm going to go ahead and disassemble my still set up here and then we'll reassemble it together we'll go through all the names of the different pieces and how they work together and and that'll be the first video and then on the second video will actually run our material so thanks again for checking out my video and let's get started to begin our setup we'll start with our large round bottom flask so in this case we'll be using a 2-liter round bottom flask from steam roller extractions to to clean the glassware clean I like to use a 99% isopropyl alcohol and you can find this at your local hardware store I just pour a little bit in a clean spray bottle and I used my spray bottle to spray out each of the pieces as we go so we're gonna make sure that all the glassware is clean and we're also going to make sure that all the all the joints are properly lubricated with our high vacuum grease so we can just grab our round bottom flasks you want to be very careful with your glassware not to not to do anything dangerous and just start spraying some alcohol in here and the reason for the 99% alcohol is to it will dry 100% clear so man just spray a little bit of that in there and they'll clean this guy up and we'll set or we'll set our round bottom flask into our heating mantle next piece we'll add is going to be our distillation column or condenser and this guy will sit right in here like this it's important that you keep track of where of where your other input is you may wish to use a funnel as your material and depending on which material you run you may decide that you want to add your material first if it's a liquid you probably want to add the material first before you build your before you build your apparatus if it's if it's a oil or something more thick that you might be using a heat gun and a funnel then you probably don't need to probably don't need to put the liquid material in here first so to put our distillation head on here we're going to get some of this dowel Corning high vacuum grease and we're going to we're going to put a little bit of this on each of our joints this says good lubricating and sealing ability low volatility excellent resistance to water chemicals high and low temperatures so this is one of the best products that you can use for this and it's it's not cheap but it's a very high quality product you really don't need a whole lot so I just smear a little bit around like this you don't want you just wanted to do thee you just want to use the very top of the joint you don't need to we don't need to lubricate the whole joint just the top area and then as we place this joint in there we'll turn it a couple of times and watch it make a seal pull out my phone here and we'll take our distillation head as you put a little pressure and you turn it a couple of times you'll be able to see that sealed right there now you've created that seal the next thing we'll do is clip that piece together this is called a Keck clip and these are 24 or 40 connections this is a 24 40 tech clip so I take my cat clip and I'll put it right here and I want to make sure that I've got enough room for this guy over here so when it comes time to add the material I'm ready to go the next piece that we'll add will be what's called a receiving towel and this is our receiving cow here the three receiving flats are going to attach here and our vacuum line is going to attach here so again the same thing we're going to take the mail connection which is this guy here he's already got some it's already got some lubrication on him and again you can see that you can see that seal as you as you push and you turn you can see that that seal is become clear through there and you know that you have a good seal and then we'll take another one of our pet clips now we'll take some of our vacuum grease and we'll put a little bit on each of these Mayo connections for our cow and these are where our collection flask would attach we'll attach these connection class flasks with the with a ket click just like we did the distillation head there are different schools of thought about about the way that lubricant is used some people prefer to use a different name brand of lubricant than the dow corning I just stick with that because that's the best review that I've seen these don't need to sit on here in any specific direction just so long as they're long as they're round they're snug and you've created a good seal there will be three collection flats so when we're when we're doing our distillation we're going to have a head a body and the tail the head is going to be those molecules that evaporate at lower temperatures the body is going to be a light colored oil and the tail is going to be when the light color and the oil starts to starts to turn a darker color so now we've got this set up the next piece that we'll add will be this guy and this will help us just to keep this from keep this from falling over this is a flats colder here and that looks good there so here is our next piece that we're going to revert to add this piece is called a boss head and this is a retort clamp so we'll take this clamp we're going to clamp it on the right here and again you want to just be nice and slow and careful if it takes you a couple of times to set this up your first time don't feel bad or feel like you need to be in a rush of any kind it's the important thing is that you do a good job and be safe and don't do any damage to yourself or you to your equipment you don't want to read on this nice and tight [Music] [Music] and sometimes it takes a little practice to finagling each piece exactly where it needs to be in before we actually start our process we'll make sure that this cow has a nice free swing that it can swing back and forth you you'll begin with your first reception flask going to your body and then to your tail here so we want to we want to make sure that this this apparatus has the ability to swing back and forth and these are 250 milliliter collection flats here and when we're setting this up we want to make sure that want make sure that this column is straight up and down so the next piece that we can add will be our which arm the torque here and we've got another one of these deposits this guy and use it to use it to hold our cold trap so the next piece I'm going to connect this one to my cold trap here's my culture here this connection goes to my vacuum pump and this connection will go to our distillation apparatus so we're going to turn this guy like so and this will end up going here and this little metal dish is to hold our dry ice so we're going to we're going to take that little metal dish we're going to fill it up full of dry ice and this little stand just helps to keep it up keep it up where it needs to be at the correct height I'll just show you what this looks like so this is the inner part of our cold trap and basically the the vacuum will come out of our distillation set will come down this tube and any liquids that might go into your pump and damage your pump are going to are going to stick to the walls of this guy I'm going to stick to the walls of your cold trap as condensation and and you're going to be pulling cold fresh air from up here on top so the the colder that your pump runs the more efficient that your pump is going to run so again we'll take our we'll take our dow corning vacuum grease and we'll just put a little bit here and make sure that we've got a nice good seal on there it really doesn't have to be perfect and I just take the I just take the vacuum grease and just do about the top half of the male connection I I never put my back in grease on the female connection that you're looking for a big mess that way so I'll just gently lower this guy into here turn it back and forth a couple times and you can see that it gets this clear look to it we're all set there then we'll be able to then we'll be able to connect our vacuum line here I like to use a little bit of teflon tape on the connections not so much on the water connections that come in and out here the what the cold water is going to come in here and come out here but for the before our at the very top here we're going to put a thermometer and I'd like to use a little bit of teflon tape on those threads and right here this is a vacuum connection and I like to use a little bit of teflon tape the reason why is because we don't want any of our joints to be leaking we want to get as as strong of a pressure as we can from our vacuum pump so I wrap this connection here with my teflon tape when you're using the teflon tape you want to wrap it in the opposite direction that the threads ago now that I've got my teflon tape on here I want to very carefully take my vacuum line and we're going to tighten this guy up as tight as we can without cross threading it or without damaging that okay and once you get it tight you want to give it just a little eighth of a turn to see all that and here's my thermometer adapter and you can see that I've just I've wrapped the top of that with the teflon tape making sure that the tip on tape out of the hole there we're going to be using we're going to be using this with our thermometer probe so we'll start by screwing this cap on partway and we'll take our thermometer probe just gently push this in here and this this probe is going to go all the way down into our material and this is going to give us a digital readout of what our actual temperature is and this goes down in this here and this connects around the back we're going to want to use our Dow Corning vacuum brace again every time that we have these glass one glass we want to use the we want to use our vacuum grease if you don't use the vacuum grease what happens is that you run a risk of the the joints seizing together it's also a good idea to it's also a good idea to separate these joints at least you know crack them open a little bit while our apparatus is still hot so while we get done running our material we're going to we're going to loosen up these connections before we allow the whole apparatus to cool off so we've got our got a vacuum crease and we've got our kick clip and that will hold this out down where we want it we don't have a lot of material this round so I'm going to put this one almost to the bottom here there we go nice tight seal alright so we have one more piece to go and that will be our thermometer and our thermometer is going to go up top here so the same thing I'm just going to wrap these threads with a little bit of teflon tape and the next thing we'll do is get some get some cold water and some ice in our bucket here and lo will be almost ready to get started so I wrapped some teflon tape around this top connection here and now we're going to add our glass thermometer 12-inch thermometer and we'll just put this guy in here and we want to I'll show you when I get done screwing this on here real quick we want the we want the tip of our thermometer to be right here right where the right where the two pieces come together and we're going to be recording the temperature right there and that's and so that's the reason why we're using the long thermometer there we want it to be exactly where these two pieces of glass meet and I want to make sure it's nice and tough nice and snug on here so that we I can get a good backing see how this illustrates a little bit better what I'm saying and about having art and you want to make sure it sits where you can read it also as you put this in and out you want to do it from here and not from back here so that you don't accidentally break your thermometer so in my pot here I've got a pump this pump is going to pump the water into our cool water condenser it's going to come into this connection and out of this connection and that's just a that's just a used fish pump that I found at the at the local pet store super cheap I think maybe ten dollars then take our ice and pour it into here and put some water and it's important that you put the ice in the water before you plug in the pump if you plug in the pump dry it will die so you want to be careful with that there's about seven pounds of ice and if I need some more ice throughout the procedure I can add some more now I'll begin adding some water this is a two-liter Erlenmeyer flask and we don't need filtered water or anything like that just regular water will be great that the water is not actually touching our material the water is simply going to be to cool this area and I'll probably I'll probably add between four and six liters of water into my into my stainless steel bucket here so I've got my my top plugged in and I can see that it is it is this one that is pumping out I've got the one that's pumping out and this guy will connect here and you always want the water in to start down at the bottom like the water out to be up here at the top all the diagrams that you'll see that's the proper setup you don't need to refine these and it's okay if you get a little air bubbles because again all we're doing here is cooling we're going to our steam is going to our material is going to come up through the through the distillation apparatus as a steam and once it reaches the top this this cold chamber is going to cool it back into a liquid and that will be able to separate it into two different classes are different different molecules based on their on their temperatures at which they evaporate or boil I've raised my cold trap up off my dish here got a bag with some ice in it here and I'm going to I'm going to put the dry ice in here and then snuggle this guy down into the dry ice okay I've got my dry ice in my dish here I'm loosening up this cold trap over it down in there just right [Music] doesn't need to be tight just just enough to hold it in place and that will allow our that will allow any moisture to condensate within the within the cold trap and that will keep us from damaging our pump and you can see that the line coming off of the cold trap is going to go to our pump and so I'll show you where our pump is it's down here in our cupboard this is for a couple reasons the first reason is to kind of keep it quiet a little bit and the second reason is if God forbid were to explode it would not hurt me or my distillation set so we keep that in the cupboard with the door just a crack open and that's where our vacuum pump is I'm using a rocker vacuum pump a single-stage 250 before we actually run our material there's one more thing that we need to check and then I wanted to go over with you just some of the concepts and ideas I wanted to read from a couple of chemistry books that I have an explanation of the different types of distillation but before we can begin our distillation we need to make sure that our cattle here this is called our cow and these are our receiving flats we want to make sure that this apparatus is able to turn freely but it's not going to get caught up on anything that's something that we need to establish now instead of later when it's all under vacuum pressure so we're going to begin with this first to begin with this first ball here and we just want to make sure that it's got a free swing so that throughout our process here we thought we can swing this back and forth those need to be this guy up here nice and straight loosen this one bring this guy up and this will be our collection flask for our heads for the beginning of our material this will be our body and this will be our tables just like just like distilling alcohol there's a head of body and the tails or a head a mane and a tail so we should be all ready to go I'm next the next thing I'm going to do is put a funnel here and I'm going to start fumbling in my materials so first we'll go over a couple of these a couple of these scientific explanations the different types of distillation and when we're done going over that then we'll be ready to start running our material so before we move on to part two of our video I just wanted to go over real quick some of the some of the different terminology and some of the different concepts not only from a organic chemistry perspective but also from an alchemical perspective I just want to go over here distillation basics this is a really good really good explanation of distillation it says the vaporization of a liquid and condensation of the resulting vapor is the basis of distillation organic liquids containing small amounts of impurities or non-volatile substances are easily purified by simple distillation as our liquid mixtures were the difference in boiling points of the compounds is greater than 70 degrees Celsius fractional distillation is more useful for separating mixtures of liquids where the boiling point of the components differ by less than 70 degrees Celsius a typical simple distillation setup is shown in this figure here it consists of a flask containing a liquid to be distilled an adapter to hold the thermometer and to connect the flask to a water cooled condenser and a flask to hold the content the condensed liquid or the distillate here's our here's our receiving adapter and our receiving flask so that that goes over simple distillation and fractional distillation [Music] continue on with fractional distillation the apparatus for a fractional distillation is similar to that for a simple distillation except that an extension is added to the flask in order to increase the distance travel by the vapor and the surface area available for condensation the extension is named a fractioning column and may be open such as the columns used here we're loosely packed within inert substance such as glass beads the purpose of the packing if present is to further increase the surface area which the vapor contacts the length of the column and the type of packing our large factor in determining the degree of separation that could be achieved with the fractional distillation another factor in determining the degree of separation that can be achieved with a fractional distillation is the rate at which the distillation is carried out the best separations are achieved using a slow steady distillation rate a slow distillation rate maximizes the number of vaporizations and condensations in the fractioning column a really good website to check out or people interested in in doing doing vacuum distillation fractional distillation is best value VAX com they they sell distillation equipment so so here it talks about a vacuum pump when doing a distillation process it is imperative that you have a chemically resistant vacuum pump that connects that can achieve extreme depth the pump should be able to achieve at least 50 micron but the deeper the better the preferred type of pump for distillation is a rotary vane oil pump rotary vane pumps offer the best vacuum depth compared to other types of pumps specialty pumps such as diffusion pumps will be discussed later short path distillation can be very chemically abrasive to your vacuum pump for this reason is recommended that you change your oil before every distillation this will allow the best depth and keep your vacuum pump running at peak performance then it talks about a cold trap the cold trap plays the important role of catching any vapors that pass through the condenser this protects and prolongs the lifespan of your vacuum systems just like we talked about in our just when we were setting up we talked about how the cold trap will catch any vapors and and condense them to the side of the cold trap and this will protect your pump from overheating and the colder that your pump runs the more efficient that your pump is going to run so the short path system is made up of four major glass components and the heating mantle these components are the boiling flask the short path head the receiving cow and the receiving flask the heating mantle is similar to a heat bath on the road of APE this is how you will heat the mixture inside the boiling flask the head is the key to distillation inside the head there are small indentations called vigor row these contain contact points for the vapors to bump as they travel up in the head they create sia reticle plates needed for distillation where the vapors will become purified before entering the condenser path the head also encompasses the condenser where the vapors will be pulled to rican dents into that beautiful golden color we all want to see the three receiving flask correspond to the three main fractions so when we we talk about molecular separation molecular distillation for an example here I have some phyto cannabinoid boiling points and these are these are different these are different molecules that are found within within a cannabis crude oil so starting with THC you can see that the boiling point is a hundred and fifty seven degrees and then the next one is CBD from 160 to 180 degrees and as you get down the line these different molecules will all have a different boiling point or a different different distillation rate and so it that's how we're able to separate these separate these different molecules this is a great book that I picked up at Powell's bookstore Organic laboratory techniques and they're on chapter 7 talks about vacuum distillation the principle difference between a vacuum and an atmospheric distillation setup is that in a vacuum distillation the system must be airtight and able to hold a vacuum a vacuum adapter rather than a bent adapter must be used since this adapter has a standard taper joint connection for a round bottom flask and the tubing connection for a vacuum source the glassware must be able to withstand the vacuum for example large thin walled Erlenmeyer flasks cannot be used use vacuum grease to seal all glass to glass connections stopcock grease flows too easily under heat to hold a vacuum use only heavy walled vacuum tubing tighten all rubber tubing connections including the rubber thermometer adapter by wrapping a wire around the rubber and twisting it with pliers assembling the apparatus completely in test for air leaks by applying the vacuum before placing any liquid in the distillation flask so when we set up our when we set up our distillation apparatus one thing that we do before we add our material is we check for any air leaks vacuum fraction collectors if a vacuum adapter and round bottom flask are used the forerun cannot be separated from the main fraction without your stopping the distillation and disassembling the apparatus therefore if more than one fraction is to be collected a vacuum fraction collectors should be used two types of vacuum fraction collectors are shown in Figure 7.3 so here it shows what a cow looks like vacuum adapters and receivers that allow the collection of more than one fraction during the course of a distillation so in this case we don't have to turn off the whole the whole distillation in order to be able to just swing this cow to the next receiving flask and and this kind of goes on in a little more detail but but that's the basic gist of it and finally I wanted to talk about distillation from an alchemical perspective so this is a book by freighter Dennis William Howe FRC and here he talks about the distillation process from me from a Rosicrucian and from a chemical perspective distillation is the boiling and condensing of a solution to increase its concentration and purity the alchemists believed that distillation released the pure essence or spirit of a substance in the evaporating vapors for example one can obtain the pure alcohol spirit of wine by distilling a solution of fermented grapes the essence could be concentrating using a process known as rectification and here he gives a definition of rectification rectification is the process of refining or purifying a substance by repeated distillation the evaporated distillate is returned to the boiling vessel to be distilled again continued cycles of distillation eventually produce a thick and extremely concentrated solution the alchemist called the mother of the stone a typical distillation apparatus consists of a lower boiling vessel or the cucurbit and an upper steel head or the Alembic which is a hooded vessel that collects the rising vapors the hot vapors are cooled and a long condenser and the purified condensed liquid or the distillate is directed by a tube or funnel into a receiving vessel a popular medieval distillation device was nicknamed the Pelican it was a glass retort a type of container with two tubes connecting the neck of the vessel with the lower body distillation is the most important operation in practical alchemy and some alchemists spent months distilling the same solution over and over distillation is described in the Emerald Tablet in these words it rises from the earth to heaven and descends again to earth thereby containing within itself the powers of both the above and the below the alchemists chose the astrological earth sign of Virgo as the cipher to signify distillation the Egyptians associated the alchemical goddess Isis with this sign the cypher for the operation of sublimation was Libra an astrological air sign the Egyptians associated with the divine child as well as Maud the goddess of truth two-headed creatures are shown rising into the air on wings and then returning to the earth and drawings depicting the distillation process the repeated circulation between the spiritual forces above and the material forces below eventually led to a concentration and purification of the essences of the substance at hand and here we see this rebus and this is a this is an illustration like a like a woodcut illustration from an ancient alchemical texts and this basically speaks to the above and the below this this this alchemical concept from thee from the Emerald Tablet of Hermes where where Hermes talks about as above so below it is very important hermetic axiom so these are some of the different explanations and concepts associated with with our project for today and our next video we're going to get into the actual process of distillation I've got some crude oil material that we're going to be running and so please check back with me soon thanks again for checking out the video if you want to like share and subscribe that'd be really great and stay tuned we'll have part two we're gonna run our material and we'll do part three

THC the CBD what is CBD CBD has well and truly brought the cannabis plant into the mainstream it's touted as having loads of health benefits and can be found in all sorts boils creams wine teabags sweets you name it and it's been all over the headlines but for something so talked about there's a lot of uncertainty about how it actually sits within the law CBD is a major compound found in the cannabis plant it's thought to affect the receptors in our nervous system and have broad medicinal benefits potentially treating conditions like anxiety insomnia and chronic pain but it won't give you a euphoric high and it's legal pure CBD is legal unlike its counterpart THC which is the other major compound found in cannabis THC produces the psychoactive effects that get you high and it's not legal in the UK but it's difficult to separate CBD from THC fully as they can come from the same plant now it's important to make the distinction here between hemp and marijuana hemp is legal to grow in the UK with a very low percentage of THC marijuana on the other hand refers to cannabis which contains more than this legal limit the home office says it's legal to grow industrial hemp containing up to 0.2% THC with a license however this is commonly misunderstood as applying to CBD products technically the legal limit of THC in finished products is 0% and research into the industry has found that a lot of commercially available CBD products include traces of THC this strict limit isn't currently being enforced and is unclear how it would be in the future right now the booming CBD market is frankly a of a mess the existing regulations are complex and vague and there isn't a standardized way of testing CBD products or labeling them instead every CBD product out there is subject to different regulations depending on what type of product it is so let's take CBD oil as an example is probably the most popular CBD product and it's classified as a food supplement not a medicine even though that's what most people use it for this means the CBD oil you find on a shop shelf won't have gone through tests and clinical trials like a medicine would have and it can't make any health claims on the bottle plus dosage guidelines and prices vary massively and you have to rely on the manufacturer's assurances that the product contains what it claims to and then other CBD products say cosmetics or veyts are subject to different regulations so at the moment got a situation where we've got a product that is super popular everyone wants to buy it everyone wants to sell it but the problem is no one really knows much about it particularly legal status of it and whether or not it can be used as a food product whether or not can be used as a cosmetic product and if it can whether or not it can be allowed to have a certain quantity of the narcotic element in it in this country technically you shouldn't have any THC at all in the product itself if you want to travel with it then you're going to have to check with the country that you're going to whether or not they will allow CBD oil to be in your possession or for you to use it or even travel with it some places won't even let you take it on a plane and to check that I would say look on the website of the government of the country that you're traveling to and if it isn't clear which in a lot of situations it isn't clear just don't travel with it so currently whether your CBD oil shampoo or tea bag complies to UK regulations or contains what it claims to is far from straightforward but thankfully there is momentum behind initiatives for independent product testing and clearer regulations because the CBD boom looks pretty set to continue and until the benefits are proven in clinical trials and regulations have caught up treat CBD with caution it's an exciting area of research but there are still many unknowns about dosage drug interactions and the effectiveness of over-the-counter CBD [Music]", "T9tIe981YFA": "chance the jury will take a field trip to the Middle school to see where the alleged crime occurred. Knew it. Six tonight There is a new product on the market that's being touted as legal marijuana without a prescription. It's hitting store shelves all across the Bay Area. It's something you should be aware of. FOX 13's Josh Cascio reports. Experts have a warning tonight. Sign inside Chillin Glass Gallery in Ybor City reads loud and clear trying this stuff. Delta eight, THC will get you high, Unlike your standard marijuana. This stuff is being sold legally to buyers without a prescription. The difference. What we're talking about here is Dr 90 CBN cannabis of the 80 s being available in hemp. Right. It's available in hemp. It's legal, right still gets you stone, and it's made it legal under the same laws. It made CBD illegal. It's said to be 70 to 75% as potent as the real thing. The best way to think about that is for every two hits off of Delta nine. It takes three hits off adult to hate. So essentially all you all you need is to consume a little bit more in order to feel the same effect right now. The medical marijuana system We have to see a doctor every seven months. On you're fading like extreme prices for cannabis. Some of these patients can't do that. So it allows us to offer an alternative to that whole system, the DEA or Drug Enforcement Agency says it's currently in the process of reviewing the rules surrounding products like Delta eight THC, I'm not surprised because I warned everybody that. It really wasn't medicine for the very sick. It was the camel's nose under the tip, and we've not seen all that We're going to see, says Pull County Sheriff Grady Judd. It should be noted Delta eight will likely show up on a drug test. You could also get it, Do you? Why? If you're driving high on it, what we're seeing here today is not the end result. But the next step. And to find another way to Stone America. I'm worried about the health. Of your loved ones that's going to drive on the same highway with a person that takes enough of this low Delta eight to get stone. So it's not gonna be", "INVzvJHc2PA": "hello everybody and welcome back to the channel in today's video we are going to be making cbd oil with a crock pot but before we get into today's video folks if you wouldn't mind if you're new here to the channel please consider subscribing and for those of you that have already subscribed thank you so much i really do appreciate all the support and if you all wouldn't mind please give this video a big thumbs up okay folks so you may or may not know but our farm is solely dependent on our sale of hemp flour and that's what we're going to be using today our hemp flour now if you guys are interested in cbd hemp flour to make your own cbd oil go ahead and check out the link in the description below also go ahead and check out this link up top okay so first and foremost we're going to need cbd flour to make cbd oil you will find an array of options on our website if you're purchasing from us you'll see large flour or regular flour you'll see small flowers you'll see trim and some other odds and ends on there as well but today we're going to be using regular sized hemp flour the variety that we're going to be using is biox which is our most popular flower which is my personal favorite but there's also cherry wine on there i'll sweeten it a bunch of others that are all great as well it really depends on what you're looking for um but today we're going to be using biox and that's probably our most potent flower as well and that really depends on your potency level also and the same thing goes with trim versus small flowers there's a whole bunch of different potencies if you guys have questions go ahead and email me i'll be absolutely happy to answer any and all questions that you guys have about the hemp flour okay so we're going to need some stuff to make cbd oil with a crock pot unlike using an expensive machine like the magical butter machine you're going to need some other kitchen gadgets in order to make cbd oil correctly at home with a crock pot and so first and foremost we need a carrier oil now this is obviously you use this for a magical butter machine or any other machine we're going to use mct oil today other popular carrier oils are hemp oil and olive oil i really don't like olive oil that's just my personal preference i do love mctl it's the best carrier oil of all of them but if you're looking for a little added flavor hemp oil if you can find it is really good as well but today we're going to be using mct oil and the reason why coconut oil and other oils aren't in this is well coconut oil will be solid at room temperature so that's not good for cbd oil and other ones don't have the necessary fats to be a superior carrier oil and you really need that absorption rate to be high especially for a crock pot okay obviously next you will need a crock pot um these are relatively inexpensive you can get them for like 15 online you don't need a large one uh your batches are going to be anywhere between one to two cups of oil and one to two ounces of flour so really you don't need a large crock pot a three to six quart crock pot is plenty um another thing you will need is something to decarb with now we're going to use our magical butter d card box i love it there's no point in using a pyrex dish if i have this but you can use a pyrex dish with a cover that works as well and this will be one of the first steps we do here as we make our cbd oil the next thing you definitely need is going to be a filter of some sort some people use a cheese cloth um i don't i've never used that i've always used the magical butter filters you can get this pack on their website or you can get any type of micron filter i believe it has to be 150 or more um that's just what we use uh you can go more or less probably depending on the amount of plant material that's going to go through or how many times you actually want to sift through it this package also comes with a silicone glove i really like using that too especially when we're squeezing out the oil but that's going to be later on in the video now this part isn't necessary um to use i'm going to show you how to get around this but a lot of people will use this to cut up or grind up their flower a nutribullet or a magic bullet of anything like this to cut up the flower pre-decarb but i'm going to teach you a trick today on how you can avoid that it takes a little time but there's a trick now if you buy your hem flower from us it's going to come in a package exactly like this this is a pre-packaged um one ounce pre-packaged from us and what we'll do is we're gonna throw this in the freezer for four to six hours and what that does is it makes the hemp fiber very brittle and once it's brittle you can scrunch it all up in the bag and boom you don't have to use a grinder to cut up a flower we've already done that process and here we go here is our scrunched up flower and a ziploc now you don't have to use the bag if you if you're not purchasing from us use a ziploc same exact method in there for four to six hours scrunch it up and we're good to go so we've already done this step i'm not going to time lapse it or anything like that you will need to cut it up one way or another whether it's the bullet or it's through uh freezing it so let's dive into making cb duo with your crock pot here at home and get into the next step okay folks let's get into making cbd oil with our crock pot here we have already measured out a cup of mct oil so we're going to get that in the crock pot now to get it warmed up this process doesn't take very long but this is going to be the first thing you're going to want to do is measure out your oil and get it into the crock pot we're going to put it on low and we're just going to let it sit all right we're going to move this off to the side here for a minute next thing we're going to do is we are going to use our magic butter d card box again you can use a pyrex dish as long as it has a cover or any other baking dish as long as it has a cover now what you're going to be doing is you're going to be de-carving so get your oven preheated to 250 degrees 250 all right so we're going to preheat our oven right now again 250 uh preheat and then once we put this stuff in there it's going to be going in for 30 minutes now again you're either going to this step you're going to be blending your hemp flour which i just don't like making a mess so that's really just not what i want to do but this is an option you can do that get that you take your um your shredded up flour whether you use the magic bullet or you use the freezer method like we did and you're just going to pour it in to your d carb box whether that's the pyrex or this particular box you're gonna make sure that it's nice and even you're gonna cover it and we're gonna throw it into the oven for about a half an hour once it's preheated to 250 degrees so that's what we're going to flash forward to next and then we'll start getting into making the cbd oil okay folks so let me move this out of the way here real quick all right so we have done we are done with the d-carb process again 250 degrees for 30 minutes and there is your nice fresh ground uh cbd hem flower so now we're ready to go um but before we dive into putting it into crop i want to make sure that this isn't the end-all be-all recipe so we used one cup of mct oil for one ounce of hemp flour you can use two cups you can use less flour you can use more flour it really depends on what you want but i'm going to stand by one cup per one ounce if you want to go less you know you can use 14 grams of flour per cup i really don't recommend anything less than that because i don't think you'll get a good experience with cbd i just don't think the potency will be there for you the other thing about the crock pot too it's not nearly as efficient as the magic butter machine so this is going to be a process it is going to be in the crock pot for four to eight hours really depends on when you're ready the longer it has to be in there to cook into the oil the more chance of a higher absorption rate so just remember that as well and again guys you can find all this stuff on our website or feel free to leave a comment or email me and you can find us on facebook and instagram as well if you need to get in touch with me through there okay so let's go ahead and get this going into the crock pot now remember we put this on low already the oil is already nice and warm we have our ounce of ground flour here and we're going to go ahead and dump it right into the crock pot okay so now that that's done we're just gonna move around the flower and we're going to let it cook down [Music] and that's really all we're doing now we're going to let this cook down absorb all into the oil we're gonna cover it again you can use more oil or or i wouldn't use anything less than a cup of oil but you can use more oil like two cups we're just doing a very small batch for the video but as you can see it's already starting to go right into the oil so now we're going to check it about every hour on low so we'll see in another hour and then we're going to repeat that for probably six hours for this particular batch so that is how we get started making our cbd hemp oil in a crock pot okay folks we have let this go for about eight hours i lost kind of track of time and we've been stirring about every hour and this is what it looks like right now very liquidy you know all broken down and that's what you want to look like again you got to go for the longer cook with the crock pot i know with the magic butter machine it's four hours but you're really safe with an eight hour on low cook um of course the setting is low for the crock pot so now what we're going to do is we're going to get our strainer again this is something you're going to have to purchase in order to make cbd oil and then we're going to get some gloves and we're going to slowly pour this into the strainer all right so here we go again it's a balancing act with the strainer just got to take your time get this out of the way here you're just going to let it all go into the strainer there kind of write it up a little bit now again we only did a cup of oil very small batch and what you can do now is get all the plant material in there much as you want because what you're going to do now is once it's in the strainer you can squeeze every last bit of oil out of the flour because the flour does absorb some of the oil okay now one of the things that you get with the magical butter kit uh when it comes to buying these strainers is they give you the silicone glove it's pretty important because it helps you squeeze out all the [Applause] oil all right that's about all you can have with that and then you can put it in your container whatever you desire whether it's a droplet bottle a mason jar but this is the finished product this is your cbd oil and you made it with a crock pot so that's really it for today's video guys if you have any questions feel free to comment in the video uh or you can reach us um via facebook or instagram or email if you guys are interested in the hemp flower that we use today go ahead and check out our website link in the description below but that is all i have for you guys today i hope you enjoyed the video hope you all stay happy healthy and i'll see you in another video", "7KDXXoIL28Y": "[Music] what's going on guys my name is Jeff Austin is popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got something out in this video hope you guys are smoking with net let me know what videos you want to see in the future make sure you follow me on snapchat and Instagram and everywhere else to see everything I'm doing I'm only supposed to on snapchat whatever new stuff I get first so especially if you live in PA and you want to see like what new fire stuff is around I'm on it like a [ __ ] so follow me on snapchat pipe underscore porn I'm at popcorn pretty much everywhere else things are about half the car that's impressive pitting about a hit that took I've been cheeping on this all day too I'm gonna be going up to Colorado next week so I'm gonna see how the lab present cartridges are out there pronounced you got a bunch of videos lined up around them out there let me know if there's anything you want to see probably me doing mostly vlogs so keep posting I can't do it I've never really been the big trick guy I'm gonna get to look cool to do babe tricks and I feel like I don't really look cool enough that just feel like a little nerd out there blowing little starfish or whatever they do thank you so much for watching click like if you enjoyed make sure you subscribe my name is Jeff peace [Music]", "GDgj4zVNub0": "so we are going to be doing a uh cbd versus thc delta 9 versus thc delta 8 blind test we're gonna have my friends try out these drugs and see if they can tell the difference between them uh this is purely for entertainment uh so let's get right into it by the way if you don't know who i am i'm chris with cbd extract and if you haven't tried our hemp flour before do me a favor and hit the link down below and you can grab an eighth of our hemp flour completely for free it doesn't cost you anything all you got to do is click the link down below to claim the offer let's get right into it we're not going to tell you what's what okay oh we're going to we're going to tell you at the end but for now let me ask a couple questions okay uh how long have you been smoking like a year and a half year and a half okay about six years six years quite a while yeah that's quite a while how experienced would you say you are with weed but i am not good at knowing types quite a lot of experience so i'm a big dabber so like um i get a lot of different profiles like i tried to switch up my strains and stuff and switch up like in because of a hybrid so okay i like to get a lot of different like experiences so i'm pretty well versed and he's from the uk by the way wheat is not legal there at all so he has [ __ ] weed [ __ ] weed in [ __ ] england they don't even have cbd weed there if they do they have to label it as tea because they they don't even allow cbd weed there so this is the first cartridge uh you're going to have to guess if it's delta 8 delta 9 or cbd and also you know just feel what you think about it tastes like ginger um it's interesting like it tastes like a flounder tastes like actual planters i could do your own i feel nothing it just tastes very like not strong but you can tell the flavor no but that just tastes like the ground it tastes like the ground yeah what cannabinoid would you say this is um it tastes a little bit different from like most cards i almost want to guess that's delta nine i really don't know i don't know cbd i'll i'll say this is cbd for now but i might change my mind so okay i don't know i get like a certain like throw hit off of the actual thc and i felt like slightly different but i almost can kind of notice some effects i could just be liking a placebo so this is the next card [ __ ] tastes a lot more like what i would expect a cart to taste like oh there we go right off the bat i noticed it's super clear i'm just looking at it it looks pretty concentrated and i can i feel like i can almost kind of feel it off of that suit and by the way on these parts we're doing a curveball because not only are some some of them delta 8 or delta 9 or cbd we're also some of them are botanical terpenes and some are going to be cannabis derived terpenes so we're going to talk not super vibrant flavor like if there's any terps in this i would guess it's you know minimal what do you think about the taste this is um this is delta eight would you say it's an indica or sativa i'm never gonna tell you that all right yeah whatever i get in the currency but it's just for like the flavor differential not really the effects i never noticed anything different [ __ ] does it hit strong though like i smoked delta 8 before but this is kind of different this is like that tastes very strong in the back of my throat i can feel that [ __ ] just yeah it's definitely there um this is delta a that's delta a i think the last one might have been delta nine because starting to fill that a little bit i'm gonna guess delta h [ __ ] i don't like that one like nothing like i can't taste anything really just tastes like is there a throat hit to it nope no throwhead okay it's fruity yeah i don't know and it hits good like very smooth it just tastes like him like i'm chewing grass taste reminds me a lot of like actual distillate like um delta nine still i like this one it seems to look a little bit like it unless it's just like terps although it does look really thick i don't know it's good though i like that one so would you say cbd delta 8 or delta 9 on this one um i'm pretty stuck in between delta no no no this is delta a not cbd i don't know that was delta nine which one the one that i just did was delta nine the first one cbd because this is way weaker than the last one right i'm not tripping like this has to be delta a i don't know you tell me man i think there might be like some cd in there too you think there might be cbd yeah yeah i think like the last one is more like pure delta eight if i had to guess and then like this one there's like some other additives i don't know it could be completely wrong but i don't know how you know the difference between [Music] [Music] okay hmm is that one clogged too they're all i feel like all cars wow that one hits more it's in the bathroom oh that one is like peaceful this is like taking him right before getting to bed i don't know whether it's thc cbd abc this is like not the strongest thing it's not the strongest like the second weakest in terms of like first impressions right but this is like i could smoke this like a lot you know like i could wake up a lot of bed and take a hit you know i have to prepare myself for this i don't need a big breakfast [Music] this is very casual this is delta r that's delta all right uh yeah or delta yeah delta nine here okay i always get it mixed up then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah interesting i don't know i don't know what this is but it's not dealt to mine not about the man no okay so final verdict finally uh which one would you say was the strongest out of all strong ones one two three or four probably two two three two two no i lied three was this one yeah three okay interesting and so and out of the one two three four which one is cbd which one is delta eight which one's delta nine [Music] cbd was the one with the little white cartridge uh delta nine was the second one and the first one was whatever okay cool am i right nope you're completely wrong so out of the four which one do you think had like the best flavor to the worst flavor um i would say the first one had like the most diverse flavor like i could just like pick up like those things going on in it and i think that one would be the seemingly one the very first one i had um and then the second one there wasn't a whole lot of flavor but uh it seemed like there was a high concentration of thc in it whether it's delta eight or delta card and then uh the third one you gave me it was a lot like the first one but it just had like a little bit more flavor okay cool and then what about the and then the fourth one we just talked about that yeah yeah yeah that obviously tastes like almost any card up there interesting all right well hey that's you were actually spot on that everything was right oh okay then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah and then this the third the middle one was dr eight and then the last one was the first one yeah okay we got that right i did she got everything right yeah oh my god yes so there you have it hope you enjoyed the video if you

this is fresh hemp that's been dried it's probably 10% CBD you're gonna run add ethanol probably 33 gallons every hundred pounds and you're gonna run that through our screw press after the screw press you've got two things you've got the cake the spent biomass this is depleted of all the oils and everything else you can be left with the press liquor which has waxes in the bottom so there's that once you go through winterization you're gonna have your your pressed liquor here that's a bit cleaner then you need to reclaim to go through an ethanol reclamation process maybe rotovap or something and this is what you're gonna be left with raw crude this is raw CBD crude oil it's really thick you know this just doesn't move around this right here is probably 50% of that's going to be CBD distillate so you're looking at probably about two and a half kilos of distillate there so today's prices looking at about $23,000 sitting there so in a very fairly effective simplistic conventional and cost-effective process you can take your hemp to crude with the Vincent screw press you okay this is a darker one yeah you know we have them lighter you can see the color of that yeah yeah some viscous this is a 65% interesting here this one some of it so 65 percent by volume are CBDs yeah yeah so that's the oil so you can see so you can tell that it's it's fully d waxed because it's viscous yeah that's right it's beef with so this is the the quality you know the consistency which is really good and really high in terpenes this oil here okay you", "syymNA-Xgao": "Hey guys, Nick with Precision here and today we're trying out our all-new L-SEP, instantaneous winterization process. So\nwe're not only going to tell you a little bit about the process but we're\nalso going to walk you through it and show you around the lab a little bit and\nactually show you the experiment real time. So if you look over here, we've got\nour bead warmer. We've got some crude sitting here. It's about 60C, we do\nthat just to keep it liquid. It's about 200 grams of crude or so, and what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to winterize this in real time so you guys can\nactually see what's going on. So we've got our solvent that we've manipulated a\nlittle bit here under the fume hood and what I'm going to do is I'm just going\nto take this solvent and dump it right in I'm sorry going to take the crude and\ndump it right into the solvent in order to show you how quickly this process\nworks so ultimately this is going to have to get taken into solution a little\nbit meaning it's going to have to dissolve within that solvent and once\nthat happens we're going to slow down the stir bar and we're gonna watch the\nlipids almost instantaneously crystallize and separate from your crude oil. So this is normal crude oil out of a hydrocarbon extract similar to any\nother crude oil that you would see coming out of a hydrocarbon application. Let's go ahead and dump her in and we're gonna have a little bit of\ntransfer loss here in this round bottom but we're gonna get just get it as good\nas we can and then we'll leave it alone from there... alright good enough. Let's go ahead and\nturn this stir bar up a little bit just so we can get it moving. So what we can see here is the lipids are\nactually crystallizing similar to how you would winterize in ethanol and as\nyou cool the ethanol you see the lipids start to precipitate - that's what's\nalready happening here instantaneously. And you can see that in most\ncircumstances the lipids are actually heavier than the miscella. Miscella for those of you that don't know is the mixture of the crude oil\nwith the solvent but with the lipids being more dense and heavier they're\ngonna fall to the bottom, so you're starting to see already the separatory\nlayer. And what I'm going to do now - I'm just going to turn off this so it stops\nstirring and we're going to watch that separation. So I'm going to go ahead and lift this\nup just so you guys can maybe see a little bit better. So all of that crude\noil is now in solution and you can see these lipids just absolutely, totally\ncrystallized within this solution. You can see try to get some different angles\nhere for you guys pretty cool though, so now that's ready to be filtered. That's\nthat's an instantaneous crystallization of the lipids. This can then be poured\nthrough any sort of filtration system whether you're doing a small batch, like\nthis like we do in the lab just on lab scale and throw it through a Buechner, or\nyou have a larger filter press whatever the circumstance it very drastically\ncrystallizes the lipids within solution and it's ready to be filtered very, very\nquickly. So if you're using a room-temperature process like this you\ncan generally speed up what took normally with ethanol say 24 hours at\nthe lowest say for four to six hours this just took four to six minutes to do.\nSo massive efficiency increase and we're very proud of the process that we've\nhelped to perfect in the lab here, so we hope you enjoyed it today.", "43C5YlAV1QM": "Cannabidiol or CBD for short, is an oil derived from cannabis.

One of the main production challenges is dispersing the oil into aqueous systems such as beverages, as minimising the droplet size is the key to maximising the yield of the active ingredient. With a Silverson this can be achieved almost instantaneously. The same goes for other ingredients such as flavouring essences which can be difficult to disperse. For emulsions such as creams and lotions, the high shear action of a Silverson mixer finely disperses the droplets to give a stable emulsion with a typical droplet size of 2 - 5 microns. Finer emulsions down to 0.5 microns can also be achieved, depending on the formulation. By simply changing the workhead, the mixer can also be used to perform many other operations such as preparation of gels and sugar solutions, disintegrating solids and incorporating powdered ingredients such as stabilisers and other supplements. Another advantage of Silverson mixers is scaling up from the laboratory to full production is a straight forward process, as all our mixers are engineered to the same fine tolerances and exceptional quality we have been known for, for over 70 years. Whether you're looking to make beverages, gummies, snacks, baked goods or creams, shampoos, lotions or capsules, a Silverson mixer offers the most versatile and efficient solution to your mixing requirements.

Hi, I am Matt and welcome to another CuredByNature\nepisode - CBD Frequently Asked Questions. After such a long time of cannabis stigma,\nthe truth is finally out. Cannabis is very good for the human body. Most of the people know about THC - the cannabinoid\nIn the cannabis plant that gets you high, right? One other cannabis component has been massively\nresearched for the past 30+ years, because of its health benefits. And that\u2019s CBD or Cannabidiol. And since CBD does not get you high or in\nother words, it\u2019s not psychoactive the way THC is,.. and because US president Trump signed\nthe new Farm Bill in December 2018, you can buy CBD products almost anywhere these days. From local health shops to different online\nshops. And believe it or not, the majority of the\npeople prefer not to be stoned or high all the time. That makes CBD products ideal cannabis products. You get the benefits of cannabis but without\nthe high. Now back to the subject\u2026 Full Spectrum CBD vs CBD Isolate\nIf you\u2019ve done just a little bit of research you know there\u2019s basically 2 kinds of CBD\nproducts. Products made with Full Spectrum CBD\nand Products made with CBD isolate. First the Full Spectrum CBD\nIt\u2019s also called Full Spectrum CBD Extract,... or Whole-plant CBD extract or FECO that stands\nfor Full Extract Cannabis Oil. It includes all of the cannabinoids found\nin the cannabis plant and also includes all the other components that get extracted out\nof cannabis flowers in the process. These other components are terpenes, waxes,\nhealthy fatty acids and chlorophyll. And you know what,... there are other components\nin the cannabis plant that get extracted in the process that we are not even aware of. But that\u2019s a story for another time. So when we say \u201cfull-spectrum,\u201d we\u2019re\nreferring to a naturally extracted spectrum rather than a constructed spectrum. Now let\u2019s talk about the CBD isolate:\nCBD isolate is just CBD. It\u2019s just cannabidiol molecule isolated\nor separated from other cannabis compounds in the plant. Now to the big question:\nWhat to choose - Full Spectrum CBD or CBD Isolate There are studies that give scientific proof\nthat Full Spectrum CBD that also includes low amounts of THC plus other cannabinoids,\nterpenes, etc. produce what is known as an Entourage Effect. The synergistic relationship between all of\nthe cannabis components has been shown to increase the healing properties of each. But when it comes to CBD isolate,... even\nthough it\u2019s fairly unlikely that you would fail a drug test or experience a form of \u201chigh\u201d\nbecause of the low amounts of the THC in those Full Spectrum CBD products,... some people\nprefer to be on the safe side. So now you have the information you need to\ndecide... CBD Isolate vs Full Spectrum CBD My suggestion is always Full Spectrum CBD. Why? Well, when it comes to health I don\u2019t think\nwe should hold back. This is a natural medicine and it just doesn\u2019t make any sense not to get the full benefit out of it.

every year we're excited to be here we're working with different processing equipment for example our nutri filter dryers these are used for making CBD isolate and so you'll end up with a powder solution that comes out of here it's a great piece of equipment used not only in cannabis processing but throughout pharma and food industries worldwide MJ biz con has been a huge success for us it's keep kept us really busy and we always like to bring our new equipment out to the show and show off to our customers what we've been selling to industry traditionally and what we got in store for the next year I'd say we're at the forefront of distillation and process design we really are trying to come up with systems that are going to fit customer's needs a lot of the systems we build our custom design and we really want to work with customers to make sure that we're putting together a process it's going to make them successful hopefully they can make a good profit off of it and we can as well help them grow I think a couple things we're looking to solve is probably just working on especially with in CBD processing there's a lot of people who have are trying to figure out how do they properly remediates THC one of the other things that we have a background in is pharmaceutical processing and as it becomes tighter and tighter regulations especially throughout the world countries like Canada and in the European Union a lot of the GMP requirements are pretty high and so with our background and that we want to make sure that we're bringing that to the forefront and helping understand what customers need to make products that are safe and effective all right so this is one of our white film stills this is one of our larger units we have you know like this could process about 60 kilograms an hour of crude oil that's extracted we're going to be doing with these machines is separating the extract into three parts you're first pulling off the lighter components such as your terpenes then you just fill your cannabinoids away from your heavier materials such as floor fills waxes fats sugars 60 kilograms an hour is what this machine is rated for we make a couple bigger products than this we got one bigger lineman it's about two and a half times the capacity haven't seen much demand for it in this industry but I can't say that I don't expect it to come through if you visit our website you can go to poping comm that's gonna be our main website there's also Polk cannabis distillation comm that's going to be a little more focused on what we're doing within the cannabis [Music]", "2kxn1RBNNSI": "hey push and black open up late at night lately thinking why do I have THC and CBD well potion color it's kind of cool but our company believes in creating full spectrum highs so even though you have botanical term means you still have both THC and CBD to create a full spectrum effect that allows for not only the THC high but a more relaxed and calm body high as well Wow I like it when my body feels high me too potion me too you're pretty great potion", "T2NsFZDLVTo": "[Music] hi I'm Casey McGarvey and I'm from Delta separations and today primarily what I want to talk to you about is the popular and common forms of cannabis extracts so when designing a lab or designing your business it's crucial understand what your end goals and then products are primarily this is important because the different popular forms and extracts so or solvent studies ethanol co2 hydrocarbon water hash these are all have pros and cons to themselves but they produce widely different products better than each other so I'm going to go over a small list is of the most common and popular ones and this is by no way in no way an exhaustive list because there's an enormous amount of products it'll give you some idea the first one off the talked about is what used to be called alright soda and this is a very black thick sticky crude cannabis or ham extract now this for example as I said is a crude extract it's a whole spectrum extract so you want to solve it that's gonna grab a lot of different compounds and it's going to do so quickly at large scale for example and for that product in particular what we usually see are people using ethanol because it does grab your water soluble compounds as well as does is very high throughput it processes you automatically you know even one batch and for that matter I have a couple of examples of some of these products here this is CBD distance and this is CB isolate so THC and CBD distillate are very perhaps even the most common cannabis product out on the market right now and similarly because these are really high potent products meaning they have a high amount of the cannabinoids CBD or THC by weight the primary solvent you want for these is a solvent that is hight ruthless and again this comes back to that so are so crude extracts distillate isolate these are all examples of and the products that are most suitable for asthma and of course I will mention that the other extracts the extraction procedures like hydrocarbon co2 they conclude with these as well but again there's pros and cons to each one and ethanol overwhelmingly seems to be the winner in that apartment so about co2 and hydrocarbons really where co2 and hydrocarbon both shine are the extraction of terpenes so here I have an example of really light molecular wave chirping so what most people would term essential oils co2 100 carbons can extract these terpenes as well but also the more heavy molecular weight terpenes for hydrocarbon really the main benefit and its most common products are terpenes and what in the form of sauce and crystallized or isolated THC a and this comes in the form of diamonds and sometimes those sauce and the Diamonds we mixed together and hydrocarbon is overwhelmingly that best for those products primarily because it's good at extracting terpenes and because with using mixtures and blends of different hydrocarbons you can get different mixtures and blends of different fats and lipids and terpenes and cannabinoids that create all these different types of damnable products like butters and waxes and these type of things co2 that co2 is very good at it's very selective so basically what that means is it is very good at extracting a there certain specific compounds so what we most often see co2 use for is fake pen manufacturing and this is being a high quality vape pen manufacturing this is primarily because the co2 machines can use subcritical co2 to pull off a very nice band of terpenes and can produce and can use supercritical fluid to extract the cannabinoids as well so if you have a co2 system with a national system usually you're producing distillate and that those terpenes are extracted through co2 system then get added into that distillate and that was what is the big thing the big cartridge are manufactured with so again we talked about RSO which is kind of a crude ethanol extract we have distillate isolate and then we talked about the different mixtures of Turkey and cannabinoid extract those that involve full-spectrum pans and these type of things as well as butters and waxes that we see from hydrocarbons so in summary it's it's obviously very important to crucially understand if you would like to produce this or isolate or terpenes and for that matter what market you're looking to target because they each have different markets and depending on what market you're looking to target why and the product you're looking to produce that is really what's going to fundamentally determine what extraction", "kBK9fpyedaI": "Narrator: With all the\nweed trucks and imagery all over New York these days,\nyou might think to yourself, \"Hey, is marijuana legal now?\" Not quite. What these companies are selling is actually something called CBD. It's found in everything\nfrom lollipops to lattes. And business is booming. CBD products are part of\nwhat is estimated to be a roughly one billion dollar\nindustry in the United States. And it's perfectly legal. So, what does CBD have\nthat marijuana doesn't? Martin Lee: The fact of the matter is we're kind of in the midst\nof a CBD craze right now. Narrator: Martin Lee is the\ndirector of Project CBD, an educational platform that focuses on cannabis science and therapeutics. Lee: CBD stands for cannabidiol. That's a component of the cannabis plant that has significant\ntherapeutic properties, but it's not intoxicating. It doesn't get you high like THC. Narrator: As it happens, not all cannabis plants are created equal. Take a look at these two varieties. One is marijuana, the other is hemp. One gets you high, the other doesn't. The key difference is\nwhat's on the inside. Lee: THC and CBD are the main components of the cannabis plant. Narrator: THC is what makes you feel high, and marijuana plants are loaded with it. Dave Chappelle: I don't know about y'all, but I can't even move. Narrator: Hemp, on the other hand, has hardly any THC at all. But what it lacks in THC it makes up for with higher amounts of CBD. Now, CBD won't get you high, but it does have a redeeming\nquality: it's legal. And at least according to the marketing, it has a relaxing effect. So since this stuff is all the rage, let's see how it's made. So, once you have a cannabis\nplant, one simple way to make extract can be\ndone in your own kitchen. Lee: As simple as using\nolive oil or butter and heating the trim from the plant or a little bit of the green\nmaterial from the plant. Obviously that's not very useful for mass industrial production,\nto be cooking up something in your kitchen with butter and cannabis. Narrator: But the more common way involves a specialized, complex machine. Lee: One very widespread way is using what's called a\nsupercritical CO2 extraction. It's ground up to have the texture initially of like a coffee grind. And it's poured into vessels, literally, of a supercritical CO2 machine. It will stay in that machine\nfor upwards to 24 hours under different pressures and temperatures at different times of\nthe extraction process. And ultimately you'll end up with a thick, golden oil that's very waxy in texture. Narrator: You can also extract it using ethanol and hydrocarbons. You can find this oil in a number of different products these days. Lee: It can be administered\nin various different forms. It might be ingested, it\nmight be applied topically. Narrator: They even have CBD\noil products for your pets. I stopped by a cafe in New York which sells all sorts\nof CBD-infused products. I tried a CBD matcha\nlatte and a CBD macaroon. These snacks tasted great, and I felt a little more relaxed after, but it was hard to tell if the CBD was actually doing anything for me or if it was all in my head. Scientists are actually\nstill trying to figure out exactly how CBD affects the body. Lee: So, there really\nis a scientific basis for understanding why CBD can work, but we're still really a long\nway of mastering the hows. Narrator: Still, CBD\nmay have more benefits than just a relaxing afternoon. Some initial studies have\nshown that CBD can help with a number of different\nmedical conditions. In fact, in June 2018, the FDA\napproved the first CBD drug, Epidiolex, which is\nused to treat epilepsy. So, who knows? Perhaps we'll be seeing CBD in more places than just cannabis-decorated\nvans in the future.", "XffOpc6EdGY": "the first initial question you might have about CBD is what is it well like THC CBD is a cannabinoid it has a ton of health benefits but unlike THC it's non intoxicating which is why it's gained a ton of popularity lately and you might even see CBD in your local grocery store or in the gas station but be very very careful CBD and fake CBD has been flooding the market and you don't want to buy a product that's been made in an industrial setting so you really want to look for organic products or activating and making your own CBD product so if you take a look at the CBD flower you might be surprised at how much it looks like a THC dominant strain and in fact that's one thing that people aren't really aware of is that heme and CBD often look very interchangeable in plants it's really about the composition and how much THC and how much CBD is in a plant so this is a primarily CBD dominant strain so we can see and you can see in the testing results below that there's over 11% potential CBD after we activate this strain so right now it's almost exclusively in CBD a and just like THC a CBD a needs to be activated decarboxylated in order to be bioavailable so we would go and take the flower place it in the decarboxylate ER and when it comes out just like your THC flower you can sprinkle it put it in food infuse and for CBD CBD is a little bit different than THC when it comes down to the D carb process and it really is dependent on how much THC and how much CBD is in your particular strain so where you have a strain that is a mix CBD and THC so where it has more than one percent THC a or potential THC then you're gonna want to do just one run through the Nova and we have testing results on this CBD flower to show you what happens with one run through the Nova and you get really great D car not 100 phildee carb but really good solid d card if you do want to crank out that last bit of CBD from that CBD a you can go and take this flower run it two times to get the most CBD and so take a look at the testing results you'll see that we did a single d carb and then a double d card and you can take a look and see that both of them had excellent results but the double d carb did squeeze out and cranked out a little bit more CBD so after you deke are both CBD there are plenty of amazing things that you can do with it you can make lotions you can incorporate CBD into food anything that you can do with THC you can do with CBD as well THC and CBD do work better in tandem together so don't let anybody fool you and let you believe that CBD is a is a cure-all in and of itself in fact there is so much merit to the entourage effect and THC and CBD augmenting each other so please keep your mind open to augmenting with THC and understand that it may be a necessity for your condition in order to relieve the symptoms so what we did here is we took our coconut oil kit and our CBD and just like we always do he took one gram of d carbon material and we actually did use the double D carb material and we infuse that with one one ounce of oil so we took our double D carb material and mix that with one ounce of coconut oil infused it right in the decarboxylate ER and if you want to learn more about infusing with the Nova go and check out our infusion guide and our infusion videos and when this came out it had about a hundred milligrams per ounce and so that's over eighty percent infusion rate just from your CBD flour and only one gram so we will be back to tell you and show you more about CBD it's so important to see testing results to know what you're getting to know that you're putting the best in your body and giving the best to your friends and family", "1iuA5wDv3Jo": "hey everyone and welcome to hemp in a pan today we'll be showing you how to make a CVD teacher [Music] so what exactly is a tincture and how is it different from other CBD edibles well a tincture is a medicine made by dissolving a drug into alcohol in this case we're dissolving the CBD on the hemp buds into the alcohol because of this CBD tincture is sort of the same thing as a CBD infused alcohol although with a tincture we're trying to maximize the amount of CBD then each drop to be used in small doses as opposed to a seaweed infused aloe Hall where each serving is most likely more than a few drops and by using the drops under the tongue the arterial blood supply under your tongue will rapidly absorb the CBD allowing it to take effect much faster than with any edible so first things first we're going to be using a lot of medicinal hemp because we need a pack a lot of CBD into each drop so half an ounce to a full ounce of medicinal hemp is needed second we're more interested in extracting as much as CBD off the hemp buds as possible then we are the taste of the alcohol so we're using the highest percentage of alcohol we can find from a distilled beverage in my case I'm going with a 750 milliliter bottle of Bacardi 151 which has a seventy five point five percent alcohol content and for those thinking why not just use rubbing alcohol event don't do this we're still going to be consuming this and most rubbing alcohol are made with isopropyl alcohol which metabolites is different from consumable alcohol and is very harmful if ingested now we need to decarboxylate the hemp and to do so Wolford grind it up onto a baking sheet decarboxylate in the hem will convert the CBB a in the hemp to CBB and is done so by heating up the hemp buds so after grinding it all up to help it heat evenly we'll place this in the oven which has been preheated to 250 degrees and we'll let it bake for 30 minutes after it's done grounded buds will have a darker baked colour and you'll want let it sit a little to have it cool down before handling it after its cooled will place the decarboxylated hemp in a jar and then pour into alcohol from here if you have the time to spare you can just cover it up and place it somewhere dark for a couple of days to have the CBD infused with the alcohol slowly over time just be sure to give it a good shake once a day if you're going with this method if you're short on time though there's actually another method available they'll infuse the tincture much quicker and that's to give the glass jar a water bath he will expedite the infusion process down to just 20 minutes except instead of beating a jar in boiling water you'll need a lower the heat until the water is down to a low simmer this is because unlike water which has a boiling point of 212 degrees Fahrenheit alcohol has a lower boiling point of just 173 degrees Fahrenheit which means that the most we should heat up the teacher is a hundred and seventy degrees to prevent any of the alcohol from burning off as you can see from the thermometer this is what a low simmer of a hundred and seventy degrees looks like but even if you don't have a cooking thermometer and actually burn off a little alcohol since we're not drinking this for the alcohol content it shouldn't matter much just know that by doing so it'll make the teacher slightly more concentrated which will have a stronger effect you'll need a place something on the bottom of the pot so the jar doesn't have to write contact with the burner make sure the water in cases the alcohol but isn't so high that will accidentally pour into the jar and be sure to take the lid off the jar I also only recommend this if you have an electric burner I don't recommend using this method with a gas stove as it's too risky to play something with this high of an alcohol content near fire alternatively if you have a sous-vide cooker in your kitchen this is much better to use to ensure that the water stays at exactly 170 degrees with a sous-vide cooker all you have to do is clip it to a side of a pot fill it with water and then set the water temperature to 170 degrees before placing the jar in note that water is denser than alcohol so you need to play something on top of the jar to make sure that it doesn't flow I don't recommend using what I'm using but it's why I had nearby so I made it work either way you want to heat the tincture uncovered for 20 minutes after that we can take it out and just leave it out to cool until it's warm to the touch now for both the long method and the quick heating method the final step is to filter out all the plant material from the tincture and here you can either use a cheesecloth or a coffee filter just place out on a funnel and pour it all through making sure to squeeze out any alcohol left on the plant material so nothing goes to waste depending on how you plan on using the tincture you either want to put it in a dropper for easy consumption or in my case a jar to store for future use as a tincture is really useful for a number of recipes just be sure to store this in a dark place if available definitely use a tinted glass jar to further protect the tincture from light and that's it", "s-0pg9n7FsA": "my last question which is probably on many people's minds can you file a drug test for taking CBD it's a practical one that depends right so if you if you're extracting from a plant so in the plant even if you say him right that's not just see me Dean there's always a ratio twenty to one thirty to one naturally occurring in that plant so a hemp plant so hemp and marijuana are legal definitions cannabis is scientific right so we've put limits we said not more than 0.3% THC that's what qualifies a hemp plant if you remove the plant material if I remove ninety five percent of the material and I've got five percent cannabinoids left in some ratio that's no different than if I remove 70% of plant and I have 30 percent cannabinoids but you know it's higher THC but the ratio is still the same so you know I think some nuance around what that term means and if you're taking a whole plant extract and then as THC you will probably fail the drug test and if they isolate the CBD then you probably won't but that depends on what analytical standards are we talking dipstick or is their cross reactivity or whatever so I would say it's certainly feasible definitely with plant extracts full-spectrum broad-spectrum and less likely with Islip it's still possible and I think this is a really important point because especially now that hemp derived CBD is legal I think most folks don't realize that it can still contain up to 0.3 percent THC and that yes especially if you're dosing chronically absolutely that could lead to a positive drug test and we have data we actually you know did this and you know tested folks that are just taking hemp extract and they're popping positive left and right in pretty decent quantities because it's storing in your fat and again point three percent you're like that's so teeny no it's by volume right so actually 0.3% when you think about a milliliter of CBD or something like that and an extract it's up to what two point eight point seven to seven milligrams so ten will get you high so four milliliters will get you high there's forty four milliliters in a shot glass so if it's at point three percent you know that's that's what a teaspoon so a teaspoon at point three percent would get you eye", "O4kLNvDjIi4": "right and you can do 100 if of ways then you can know the best gets a top 10 and you're just going to have to throw a dart so this is Vincent corporation we're running a time test on the cp6 press with 8 to 1 ratio ethanol to hemp these guys here using art press as a quasi extractor so they're running the first pass through here as you can see they're getting a very heavy flow of ethanol really not too much plant material in there that's a point zero zero six slot which screams so that's actually zero zero six thousandths of an inch here's their material still pretty wet all right we're going to increase the pressure now it's running fine so I'm taking it up to 40 psi now squeeze on it right [Music] in fact it's working well so I'm going to go ahead and go up to a good 50 psi [Music] well this is the most flow I've ever seen but that's because there's only four people we know that are using the press in this manner a lot of people just give us your waste material where's your doing your first pass through here yes got it yep and so that heavy flow is good because those first buckets are probably some of the highest CBD content I think major you might want to run it by us first but outside of habits break it we're not gonna not gonna charge you for it we might not give you another one how's that cake is I'm a little bit dryer yeah it is I'm gonna actually turn this up I've turned it up to sixty how much press can we get out of it what kind of pressure you have coming in here 100 okay this is about 80 running 80 now okay you're not gonna break anything you shouldn't and you'll get more dewatering you know what I mean see if that makes a difference is the last bucket in yeah oh this is an 80 psi you want look at that that actually looks a lot drier [Music] let me go guys [Music] are you gonna wash this through a second time yes the plan yeah good did you get a lot more out and what I would do is we're at 80 started 80 maybe go up to 100 and and just yeah and then check just check temperature if the temperature feels you", "kd1rKFBDt4M": "if you visited a farm field in Minnesota before World War two you likely would have come across a crop that is not very common today hemp when the US government passed the marihuana Tax Act of 1937 hemp dominance took a significant downturn aimed at the commercial sales of cannabis products the Act also imposed an excessive tax on hemp sales which was a hindrance to many farmers during World War two hemp made a comeback when imports of hemp that were needed to produce parachutes marine rope and other military necessities became scarce the federal government even launched a Pro hemp campaign which included the distribution of four hundred thousand pounds of seed it also released the hemp for victory film to encourage farmers to grow as much hemp as possible for the war effort so hemp was grown pretty widely in the state of Minnesota especially around World War two surrounding the kind of war effort the federal government was really encouraging farmers to grow hemp and we had a lot of processing capability to make things like canvas and rope and things that were needed for the war after that the need for the products kind of went down but then also we were having conversations about drugs in America and that led to the passage of the 1970 Controlled Substances Act in which hemp was really linked with marijuana as a Schedule one narcotic so it could not be grown anymore in an agronomic setting nearly 50 years later hemp is once again starting to take root in the u.s. with the passing of the 2014 farm bill states like Minnesota are able to implement laws that allow its Department of Agriculture and universities to grow him for research or pilot programs under the 2018 farm bill states are allowed to set up a plan to regulate hemp to ensure that any crop grown doesn't exceed federal standards for THC so after the passage of the 2014 farm bill the Minnesota Legislature passed the industrial hemp Development Act in 2015 and that really gave the department of agriculture authority to run a pile program under the farm bill and so the department had hemp growers growing and that first year we had six growers growing 40 acres which was really an achievement since we hadn't had him growing since the 1950s in Minnesota but there were a lot of challenges getting the program up and running we had to get a DEA permit to even move hemp material into the state and so it was very much a learning experience that first year so out of the applications that we have right now we have about 12,000 acres and about half of those acres are registered to be growing for CBD about the other half is registered to be growing for grain and we only have about a hundred and twenty acres growing for fiber and so because that market isn't there we think that's the reason why a lot of people aren't growing for fiber if you're growing hemp in Minnesota you have to be registered with the state and so that is for the pilot program but also farmers license to grow hemp so in order to be licensed through the Department of Ag you have to go through a background check you have to get your fingerprints taken you have to pay any sort of fees that we request for the program and then you have to identify all of the locations that you plan to grow hemp on and that's because at the end of the growing season 30 days before harvest MDA comes out and tests that hemp to make sure that it's not over the point three percent threshold of THC levels and so those locations are really critical to us the farmers also are required to sign a memorandum of understanding with the state that outlines what the requirements are or the pilot program while Lee and Shanna Berry's vision for raising hemp and they're traditionally corn and soybean farm began about three years ago 2019 will mark their first growing season I guess the reason why we got in this year it been a thought for long enough and we finally had to act on it get our act together and get moving and just try it and make her make our mistakes and getting hopefully some successes along the way Lee had told me a couple years ago that they were interested in growing something indoor at the ranch if possible just not 100% sure what and then about a year ago it turned into an interest into the hemp and the CBD and use and so I started just in general researching and just what they needed from me was to learn how to grow it and and specifically the nutrition this field went in in June the 15th we were a couple weeks later than we our target date we had to do some transplanting and in places and and then we have been planting off and on for basically a month yep so we'll find out if the later plants do what they'll do and in the earlier plants but ideally we'd like to be in closer to the June first you hand plant them through the with a waterwheel planter it rolls across the top of the plastic pokes a hole and and we drop the plant in and then come back and hand packed the plants and recovered about six acres total we have we designated areas according to type just to see which soils are better pest pressure eight heads just how it if it works good with a cabana you know close to another crop and just kind of spread it out and and see what's working and what if there's better areas that we need to concentrate on just like in in corn and beans there's there's a million ways that a grower can grow a corn crop so you know 28 growers that I work with not one of them does the same as another one and so it's the same in the hemp industry is that some growers are going to grow solid seed males females they're going to harvest a seed bale the straw lean Shanna decided to go this route and that was that was the way that that they had had chose was to go this route more like how tobacco has grown and so the spacing for some research Lee had done was the spacing and then the equipment that went along with it and then from there on and feminized seed and from there on knowing that end-use of how they wanted to have that and oil content that's kind of everything just kind of is a domino effect from one choice to the next to the next we try to get it like a garden and when we form our bed everything just works so much better when when you get when you got you don't you're not dealing with any sod and in the moisture that it just doesn't flow through the machine like it should so we had to make some modifications and and stumble through it because we had a window to get to get our beds made so we could get in with the plants but if it's not right the plants don't go in good the drip tape doesn't want to lace where should there's you get in you get critters living underneath the plastic where you got voids so yeah it's it's it's got to be good it's just got to be a good garden type tillage the watering we're still figuring that out again it's it's a very trial and error basis and each site is different we found that lie clean Shan have been very intensively managing all the sites on the watering end of it they've we're finding that we know that the plants don't like wet feet but they definitely like water and the sites that are are set up this year are very well drained sites which work really well there's one that's probably a little bit heavier that tends to hold water a little bit longer but it's it's just kind of managing managing the plant's response and that's one of the things learning about this and connecting with people that are much more seasoned than than I am in this a consult on the west coast and that was one of the things I struggled with is there was no quantitative values of anything going into this watering nutrition and a lot of them just said well you kind of just get the feel of the plant you'll do something to it and you'll see how it responds and that's virtually what we've learned how it really is it's not not like a normal being in corn crap you make the watering applications the nutrition applications and you see how it responds and then you kind of dial it in from there on how much more or less you need to do so our logging in our and keeping track of everything that we're doing we do a few different ways just to have a couple checks and balances that something doesn't get missed but anything that's that started as seed starts everything gets labeled everything that I've cloned gets labeled and and then in our our girl room we have a calendar of what gets done each day just a just in general and then we have a shared file note file that gets shared back and forth between these in my phone that it's what what they're doing for applications what I'm doing for cloning or planting or applications or or seeing in the field those types of things all get documented in that note file and then I also have a shared photo album that gets shared also so any of my scouting that I do in general on the farm plus with these sites I have a shared album for each site so all the protocols that have been written for nutrition anytime that I'm scouting there's a picture of a bug or a date or a note everything is on those shared files so he always has access to each each site how much gets put down on certain runs and the calculations are already done and about a week there'll be a protocol started where there will be a another party coming in to take tests tissue tests and they will run it through their lab and then that will give us a weekly guideline to go by on the THC and then also visual once we get into the flowering stages and the resin is visible then we can start seeing whether it's virtually the color of the resin of when we need to start pulling the pin of of when it's going to start turning to hot for us to harvest and we want to for sure beyond the early side of that if you do go over that threshold the state does offer a retest you you pay to get your material retested if it comes back to say as the first test then you destroy your crop we all right ordered a harvester this spring then found out that the it'll dismissed our miss our harvest window it'll won't be here till like December and we will hand harvest the flower here in the field well we'll put it send everything through a bunker to strip all the leaves off the majority leaves in stem so that you leave them behind and then the bud will be transported down to the ranch and we will put it out on in dried out on racks bring the moisture down and then once it's at the proper level for storage then we can go ahead and bag it and store it and be ready for the extraction process tht numbers were really low this year I think 1.17 was our highest THC content so it was very very low we would had warmer weather I would have been dissipated those numbers being a little bit higher but well under the threshold it just varied so much from plant planning and when you you know your yield at the end was did you have enough water did you have enough heat did you have this did you have that talking to all the different growers we were all kind of in a very similar weather pattern and that really made the difference it is the this that yield at the end of the day input costs weren't some varied because of where you bought your starts or if you started them to yourselves or if you you know you if you're on organic ground and you didn't have to put a bunch of fertilizer in in labor did you have enough labor to do your own harvest did you have to hire labor to do your harvest and the harvest kind of falls on top of all the other harvests out there so that part kind of gets tricky as far as being able to staff appropriately for 2020 season we're gonna have one large site it will be a site that we use last year but double the size and the the site hasn't been amended and prep work already done and then we'll possibly have another smaller site is my plan just to have a small research site so that can control all the variables on a smaller scale and continue the feeding and tissue test regimen and and hopefully continue to learn on on multiple strains within a site as well as our large site it's just that we'll be more efficient with our time and travels although there is still much uncertainty in the hemp industry the strong market growth for hemp derived products like CBD make betting on hence future stability an attractive option for many farmers the buyer market has changed a little bit last year you were able to sell it in the crude form there was a lot of demand for a lot of people getting into the industry this year it seems like it has to be of the highest quality in order to to move it on you don't get you don't have mediocre oil and expect to move it so that process has kind of changed there's been some back-end refinement that needs to be done to improve the numbers as we wait for guidance from the federal government from the USDA on the farm bill we're gonna be able to have our program up and running by the next growing season so on the grower side of things I think we'll have our regulations figured out on kind of the food side of things and you know the marketing side of things those challenges will take a little bit more time I know FDA has started considering changing the rules that they have for food and drugs with CBD but you know those are long public processes that that take a lot of input and a lot of data that again we don't have because we haven't been researching this crop for a long time so I think the Department of egg will have our ducks in a row in terms of the program but there are all these other considerations that need to be made to make the industry really a success in Minnesota what excites me about going up is the industry's young that it's a it's a big enthusiastic group there's a lot of things that haven't been done it's a new crop to the area and it's a challenge I guess just be prepared whatever you can get done today do it today get your license get your get your background check then start working towards that the more you can put behind you the easier it is the ground you work in the ground getting things right makes it go a whole lot easier start small it can be overwhelming don't be afraid to to reach out to people but don't be afraid to do it your own way either because there really is no right or wrong way we don't know that there's a right or wrong way and we still don't know but there's as far as learning for the year you you know more like we say we know more today than we did yesterday and there's a lot less things that I can tell you that I didn't learn that I did learn in the last seven months hi I'm Dave moats thanks for watching if you like this video hit subscribe right here if you

now I got a lot of pain Ally a cannabis health and wellness consultant says she prefers CBD the non psychoactive part of the cannabis plant to over-the-counter painkillers I weighed a couple of minutes and literally it just kind of eases away but amidst the endorsements and hype what are you actually buying and where you can buy CBD creams online but to be honest it's confusing the dosages are all over the place so I head to the havahart dispensary in Oakland California where they can explain what's being offered plus whether it's intentional or just ironic this legal marijuana dispensary is directly across the street from the Oakland Police Department co-owner Josh chase shows me the products they sell we pretty much offer every single type of CBD that one could find in any form what's really interesting to me is how few claims these products make and that may be because the FDA forbids medical claims for products we're rigorous studies haven't been done was really up to the consumers to up to the patients to educate themselves and make sure that the products that they're purchasing are of safe quality or from a reputable source but keep in mind if you do shop in a

Jenn Ashton is here for more will do viewer questions today and the first one comes from Adria from New Jersey let's take a look hi dr. Ashton I've heard a lot of people using CBD oil for things like stress anxiety muscle soreness but I'm wondering how does it actually work could they be making it up Thanks great question that is a great question and right now it's really about what we know and what we don't know the bulk of the pain literature in peer-reviewed data comes out of Israel and Canada but everyone is researching this and I think it's based on this understanding George of this endocannabinoid system and if you look at the wall we have at least two receptors that are called cannabinoid receptors one heavily concentrated in the brain that's related to the perception of pain cb2 receptors located all over the body and the confusion here with respect to pain is that THC which is the psychoactive component of cannabis yes it fits into that cb1 receptor but khat CBD also fits in does not give you a psychoactive effect that is really important but it there is data that it can help you see a lot of the prices say no THC exactly okay we have another question coming in on Twitter this is from Susan she says I've seen 300 600 1200 and 2,000 milligrams how do I know what does to try and what do we know about the dosing here we see the different ones here yeah wild wild west George and here's the thing in in terms of official recommendations so far the only group that has guidelines out is the Arthritis Foundation their recommendation is to start with as few milligrams as possible under the tongue twice a day if you're not seeing an effect over days and weeks increase its slowly and if you're noticing any unwanted side effects obviously stop and talk to your provider the concept here is start low and go slow and it's a lot of trial and error it's not one side and this is not a beer question it's my question I guess is there any any concern about dependency there not as much dependency but you always have to take into account risks when you talk about pharmacology if you're getting a good effect you have to be on the lookout of any unwanted negative effects and right now those risks are low but as always talk to your provider if you are using any of these projects and thanks very much well hey there GMA fans Robin Roberts here thanks for checking out our YouTube channel lots of great stuff here so go on click the subscribe button right over right over here to get more of awesome videos and content from GMA every day anytime we thank you for watching and we'll see you in the morning on GMA", "zaFs3Cmx3Ds": "-You've probably started\nseeing CBD products popping up\nin a lot of places -- pharmacies, health-food stores,\nfarmers' markets. One place it's not\nsupposed to show up -- Amazon. But the e-commerce giant\nhas become an outlet for CBD supplements, despite Amazon's policy\nbarring those items. That's because\nthe vast retail site, where consumers search through\n500 million items on any given day, is too large for even the tech\ngiant to thoroughly police. Sellers use alternative terms, like \"hemp oil\"\nor \"hemp extract,\" to avoid Amazon's\ndetection algorithms that would likely sniff out\nthose listings and remove them. So, to see if third-party\nmerchants were violating Amazon's policy,\nwe decided to buy 13 products that had high likelihood\nof containing CBD and have them tested at EVIO\nLabs in Berkeley, California. We should note that Amazon\nfounder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns\nThe Washington Post. David Egerton is\nthe lab director at EVIO and tested each\nof the products to determine\nif they include CBD. Okay, so, let's look\nat the Select CBD products. Does this product\nhave CBD in it? -It does. There's close to 900 milligrams\nin the container. -And maybe another giveaway --\nit says \"CBD\" on the label. -It does, indeed. -If I were to go to a\nnatural-food store in Berkeley, and purchase a CBD product\nfrom them, would it have a similar profile? Would it have about 30%, milligrams to milliliter,\nof CBD in it? -It's very difficult to say\nthat for sure, because a lot of these products have a wide range\nof concentrations that we see. Even in what we see\nin front of us here, you know, we can see,\nthere's some products that claim to have\n5 milligrams per serving, others that claim to have 100. -Let's look at\nRestorative Botanicals. Does this have CBD in it?\n-It does, indeed. In comparison to\nthe other sample that we just looked at,\nthere was, say -- where there was only\nCBD detected, here we see\na variety of cannabinoids, including THC,\nat a very low level. But this variety of cannabinoids\nindicates that it was likely manufactured using what they referred to\nas a full-spectrum hemp oil. -Okay, let's go to\nthe Lazarus Naturals. Does this product\nhave CBD in it? -It absolutely does.\n-And again, dead giveaway, it says \"CBD tincture.\" So, now,\nlet's talk about this one. This is a tincture made\nby a company called Tranquilo. What was interesting to me\nabout this company is, its Twitter\nhandle is AmazonBestCBD. Is there any CBD in this one? -There was no CBD detected\nin this sample. [chuckles]\n-This also says on its label \"hemp oil, 500 milligrams.\" Is there 500 milligrams of anything in this\nthat you detected? -Uh, none of the cannabinoids\nthat we report. -Today we asked you\nto check 13 products. We have them all lined up here. Of these 13 products, how\nmany actually had CBD in them? -11 out of the 13 contained CBD. -And the two that didn't is\nthis one oil from Tranquilo -- -Mm-hmm.\n-And the other, the Hemp Gummies\nhere from Mix Rx. -Correct.\n-So, even though Amazon prohibits\nthe sale of CBD products on its website, we found 11 out\nof our 13 products purchased contained\nthe substance. After informing Amazon of\nour purchases and testing, the company removed some, but not all,\nof the product listings. Amazon said the company\nrequires merchants to follow selling guidelines and that it has teams\nthat use machine-learning tools to keep prohibited products\nout of its marketplace.

where everything we do starts with you hello I'm Jamie this is Mike welcome to fridge today we taste essence CBB food and drink products to see you know it's a trend worth taking seriously and do they actually taste really good so many of you have requested that we try some CBD food products so we've got our chefs Ben and James here we've got our normals Jamie and Baz to give a conflicting perhaps different side of the argument and we're going to see whether we think CBD and food have a place in synergy together in the world [Music] ok see what we're talking about today whoa smile so first off very very important that we make it clear that we are not researchers nor are we in the medical profession what we do like to do is eat first off what is CBD marijuana CBD is a compound found in the canvas plant it can be using several different ways including vaping teachers capsules and edibles it's what we're talking about today unlike its close relative THC which I'm not going to tell you the full name CBD is completely non psychoactive this allows us to benefit from the many health properties of the cannabis plant without the negative side effects of getting high this is one of the highest rated CBD oils that you can get in the UK it's made in the UK or the UK but before we begin anything pop three drops under your tongue hold it for 30 to 60 seconds and swallow Grassi very earthy mm-hmm it's got actually got a slight burn to it floral it's like the grass poppy it's got like a a spicy back note to a hoppy flavor it's not terrible it's just very safe very savoury this is how this is marketed it may reduce anxiety and depression improve sleep reduce seizures in people with epilepsy soothe pain and information and improve heart health board claims a lot of players have tried this before with the idea thing it's you've got quite useful for anxiety and so on but actually I couldn't get in the habit of using it regularly enjoy I actually asked one of my friends who I know uses it to give us a quick summary of why he uses it and he said I've been using CBD oil for the last six months to help me manage my anxiety and insomnia I often get anxious being in crowded places so I'll often have a few drops about half an hour before doing these activities it comes me down very quickly and slows my mind down I also use it if I wake up in the middle of the night and I can't switch my brain off I think it's good to use infrequently I try and only use it a couple of times a month that is interesting right to have such a cause-and-effect mmm is I I'm surprised that it's that direct John hasn't a guess in how much that bottle cost I'm going to throw thirty pounds okay I was gonna say like more like eight pounds 4495 oh well very clear when you tasted it earlier you didn't like the taste let's see if we can find a way to get the same benefits through something yummy dip the cloth [Music] these are CBB Zen bears CBD gummies with the guaranteed 5 milligrams of CBD per pair each pot contains 100 pairs giving you a total 500 milligrams of CBD it's all about natural delicious fruit flavors with no sugar or sweeteners so the highest searched CBD term on Google difficult to find recommended dosages online the guys who provided the oil recommended we go on body weight so for people your body weight you're looking to consume around 18 milligrams both a THC free you will not get high you will not suffer those side effects they do both contain CBD now I'm gonna try a little let the red one a yellow one mine tastes like a gummy bear it's a lemony it does not taste like CBD does not quite CBD yeah right now how not per mange really I really expected that to taste like fruit but that tastes a lot like the CBD oil sweet gummy fruity it certainly hasn't got any of that flavor that we were having from the oil it's a much less experience than having the CBD straight but it doesn't like their nostrils [Music] CBD gummies treat yourself to an extremely chilled out Valentine's Day eight gummies in each pack eight sweet kisses of calm each gummy heart contains two milligrams of CDD scent match to the fragrant Tahoe og cannabis strain that must mean something to someone somewhere they don't taste amazing but again like I probably would never attribute that term CBD their hearts are much sweeter mmm but still not I mean love hearts are the first to go - can any picker mix oh no no way totally with you then Oh Percy pig oh absolutely not no no Harry by Friday oh wow I didn't expect that oh I mean that looks more like is aimed at kids now edible cannabis weird it's giving off the whole subculture of being high and stoned and applying that to the branding of a product that does none of that hmm they are playing to that market and misleading I should imagine this is a good thing looks a bit more more a bit more medical how much do you think the gummy love hearts are eight gummy hearts they can't be more than copy a quid by the four pounds because you're bonkers yeah five or six quid love heart gummies are $8.99 for that packet hmm okay and the CBD Zen bears there are a hundred in that thirty-five forty quid I reckon there's fifty quest probably forty quid hmmm oh yeah tenner 39 pounds 95 pence is 500 milligrams of CBD it's exact same as the oil the good thing about them is that they're it's a lot easier to apply a dosage well I don't know how much oil I had but I thought I had a drop he watched me pour half a dropper down my throat amazing how much packaging changes your mind because if those who come in that then I'd be I'd be all over there maybe like this is no good but because of that plus the price you see my quite a good idea ready for another yeah Oh stressed you not with these little delights luxury chocolates with a whopping 5 milligrams of CBD each four chocolates in each box perfect for sharing 100% legal for a guiltless experience they cannot get you high only chill you out if you say after eight months as in though yeah it's in like an eighth of an ounce Oh see this is a ha ha ha yeah I like that I'm already pre-empting that the price is on par with luxury chocolates we'll see about the quality please copy our bad mm-hmm making a gooey middle oh I was expecting like a truffle it's not unpleasant if I had that ended up in Canada I wouldn't be offenders because it tastes like I drank heaven for chocolate you know the little chocolate footballs or chocolate coins you got a Christmas in netting it tastes like cardboard chocolate lime in yeah I'm disappointed by that there's no minutes not right it's the myth right Trey you pay chocolate with a cream in his hand again they've gone down the cannabis room it actually plays off that negative stigma doesn't it yeah and I like I don't find that cool personally if the benefits of CBD work for me I'll actually be personally embarrassed to get out of product like that yeah to pay off drug culture yeah dare I ask the price would you want to take a guess or 20 quid 20 quid oh yeah I'm in 16 full pound a 16-9 pounds ninety-nine oh wow you can still keep them we're getting a bit sillier now have a lift what oh my goodness okay what Christmas pudding this is a CBD Christmas the most festive way to get a hit of the glorious green to delicious only to sell at Christmas time handmade pudding infused with CBD and cannabis terpenes don't worry it's 100% legal and cannot get too high it might make you feel chills out low do you have any brandy I'm not providing anything I'm not even bothering you no because come on like who's eating this well apparently we are yeah [Music] but I do like a good Christmas pudding I'm not sure that's a good Christmas pudding no it's the kind of thing that someone would have got old little Johnny's a STONER why don't we get him listeners without heating up Oh garnish it with Holly flambe and 70 brandy butter it just tastes like fruit it's like guys that it's a pretty good as just as bad as any other fruitcake I think I've still six tip of the air the oil yeah I'm still sticking with the oil happy holidays yeah there are studies showing that CBD loses its potency once heated to above 200 degrees Fahrenheit this is not by any means a bad fruitcake I just I'm not sure I see the point I'm not sure this would be the vehicle in which if I wanted CBD I would take it it is an odd thing but its novelty again isn't it how much how much for the PUD ten pounds twelve Robin I want to say ten pounds fiver three pounds ninety-nine yes hmm I'm quite young surprised at how cheap they is well the recommended retail price is $9.99 it's because it's not Christmas boy slightly different this one right there so that whoa look at the color of that this is cannabis sativa Jim cannabis sativa is herbaceous flowering plant from Asia it's been cultivated throughout recorded history of the source of industrial fiber seed oil food recreation religious and spiritual moods and medicine each part of the plant is harvested differently depending on the purpose of its use this has been infused with cannabis sativa to have a taste see what you think not my favorite did but it tastes like gin alright it's not home okay crafted in Amsterdam for massive cannabis plant on the front of it so this is completely different in the there are no CBD benefits this is the other way round this is marketing purely cannabis as a selling point fine fine I mean it's a perfectly suitable botanical I wonder what they put in it that gives it that green tinge food coloring probably it's 40% it's a property it's a proper gin it tastes nice and it's a nice tasting too you know yeah I think yeah you have to work our ways that you can market yourself out there and by adding the botanicals of cannabis I think it does it so I can see how on the shelf in Amsterdam this would stand out would you put it on your alcohol shop I would yeah I'm good it's interesting that's a talking point that's it people would ask questions about it Oh does it and you go no yeah Oh could I get no you can't other than the whopping great big leaf and the association that cropped up recently there's nothing novel about hemp it's been around forever in rope-making and clothes making and paper making and all sorts there's nothing new about it it's just the craze now they're latching on to this doesn't offend me as long as doesn't cost a fortune how much do you think it costs for the bottom 25 hours bang in the middle 30 pounds $29.99 just what you pay for a nice bottle of gin so in summary CBD food the crossover what your thoughts CBD is not necessary and food and food is not necessary see we do see videos of supplement boom and you can choose to have as an oil or I think it's quite a good idea to put in something like gummies so you can regulate it a lot and it's more enjoyable I can definitely see it having a place I don't necessarily think that we're there yet like so many people feel they have to play off the legality of cannabis and it's naughty and you shouldn't be having it but it's okay because we put in a Christmas pudding for you I think the market needs more education about the benefits of CBD and then that can be celebrated and there's actually a CBD brownie recipe in our brand new cookbook to the beat yeah we fuse music and food we've got loads of playlist loads of recipes it looks amazing if you'd like to get a hold of it I'll click the link in the description can I do that can I do it please do accidentally broke my favorite bottle of whiskey last night it's

super excited about today's review we have an amazing product over hope is gonna be amazing from the vendor we've seen on the channel before my CBD Haven my CBD Haven has my opinion probably the best CBG and CBD concentrates you could get currently well they just change the game and they release read what that says delta 8 THC distillate syringes you might be wondering what is delta 8 THC well the THC that is illegal is Delta 9 THC there are other forms of THC in cannabis THC a THC v delta 8 THC Delta 9 THC is obviously the most psychotropic the most strongest the most noticeable it's the thing that really gets you high and that's why that's what is illegal in most places Delta 8 THC is not illegal it's legal so just proving your started in case you're wondering right now man this is too good to be true yes you can order it in all 50 states it's not illegal it's not Delta 9 THC this is Delta 8 THC which is not illegal does Delta 8 THC still get you high to put it bluntly yes is it as strong no he says racy rushy no no no from just from what I've heard in my research everything I know Delta 8 THC is kind of like a watered down version of regular juice definitely stronger than CBD stronger than CVG but not as strong as THC or I should say noticeable or psychoactive and with that means that it doesn't cause as much anxiety we got Delta 8 syringe we also have CBD syringe and a little vial of the same stuff in each here goes the delta 8 and this is the CBD with my CBD Haven logo we also have test results all right so we're gonna start off with the CBD distillate and that CBD comes in at four hundred point two seven milligrams all the COA the test results with a small amount of CPG CBN and CBC so that is a nice combination a nice smorgasbord of cannabinoids right there so let's see here goes it's a syringe and while I'm opening this the awesome thing about these syringes is you can use this oil to dab with you can dab it like wax you can make edibles with it a lot of people just simply enjoy putting it on top of flour rolling a blunt or smoking bowls of it and it does come with this little skinny applicator so so I'll give you up close that's what it looks like you unscrew the end of it out like that and then you put this in you screw it in and then then it's ready for whatever today I'm gonna be dabbing it so that we just get the pure effects of that I don't want to you know I would recommend personally putting this on top of flour to kind of you know intensify the experience but it since I'm reviewing it I want to tell you exactly how this feels [Music] [Applause] we're gonna squeeze this right into the banger Wow there's no flavor in that no harshness I mean it's my pure CBD distillate so I wouldn't expect any kind of harshness or flavor this is really really interesting now even though hitting concentrates like this usually does take effect immediately let me kick back for a few minutes and just let it fully sinking and I'll come back and let you know how I feel a few minutes later all right I'm back that was interesting it's just so interesting to feel CBD without any other little bit of THC or anything CBD by itself is very like it's not like psychoactive psychotropic it is very in the body and behind the scenes so I don't really feel any different right now maybe a little bit more relaxed but this type of thing is intense concentration of CBD this is really recommended for people that really need it for like medical reason so if you have some kind of ailment you know I don't know I'm not gonna go through the list but if you need a high dose of CBD and you need it quick this is perfect you know those little syringes are you know it's so convenient you can carry them everywhere like I said you could just roll these on top of a joint stick these on top oh really quick just a tiny little dollop distillate I have absolutely nothing to compare this to because I'd obviously never tried anything like this before but I'm gonna give it the sebastio approval I think if you really benefit from seeking you by itself this is a really good option to get a very high concentrated dose of it all right now to the main attraction the real reason you're here this is the Delta 8 THC cartridge 66.3% Delta 8 THC 0.62% CDN so 66.3% Delta 80 X and I'll just think about a few Mets with something at 66 percent Delta 9kc you're gonna be gone like you're gonna be in space packaging everything is the exact same deal appearances exactly same little syringe the little adapter piece to get it you know in a small amount you know same same deal we twist this piece off right here and then we twist this in and you do have to kind of handle it for a little while because at room temperature this kind of settles and hardens so you got to get it just a little bit of warmer than room temperature so that it starts to know so that you can you can get it moving down the row syringe so we're gonna handle this for a minute and I'll just talk while I do this I am THC sensitive like I told you before I love cannabis but I cannot handle the high concentrations of Delta 9 THC it just makes the experience unenjoyable for me like I know it does for many others in the hips and CBD community Delta 8 THC might be the perfect answer if you thought CBD was a perfect answer well this might be a way to enjoy th see without the negatives that come with it for some people [Applause] all right here goes to Delta Wow once again no taste no throat burn I come coffee is just irritated from inhaling something but absolutely no harshness nothing it's interesting I'm getting the most craziest sensation just like a wave going down my body and throughout my limbs Wow I know wow it's hitting me it's hitting me fast and it's hitting your heart and I want to break away for a few minutes but I almost kind of want to share this experience with you you've ever hit if you've ever taken a hit some really strong TMC flower concentrate and you know that feeling you can feel it come creeping on handy just you know and you could that's what this is doing right now it's just creeping along heavy and that's it's getting me this this is amazing there's like seriously right we thought CBDs would like the answer to our prayers I mean there are many people in McD's amazing CBD will forever be you know the standout aside from THC but there's Delta 88 see this this doesn't this feel like th it just doesn't feel like City this feels like so like strong hopes to make city but I'm not feeling literally any anxiety in Russian I don't feel my heart beating faster I'm not worried about nothing about what we're thinking anything I feel like I'm baked but my head is clear like I'm able to control my thoughts and food I just feel like yeah I feel like I'm Paris Thomas [Music] Wow Wow this is amazing this is amazing yeah I just I love I love how clear-headed I am I love how control I am of my own thoughts and everything my own feelings I'm not letting anything get the best of me this isn't invoking those kind of feelings and I think that's amazing well here it is it but it ain't here I think this is the answer to a lot of people's prayers a lot of people who want to enjoy cannabis and maybe CBD flour just doesn't do it for you a regular THC but it's too strong here you go right here you could thank me later I'm really glad I'm doing this review because not only am i reviewing the product yourself but I'm putting out some awareness about what Delta a THC is and what it does and that's awesome because I think it needs to be more focused on for sure I think that this is probably the best thing in cannabis and I think if you mix Delta eight with CBD you have the honest-to-god perfect combination Wow this is Bob this is Bob I'm sorry I can't shut up but this is absolutely bomb I have to stop myself someone just let me say this is one of the best things I have experienced in the hemp world since I first started using hemp flour and reviewing hemp flour this is I mean this is this is amazing more focus needs to be put on those Delta 8 THC and obviously this is concentrate so you know 66% Delta 8 THC so you know it's not this isn't light weight one tiny drop does it take my word for it I put just a tiny tiny squeak like the size of the drop of water and that's it that's all you need pretty sure this feeling is gonna last for at least a good 45 minutes to an hour I don't think I need to say do I need to say this gets the Shabazz silver pool now I believe there's other Delta 8 products out there they're few and far between my CBD Haven is a stand-up company I I could vouch for them this right here this right here this is dope definition soo cool I love this product I love what's in this product I really like look at this this looks official this looks official like you could whip this out people in like am like what you doing me like look at this do it over here this is spicy spicy pan I'm enjoying myself a little bit too much this is this is what you want just let me just clip on me a lot of you that's watching you want legal THC there you go if you're still

"converting CBD to THC we're developing procedures SOPs around that and then trying to build equipment to do that something people commonly do now so this is it's not commonly and people do do it and it can be done so you can take CBD and convert it to THC yeah and I think that's a big future of where the dose that's so lightly like a like maybe four people currently are doing anything that it's on such a small scale and it doesn't actually work correctly so you'll get like half isomers from half your oil will be like that converted oil some of it will be some a Frankenstein a lot of it doesn't see molecules a lot of its delta x and some delta eight so doing it correctly to where you get a conversion from second easiest ELCA 90hz is like is a consistent conversion to at a very specific yield meaning like the amount of material that gets converted is like changing and so many different like it's the industry shaking revolutionized everything so you think about those like tens of hundreds of thousands of acres in Colombia and Chile that grow him and imagine the implications that it makes for when when places actually start legalizing THC like it takes how many how long do grow a plant and then get to currently it's something that isn't really relevant because you can't grow a hemp farm and then process and then convert it to THC and sell it to the teat the dispensary my future wait not the future right now the USDA just opined on that anything any compound because of the farm bill derive from a hemp plant is a legal compound and because of the language in the in the farm bill there needs no other congressional approval like THC from hemp and CBD from hemp are perfectly legal compounds for legal language which says you're right your language anything that comes from this yeah I knew that we could convert it in this yes yeah there were they're elitist no so that looks like and I think if like the Senate Majority Leader like Connell who's been pushing him for a long time that is the backdoor to legalization that's why cannabis probably isn't legal on a federal level he's a crafty old geezer he's like the guy in every single scooby-doo show you know and he's like oh well you got me this time yeah exactly you dimed kids so if I understand correctly you guys see a future where the massive massive amounts of hemp feels being grown can be converted to THC which could end up in my vape cartridge yeah and and actually people are now starting to grow hemp for terpene profiles if you if people are worried about flavors and and cannabinoid profiles well flavor profiles can all be done through breeding well you can you eventually isolate those and then you can isolate the terpenes and then from there you grow different cultivars for different cannabinoids and then we start to isolate these cannabinoids and then we can form them into a concentrate that is tailored with the right concentration for cannabinoids with a flavor profile that that's all natural actually doesn't mean anything all-natural yeah it really means really no there's really no definition to all-natural you can it's it's a market ideally I say anything what cannabis and left boy you first said all-natural so what's your definite well I was I mean I was just saying all-natural as like it was a really stupid thing for me to say I didn't mean all that I met I met cannabis derived or have derived so yeah it's a terpenes coming from the plans", "BhAAhz6ozOE": "[Music] wiped thin-film distillation sometimes called molecular distillation is the separation process where fluids with different boiling point temperatures can be separated with great efficiency and high purity in the cannabis world thin film distillation is commonly used to purify cannabinoids after the oils have been extracted from the plant material extracted cannabis oil is very dark brown in color sticky and very thick at room temperature it is sometimes referred to as crude oil or full-spectrum oil and is a feed material for our distillation process because crude oil is very viscous at room temperature it is first warm to a liquid state in the feed tank this oil is then pumped up through the feed tube into the main evaporation chamber the three main elements of the chamber are the evaporator surface the wiper and the condenser the process takes place in a vacuum which is monitored by the vacuum gauge the vacuum is created by using two pumps a mechanical roughing pump and a diffusion pump reducing the pressure reduces the boiling temperatures of the liquid which in conjunction with the wiped film creates greater efficiencies in purity following distillation the oil is divided into two fractions known as the residue and the distillate phases the distillate phase contains valuable cannabinoids rich in THC or CBD while the residue phase contains impurities and other undesirable high-molecular-weight byproducts the wiper rotates at several hundred rpms by the motor on the top of the unit and creates a thin film on the surface of the evaporator similar to the wiper blades on an automobile the evaporation of the crude oil makes the distillation process more effective and facilitates the transformation of liquid oil into a gas phase in this view we see the crude oil mixture entering the sidewall of the evaporator in this illustration the mixtures are composed of distillate and residue shown hypothetically as the letter D and are under very controlled temperature conditions the desirable distillate portion is heated to its boiling point which in turn vaporizes to four mccaf\u00e9 per the vapor phase molecules then returns to a liquid phase on the condenser which is at a lower temperature finally the distillate drips down the coils of the condenser and is pumped into the receiving vessel the residue flows down the side wall at the evaporator and is collected into another container the distance between the evaporator surface and the condenser is sometimes referred to as a short path which helps ensure product quality since the distillate is only in a vapour phase for a short period of time which reduces the chance of breakdown or oxidation in summary high purity cannabinoids are distilled from raw cannabis oil extract by selectively evaporating and recovering distillate phase using wiped thin film distillation the distillate fraction is often a brightly colored yellow solution that will also become solid at room temperature cannabis distillates are odor free high in purity and ideal for edibles and other medicinal products [Music]", "HezPikWxOKw": "what's up pop peace it's your girl pop mom 420 and we are back for another weed Wednesday welcome and as you can see guys I heard your request

that swing left the time going and I believe I'm only using one tablespoon which is 15 MLS remember you use soy lecithin you can use a sunflower less of ten any less the ten is fine you use it because you want to keep the chemicals bond together you do not want them to break down so it keeps it together and then we're going to go ahead we have our coconut oil we have soy lecithin and we have our bud so we're gonna go ahead and put the head of that magical butter machine on then you can go ahead and plug that up alright you hear the beat pop beeps we're gonna go and take that temperature to

research facility CEO Albert Gutierrez walked us through how CBD is extracted from a cannabis plant to oil first it goes to a co2 extractor and is further separated with ethanol we're gonna separate the waxes and fats and we don't want in the product from the cannabinoids that we do want to see VD smell then the ethanol is separated in what's called a rotary evaporator that's usually about 75 to 80 percent cannabinoid content so what is this machine this is a white film evaporator we're loading that cannabinoid content that we just got out of the rotary evaporator into here and we're gonna let that content seep down into this jacket right here so you'll get CBD testing it then 90 to 99 percent purity and we'll test it right after this but that's going to be very high quality products and we call it that the money jar and this idea you might have a little bit as well okay for testing just to see can you extract it more from here absolutely her choreography we can extract it and make it isolated to be booty recessive teen performs a series of tests to know what they're making oil this is just a base and we can make into whatever we need to make out of it what you're gonna make creams tinctures who can make pills CBD can also be crystallized this is the crystallized form in the powder form of that no THC in here strictly CBD is testing at 99.9 percent purity then put into a product and shipped out to consumers buying into the CBD trend for today Kristen Dahlgren NBC News Denver you", "kyDnfHFKO70": "those dabs are no jokes that just ripped me oh my god hi friends welcome to that high couple where we explore and discuss our passion for cannabis today we are doing another delta 8 thc video quick recap that is a cannabinoid that is extracted from hemp cannabis plants it gives you a similar feeling to delta 9 thc that we all know and love but we sort of like to think of it as thc's little brother something that's not going to give you those same kind of paranoid effects from higher doses but i think the biggest surprise from this video is that i had no idea how many different ways you could apply delta eight for this video we've partnered with hometown heroes based in austin texas using hemp grown here in the united states they extensively work with veterans and a portion of all proceeds goes to help the vfw and the dav they sent us this big box so let's pop open this box and dive into it so let's start with the way that we've already at least featured on this channel before which is using a cart so we've got a 510 thread vaporizer cartridge here it's got 600 milligrams of delta eight and it is flavored after strawberry coffee and because it's a 510 thread cart you can pretty much put it into any battery is good for those carts and install it click a button and you're good to go oh cheers alice there we go i love it get this started oh nice big hit off of that yeah does kind of remind me of this kind of cotton candy flavor to it especially with the strawberry cough oh yeah really nice flavor it's not like overly sugary candy but this is this is good i would not mind smoking on this all day long so another way to consume delta eight is actually by smoking moon rocks kind of like a turducken of cannabis you take bud you take wax you take keef you push it all together into this crazy kind of hash sort of looking like thing and you can easily add it to a packed bowl or even sprinkle it into a little bit of a joint what this is is cbd bud with delta 8 distillate on top and then rolled again in cbd keith another very easy way to consume delta 8 is actually with delta 8 infused edibles edibles everybody loves edibles yeah we are looking at three different flavors gummies are kind of the go-to for edibles i love that i'm looking at pink lemonade fruit punch and blueberry and blueberry so these have 25 milligrams of delta eight per gummy and there are ten gummies in each container pretty good off of this vape i've taken a couple hits a bit yeah it's it's not that i'm high because i know what that feeling is this is different but i do feel pretty chill pretty uplifted that's what's so great about delta 8 is that i feel like we could dabble in every single way here and not get so floored that we couldn't get off the couch because that's not what the whole point of deltate it's to give you a kind of milder experience so cheers cheers everyone yeah that's good get a little gummy definitely don't taste the cannabis i don't taste any cannabis in this whatsoever if i just ate this out of a candy jar i would not know it's inedible what's great about these two is that it's kind of in the same genre as cbd which a lot of states have legalized and are allowed to ship and everything like that go ahead and check out the website for like exact details on bi-state specifications but pretty much all of this can get shipped nationwide which is really cool great way to experience cannabis a very popular cannabinoid without worrying that you're like breaking the law this is only one cannabinoid off of thc is delta nine that's delta eight exactly right another edible way of experiencing delta eight we have a couple of different tinctures usually one of the strongest ways to feel the effects of cannabis definitely the strongest in this box yeah yeah this is each bottle comes with 1200 milligrams that's insane 40 milligrams of delta eight per milliliter with tinctures usually it's good to just do them right under the tongue absorbed into your body really quickly tend to take effect really quickly great way to infuse food too if you're doing any kind of cooking add a couple of drops of this to it and like bam your whole meal is now infused this is the natural tincture this is mint tincture and this is berry i'm gonna try a little berry oh going for it you know i'll try a drop of the mint it's like a i was expecting it to be a little bit more syrupy but it's flavored water almost yes there's there's a lot of different almost like mouth sprays mouthwash that kind of reminds me of i mean this is also the mint so i'm definitely getting that's true that's true you should be feeling the effects of these very quickly i know i'm already just now starting to feel the first effects of the pen getting in front of the camera you're just like oh what's the next thing going but this i'm just like in the flow of it right now yeah there is just kind of an uplifting sort of happy mood and we haven't actually smoked any thc today so this is all just purely a delta eight high rolling on to the next product i see what you did there we're looking at this roll-on topical i know you can infuse delta nine you know thc with different topicals especially because it works really well for like veterans for anyone that has chronic muscle pain you can roll it on to very specific pain points on your body relaxation it has a kind of like i i rubbed a little bit on my arm earlier and it has a kind of like minty tingle feeling as well yeah i could actually see this working really well for any kind of a like post workout regiment um i did just roll a little bit on my arm and i do see what you mean there is kind of like a cooling like very light tingling effect feeling really good if you've got any kind of like neck or back or muscle cramps of just rolling that in and feeling the medicine get inside that's great nothing to do with like smoking or eating i this could not be easier for anyone that is totally adverse and afraid of cannabis in general the last way to use delta a that i was really surprised at hometown hero is introducing this to the market is dabbing it dabbing we've got delta 8 dabs here color on that is really nice and light let's try a delta 8 dab and see how we feel pull out the last things we've got some goodies here these are both dope rolling trays like cool and kind of trippy and sort of like future get kind of westworld vibes from these got kind of like alien sort of angel robot it looks very cool on camera too with the light hitting it damn yeah i'm trying out the sixth final way to do delta eight which is dabbing it cheers everyone as alice the first to try this this new delta eight experience infusing it into these dabs that was a big dab too it tastes a lot like cbd very cbd taste but i do enjoy the taste of cbd so there you go that just ripped me oh my god cheers everyone yeah i am feeling nice and groovy right now between the vape and the edibles and the tincture and my arm is feeling all tingly we've also still got the moon rocks there i i love it shout out to hometown hero i really am a fan that dab is kind of like next level and if you want to see more delta 8 adventures from us right now all you

cannabis for a lot of people it could be this or maybe this and for those of you that are better at planning ahead maybe even this basically we're all thinking joints bongs and getting stoned but modern cannabis has become a lot more complex than that nowadays when we talk about cannabis we're no longer just talking about a plant we've broken that plant down into extracts compounds and building blocks with tremendous therapeutic potential as a result cannabis is starting to look a lot less like this and a lot more like this and that's actually great news for all of us because the new version of cannabis is a lot more exciting than the old one in fact cannabis has emerged into a modern-day superfood and if we can reset our image of this plant cannabis might actually become more important to your daily routine than coffee so let me tell you how cannabis became a regular part of my daily routine when I was in my early 20s I had a moment of what you could call youthful indiscretion that set my life down a very challenging path I applied for a job on Wall Street to make matters more complicated they hired me it was fast paced and high-stress and in certain situations that stress could become pretty overwhelming so I tried everything I could to manage my anxiety including prescription medications but those came with their own side effects on my mood and my energy levels so I searched for a different solution and it took years before I actually found one I stumbled upon a little-known can extract called CBD it toned down my stress levels but still allowed me to feel clear-headed and focused and suddenly I was back in control of my daily routine I felt confident and composed and relaxed and I just sort of felt like myself now before you all get the wrong impression let me clarify that CBD does not get you high that effect comes from a completely different chemical called THC and CBD does none of that you could take all the CBD in the world watch the entire Beatles Yellow Submarine movie and you're still not going to feel high and trust me on that one see CBD doesn't impair you instead it seems to have the opposite effect which sounds a little bit like magic until we dig into the science we all have a built-in system in our bodies that keeps our internal functions in balance despite imbalance in our external environment it's called the endocannabinoid system and it regulates things like stress mood and appetite think of it like the conductor of an orchestra when one piece starts acting out of rhythm for example an overactive stress response the endocannabinoid system can step in and smooth it out CBD happens to be one of the chemicals that supports the function of this system helping that conductor to maintain rhythm throughout the body in the brain and brain imaging studies have actually proven this through these studies we know that CBD can help to modulate activity in key brain regions involved in our stress response like the amygdala in other words CBD helps your brain to function in a more balanced state when stress level spike ok so why am I telling you about biological systems in brain activity well for one I paid a lot for a degree in neuroscience and I'd kind of like to get my money's worth the other reason is that this little-known cannabis chemical it's about to change the way we all think about our daily health it's made such a big impact on my daily routine that I now dedicate myself professionally to creating healthy CBD options for people that want to give it a shot and it's not just for people with extreme anxiety or panic attacks either CBT has this gentle calming effect on mood and stress levels similar to a meditation think of it like the volume knob on a stereo CBT doesn't shut the noise off entirely it just turns that dial down a little bit so you can hear the music and because of that it's being used to help people perform better in a wide range of daily stressful scenarios from interviews to networking people that used to have a drink to calm the nerves are now trying CBD instead it is even effective for public speaking [Laughter] [Applause] multiple studies have actually been done on the effects of CVD on public speaking and have found a significant reduction in stress and discomfort compared to a control group and the potential benefits of CVD you go way beyond stress management to because of the broad function of that endocannabinoid system CPD itself can have a wide range of benefits professional athletes are now ditching prescription pills and painkillers in place of CBD and insomnia acts are turning to CBD is a potential natural remedy for more restful sleep but before you go and toss out any prescription pills I should note this does not mean that CBD is going to cure your anxiety your insomnia or your arthritis there's no one-size-fits-all solution these things and for many people prescriptions will just be the best option but the implications for CVA are pretty fascinating particularly when you consider that we may have stumbled upon a natural remedy to common ailments that affect millions of people every single day better yet you don't have to ingest a handful of pills and supplements to get those results CBD is commonly infused into foods and beverages in a way that's healthy and convenient you can get everything from CBD waters and juices to CBD olive oil and hummus but before we all go run out of here and share a giant bowl of CBD hummus it's important to consider the risk factors is CBD actually safe and what happens if we take a lot of it these are all very good questions unfortunately we do have some answers reports currently indicate that daily dosages of CBD up to 1500 milligrams are well tolerated by the body which means they're safe and to put that number in perspective here's a graph that shows common CBD dosages and food products today versus what those reports deemed to be safe and you can see it's not even close you'd have to spend thousands of dollars every single day on CBD infused food even come close to those numbers the World Health Organization has also weighed in on this stating that CVD has a good safety profile and that no public health problems have been associated with CVD use even the FDA which sets the gold standard for safe food policy in our country seems to agree with all this just last year the FDA noted little indication that CBD has abuse potential or presents a significant risk to the public health even more remarkable CBD doesn't seem to be addicting either the FDA's data also found no evidence that CBD causes physical or psychic dependence so let's recap CBD comes from plants doesn't impair you safe for adults consumed and could help millions of people it's a pretty amazing discovery right I think we should all pop open a bottle of CBD champagne to celebrate well actually not so fast because we currently sit at a pivotal moment in the history of cannabis regulation one that will determine if when and how we're even allowed to purchase cannabinoids like CBD C as a country we don't like to change our canvass laws very often we've really only done it once before when we effectively made it illegal back in 1937 and since then cannabis has been vilified for its recreational use the idea that weed equals scary is so deeply rooted in our culture that it even affects the way we think about versions of this plant that have absolutely nothing to do with its recreational use like hemp so now after an 80 year failed experiment we're finally about to revisit the cannabis question and the decisions we make today will set the course of this industry for generations to come now this is obviously a ton of responsibility and it's very important that we get it right this time part of getting it right means doing more research setting the right market marketing standards right safety guidelines because as much as we know today there is still more work to be done and a lot of products on the Shelf today just don't hold up the right quality standards but we can't continue to put it off to kick the can down the road because the longer we delay our regulatory decisions the longer we deny access to a natural solution to common ailments that should be very treatable we need to move forward based on real science one step at a time now I'm talking you about CBD today because it happens to be a pretty great first step it's healthy its natural and we have a growing database of research to support its efficacy so how do we move forward on CBD regulation well first we all need to determine what it is there are a lot of people out there who will tell us that CBD should only be a prescription medication those people are called pharmaceutical companies and there and they're well aware that this industry is projected to be worth 22 billion dollars in a few short years but maybe we're a little skeptical of those motivations because if we removed the veil of cannabis stigma CP is nothing more than a natural plant ingredient with therapeutic potential it's really more like a superfood and fortunately we already have a pretty good blueprint for that thanks to America's all-time favorite functional food caffeine now I know it might seem strange for me to stand up here and to compare something from cannabis to an everyday item like caffeine but bear with me are they really all that different they both come from plants they're safe for adults to consume and we use them to improve our mood and our energy levels interestingly enough caffeine was once vilified too back in 1909 the United States government filed a federal lawsuit against coca-cola for marketing a product that contained caffeine which they deemed to be unsafe nowadays caffeine can be found in all sorts of products from food and beverages to cosmetics and even medication we ensure that caffeine products are safe and labeled properly and then we let people decide if they want it when they want it and how they want it and since I'm sure everyone here has had some form of caffeine today it's safe to say we're all pretty comfortable with that system we need to take the same step forward with cannabis because cannabinoids like CBD should be no more threatening than a cup of coffee and if we do it the right way this time we have an opportunity now to give millions of people access to something that could improve their work lives their social lives and their overall happiness but we need to take a step back first in order to move forward and toss aside those outdated stigmas because this plant is a lot more than just weed cannabis should be viewed as therapeutic so let's hit the reset button on our image of cannabis starting with a fresh look at CBD and if we can change our perspective on one aspect of this plan maybe we can take another look at the rest of it - thank you [Music] you", "0xh5liVaWpY": "yeah today is the temperature this is going to determine when we have vapors moving across the system right in this region so if I look at it right now let's change it to Celsius it says twenty six point six degrees Celsius so let's just keep our eye on this thermometer all time straight during the process it's a something that you guys are going to see constantly fluctuating again it's going to help you determine whether you're in a fraction or not so our 27 degrees so 26.6 to 20 so the set point is a little higher we're at 40 on the mantel and we're right about where we need to do as far as the bath temperature and it's almost reached our set like the activity which we're doing more water in here then I call you with life and some people you know previously you may be concerned about water in your extract right sometimes I don't want water in my extract when it comes to for conservation I mean you can throw sand in that flat you can throw like any creditor realistically you can separate it by going so now right now is actually a point where I switch my chiller so you guys notice that the slur is getting kind of we've got to move all of the trailer we've got the chiller over here set to one degree Celsius but for the process of THC one degree Celsius you can see me about the slide building up here it's going to be too cold for our THC to run on its going to actually start to stall and back up and basically kind of clogged up in the condenser so we need to turn it to is I'd say 55 degrees is a pretty good temperature you can go anywhere from 45 to 55 I've started out at 40 zero staying through the system - yeah that's all the water stamp that water steam and terpenes being distilled together definitely definitely so the reason I'm now switch my condenser over me now is I still have ethanol and stuff going on and I need the connector kind of so cold for a little bit it's because it's going to take we need to have both functions but if you were able to remove ethanol so say you had a rotary evaporator you had a simple spill or something that was doing your distillation of ethanol and getting you down to that food sludge and then you're going to your short path that's what you're already cold and then you don't need it cold for you the in the fashion of how crude it is it's kind of one of these byproducts this a lot of people before were like hiding it cracker which I'm generating class so you do want that full vacuum as much as possible I really don't want to lessen the vacuum or introduce any oxygen or anything in the equation she's doing a spiral and there's a couple different spiral paddle patterns they don't notice it will make and there's actually a cool video on this guy smarter every day Destin on YouTube is a really great Tuffy's cool YouTube viral videos he's got one on the spiraling pattern here the habits or not and he's as Bernie as an example he'll take a honeycomb to pick it up and the erotic a stacking we can kind of Judge there we go anyway because it's based on it's actually face out so my elbow it's a number one into the midnight gravity so that can give you a use the core now we're at equilibrium is - it's actually very depressed when it's light its absolute popular for everything vacuum temperature vapor pressure basically will tell you the overall usefulness if your goal if your goal is came from that by three to five percent if that extra three to five the two important to you but it's going to take time equation it's very cool dad with the reflex right now exactly why I know it's not refluxing too high and we got an excellent flow rate and the reflux is low it's not boiling all the way up the to put it that's like ideal where we're at right now it's perfect it's just jewelry on the bottom the color is awesome yeah that's good and then there's that green fraction over there suppose we got rid of", "9CJQL5RZLPw": "welcome back to the channel everybody my name is grim from wku consulting and today we are going to be talking about how to make delta 8 from a short path in a short path if you're moving into an industrial size scale this process will not work for you however on a bench top scale this will work perfectly depending on how much delta 8 that you have or need for your production so without any further ado [Music] [Music] all right guys well and girls whoever is watching out there how to make delta 8 in a short path we have a lot of things to cover in this video so we're going to be moving pretty quickly if you have something questions or anything feel free to leave those in the comment or reach out in the description below as always like subscribe and share for a chance to be enrolled in our free cannabis education course if you're watching this on youtube if this is part of your course then you will undoubtedly have the full-fledged material in front of your face and congratulations on making it this far so first off we need to talk about is delta 8 legal because there's a lot of things going around in the market right now and in the industry where people are very scared because of the production that they were doing on delta eight and then all of a sudden some additions to the farm bill came out they kind of uh retrofitted that a little bit and so there's been a big misunderstanding on whether or not delta eight was legal anymore here is the clause that a lot of people are worried about right here and i'll just go ahead and read the quote the 2018 farm bill does not impact the control status of synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinols thcs for controlled substance code number 7370 because the statutory definition of hemp is limited to materials that are derived from the plant cannabis sativa l for synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinols the concentration of delta 9 thc is not a determining factor in whether the material is a controlled substance all synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinols remain schedule one controlled substances so this has people in an uproar basically because they thought that they had a way to get a little bit high delta eight does have mildly psychoactive effects and so they started producing it then this clause in the farm bill came out people started losing their minds they say oh my gosh delta eight is going to be illegal so is delta 8 legal the short answer is yes yes delta 8 is legal and i'll explain why the long answer is yes but if you do not have a comprehensive understanding of the laws and regulations in your industry i would highly advise that you don't do it if you cannot understand the legality in your laboratory just leave that specific process alone or to the professionals or call somebody like me and we'll be happy to go over it but where people are getting caught up is the term synthetically derived now delta 8 is a phytocannabinoid that naturally exists in the cannabis plant it's organically derived its natural occurrence is too low to be extracted out right but it is my understanding here that the isomerization process takes place to convert the cbd into delta eight thc now isomerization is the transformation of one isomer to another isomers being molecule with the same molecular formula but having a different arrangement of the atoms in space i personally don't believe that isomerization converts a phytocannabinoid into a synthetic one into the manner that synthetic is being used by the dea the 2018 farm bill definition of hemp includes all isomers of hemp it's in the law therefore any isomer of the hemp plant is also hemp and pursuant to the 2018 farm bill does not fall under the csa or the controlled substances act so what i believe is the reference to synthetically derived is referring and this is with contacts with people in the dea and in the fda as well so this is my understanding um you know as a professional consultant for 10 years and not just something that i've gathered information on google for instance but something that i've had long talks with uh professionals in the uh the legislation department of this industry so i believe that synthetically derived is referring to a man-made chemical not a process by which someone at a lab isomerizes one organic molecule to another for example cbd to delta eight thc if the concept that any material formed from any sort of human controlled chemical action taking place means that the material is synthetically derived then that would mean that all of the hemp derived products that go through processing are synthetic this is the law and that's simply not the case so here i've uh i've put a little article you guys can copy and paste this into your browser so you can go back over and uh and look at that and you know this is just going to help you determine what is a synthetic cannabinoid or what is a synthetic material and uh what is uh from synthetic biosynthesis and what is just plant-based extraction and the organic isomers that occur inside of that hemp material this will give you a little bit of good information uh that you can look over for that if you're still kind of not clear but what this did in essence was to combat the synthetic marijuanas or the synthetic delta nine thcs that have begun to circulate the market um i don't know what all of them are called k2 this is not my area of expertise i don't really get into that you know k2 and the other spice or whatever people are going to their local head shops and getting and it is getting them extremely uh giving them extremely psychoactive effects this was made to combat that not the already existing phytocannabinoids inside of the hemp and cannabis plant now that we covered that i hope that you have a better understanding of you know that in particular but um here we are moving on so this is the golden ticket this is what you will find this is a very simple process i say simple but i am an organic chemist by trade consultant now however as far as organic chemistry goes this one is relatively simple to achieve and the um level of danger that is associated or the level of risk that is associated with this process is very minimal now you can find this stuff this is t41 bleaching clay uh you can find this pretty much everywhere carbon chemistry is the one that i have up here extractor depot if you just simply google where do i find t41 you can get it on amazon but this is the stuff that's actually facilitating the isomerization of cbd into delta eight and also delta nine thc into delta eight so i didn't give you any links in the descriptions or anything like that uh because it's a relatively simple um piece of material to find now here is a basic short path and using this we're going to go over first the application and um you know this is a really simple setup i found this on dhgate which is an overseas amazon type thing not the most trustworthy for equipment suppliers so i'm not referring you to these guys down here however this short path is pretty basic and you could do it and this you could do this same reaction in this short path there are some things that i would change about this short path but it will work for illustrative purposes so first we're gonna go into the pieces this is what's called a boiling flask here you have your temperature probe which is connected to your mantle your mantle will have magnetic stir bark capabilities as well as temperature sensors to heat up this boiling flask as things boil off in here and turn into a vapor they will come up through this distillation head or distillation head but this head unit here uh this is a really relatively simple normally you'd want to have as much surface area for the vapors to climb on as uh as possible to kind of increase your your distillation ratio and purity however i really like this one uh that's pictured here because you are able to um pack it with material like steel wool and also there is a nipple here that if you have a good glass blower you can go ahead and insert another vapor temperature probe right there and then just simply a top but this is connected to what's called a liebig condenser and this is what will be heated up however comparatively speaking from boiling flask to liebig condenser this will actually be a lot cooler than the boiling flask and as the vapors are boiling off they will recondense down this line and drop into your cowl now i don't like the triple cal system because i like to get the most purity as possible so just simply rotating and allowing vapors to kind of run around in here decreases the chance of just that really excellent level of purity i like to just break down my machine isolate the vacuum somewhere with another piece that i have put in there and uh be able to just take off that collection orb and put a new one on there however this is will work for illustrative purposes uh you can turn this cowl this triple cal system to collect your different fractions without breaking into the vacuum and restarting the reaction and this will be connected here to a cold trap which if i'm being honest is just to preserve the life of your vacuum pump you will put you know something like dry ice and alcohol in here to keep everything cold and then your vacuum line will be attached down here you will also collect some volatiles down here uh they will smell horrible be gross and that's the worst part of this whole uh if you're using your vacuum over here i always suggest vacuuming or exporting your vacuum out to a ventilation system because that's just that fishy odor is just one of the odors that me personally i am not a big fan in most of the odors in our industry are quite pleasant but that one is gross and then you just have you know your supports this is a manual lift to kind of keep everything straight uh this doesn't have as many supports as i would like i'd kind of build a frame over here to support that but that is a short path and that's what you can use and here we'll get into the application so the application we will add 100 grams of the t-41 that we showed you earlier for every five liters of crude to be distilled first i will add my t-41 to my boiling flask using a glass funnel then i will add my warm crude oil what i like to do is just go straight from decarboxylation into distillation uh makes things much easier much smoother much faster in your distillation process we're gonna set our stir bar at 100 rpms and let that start homogenizing inside of there in your boiling flask or on your mantle you will ramp up the temperature this is imperative i know a lot of people that just come in and they set their mantle to 205 c that's a no-no because the um the mantle will over compensate for the temperature that it's supposed to be producing therefore parts of your reaction will actually be hotter or cooler than other parts and it won't be reacting uniformly and we don't like that we do not want that so we're going to ramp up the temperature by 10 degrees celsius until 205 degrees celsius is reached and i put here adjust the fraction accordingly because um at approximately 165 to 175 you're going to start collecting what i like to call your head's fraction which is going to be a lot of your terpenes and volatiles magnesium that list kind of goes on and on and uh here is a basic definition for you if it drips it's no good if it coils and you'll notice that as it comes down it begins to coil along the bottom of the collection orb if it coils its oil and uh you know so you'll get your heads your main body which is the good stuff and then you'll collect your tails the tails will be significantly more viscous and darker color it's very hard to miss that you're into your tails fraction um so that's what i mean by just fractions accordingly you don't want to collect them all into the same orb but rather three separate orbs so at around c once you're really getting deep into your head's fraction and you're about to begin boiling off your main body you want to adjust your stir bar to around 300 rpm and then collect all of your fractions accordingly and that's it you will notice in using the t41 one of the first things that you will notice is a significant color decrease now this stuff will be almost water clear if not as clear as water so if you're watching this and you're like oh my gosh what's happening don't worry this is supposed to happen this is what a lot of people at the beginning of this industry when there wasn't much research about this they were calling it aqua tech technology this is also kind of the stuff that they're doing to make the clear slabs um in the extraction machines and that's a different video so we won't bombard you with a bunch of information but i wanted to go back here now that you have the application down and can go back over it you can just disconnect this temperature probe and put you a glass funnel there and load in through there re-grease that temperature probe stick it back in there make sure you've got a good vacuum um you know being pulled down on your entire machine here uh you want to actually pack this with something like steel wool i like steel wool steel wool works i don't like the ones that have all the chemicals in them and stuff some of them have like dishwashing chemicals in there but if you can just find a steel packing wool that will go a long way for what you're trying to do here lee big condenser two nipples will be connected to your hot water circulator something like a julabo i know people that are even using rice cookers i mean hey whatever works for you uh to get this up to temperature and uh then you know your dry ice and your ethanol here so you'll load this up here's where you'll be adjusting your parameters for temperature and um you know if you've got the triple cal system you can just rotate this orb kind of lower this and uh relieve pressure here and then just spin that orb down into there um and just go ahead and leave that fraction up there because if you disconnect to collect your fraction then you might as well just be doing one fraction at a time and if you are doing that normally somewhere around here this one doesn't have it but you'll have a little vacuum sensor that'll be hooked up to one of these auxiliary ports that are hanging on around here but you can either close off um here the vacuum and then or here is where you'd have to close it off somewhere this system is not built up for it so i don't want to confuse you but um if you wanted to to shut that off and then bleed atmosphere into here while isolating this reaction that would be best then you could disconnect your fraction reconnect it grease it up reconnect it put it back get that pressure going here on your um on your support system and you can go ahead and open that up and allow the vacuum to pull it back through and you'll start collecting as normal normally i just bleed atmosphere into my vacuum sensor here or if i have like i said the vacuum attachment or the ptfe valve then i will just use that instead and yeah that is pretty much it now i wanted to get into packaging because a lot of people are putting their material their finished product in mason jars i mean they're great for that mason jars however uh you need to vacuum seal or nitrogen blanket your storage containers to remove any residual atmosphere inside of the material depending on the shelf life at a couple of weeks it won't hurt it too much however over months and months of it just being stored there you will start to establish what we call in the industry the red ring of death and that is actually oxygen if you ever notice any vacuum leaks in your short path and you'll notice like a blood orange type coloration happening around those leaks that's what it is and nobody wants to buy blood orange distillate especially when you're turning it clear right right we like the gold stuff we like the clear stuff we want it to look like money and make us money so i just wanted to put that little tip and trick in there uh thank you for watching this video make sure to reach out to us in the description you'll find links to our website you'll find links to our social media pages you can get our phone number off of there we'd love to have a conversation with you leave us a comment on how we can help you further educate you that's what we're here for and we will see you next time i believe that next we are going to be talking about vacuum oven technology in uh the bho and pho extraction area so it's exciting share this with your friends make sure that they get a hold of it and we will see you next time have a great day and be blessed", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea", "tjZ-qDLeid0": "welcome back to another edition of our cannabis vlog series with me your host tyler green today i'm going to be discussing a topic that i've been thinking about quite a bit this week and that is hemp flour versus cbd extract so there's been a lot of products that have emerged recently on the market that i believe are to cater for cannabis consumers people like myself who enjoy the consumption experience now have a bit of a choice when it comes to getting our cbd that moves away from the traditional oils bombs and other topicals right i've actually got an example of both here this is hemp flower you can find this online you can find it in several shops in the uk and this is what it looks like and then this is cbd extract the example i've got here is the goods lemon drop cbd shatter which is 99 cannabidiol today i'm going to discuss the pros and cons of cbd flour okay hemp flour and cbd extract aka cbd dabs just to try and figure out which suits who you know like what is going to make this suitable for you or this suitable for you let's discuss that right here so flower pros when it comes to hemp flour you can roll this up and smoke it with your regular weed you can also roll it up in place of your regular weed you can put it into a vaporizer and all of those things make it seem very natural to cannabis consumers so for people that are already smoking weed regularly then adding cbd weed into your diet your your cannabinoid consumption isn't going to present any challenges or really feel any different you'll notice a difference in flavor indeed there are different flavor profiles in the hemp world as well but typically you may notice that it is less flavoursome than your high thc strains um but you will be able to naturally gel with it as a weed product right just looks the same there are different hemp strains with different cannabidiol content so there is actually stuff out there that will suit you as a newer consumer or someone that needs a lot of cbd for their medical conditions so you can get cbd flower up to about 20 cbd i think i've seen and this overall means that it is a really natural feeling product right so really easy to transition or to add it into our existing consumption cbd extract on the other hand really really cool to get the dosage requirements that you can get when it comes to cbd extract so you can literally take your gram and portion it up into 10 or 20 evenly sized portions and then you know exactly how much cannabidiol bearing in mind that this has 990 milligrams of cannabidiol in this pot so that makes it really super easy to uh to deal with dosing much more easily than it is to deal with dosing when it comes to hemp flour right another awesome thing about cbd extracts is the ability to imbue them with these lovely terpene profiles so this one is lemon drop and it just smells like sweet sicilian lemons and you can really play about and get some awesome terpene profiles in the cbd world another benefit to cbd extract which hits less with cbd flour unless you vaporize it is the bio availability of the vaporized compounds that you get when you dab versus the amount of cannabinoids that you get when you smoke so if you smoke something you're actually absorbing sort of 10 to 20 percent of the cannabinoids whereas when you vaporize you're absorbing 80 to 90 percent of the cannabinoids so if you put these in contrast and you smoked this and you vaporize this then you would be getting more cannabidiol from the extract right even if they had the same amount of milligrams consumed you would absorb more into your body with the vaporization so that is a really key positive point for cbd extract it's also a tried and tested method of delivery for cannabis consumption so you can either put it into a vape pen or a dab rig both consumption methods have been used for years and both of them are prized by medical patients for fast and effective cannabinoid delivery and of course it's much healthier to not burn your material if you can help it and that is why vaporizing extract is a healthier consumption method than smoking flour so we've talked about the benefits of both consumption methods but of course there are some drawbacks to both as well so i'm going to discuss that before we make our final verdict the first drawback to hemp flower and one which is always on my mind is that this still sits in a legal gray area so the law never changed to make an exception for cbd flower and people sold it and continued to sell it on the assumption that it contains little to no thc therefore is defined as heaven but the legal gray area does make it quite tricky to operate in the market with some cbd flower sellers being raided by the police in reality this is unlikely to affect you as a consumer so you don't have to worry so much consuming cbd flowers but just know that that distinction doesn't exist in the law another drawback to consuming only hemp flour versus consuming the extract is that you're not going to have an idea of the accurate dosage like you would if you took another consumption method when you smoke flour and particularly when i smoke flour i just grind up a few buds put it into a joint and smoke it it's a really enjoyable experience but i'm not thinking about how many cannabinoids i'm putting into my body that is something to think about for medical patients and why they might opt to consume the cbd extract instead another really key point when it comes to hemp flour is that the cannabidiol content is going to vary from batch to batch just because you smoked it once a long time ago and there was an awesome amount of cbd and doesn't mean that it will have that exact amount again and there are actually some processes where people either spray can abu dial onto the buds or they can remove the other cannabinoids to make it come down to the legal limit as well so there are some practices which you might not be aware of which might put you off when it comes to hemp flour the cannabinoids and terpenes really really nicely so that covers the drawbacks of the hemp flour so let's talk about the extract one of the things that i think is important to mention when it comes to cbd extract is often not always but often you will find that it is made from isolated compounds and broad spectrum terpenes and cannabinoids have been added right so when this is extracted to its pure form this is extracted all the way through to pure cannabidiol from hemp plants grown out in europe so they've taken away the other compounds left the cannabidiol behind and then added in the terpenes and their broad spectrum wax which is 80 cbd also offers additional minor compounds minor cannabinoids making it broad spectrum rather than isolate but it's worth thinking about that this is full spectrum right so a little bit of thc and a lot of balance of all different stuff and then this is an extract so the pure cannabidiol there is a flip side to this obviously from a medicinal perspective you know what you're getting with the cannabidiol and that's a really good thing for patients another drawback to extracts on the cbd side is that you have the potential for low quality because it's a newer industry and growing all the time there are going to be some extracts out there which don't taste as great and particularly when i got started in the world of cbd extracts i wasn't enjoying the flavor so much this year however i've been impressed with the goods flavor profile and i know there are some other awesome companies working on terpene blends and really cool stuff that you can explore so the the high quality extracts are there as well consuming extract also requires another piece of equipment so either a v8 pen or a dab rig as i mentioned with the tried and tested consumption methods however this does make it a little bit more expensive to get started and you will have to buy yourself at least an entry-level product to be able to consume the extract unless you want to just put it in with your joints but then you will be burning it and therefore wasting some of the cbd and finally the extract may feel a little bit less natural to old-school smokers i'm talking the guys and girls that have been smoking joints for 30 years haven't really tried out other consumption methods this is a newer way to consume cannabis right and it doesn't look like it did in its herbal form so it feels less natural to people that have never tried it but once you take the plunge it can be a very enjoyable experience so what is my verdict when it comes to consuming hemp flour or cbd extract which should you pick it's going to depend entirely on you and your motivations but there are clearly some benefits and some drawbacks to both i personally really like consuming the cbd dabs in the morning they're a really good start to the day but i also find myself smoking and vaping cbd flour from time to time so there are benefits to both you know it's really nice to mix them sometimes as well during the day and have a bit of both in different sessions so i find it difficult to pick i really like the flavor profiles and i really like this sort of clear-headed feeling that i get when i consume cbd extracts which is very noticeable for something that's not psychotropic both forms of consumption are entirely valid but you'll get a clearer dosage with cbd extract i'll buy both i'll have both in my medicine cabinet and i will consume both of them but i want to know what your thoughts are on the subject do you smoke hemp flour do you dab cbd extract have you tried both and what is your preference please leave your comments below and we'll be joining the discussion and as always if you've enjoyed this video hit that thumbs up it helps us grow subscribe to the channel for more and i'll be back with another video early next week thank you for watching keep talking and i'll see you on the other side [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] you", "Okpa6QMt51Q": "hi everyone welcome back today i'm going to talk about cbd products that i've been enjoying i've been a little bit more interested in cbd lately because it seems like you know it's this trendy ingredient that's now becoming a mainstay like i think we're going to just continue to see more and more of it so i'm gonna share the products i've been liking all right so let's talk about cbd in skincare products and in our beauty products and wellness products i first was not sold on this as an ingredient to look for just because it seemed a little too trendy the natural skeptic in me was kind of like are they just throwing it onto the label because it's cool to do it now it seems like it's an ingredient that's going to stick around and i think they're starting to find there are some real results that you can get from it it's a natural humectant so it does draw water but at the same time we tend to see it in oil form so we see it in moisturizers or we see it really truly like in an oil form so it can be a little bit confusing whether it's moisturizing or whether it is a humectant but it does draw water so i consider that to be a humectant the thing that stands out to me is that it's anti-inflammatory so that's why i think people really tend to like it when they feel achy is because it's anti-inflammatory so it just calms that inflammation in their bodies whether you have like eczema psoriasis if you have any type of sensitivity for your skin then it might be an ingredient that you can look into there have also been some early studies not conclusive studies but what they're also starting to find is that cbd could be good for oil production to control oil production so that's something that i'm also interested in i'm not 100 sold on that yet but it's something that people are starting to talk about and starting to use cbd for that reason but if you are using cbd truly just for its humectant and moisturizing properties then it definitely does that at the very least there are actually three reasons why i've been very interested in cbd just lately like very very recently in the past like month i've really been interested in it one is because i have scalp psoriasis so i get scabs on my scalp it's very dry it can get flaky it can just be very annoying to deal with like where my scalp just feels like it's almost on fire or it can be very itchy and stuff so because cbd can be hydrating and it can be anti-inflammatory i thought it might be an ingredient to look for in my scalp products another reason is because tada can you see this i'm like lifting up my ankle that's classy i hurt my ankle a month ago and i decided to buy a cream that had cbd in it and it really started to make me focus on cbd the cream has been amazing it's you know i don't know if it's because it has like the menthol type of ingredients in it or because it has the cbd or if it's the combination of both but i have loved it and so i you know i start to really put a little bit of a focus on oh like maybe i should be looking for cbd in some of my products and then the third reason honestly it's just been such a stressful year for everybody not just me i realized that it's been such a stressful year i've had so much anxiety i haven't slept well partially because it's been such a wild year but also because i'm coming out of that like first year of you know having a baby with isla and just starting to you know be able to get some sleep so cbd i'm really really late to it right now but i'm starting to become very interested in it for those reasons that said i'm i'm only just starting to get into it and starting to learn more about it so if you're interested in it or you do know a lot about cbd feel free to let me know more information about it because i'm very interested there are definitely products that i have tried in the past couple of months with cbd that have been so stupid and you know there is definitely a marketing aspect to the cbd products as well so that's also something to keep in mind just because it has cbd doesn't mean it's going to be a great product the other thing that's important to point out is that cbd oil and also hemp oil those are completely different types of ingredients than the thc that is in pot like in marijuana so if you are worried that you're going to get high from you know using like a cbd product you're not unless it says it has thc as well because i have seen those products too that have the combination most of them have some kind of a disclaimer that says it does not have thc it will not get you high and this is purely for the skin care benefits or like the wellness benefits of it all right so let's get into the product starting with this one this is the vita hemp cell energy ampoule and a big thank you to go selly for partnering with me on this video so in this serum they used one of my favorite skincare ingredients niacinamide and they paired it with cbd so that was really interesting to me and it's the reason why i start to give it a try i fully expected this to be kind of like a rich oil feel but it's not it feels like a light oil slash serum and it's kind of a fun application because it comes looking like it's almost in like in a vial and it comes with a little syringe there is no needle don't worry it comes with a little syringe that you you know pop into it and then you just pull out the amount that you're going to use and that keeps it all really fresh which i also think is very interesting because you know we're always talking about like keeping your ingredients fresh and making sure that they stay stable and everything and that's one way to ensure that so you pull out a little bit and then you apply it just like you would a serum it's very hydrating to the skin it immediately starts to plump your skin and give you those hydrating effects that you get from it so in that alone it is anti-aging but it's also very nice for controlling oil production and calming that redness in your skin i've seen a huge difference in the month that i've been using it this is one of those products that is really nice for everyone that's been wearing a mask if you're experiencing any kind of irritation and redness on your skin if you feel like your skin's getting really dry under the mask if you feel like you're getting flaky any of that even with the change of the seasons you're feeling like your skin's feeling a little bit more sensitive because it's colder now this is a wonderful serum to add in especially if you want to get those hydrating benefits it's also great for people with sensitive skin again it's anti-inflammatory you can also use it day and night in your skincare routine these are all ingredients that are really nice like they play well with others so if you are using your actives like your ahas and your bhas or if you're using some type of retinoid at night you can still apply this first to really soothe your skin and while this is for the face and this is how they market it is for your face for the skin for your skincare routine i have been using this on my scalp again they do not claim for this to be something that you use on your scalp it's just that i have really enjoyed using it also on my scalp it was one of those things where i started to feel the texture of it and i was like hmm i really like these ingredients for my face i think that this would be nice for the scalp because of the the feel of it it's very liquidy and i think that's why i like it for my scalp you know like serums and oils that are meant for your scalp like when you're losing your hair and when you are trying to treat something like psoriasis a lot of these serums or these oils haven't really caught up to what we've learned about skin care you know i think about my scalp as skin i feel like it's really important to find the right kind of skincare products for your scalp so while this isn't made for the scalp i have been putting this on my scalp at night and it has really made a huge difference the night before i'm gonna wash my hair i'll take actually like i'll fill the syringe and i will basically just kind of run this through my scalp area and i'll rub it in and then i have another product i'll show you that is more of an oil that also has cbd in it that i've been putting on my scalp and it's really helped to calm it really help to moisturize it again you know like i don't know if it's 100 the cbd in this but i know that this feels really nice on my scalp and it's made a huge difference since i talked about how i use that on my scalp i might as well get into the second product i use on my scalp and that is by briochio this is their be well 100 milligram cbd plus arnica flower soothing skin and scalp oil because the vita hemp really feels more like a serum it absorbs into my scalp really quickly so i've been locking that in again i'm trying to treat it like it's a skincare routine right so i've been locking it in with this oil and the combination really has made such a difference on my scalp if you're one of those people that has just kind of like an itchy scalp in general i'm not saying this is for psoriasis i'm just doing it because i have psoriasis neither of these products are claiming to be psoriasis products just i want to point that out this is just what i've been doing to soothe my scalp i really do think there is a lack of great products for your scalp out there i've got some hair oils for instance when i was experiencing a lot of hair loss after pregnancy where these oils were like full of just essential oils and you know when you turn and look at the ingredients list you're like this is so not caught up with the times like we know a lot more about skincare everybody and we want real skincare ingredients on our scalp the combination of the niacinamide and the cbd from both the serum and from this oil is really just nice for my scalp but also this has arnica in it and we know that arnica is also anti-inflammatory so i just really love this combination it's been working out really nicely for for my hair and my scalp all right so like i said at the beginning of the video i hurt my ankle and i really wanted to find some type of product to put on my ankle just to make it feel better so usually you know i'm like a tiger balm kind of person or like you know like the old school icy hot and stuff but when i was looking for these things on amazon this is the product that came up and it's just called natural hemp cream you know i decided i might as well buy it at the very least it has the menthol in it that i know will help my ankle feel a little bit better but i was again interested in the anti-inflammatory benefits of this hemp oil is the main ingredient of this cream which is which was one of the reasons why i was into it it also had really high ratings which i don't 100 take serious on amazon because it can be all over the place and it also has arnica in it so again we know that arnica is anti-inflammatory i know that the menthol is going to work well and then it has the hemp oil in it so i decided to purchase this and i have loved it the minute i started using it on my ankle it started to feel so much better could it be that it's just that i'm putting something that feels really nice on my skin and i'm also massaging it and everything sure but i do feel like i saw such a huge difference when i started using this on my ankle it's you know fairly inexpensive it's easy to get because it is on amazon it's not fancy at all but it feels really nice i have been using it every single day at least morning and night it's made my ankle feel a lot better i've even been using it on my other foot because since my right foot is not her it gets the brunt of my weight basically and i've been you know putting a lot more work into my right foot and my right ankle so i've been using it to massage both of my feet and my ankle areas it also just feels really moisturizing to the skin so that's been nice too i think one thing to point out is that this has hemp oil in it and not cbd so i had to do a little bit of research on the difference and it's just basically the part of the plant that is being utilized essentially in the cbd and the hemp oil but you're getting a lot of the same benefits from it all right next up is kind of like a treat yo self kind of product this is the prima bath gem i got this off of sephora i bought a couple of these because i don't really take baths as much as i used to anymore mostly because my children have taken over my bathtub so you know when i when i use this i have to essentially like clean out all the bath toys and everything and then you know actually take a bath for myself and it's got to be after the kids have fallen asleep it's a whole deal so i want to make my baths nice when i'm going to take a bath so i got a couple of these i've only used one so far and then i've got this one left but i really enjoyed the experience it's effervescent so you pop it in basically to the water once your tub is filled very similar to a bath bomb but it has cbd in it so again it's anti-inflammatory it's very hydrating and moisturizing for the skin so at the very least we know i'm getting those benefits from it but this also has magnesium in it and i think magnesium is one of those underrated ingredients that people don't focus on for skin and skin healing a lot the best way to get magnesium in our bodies as well which people don't realize is actually through our skin it's not actually taking it as a supplement and i think that's how most people try to get their magnesium but truly the best way to get it is through your skin magnesium is great for so many of our bodily functions it helps to calm us it helps us sleep it helps even our bowel movements and things like that it's just good for your body in general and it's very soothing for your muscles so again because i hurt my ankle i've been looking for products that will just help soothe my pain and like the issues i've been dealing with and this is one of those products that i got so it's not cheap considering that it's just a one-time use little tablet but it is really nice it makes your bath feel like an experience and i'm really excited to use the second one that i got next up i have two moisturizers and by the way i would consider the the hemp cream to be a pain relief cream and not a moisturizer because you don't want that menthol feeling all over your body maybe you do but i don't so i keep it only to my feet and my ankle but the next two products i have are the josie marin skin dope this is a cbd body butter and then i have this by lord jones it is the cbd body lotion so first let's talk about this this is just a nice rich moisturizer it feels good it reminds me of like a really fancy version of my old school favorite like when i was a teenager i was into the body shops mango body butter this feels like this amazing updated elevated adult version of that so i just started using this because it feels so luxurious and like i said i also got this laura jones cbd body lotion this you don't get a lot of product in i feel like i'm going through it so quickly but i really enjoy this lotion again you know i said at the beginning of the video that i have been a skeptic of cbd just because it does feel like so many brands throw cbd onto their products just to claim that they're using cbd because it's trendy and not necessarily to give you any real benefits you know lord jones has created their brand around cbd so it feels like it's a different approach in the sense of you know like they're focusing on cbd and building a whole line around cbd whereas brands that are you know established and then just like kind of including cbd in a couple of their products this one really focuses on cbd as their entire brand this is the signature fragrance by the way it's a very fragrant lotion which i personally enjoy i do feel like i'm going through this pretty quickly especially for the price of a body lotion but it has felt very nice it feels very refreshing to the skin the josie marin i've been using more on like my body after the shower and stuff and this has been a lotion that i've been just kind of like keeping at my desk and using like all my hands on my elbows on my arms like those types of areas when i'm not out of the shower it feels nice and refreshing it almost gives you kind of like a pick-me-up and because it smells pretty it's it takes a place of perfume for me too i can't really say that these products have done more than other lotions for my body but they have felt very nice i only have psoriasis on my scalp right now hopefully it doesn't go to my body but i haven't been dealing with any skin issues on my body so i'm not needing you know cbd for my body besides my ankle obviously because i'm looking for anti-inflammatory products there but they have been very nice body lotions and creams to use and like i said this feels very refreshing and it has this beautiful scent to it i'm just very interested in them i'm telling you i'm using these i like them do i recommend them as cbd products i'm not sure yet but i do like them as moisturizers next up i have these two products from milk makeup one of them is the kush fiber brow gel and then the other is the kush lip balm this is actually just their green dragon lip balm this is not the one that has color to it again we know that cbd is very hydrating moisturizing for the skin so i have enjoyed this lip balm a lot just as just a plain lip balm i've been wearing it before my lipstick you know i've seen people comment you know i was showing off like some really matte lipsticks on instagram the other day and somebody bought it and messaged me and was like this felt really dry and cracky on my lips but it looked really creamy on your lips are you using a lip gloss and stuff and i was trying to think like what is it that makes my lips different like why did that matte lipstick look different on me and i think the difference is that i tend to prep my lips with something like this i've been really enjoying this as a lip prep for my lipsticks because it's not one of those like lip balms that's super shiny and that makes it hard to you know like put a lipstick on top of this feels more like a mix of a lip balm with like a chapstick i know that doesn't sound very elegant but that's kind of what this is it's not shiny i guess is the whole point so it really helps to prep your lips it feels nice and moisturizing and i'm not sure if it's a cbd per se but i know that this is just a really nice lip balm and i've really enjoyed it and also it's got this green tone to it but it doesn't actually leave a color on your lips it just feels really nice but it's clear and then the other kush product that i've liked is the fiber brow gel one i just like fiber brow gel so i was interested in it just solely for that because on the weekends when i'm not really wearing much makeup i'll just swipe this into my brows so that i look a little bit more groomed and pulled together and i also just like that it has color to it because when i'm not actually using a brow pencil to fill in my brows this is usually what i find is all i need if it's just a day like at home or i'm going to be you know like running some errands or something and i'm not wearing a lot of makeup this is all that i need for my brows and the reason why i was interested in this having cbd in is because we know that cbd is conditioning at the very least so i assume that it does that for my brows it conditions them a little bit i've seen a difference in my brows in the sense of you know they feel like they're fuller i've also been using a lash and brow serum so it could be the combination of both or it could be just the serum or it could be this uh nikki uses this on me when she does my makeup just like today and we've really enjoyed this and then last of all my cbd products is this this brand is called recess it's a sparkling water that has hemp extract and adaptogens in it i'm not one that's into these types of drinks they usually taste terrible to me i'm one of those people that has like two to three drinks sitting on my desk almost at all times it's like i have my water a tea and some type of other drink so i thought that these would be nice because they don't have a lot of sugar in them i think like this one has four grams of sugar in it all together and it actually tastes really good there are lots of different flavors to it essentially it's like tea mixed with your sparkling water so it's kind of a nice refreshing drink at the very least it does have the help the hemp extract which i you know hope is helping to calm me down i don't know if it's working but i enjoy it it also has ginseng in it and i i've also been a fan of ginseng for a very long time i don't know if it's because it's like in my blood as an asian or something i've always liked seen my grandma and stuff use ginseng in a lot of products and in her you know like in the things that she would take for wellness so i'm a believer in ginseng and then it has l-theanine and it has lemon balm in it so both of those are just really good for like boosting your mood and stuff basically it's like a mood boosting sparkling water and whether i see a difference or not i've just enjoyed it i guess like that's the best way to explain it it's so hard to tell you guys if i've seen a huge difference in using any of these cbd products because of the cbd but what i can tell you is i've enjoyed the products that i'm talking about period right so that's like the biggest thing that i can tell you is that these are all products that have cbd in them that i really have enjoyed and this drink is one of those drinks it tastes delicious it's a very light refreshing drink i hope it's helping calm anxiety and help me sleep i did you know get like a sleep pillow that has cbd infused in it and it was the stupidest thing i've ever gotten i went back to my regular pillow and just put a silk pillowcase back on it it seemed like it did absolutely nothing for me so there are definitely still things out there that i think are just marketing gimmicks but these have all been products that i i've just thoroughly enjoyed and they happen to have cbd in them so i hope that the cbd is just doing more for me so those are cbd skincare products and wellness products that i have been enjoying tell me in the comments below if there are any products that you're going to try from my list or if you've been using any of these or if there are cbd products that you think i should take a look at i'm very interested in cbd i know that we're only going to see more and more of it on the market another reason why i've been interested in it because you know gotta pay attention see what's happening out there uh tell me why you use cbd or why you don't use cbd because i'm also curious about that find me on instagram i'm at susan yara and i'll talk to you guys soon bye [Music]", "JRqt7DCQnIs": "when you sort of create a robust healthy human then you know you can tolerate more of these things that doesn't mean you should holler you should force yourself to tolerate them but right you know in many of the people that we work with you know cutting out alcohol altogether to begin with is very important but then adding some of that back in can certainly have benefits for multiple reasons can we talk about CBD and THC we both live in states where that's legal now yeah and I can tell you I first started doing CBD oil last year and just to help out with with sleep I've heard people talk about you know it's good for back pain and all this other stuff and I found the curcumin is actually way way better for back pain than the CBD oil was for me although I haven't tried the lotions and stuff like that but then also THC and edibles especially like the OL spray or like a vape pen before going to bed I found that that helps me out a little bit with sleep if I'm if I'm struggling with sleep so I know there are obvious upsides and downsides I like to get some opinions on this we asked some data we don't even need it and we were we were actually talking about this over breakfast that's the kind of guys that we are yeah so the interesting thing is that CBD on its own based on the data that's available should not help with sleep so basically when they've looked at it and they've given people CBD alone or CBD plus THC the CBD alone can actually cause alertness and it may be to do with how CBD and THC affect cortisol metabolism there's some other stuff of it you know the the signal the ways they signal you know so some people may sleep worse if they take CBD and but when you add THC then people seem to sleep better so there's like a there's a synergism there however I can say for personal experience that I've tried CBD alone before bed and it certainly seems to help it certainly does seem to help me sleep and why that is I actually I actually don't know I don't have a study to say this is why I think there's the you know there's gonna be an interaction with all the other things that are going on in the gut CBD has certainly been shown or you know to improve got information got health I don't think that's an issue for me but that's particularly animal studies and now it's been translated CBD is now being used for in cancer therapies and for epileptics and they're starting to use it in people with inflammatory bowel disease so can certainly have a number of benefits I haven't tried the CBD plus THD THC was more of a thing I did in my teenage years but but have both been shown potentially to help with sleep the the potential downsides are obviously then can interfere with cool summers harbors and all this other stuff so if it's not causing it if it's not causing you benefit then you know there's no there's potential downsides for taking it so I mean we do think you know particularly for people you know heavy marijuana users there is some risk of mental health issues if that's coming from THC or other things you know of is obviously the the strength the concentration of THC in marijuana has increased dramatically over the last few decades so there's there's multiple factors that play there if you're taking 10 milligrams of THC with 30 milligrams of CBD before bed you know you're probably well under that that risk first hold but there are studies that show that it interferes with hormone metabolism called slow metabolism so it's just it's at the moment is kind of a try it out and see if it benefits you but equally you know we roll back to our continuous message which is why aren't you sleeping in the first place right you don't want to medicate yourself to sleep you want to find out what it is it's causing your poor sleep in the first place similar to the melatonin in the apple meadow that can help but but that is a band-aid off the band-aid that you not having enough melatonin because you're exposing yourself to bright lights at night all you know it's something like that right and so I think the micro dose with are the few times where I've done edibles where I get a like oh I can't do anything else besides eat potato chips today I just I don't like the feeling and so I I tend to I tend to avoid avoid that but I also have found that the mental health thing so I have the mental health problems running my family my dad was schizophrenic my brother was schizophrenic killed himself and so I know like that's the reason I won't do psilocybin and other things because there's a potential for you know even though I think I'm well past the age at this point where those symptoms would present themselves I do notice that the couple times where I've tried that an edible that is like Oh like this is too much the next day I it's like the roller coaster there you can't have the high without the low sort of thing and the entire next day I'm just like oh wait I should be happy right now but I cannot be happy this is a thing this is a story for anything that you take to try and change the way your brain functions but what we usually say is there's no biological free lunch right you can't ask your brain to do something which you wouldn't normally do and then expect it to be completely normal after so nootropics are a classic example you know you take these compounds are supposed to increase brain cognitive function various brain functions but it might increase function in one area but it makes you less good in another area and then so maybe well I will do I'll take a nootropic usually book the only time I do is before a podcast yeah and I know in afternoons I all I have this brush yeah yeah there is a nootropic crash for me I thought maybe I was unique in that because I've never heard anyone else talk about it but no I'm certain if experience the same and there are some some nootropics that are basically just like the kitchen sink everything's in there and this sort of light switches everything on you definitely notice a difference but then you gotta come down later so I often liken it to taking MDMA where your lights switch everything on you feel great and then you know a few hours later you have this you have this big come down and it's not the same for everybody again it's something that you have to experiment with yourself but but you know again we go back to why isn't your brain functioning as you would like it to why do you feel the need to take something to enhance your brain function are there other things you could be fixing and therefore you don't need to take that it's propak in the first place you know that's always where we're gonna go back to and then if you know occasionally you need to try something like that you just need to be aware they're asking your body or brain to do something you wouldn't normally do you might gonna you're gonna pay for it later yeah from either the THC thing is not to a point where it's or at least that I feel there's any sort of psychoactive effect it it's it's like micro dosing that's like one or two milligram sort of thing and the thing that helps me with is with the sleep is it prolongs the the period where I stay asleep another thing that has really helped me and I I've had to get really sort of diligent about it and I screw up still all the time water I drink a lot of water during the day but I stop at 5:00 p.m. I stop drinking liquids of 5:00 and that way I don't feel compelled to get up at 3:30 a.m. to pee which but sometimes when that happens I get up at 3:30 a.m. and I'm like I'm up I can't get back to sleep now and so I found those two things for me in the water is probably way more helpful than the THC to be honest with you so just something to think about any other words about THC no it's not something that really interested me on the c-word site about the stuff that's free like sunshine I'm very excited about where as yeah sunshine deficiency can definitely cause insomnia so like you can fix that first before having to buy a supplement we so we the one reason why we talk about CBD is because again it might help with people with inflamed guts and we see a lot of those so we know a lot of people who feel they've benefitted from taking you for some see yeah so that's an interesting thing that you bought up recently is that maybe you have some problem that's stopping you from sleeping and then you take another thing that makes that first problem worse and maybe introduces another problem but the net effect is still positive and so your sleep does get better yeah you", "KH6Cx5vCCGs": "[Music] good evening ladies and gentlemen it's your boy sean coming at you on orbit 420 this channel is dedicated to cannabis and cannabis related products and in tonight's video we have another outstanding video on how to refill your vape cartridge using a true clear syringe and a needle that i just picked up from hobby lobby so stay tuned i'm going to give you all the details and we're going to go step by step on how to fill this cartridge up this is requested by some subscribers now if this is not your first time coming to my channel and that button below this video is still red then what are you waiting for go ahead and tap that red button right now and ring that bell next to it become a subscriber in the urban 420 family and go ahead and ring that bell for notifications so you get notified whenever i drop a new video like this now this applies to all of you new visitors as well this is your first time coming here definitely consider hitting that subscribe button i'm not rushing it you can wait until the video is over and then go ahead and hit the video or the button at the end it doesn't matter to me as long as you hit that button so i'm knocking stuff over here making a mess that's kind of what i do around here i've got this is the cartridge this is a store-bought cartridge just so you know and we're going to be using that one and i've got a ooze battery here and i also have my yokan armor battery and this cartridge here i've got two of these these are cartridges that are from fluent which is a dispensary in florida i'm gonna go ahead and put the temperature whoops i just put it on preheat one two three one two three now this battery here is actually a yokan battery but the voltages like for example on this ooze battery it goes from 3.3 to 4.8 and this goes i think there's three different settings unlike the ooze where it has the rotating part if you've never seen a news battery before the use slim battery you adjust the voltage on the bottom just by turning this potentiometer here so you don't have to click the button three times to change your temperature and you get a lot more variation there like you don't have to just put it right on 3.3 or 4.8 you know you have little steps in between there so that's kind of convenient and um this is the yokan armor vape pen which comes with a dual quartz coil tank and a mouthpiece so that you can obviously vape wax concentrates oils etc but it also has a 510 thread and you can put a 510 battery on it and since the voltages are similar 3.5 3.7 and 4.3 i believe is what they are actually i have a box right here instead of guessing it's 3 volts 3.5 volts and 4 volts there you go let's be factual about it shall we that's the yokan armor handy dandy little vape pen i've got a video on that too you can check that out cheers and i apologize for being so rude and just taking a vape right in front of you like that you know it's kind of like back in the 80s when you were to nightclub somebody just took a bump right in front of you in the bathroom and didn't even act like it you know it's it's something that you should stop the conversation about like gee whiz you know here we go cheers i like these uh fluent vape cartridges this one's almost empty i'm just cashing it out we're not really going to use that yokan armor but to the task at hand now i picked these up crystal fx is what they're called at hobby lobby and it comes with syringes but you don't need to use those um but this is for glue glue tips these are glue tip syringes is what they are now you can order these on amazon and get a big pack of them and get the exact diameter that you want i went and picked these up today because i didn't want to wait for amazon and the syringes aren't something i can get in same day delivery so anyway i don't know what i would use these things for i don't know you can't put distillate or anything like that in there but whatever those things might just uh get into the recycler but the needles is what i'm going to use and there's actually there's only two sizes in here there's a real small size which it tells you the sizes on here too it comes with an 18 gauge and a 20 gauge blunt tip and they're not really a needle it's not like you can poke your arm with it well i guess if you wanted to you could but it would hurt like hell and it's not made for that so um don't do it but this is great for you know using for glues and adhesives and stuff epoxies and things like that but we're going to be using it for distillate so now for the sake of making this video i did dip these into acetone and i will do it again actually i've got a jar just for that my acetone jar if i can get it open now it's always good you don't have to use acetone you can use alcohol isopropyl you just want something to kind of clean the needle out with and you know you're not going to put a whole bunch in there you just kind of and then you let it air dry and we'll kind of heat it a little bit to you [Music] and you don't want to do that and then put your distillate right into it because obviously there's still some residual acetone in there and it doesn't take long for don't blow in it because then you're putting your own bacteria in it so just kind of let the acetone naturally dry you can kind of flick it and tap it if you want and then what we're going to do is we're going to apply some heat to it with my handy dandy little torch i don't think i'm going to use the big boy torch that'll get really hot really fast so we're gonna use a little torch and we're just gonna that's really all you need to do other than that you'll melt the plastic trust me it gets hot enough like right now i'm not touching the metal part but just that plastic part is already a little bit warm that's all you need to kill bacteria or anything and that's really all you're worried about you just don't want any rogue bacteria inside your distillate and that is something that i do right before i put it onto the syringe so we're going to do that right now pop your top it's a little sticky when it's not warm so if you warm it up first using warm water or something like that that top will pop off a lot easier but we're just going to and oh sorry i should have been showing you that a little bit closer now this hobby needle you take the top off which is right here take this piece right here off of the tip of your off your syringe then you're going to take this needle here which of course is a blunt tip needle i'm not touching the metal part and as you can see it's not sharp or anything like that and the pink size [Music] according to this is 18 gauge i went with that one because it's a little bit bigger i believe it's bigger yes it is the higher the number the smaller the diameter of the needle so now we've got our 18 gauge needle on here we take our store-bought cartridge and you just unscrew the top that's how most refillable cartridges work and this is i believe this brand is a c cell brand i'm honestly not sure whoops it's not really important you just want to get yourself a nice quality cartridge you can buy them at smoke shops vape stores stuff like that and you know just tell them that you want to be able to reuse it a couple times because that's where the quality comes into play is well number one the components that are inside and you don't want those components to wear out very fast and obviously the better quality cartridges use better quality components now the cartridge is open as you can see there's still a little bit of residue at the top but that's okay it's a little bit left over um oil from the last time now you i don't know i've never cleaned one out maybe you could i don't know i don't recommend that i just because i don't like putting solvents and stuff inside my cartridge so you can stick a pipe cleaner down in there if it gets clogged but not too far because then you will mess up your atomizer as well so now we're going to have to warm this up because as you can tell that bubble's not moving and we want to make that bubble move so instead of using the lighter i'm going to use my handy dandy flat iron and what i'm going to do is i'm going to set mine on my lowest temperature which is 310 now i want to discuss this really fast because when you are warming your distillate you do not want to get it over 200 degrees as a matter of fact i prefer to stay around 180. so what i like to do is i for mine which is 310 is the lowest temperature i can do i'll let it heat up to about 310 or it'll tell me when it gets to 310 then what i do is i turn it off and we're going to wait a little bit and then i'm going to put my syringe in there so that that way i don't believe that it's going to be getting over 180 degrees they do make flat irons that you can get that you can actually adjust the temperature to 180 i highly recommend those are like 14 bucks on amazon it's a hell of a lot better investment than that true leave warmer that they sell for the true clear you could always use hot water and a lighter a lot of people use lighters and torches and stuff to heat it up too you can do that as well i just i like this method and it's already to the right temperature so i'm going to turn it off and then i don't even actually open the lock because the lock for it leaves it just about the right diameter if i'm not mistaken that's what i did last time yep see that so um and anyway i just wait i've turned it off it's gonna cool down fairly quickly you know it's not an exact science but and the temperature of this thing can still be above 200 in my my distillate won't get to be that temperature because i'm not going to let it either so it's cooled down pretty much i think so what i'm going to do is i don't put it near the needle or anything i just kind of put it towards the middle of the syringe and as you can see the syringe is in there hopefully you guys can see that and then what i do is i just kind of wait until that bubble starts to move around freely and you can kind of see it too if the bubble starts moving very fast very quickly then it's too hot but as you can see it's taking a little bit of time for the glass to warm up for that bubble to start moving now see that's what happens i unlocked it on accident and i don't want to get too close to the plastic as you can tell i'm keeping the needle well outside of the uh i think it's warm enough now if you see that bubbles moving right and that's all i want now i haven't turned it on so my hot my flat iron is only getting colder i'm going to go ahead and turn it back off because i just actually turned it back on but it's only getting colder right so i'm going to go ahead and lock it my distillate is still warm enough i'm going and go ahead and lock it and a lot of times you can actually if you have to use that more than once i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to stick the needle down into the cartridge as you can see there and then i'm just going to start pushing on the plunger and you'll start to see the distillate start to come out see it down there at the bottom of the cartridge and then i'm just gonna keep going around the cartridge nice and easy you don't wanna squeeze too hard or push the plunger down too fast just like that you can even try to get on amazon you can try to get a longer needle because this needle here is obviously not that long but it will settle down if i let it sit my finger is probably covering it up it will settle down into the cartridge i'm sorry i'm being lazy it will settle down into the cartridge hopefully you can see this and i'm not too high um and hopefully you can see the distal it's only about half full and there's a little bit of air here and that will work its way out because i didn't make well it is kind of a solid ring now but that air will definitely work its way out you don't have to worry about that and i do sometimes i'll even warm this cartridge up and the way i recommend doing that is just right now i haven't turned it back on at all it's still off from when we turned it on originally and the heat from that will warm up the oil just enough to be able to drop it down you know it'll kind of like work its way back down it's going to warm that glass up and just kind of help the oil to just settle down to the bottom now look you there and look see this glass isn't even really too hot for me to touch and look at that oil went all the way down to the bottom you got a nice seat and then if you wanted to fill it up i'm not going to because i want to use some more of this distillate to dab so i'm going to save it and i'm going to leave my needle on it because now there's distillate in the needle so i'm going to want to dab that out and you're going to i'm going to have to be careful not to heat the plastic up and we might even take a dab of it right now after we hit this cartridge but now the cartridge the oil has settled to the bottom now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and put this and when you take these tops off you've got to be very careful there's a rubber silicone not rubber silicone gasket right there medical grade silicone and you want to make sure that doesn't get all gnarly messed up because i'm not exactly sure if they're designed to be refilled so what we're doing here is possibly just a hack of a cartridge that it's designed to do this once of course when they manufacture it but i don't believe that it's designed to be doing it over and over again and that's why i only recommend refilling a cartridge maybe three to four times max because you also take the risk of filling a cartridge completely with a gram of distillate and then you take one or two hits off of it and the coil goes out because it's just they're only designed to last so long you know what i mean well they're only gonna last long because there's there is tiny metal coil in there or there's a ceramic coil in there and it'll just burn out because of the fact that it's it's manufactured or it's not manufactured to fail but it's you know it's only got a limited lifespan because those materials will just burn out especially if you are always hitting it at a high temperature or high voltage so just like we always do in this video we're gonna have to try this sucker out now i just put it on the lowest voltage setting i believe i did yep i'm gonna just crank that sucker up one two three four five just like everything else turns it on it's only one color because you change your temperature at the bottom look at that beautiful now i'll take a bigger dab here in a second with my uh my dabinator there it is bam we're gonna grab a piece and take a big old dab here but um or hit off this oil pen uh what was i gonna tell you about it oh also another trick is if it gets clogged because when you're refilling your cartridges they will get clogged okay um sometimes so like this one's not clogged but if you're pulling on it and that's not doing anything here's a technique that i have tap it upside down on a hard surface even like that okay and then turn it back over and immediately hit it and pull it you can even warm it a little bit and then and you might have to keep pulling it until you feel that pop through but you'll feel it clear out and the trick is tapping it okay nothing hard enough to break it or nothing like that you don't need to be like you know donkey kong but but you know definitely just tap it on a hard surface a couple of times flip it over and give it another shot and look i'm tossing this thing around like a marionette and that oil is not even moving that's the true leave co2 true clear distillate where'd the case go bam and it's the 5g purple f2 that's right came in at 80 81.9 percent thc gotta love it i'm gonna take a dab of that stuff too real dab and a dab through the pen the dab inator which piece am i going to use well i've been using the dual recycler i think i'll keep using that so refilling your cartridge with a needle that i bought from hobby lobby and i used my flat iron turned it on got to get up the temperature turned it off let it cool down get to the right temperature warmed up my see how neat and easy that was i got it nice the perfect temperature i didn't have to use a lighter i wasn't fumbling around with some hot water or anything like that just makes it so much easier for me um it doesn't work for everybody some people have told me they don't like the hair iron or the flatiron method and it just doesn't work for them well i totally agree with that there's some things that just don't work for me so just got to keep trying and experimenting you know that's what cannabis is all about so this is the dab this is actually called the dab cap this particular one and we're gonna there's dab inators dab caps it's just a piece of rubber that goes on the end of a cartridge and allows you to put it into your piece your rig take that out and here we go cheers let's celebrate filling up our new cartridge with a nice big dab from it cheers got a little water holy moly i want to say thank you for watching this video if you liked it definitely give it a thumbs up and if you want to catch my videos in the future definitely hit that red button below the subscribe button that is and ring that big bell that's right next to it and that way you'll be notified when i actually do drop a video so thank you for coming out i hope that you have a great evening i hope that you're going to refill your next cartridge and just remember this you buy a true pod you can do the same thing they sell even pods aftermarket pods that you can get i'll put a link in my description um that you can get that will fit onto the uh trustic and you can refill those pods as well you can buy the 94 true pod is usually just their standard oil it's not their co2 oil so it's the 60 oil that goes into that true pod and they charge you 94 bucks for it which is nothing wrong with that you can even buy an actual true pod i believe and open that up and refill it or like i said you can buy there is pods that you can buy that will actually fit onto a true stick and then you can fill those as well i still recommend using the true clear but instead of buying the 60 oil which you could do that too if you wanted to save 34 dollars but you could also buy the co2 oil for 75 bucks and get a little bit of an upgrade in the quality of your oil and you're still getting it for less than you would if you had bought a true pot so i don't know if truly is going to get mad at me for telling you that but you're still buying their products and i'm just helping you to buy their products and buy more of it and save some money so i hope you guys have a great evening and i hope that some of this information helps you out stay lifted", "MSzIYGWRXbE": "- [Narrator] You've probably already heard about cannabidiol,\nbetter known as CBD. It's exploded in popularity with claims of treating everything\nfrom insomnia to diabetes. - That's the only thing that would help me with my migraine headaches. - [Narrator] It can be consumed as an oil, applied to skin, or inhaled it as a vapor. We know CBD is a component of marijuana, but it's derived from hemp,\nusually does not contain THC, and won't get you high. The game changer for the\nCBD industry came when President Trump signed a farm bill legalizing hemp cultivation. One prescription drug\ncontaining CBD has been approved for treating two rare forms\nof childhood epilepsy, but the vast majority of\nwhat we know about CBD has been limited to personal experiences and unproven animal studies. - More often than not, things\nthat look good in animals, when you go into humans,\nthose effects aren't there. - [Narrator] According to a\n2018 Harvard Health Blog post, scientists say they still don't know much about how CBD affects the brain or which doses and\ndelivery methods work best. For example, if you put a few drops of CBD under your tongue, you\nmight consume 10 milligrams. But some researchers say you\nwould need 30 times that amount to reach a threshold\nthat can relieve stress. And since CBD products\nare primarily marketed and sold as supplements, the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration doesn't evaluate whether these products\nare safe or effective. That means if you buy a CBD\nproduct, you don't really know how much CBD is actually in the container. There's no denying the\nCBD revolution is upon us and the marketplace is buying in. However, there's still\na lot of TBD about CBD.", "Zo5jiigf_JM": "So I've come to public-housing\nneighborhood in London, and I'm about to meet\na guy named Hidrow.

Andavolu: Okay, good.\n[ Chuckles ] So, Hidrow,\ncan you take me through the cannabis medicines\nthat you make, and, like,\nhow you make them? Yeah, I'll give you\na first run out, and this is trim and leaf and a little bit\nof bud and stuff. Where do you get this trim from?\nWho gives it to you? Everybody's got a friend\nwho grows a little something, and, you know,\nthey throw it away, so I say \"Bring it to me. That, what you're throwing away,\nto me, is a lifesaver, and to other people can be\na lifesaver, you know?\" And when you say \"they,\"\nyou mean, like, people who are basically\nselling weed illegally. Yeah. Some of them are\nreally nice people. Some of them are\nvery horrible people. Some of them are --\nI would like to see them out of the business\ncompletely, because -- What do you mean,\nthey're \"horrible people\"? Well, they're not nice. They're criminals.\n[ Laughs ] You know,\nthey actually are criminals.

Hello, Paul.\nVery nice to meet you. Can you step aboard?\nI'm -- I'm good. Thank you. \u266a\u266a I've just given cannabis\nin the privacy of my own home. Thank you very much. And, uh,\nthat's a 1:1 strain, which is 15% CBD\nand 15% THC. There's no\nrecommended dosage, because there isn't\nany medical data on how we're to do this.\nOkay. But, really,\nwhat I'd say of anyone is try a very, very, very\nsmall amount. Just take -- even just, like,\na pinhead to start with until you just\nget used to it. No need to worry about money,\n'cause that's what we do. We give out\nfree cannabis oil.\nWell, thank you very much.

[ Woman gasps ] -It's okay.\n-There's no blood. [ Child crying ]\nOkay... And I was paralyzed\non the left side of my body. [ Slurring ]\nDo you need any... [ Woman speaking indistinctly,\nchild crying ] Woman: Hey. [ Crying continues ] Paul:\nAnd for the next six months,\nI was carried to the toilet. I had about 10% of my left body,\nat that point. I've had a headache\nfor 11 years.\nWow. Can you imagine having\na headache for 4,100 days? -Straight?\n-Straight -- absolutely. I never get a break. Imagine big, rolling\nboulders or marbles crashing\noff each other. It's like a tightening\nof a skull cap on my head. Did doctors sort of\nprescribe you anything to sort of help?\nOh, sure. Yeah, I-I've been on\npretty much all the medications that they're allowed\nto give me. I was on 14 pills a day\nat one point. So, on these pills, physically,\nit closed me down, and a couple of them depress you\nenough to kill you. This last Christmas,\nI decided no -- no more. And, uh, that's when\nI started, uh, smoking, because it dulled\nthe pain. \u266a\u266a It allows me to do the things\nthat I must do. It gives me potential.

I don't smoke anywhere else\nin the house. I'm a single dad.\nMy kids come first. Hello, you. -What'd you doin'?\n-Hi. There's word\nfor your brother you'll learn\nwhen you're older -- seven girlfriends,\nI mean... He's a player! Okay, that's one way\nof putting it. Yeah, sure. All right,\nhere's the view -- pizza. Can you bang it on?\nYou can do that, can't you, huh?\nMm-hmm. All right, homework --\nWhat about French?\nI got my history. What was your history like? 64%. 64%. -Yeah.\n-Well done, you. -Pizza's ready!\n-Okay. Thank you, sir. Please.\nYou're very welcome. Oh, thank you very much. Meat Feast or pepperoni? I think it's Meat Feast,\none of your favorites. -Meat Feast.\n-Looks like it's Meat Feast. Do you guys sort of,\nlike, realize that, like, the marijuana\nthat your dad's smoking is still, like,\ntechnically illegal? Yeah, we do. How does that make you feel?\nLike, what... Uh... Kind of scared that\nhe's gonna get caught. Paul: If I thought there\nwould be a situation where our life\nwould be threatened, I wouldn't smoke.\nMm-hmm. That's just\nblack and white. They're more important to me\nthan, uh -- than anything. [ Speaks indistinctly ] Ooh.\nHey, you okay? Yes, yes. Is it sort of scary\nto think that he has to do something that's illegal to,\nlike, feel better? If it's helping him,\nI allow it. But if he's doing it\nfor no reason, really, I would feel\nkind of upset. Right. But it doesn't seem like\nhe's doing it for no reason. It seems like\nit helps him a lot, right?\nMm-hmm. Well, she hates smoking --\nI think that's the main thing. And she's got a pretty good\nsense of values. And to her, whatever\nshe sees in the world, says pot's bad. And she thinks\nin black and white. And now we give her\nthis conundrum that daddy needs it. It kind of throws a bit\nof a wobbly at her, you know? Mm-hmm. So she's trying very hard\nto reconcile that. We had a bit of a cry together\nand a cuddle upstairs, and, uh, she'll be okay. I mean, it's hard, right?\nAnd it's -- It's lousy. I have to live a lie,\nand no parent, especially when you've got\nabsolute love for your kids, wants to do that. \u266a\u266a I've come\nto Limehouse Marina in London to see John on the final leg\nof his journey. Today he's gonna take\nhis tiny, little canal boat into the mighty River Thames\nto let his cannabis banner fly and to drum up support\nfor marijuana reform right in front of Parliament. What we've got here are\nsome CBD-rich cannabis seeds. They're very low in THCs. I'm gonna pop them\nin the balloon. Okay. [ Helium hissing ] We are gonna tie some notes\nto them from patients -- medicinal-cannabis patients\nacross the UK, and we're gonna send those\nup into the sky and hope they reach\ncommunities across Albion. Amazing. [ Hissing continues ] So, what do you reckon the day's\ngonna be like for you? Uh, I am...\nI mean,\nyou're taking a small boat into big old body of water. It's gonna be a big old\nbody of water out there, be nice and choppy. How is it different from the small canals\nthat you go in? Uh, it's tidal,\nso it's pretty dangerous. Do you think the boat's\ngonna handle it? The boat is gonna handle it,\nmy friend. We do not like pessimism...\nOkay. Right on. ...anywhere near my boat.\n[ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a [ Boat motor humming ] All right, John!\nSee you, man! Goodbye, Krishna.\nGood luck. Namaste. Whoo-whoo!\nWhoo-whoo! [ Laughs ] That's the little barge\nthat could. \u266a\u266a [ Crowd cheering ] It's to legalize\ncannabis in London. [ Cheering continues ] -Hey, how's it going?\n-Nice to meet you, man. Good to meet you.\nHey, man. I'm Krishna. You guys excited? \u266a\u266a [ Siren wailing ] Hey, Paul. -Krishna, how are you?\n-How's it going, man? Aw, it's good to see you. -What a great event.\n-I know. How are you feeling --\nYou excited? I'm very enthused\nand excited about it. It's not just talk. These are real people\ncoming out and demonstrating\nthe reality they believe in. And that's got to make a\ndifference, Krishna, in the end. And what's it like being sort of\nbeing amongst this group of, like,\nother like-minded people? -Brothers. Family.\n-You think so? -Yeah.\n-Amazing. They're just be so open\nand honest about it. I asked them, did they feel\nat all self-conscious? Hell no.\n[ Laughs ] You know, this is what\nthey believe and what they do. Yeah, people are just, like,\nsmoking weed next to the Thames, next to Parliament. The English are\nvery law-abiding.

But another way -- I'm seeing\nsomething sort of special. The people I met here\nare kind of filling in the gaps. Guys like John,\nlike Paul, like Hidrow, who are making real sacrifices\nin order to help people -- Robin Hoods of sorts -- they're forming these kind of\nad hoc underground communities, taking weed\nfrom the black market, making it into oil\nand medicine, and then giving it\nto the needy. That's kind of\na beautiful thing. That sort of, like,\nmodel of compassion is something I think\nthat the world can learn from. What I've seen in the U.S. is that legal weed\ncan equal money. But here in the UK, it seems like illegal weed\nequals compassion. And what's cool\nis that compassion is free. \u266a\u266a", "nO7vlAP5Mc0": "hey there Jeffrey here Sephora beauty director and Myesha also beauty director and we're so excited to bring you this video because we're here to talk to you about a topic that's definitely been buzz worthy for sure mm-hmm for sure so CBD is something that you have definitely heard about it's used in many different ways but we're here to talk about six very new very exciting products that we have at Sephora that offer this really great ingredient now we've talked about hemp derived products in the past but it's really important to know that this is the first video that we're actually going to be talking about products that actually contain CBD in them and this is full-spectrum CBD so you get maximum benefit and higher quality of the ingredient so you can rest assured that whichever CBD product that you choose because we have many different formulas and we've picked our favorite for sure that you're gonna get the best most soothing calming ingredients mm-hmm now at Sephora we've definitely put together this is kind of our stance on what CBD actually means and basically this is our curated assortment so when you're watching this video keep that in mind hmm so our first product that we have is something that our boss actually really loves is the first time I heard it was from her showed us a Blakely hi so this is the Lord Jones high CBD formula body lotion it's very very potent and it's very targeted so I would suggest putting your normal moisturizer on I love a good josie maran body butter after the shower that works really well for me and then put it on the areas where you feel like you need that targeted sort of soothing calming this also has shea butter in it so it's gonna go on really nicely it's gonna penetrate really deeply and also has a sort of minty feeling to it as well so it kind of helps with the feeling of just kind of like relaxing the skin so body lotion she's deceivingly small but she packs a punch for sure and remember targeted yes great for after a long day you know especially those of us that work on our feet all day and want to just a nice way to relax of my body like scrubbing and lotions and things like that but this is really going to amp it up for sure definitely take it to the next level first up for facial skincare we have from flora and bath this is a new skincare brand to Sephora this is their age adapting CBD serum now this is a beautiful product and I have to say a gorgeous texture I'm obsessed already this sort of very moisturizing like almost like a dry oil texture a wood additional oil because it's not heavy it dissipates in the skin very quickly exact like a truth serum yeah and a long time ago I would say that oil 's were definitely kind of nature's first serum anyway yeah so even though it feels like an oil it definitely has that that serum effect on the skin it's gonna dissipate really quickly and you'll be able to apply other products right on top of me say if your oily probably like I Oh probably just uses by itself but I could totally or something else on top so one of the key benefits of using this product is it's really gonna help to reduce the appearance of redness it helps to clear blemishes so it's really easy to apply you're gonna want to use five to ten drops and you can use this morning and night okay and it's really important for you again to warm it up in the hands and then press it with your fingertips along the face right just softly where you just along the high plains really working it yeah yeah and it's nice like if you want to maybe touch up your makeup cuz they're just going over you have a very very light complexion on it it looks really nice it's more satiny it doesn't look Whaley it's not breaking up anything No so our next one like I said is more of a traditional sort of oil feeling which is really nice this is the herbivore emerald CBD 100 milligram deep moisture glow oil I would say if you hear the words deep moisture it's still for all skin types it's very very lightweight I feel like it's maybe just like slightly more moisturizing than the last one we talked about with a very lightweight serum oil texture it's really really nice just to kind of put on under your makeup over your makeup it's just a really beautiful texture with a nice scent mm-hmm and I love the color I think it's just gonna look a beautiful thing on anybody's fan wait I do my products according to like what looks cute yeah I do hear that Brad you better make it look me over the weekend or company I'm late so definitely really beautiful to have on your vanity it has a nice calming like very light scent it's Jeffrey was saying kind of grounding and I love the way that it smells yeah so if you're maybe an incense person at night or you know you spritz a little perfume or something on this will kind of help you and it won't be overly distracting at all of a scent either so next up we have another powerhouse product and this one's infused with 20 different botanicals which is amazing this is from Saint Jane and this is the luxury beauty serum now this is another kind of lightweight serum oil and another one where we can talk about the packaging for like three years like this is so beautiful DUP now this one's a beautiful kind of golden color so you know that it's gonna be really great for boosting glow and giving that really nice radiance to the skin which we really really like so and this one's also gonna be really great for some age-defy in there because again like what we talked about there's a lot of antioxidant potential behind CBD so having it infused in the product is really going to help to protect your skin from environmental aggressors and stress throughout the day it has a really nice sort of I don't want to say minty but like what is that scent it's really nice it almost wakes you up I think this would be something really nice to wear in the morning or maybe on those days where you just like have had it you just want something to sort of perk you up a little bit but it's really really nice whatever blend is in there with a twenty different botanicals is really working mm-hmm you got the purest of the pure air which is great so our next one is something that's definitely a favorite of mine I'm not he was quite a bit of josie maran products and when I received this in the mail a few weeks ago I literally at my little mail opening station opened it and put it all over me so excited to use this so this is the Josie Maran skin dope argan oil plus 100 milligrams of CBD so argan oil is probably the most popular oil we have it's important has been for a long time like everybody kind of has tried it in one way or another so same benefits as her original argan oil with the omegas and the argan oil kind of giving you that like nice lipid layer it's very very important it comes in many different varieties but this has the CBD added into it so maybe if you're using that but maybe you're using maybe in anti redness serum or something to calm your skin as well and maybe you want to kind of want to use something that's multi-purpose this would be a really great transition for you and I just I find as someone who's very oily I can actually wear this during the day which I only usually wear oils at night and I was just like all for it as soon as I literally laid eyes on it yeah huge man I've been using it with the Jade roller I really yeah I enjoy it you need an automatic Jade roller that you just stick your face and that'd be cool it's a last step I have a product that I'm super excited to try this is from pharmacy and it's called better days ahead now this is gonna be a restorative kind of cushy cream now this texture is ultra addictive because it's ultra lightweight but gives you a deep hydration without a like greasy residue yes yeah it's really great for makeup prep I could see it used before oil would be really nice now this is gonna be infused with CBD as well but then you've also got an adaptogen blend of reishi mushroom you've got purple ginseng in there which are really gonna help to calm environmental stress but I like about it too if maybe you don't want to go the oil route I felt like this was a pretty good assortment of different kinds of weights of moisture too so this is something that you could use if you just like all for it or live in a very dry climate you could layer one of the oils we talked about on top of this one and you'd like to but it's very like cushiony clouds yeah nice like so so nice okay so that's pretty much it hopefully that was a healthy introduction into CBD as an ingredient for you for sure I feel like really experiencing the parts in person is really gonna solidify what you like and what you need to get I find that the consistency really sells me on you know if I'm looking for something for nighttime or daytime and the reason why we said soothing and calming quite a bit is because it's really gonna do something different for everybody so experiencing it is really the only way to know for sure which one you're gonna fall in love with

This cannabis compound, which some claim can\nhelp with pain, anxiety or other ailments, has sparked a gold...\na \u201cgreen\u201d rush in the U.S. Sales for CBD -- or cannabidiol as it\u2019s\ncalled -- are expected to grow from $1 billion to $20 billion within the next three years. But if you don\u2019t do your homework, those\nlotions or lattes could land you in deep trouble -- EVEN in places where medical or recreational\nweed is legal --- AND EVEN THOUGH the 2018 Farm Bill removed restrictions from CBD \nif it\u2019s derived from hemp plants. I mean just look at the confusion that remains\namong federal agencies: As of early July 2019, the U.S. Department of\nAgriculture says states can\u2019t block the trade of hemp plants. But if you sell CBD from those same plants\nin any health or food products, the Food and Drug Administration could technically come after you for violating interstate commerce laws. And don\u2019t even get me started \non state cannabis laws. Finding legal CBD is way \nharder than you think, so we packed our bags and headed back to school. Namely, to the University of Connecticut. In January, UConn launched the nation\u2019s\nonly college course that gives hands-on experience with growing cannabis plants. Graduate student Peter Apicella and research\ngrower Shelley Durocher showed us around their greenhouse\u2026. The stems are really purple. It's a nice tall upright plant. The leaflets are very narrow on each individual leaf. The class only grows hemp, which is like marijuana\u2019s straight-edge twin. All cannabis varieties, including hemp and\nmarijuna, fall under one species: Cannabis sativa. The main difference is marijuana makes high\nquantities of THC, tetrahydrocannabinol -- which is federally illegal. Industrial hemp, under federal law, shouldn\u2019t\ncontain more than 0.3 percent THC -- but plants aren\u2019t very good at following guidelines. So even within hemp cultivars, there's a lot\nof variation as far as the morphology of the leaves. that's where you start to see some \nof the variability and different levels of THC and CBDs. A hemp crop can start off making only CBD -- and then unwittingly turn into a \nTHC-laden field of marijuana. That\u2019s right: a hemp crop can become marijunana! And if your CBD comes from a marijuana plant,\nselling it and buying it is a federal crime. That\u2019s why under the 2018 farm bill, hemp\nfarms must submit to state or federal inspections. These mixups are created by the basic biology\nbehind THC and CBD, which are both cannabinoids. Cannabinoids are plants oils, and cannabis comes packed with \nmore than 100 versions of them Scientists suspect cannabinoids protect the\nplant from UV rays, much like sunscreen does for the human skin They think that because up to a quarter of\na cannabis plant\u2019s weight can be just cannabinoids -- and cannabinoid levels change with light exposure. You'll have more cannabinoids with more light. At the top of the plant, you'd get more cannabinoids compared to flowers\nthat are at the lower end of the plant. A cannabinoid starts out as a bit of sugar that hitchhikes around the plants\u2019 enzymes, changing its identity, bit by bit, with each ride. Eventually this wandering sugar can bum a\nride from one of two enzymes: THC-a synthase or CBD-a synthase. One ride leads to becoming THC. The other to CBD. Except in hemp, THC synthase is genetically\ndormant That\u2019s why hemp plants can make loads of\nCBD and little to no THC... ...a habit that will continue as long as the plants don\u2019t pollinate each other. When the plants DO reproduce, their traits\nmix -- and those once dormant genes can suddenly be replaced with active ones. Studies have found if two hemp plants that purely make CBD hook up, most of their offspring will be able to make THC. In fact, some of those seedlings will ONLY\nmake THC. Any biological organism is going to fluctuate\nand that's something like farmers are always and growers are always really concerned about\n-- that fluctuation. If an inspection catches marijuana in a hemp\nfield, then a whole crop could be lost. That\u2019s why UConn\u2019s cannabis class only\ngrows female hemp plants. This is a preflower and it's a very small pistil. Since it's this little tiny white hair we\nknow pretty certainly that it's a female. and they\u2019re all clones. You snip a part of a plant off you put it\nin soil with a little rooting hormone and that cutting is actually genetically identical\nto that first mother plant that you took from. And so these are all genetically identical\nto one of the mother plants we have in here. Keeping a greenhouse all-female is easy, but\nit\u2019s a different story growing hemp outdoors. Cannabis is abundant in the wild -- meaning\nan outdoor hemp field is one gust of pollen away from accidentally breeding marijuana. So before you buy, ask the store how its extracts\nwere made and if they were validated by a third-party tester. That\u2019s important because extracting CBD\nor THC from cannabis plants is essentially the same process. If your supplier does it incorrectly, your\nCBD bottle might carry a little surprise. It happens all the time. Sometimes there is CBD. A lot of times, there's not CBD. Sometimes it even contains THC in the bottle\nwhen it's not supposed to. It's really... it's a crap shoot. That\u2019s the voice of Rino Ferrarese, COO\nof the medical marijuana extractor CT Pharma, and he\u2019s tired of tainted CBD flooding the\nmarket. Under Connecticut law, their company must\nensure their products match the labels on their bottles, which they accomplish through\npharmaceutical-grade extraction. Using liquid carbon dioxide or ethanol, they can strip the cannabinoids from the plant material, in a process that's similar to distilling liquor. Add a little heat, and all of the carbon dioxide\nand ethanol evaporate away. Specific temperatures can isolate CBD and\nTHC on their own. But Rino said many CBD producers don\u2019t take\nthese necessary steps with extraction. Ok, we\u2019re back in the office. Let\u2019s recap. If you buy CBD...and it came from a hemp plant...and\nit\u2019s pure...then you\u2019re in the clear. Not quite. The FDA has prohibited the sale of CBD in\nany unapproved health products, dietary supplements or food... ...which literally means everything except for\none approved epilepsy drug is banned. The Drug Enforcement Administration also still considers CBD a schedule 1 drug unless it is in FDA-approved medicines. So why do we still see so much CBD on shelves? Well, what a lot of consumers don\u2019t realize\nis federal agencies aren\u2019t exactly on top of policing those CBD products that you see\nin a gas station or convenience store. Meanwhile, as those infractions go overlooked,\nmany states and the district have moved to decriminalize cannabis products like CBD. The result is a limbo, where hemp-derived\nCBD is mostly illicit but only if someone is watching. For the PBS NewsHour, I\u2019m Nsikan Akpan.", "ArO6G30cO2I": "[Music] welcome to the doctor Gundry podcast on this program we never shy away from controversial topics and today is no exception my guest Jenny sanssouci and I will be discussing the healing properties of cannabis CBD and medicinal mushrooms jenny is a health coach wellness blogger and the author of the new book the rebels apothecary a practical guide to the healing magic of cannabis CBD and mushrooms now she became an expert on these ancient remedies after her father was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer as it turns out something that was once considered taboo was key in helping her dad so she's here today to tell you how you can use these plants and fungi safely Jenny welcome to the program thanks so much for having me well this is gonna be fun so can you start by telling our listeners about why and how you got interested in mushrooms and cannabis sure yeah well in 2017 Thanksgiving 2017 my dad was diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer as you said and that moment was a real before-and-after moment in my life if anyone you know has been diagnosed with cancer and knows someone diagnosed with cancer you know that hearing that information just completely changes your life in one instant so as soon as he got diagnosed I knew that I wanted to help in whatever way I could whether that was with nutrition or supplements or you know cooking for him or finding remedies that could work for him plant-based remedies anything that I could you know could get my hands on I wanted to I wanted to try to find for him and I had been working in the wellness world for many years and I had some connections with functional medicine doctors and people in the wellness arena and so I had this arsenal of people to reach out to and ask you know what are the things that I should look into when it comes to helping someone with not only treating the cancer but really helping with the chemotherapy side-effects in the immune system because I knew that I didn't know much about chemo or cancer at the time but I did know that that chemo can really affect the immune system and people can not tolerate it sometimes because their immune system is so weakened so I just thought you know what can I do to help my dad and I just went full force into the research and cannabis and medicinal mushrooms were the two things I kept hearing about over and over again and once I started to dive into the research there it was really really promising so that's that's the route we decided to go on so just so that everybody understands your dad was getting chemotherapy and so you're not going to come on and say you my dad never got chemotherapy all he did was have a joint and chew on a mushroom you know in fact in fact my dad was definitely sure that he wanted to go the traditional chemotherapy route for treating his cancer and I was not about to try to you know get him to do otherwise I'm not a doctor so I was not gonna I wasn't gonna go there but I knew that I could support him with some home remedies and we you know we talked to his oncologist and we got his oncologist on board with all the different things we were trying and he said you know I don't know if this is gonna help but it probably won't hurt so go ahead and we'll just keep monitoring his progress so he has the you know the chemotherapy regimen at the hospital and then we've had our our home regimen that we've been doing on the side you know that's actually great to hear because I work with a lot of cancer patients as well and so many of their their oncologists tell them no you know you may not do alternative therapies during this chemotherapy you know how dare you don't even come near this stuff it will hurt your chances so tell me actually tell us about that process how'd you how'd you find an oncologist that lets you do this number one yeah that's a really good point because I hear that from so many people that their oncologist said no absolutely not don't try cannabis you know medicinal marijuana CBD mushrooms and they say maybe it will hurt or they just don't have enough information about it to be able to say it's okay and luckily for us we we were paired with an oncologist who was open-minded to it he definitely did not recommend that we do it and he said you know this may not do anything but I'm not gonna tell you know so he didn't we were really lucky in that sense because a lot of oncologist don't do that so what I always tell people to do is when they speak to their oncologist about potentially using home remedies and their oncologist says no maybe you'll agree with this I always say what's the exact reason why they're saying no is there something specific to your condition maybe there is maybe there is a drug interaction maybe there is something very specific to you and you shouldn't use these home remedies or you know if not like maybe ask me on college if you on college us if you could try it for one cycle you know until your next scan and see if everything is still okay you know if there's not a specific reason to you maybe maybe they'd be willing to just let you see how it goes for one cycle so what made you tell us about the your research that said you know we need to look into cannabis and CBD and medicinal mushrooms what brought that to the forefront well one of the things that happened really early on when my dad first got diagnosed is he watched a documentary about medical marijuana and it was and he had just recorded it because he thought it looked interesting he wasn't even interested in it for himself he just wanted to watch it and it was all about cancer patients that were using medical cannabis and having really good results you know not only with their cancer but with their with their side effects of their chemo and so he his ears perked up at that immediately and at the same time CBD was just starting to emerge and one of my friends said hey just look into CBD and cancer and see what you find and I started researching that and I found so many stories of people who were using medical cannabis and CBD who have cancer and were experiencing relief and then I started to look into studies I went to a medical cannabis conference I started to get in touch with medical cannabis doctors and ask them what their experience had been and I just went straight down the rabbit hole and I I was you know I was really impressed by what I found in medical cannabis and then with the mushrooms I had already known that medicinal mushrooms could be helpful for the immune system that was something that was already in my consciousness but I didn't know a lot about them and when I started to go down the route the route of researching mushrooms I found so much information there is about medicinal mushrooms being used in cancer hospitals and other parts of the world and people using it to help their immune systems know is really really interesting okay so explain to people as if they don't know the difference may hopefully most people know so what's the difference between cannabis CBD and medicinal mushrooms and our medicinal mushrooms different than magic mushrooms yeah so cannabis CBD is part of the cannabis plant it's a compound within the cannabis plant and it's a compound that doesn't get you high so THC is the compound that most people are familiar with inside the cannabis plant that does get you high so they're two different molecules that are both within the same plant the mushrooms the medicinal mushrooms all the ones that my dad is taking and most of the ones that I write about in the book are completely non psychedelic so there's you know when people think about mushrooms they usually think of grocery-store mushrooms like button mushrooms portabellos Khomeini's or magic mushrooms that are going to take you on it on a trip there's another class of mushrooms that's considered medicinal mushrooms which is their edible and you know you can consume them and they have medicinal properties but they're not psychedelic gotcha and you want for the listeners you want to name some of those medicinal mushrooms yeah yeah some of the the ones that that I cover in the book and that my dad has been taking everyday chaga mushroom reishi turkey tail is a big one that's one of the first ones that we got him started on shitake is a wonderful actually a really great one for right now - because it's shitake has been shown to be antiviral so that's a really interesting one to look at lion's mane and cordyceps and maitake I believe those are those are all the all the ones and then I do I do cover magic mushrooms a little bit in the book too because there's some really interesting things going on in the search with with psilocybin which is a compound inside magic mushrooms but that's not the main thing that that we've been focusing on but it's definitely an interesting one to pay attention to all right so you keep bringing up the immune system with mushrooms in terms of medical marijuana and CBD where where's the benefit that with this in in cancer patients sure yeah with the immune system with the cannabis what we had found with our research into cannabis is that THC and CBD both have properties that have been shown to kill tumors and and slow tumor growth and they can help with the immune system there's not enough research there yet because they can't do clinical trials on cannabis because of the legality so this is a lot of preliminary research and anecdotal stories so that's with cannabis with the mushrooms all of the mushrooms that I just mentioned aside from magic mushrooms but all the medicinal mushrooms that I mentioned have been shown to have immune system modulating properties so they don't necessarily stimulate the immune system or you know dampen the immune system they balance the immune system so they're they're considered adaptogens so they can just help keep your immune system in balance and all of them are really powerful for you know keeping that immune system strong yeah we I have a patient who oh I think he's now 10 years out from stage 4 pancreatic cancer and he we treated him basically with a raw food diet and a lot of mushroom extracts particularly coleus turkey tail and he's like I say knock on wood he's cancer-free now for 10 years and it's amazing now so I'm a huge supporter you know using plant-based therapy in cancer so and I'm you know again I've seen it with my own eyes and and and written about it in my books so can any of these I know that when you have chemotherapy it's not exactly the most wonderful trip so and a lot of patients complain of pain of GI upset of sleep of energy loss anxiety what's the deal with these compounds with that yeah well the cannabis my dad the cannabis that my dad has been taking in a lot of other cancer patients also take this it's a very highly concentrated cannabis oil that comes in a little plastic syringe and you eat these small droplets of this cannabis oil tiny tiny droplets the size of a grain of rice and that can give you around 50 milligrams of THC and 50 milligrams of CBD if you have a one to one ratio product in one drop so that's a very high dose for people that don't know about 10 milligrams of THC is considered a recreational dose that someone may you know use to get high so 50 milligrams is a really really high amount so you have to really start slowly with that kind of medical cannabis product but what my dad has found with that it is really really taken away his nausea completely he's barely ever had nausea and it's two and a half years in now he's hardly had any nausea his appetite came back as soon as he started taking this cannabis oil which a lot of cancer patients I'm sure you know they completely lose their appetite they lose so much weight and that really contributes to them feeling sicker and sicker as time goes on because they're not able to nourish themselves so that was amazing right off the bat he started to be able to eat full meals again and feel really well and then he sleeps great because he takes a higher dose at night he doesn't like to take a higher dose during the day because he still wants to get things done and not feel too you know impaired by the THC but at night he's okay taking a little bit more and he has slept well the entire time so I think that has been the main that's helped ease his side effects from chemotherapy and then I believe that the mushrooms are what's keeping his immune system strong so he hasn't been weakened by the chemo got you so your book is trying to remove the the drug stigma of cannabis and mushrooms why is that important to you well yeah you know when III quit drinking and quit using all drugs back in 2007 so it's been for me I swore off cannabis and mushrooms back then and alcohol and you know I used cannabis and mushrooms in college recreationally and I never thought of them as medicine I never would have even had a reason to think of it as medicine and so for me that part is really important because my perception of all of this has completely changed throughout my research and I've done so much research now into you know the prohibition of cannabis and you know the legalization of psychedelic mushrooms and it is just it has always been focused around patients and I mean of course there's people that that want to use it recreationally but there has been so much focus throughout the years on you know getting these plants to patients who really who really need to find relief and I didn't realize that before so it's really important to me to try to help to shift that perception to see how these can be medicinal for people and that it's not just about getting high or or going on a mushroom trip it's it's so much more than that so you mentioned that the dose is is enough to get you high what if what if you don't want this effect how do you avoid it yeah so if you're using these in the in the book I do talk about a lot of different wellness wellness topics and not just cancer so for cancer patients specifically if you do want to take the THC and use that medicinally and not feel the high you're just gonna want to work up really really slowly a tiny tiny tiny amounts of THC for most people two milligrams of THC is the the threshold if you go above two milligrams you kind of start to feel those those intoxicating effects if you start a little bit lower and move up you know every few days a couple more milligrams and just monitor how you're feeling that can be a really helpful way if you don't want to feel it at all I would take a high CBD product with little to no THC in it and that will you know give you the medicinal effects of the CBD without without having the THC but they do work better together so if you have a little bit of each in there they boost each other up so if you can tolerate a little bit of THC for the medicinal effects that's great but you don't have to you know and if you're not using it for for your cancer journey and you're using it more for wellness then you can absolutely just take a high CBD product with very small trace amounts of THC okay so let's get away from cancer for a minute and let's talk about wellness so give us your take it's the thoughts or the book on why these may promote wellness how do they pronoun promote wellness and let's go from there sure well one of the things that I found right off the bat through my research for my dad was all these different ways that it might be able to help me to which is you know a totally different realm of why I use them versus why my dad using them but for CBD in particular some of the the main things people use it for our pain sleep and anxiety those are probably the top three and I personally found help with sleep right away and the interesting thing with sleep anxiety and pain is that a lot of times when people can't sleep it's because of anxiety or pain either they they have some painful part of their body and they can't sleep because of that or racing thoughts having having those anxious feelings during the night not being able to sleep so using the CBD can take away the thing that is keeping you from sleeping and help you sleep deeper which is what I experience because I can have anxiety when I'm trying to fall asleep and before I started on CBD I would frequently you know take a long time to fall asleep and then wake up a lot during the night with racing thoughts and when I started the CBD I was really - just sleep better so that was that was awesome and as far as the pain goes there was another kind of before-and-after moment that my dad experienced with CBD which was before he got on the medical marijuana train he was just taking CBD that's all we had access to at the time and what he noticed right off the bat was that his joint pain went away just from taking the CBD he was taking CBD capsules and he said I don't even need to take advil anymore he used to have all this joint pain walking up and down the stairs he's been an athlete his whole life so he says all these aches and pains and he was like I'm I'm impressed by that and he's not one of those people that just gets on the bandwagon quickly you know so he that was really impressive so the pain sleep and anxiety are three things that CBD can be amazing for so let's I have a lot of patients who have tried CBD primarily for sleep and for pain and I would say that just as a general rule 50% of them seem to respond and 50% of them don't and of the people who respond what's been fascinating to me is half the people particularly with pain respond to the topical CBD but don't to the oral and the other half they respond to the oral but not to the topical so help me understand this what's going on sure well yeah a base level of why people respond to it differently is because we all have an endocannabinoid system as I'm sure you know in our body that responds and reacts with the cannabis directly so and everyone has their own dr. Ethan Russo who's a cannabis researcher he he calls it the endocannabinoid tone that we all have this baseline tone kind of like everybody has a different digestive system you know your gut flora is going to be different than mine you have a different endocannabinoid system than me so you may have different levels of natural cannabinoids which we make in our body in your system than I do so the cannabis will well and CBD in particular will kind of raise those love raise the levels of the natural cannabinoids that we have in our system so if someone has a lower amount versus a higher amount they're gonna respond differently which is why dosing can be really tricky and is really really personal with CBD dosing and method of delivery like you said some people will respond to a topical some to a tincture it's all gonna really be based on the person's individual endocannabinoid system so let's talk about dosing and how do you know what you're getting obviously marijuana and CBD are legal here in California and we've we've got these shops almost on every street corner now and how how do you figure out okay well is this stuff legit this stuff came from hemp this actually came from the marijuana plant some people argue no no you got to have marijuana base CBDs hemp CBDs no good come on help us sort this out yeah well you're you're lucky to be in California because I really think California especially at the license dispensaries have have have it figured out in a really wonderful way I wish that all dispensaries could be like the ones that I've visited in California and that's because they have a very wide array of ratios of product ratios out in California with different levels of CBD to THC that you can pick from and choose your your ratio because like I said if the more THC in a product the more you're gonna feel those intoxicating effects and so you know you can have a ratio of eight to one CBD to THC or twenty to one and you can try all these different ratios to see what works for you so I think that's wonderful but to answer your question the most important thing right now when you're looking for a product especially a CBD product that's not from a dispensary because those are unregulated you want to make sure you find you had they have a third-party lab test so that's to show that the amount of CBD that they say is in the product is actually on the lab test so if it says 25 milligrams per serving you want to say see that on the lab as well and you want to make sure that it's negative for heavy metals pesticides residual solvents that could have come through the processing because CBD like I said is totally unregulated right now it's really important to get those lab tests if you do get it from a licensed dispensary they have stricter regulations with the kind of products they're able to sell so you're probably better off that way but even if you're getting it from a dispensary you may want to ask and see the lab test to make sure what what you're getting is really what it says on the label so if I'm on my road trip and I stop at the gas station and they've got CBD oil at the checkout counter which I've seen that's probably not the one I want to buy for sure yeah you really want to do your research and make sure the company is is doing like I said those third-party lab tests meaning someone else is doing the lab tests it's not affiliated with the company so they can't you know make it up and it's and you want to make sure that they're using safe practices and then just answer your question about the hemp versus marijuana right now it's all legal terms so hemp hemp face CBD versus marijuana based CBD is basically just about the amount of THC and other cannabinoids which are other compounds within the cannabis plant that are in the product so if it's hemp hemp face CBD it's basically just very very minimal THC it was going to be in that plant that was grown for that CBD and if it's marijuana based CBD it basically just means that in that plant there was a higher level of THC and this is all you know these numbers are are just kind of you know the numbers that they're using to differentiate these plants but it's all the same comes from the same plant at the end of the day now bring us up to date the DEA once classified this substance as really nasty stuff where do we stand where do we stand with the DEA and where do we stand with the FDA with these substances well right now cannabis is still a schedule 1 drug federally so I hope that that will change I don't know for sure when it will I mean people predict that that will change within the next couple of years CBD in as of 2018 became legal federally which is why you see the CBD boom everywhere so CBD from hemp which just means point three percent THC or less is federally illegal anything more you have to get from a licensed dispensary which will be different in every state some states have Medical dispensaries only which you're gonna need a medical card in order to access those products and so you have to go to a doctor get approved for a medical marijuana card and then you can go to a dispensary some states have recreational or adult use dispensaries which is usually twenty-one plus and right now it just varies from state to state so things are changing everyday my hope is that it will become federally legal soon all right I'm going to throw you a something out of left field what do you know about black urine disease so I have a very good friend and I won't mention his name who ran a company that was really big into CBD and kind of put their whole careers into that and was working very hard with the FDA to get FDA approval for CBD and you probably know that the FAA does not approve so yeah yeah and interestingly enough and I did not know this because he said I'm sure you've heard a black urine disease and he said no I I haven't he says well it turns out that too much CBD can actually affect the same receptors in the liver that tylenol hits acetaminophen and can actually poison the liver and it was discovered because some very heavy CBD users notice their urine was turning dark like they hepatitis and it got the name black urine disease and he tells me and I'm not I haven't talked to the FDA about this that the FDA is worried that big-time CVD use and I don't know the dose may potentially damage the liver and that's why they put the brakes on this but but look it up it's fascinating yeah you know I have seen some things talking about CBD damaging the liver because of studies that they did in my surahs' and from what I could gather from these studies the amount of CBD they had to give these rats was was huge like thousands and thousands and thousands of milligrams of CBD like what it would what it would equal with a human it seemed very very I got huge stretch to me but I will look that up and see see what the what they're saying about black hair and disease that sounds pretty scary and you probably couldn't afford to take that much right so let's get back to that is there is there evidence is there at least anecdotal reports about the amount of CBD that you have to use to be effective you mentioned that everybody's endo cab enoyed systems different so what what what should people look for why do they try what do you recommend yeah as far as dosing I mean I've heard from doctors that practice with with cannabis medicine that some patients do well on five milligrams of CBD and some people do well on 500 milligrams of CBD depending on their condition so it's really really different but what I can say is a starting point for CBD you want to start really low and take it by itself and monitor how you feel you know every 15 minutes like do you feel anything different do you feel you're more relaxed do you feel any relief of pain do you feel any relief of anxiety or whatever it is that you're trying to find relief from and pay really close attention and only take more if you feel no nothing if you feel nothing take a little bit more you could start with like five milligrams even something really small and see if you feel anything if not you know around fifteen to twenty five milligrams is a standard dose for people for many people a standard kind of wellness dose and then if you're having a high amount of pain or anxiety you may need to take you may need to take a little bit more and just kind of move up until you find the relief that you're looking for or switch products if it's if it's not working for you or methods of delivery there like you said before you know topicals work really well for some people for people for pain for anxiety a lot of people like to take the tincture under the tongue because that works usually within 15 minutes or so and you can really measure your dose drop by drop so I would suggest starting with it with a sublingual tincture because that that's how you can really really get a measured dose and say okay I took it's this exact amount where some of the other methods you can't always know exactly how much you're taking okay so we talked about anxiety pain sleep and you use the buzzword the wellness dose of CBD so again help me experimentally anecdotally where does CBD fit in a wellness regimen sure well like I said before we all have this endocannabinoids system in our body that CBD works directly with and we have our own molecules inside our body that work with this same system that CBD can help to regulate those those molecules and they affect things like you know pain sleep the immune system anxiety depression mood they have they have so many things that this endocannabinoids system affects it really keeps you in homeostasis or keeps you in balance so taking CBD as a daily tonic is kind of you know tonify z-- your endocannabinoids system and can keep things in balance many people just find that taking it you know a day as a daily thing whether it's at night or during the day depending how you respond can just make you overall you know feel more balanced got you okay interesting dr. McCullen and I have talked about CBD for sleep when we've been on each other's podcast and we back years ago now did 20 milligrams of CBD sublingual before bed and tracked our sleep with an aura ring which I'm holding up on camera and quite frankly neither of us found any effect on our sleep and as I recall I won't put words in his mouth he even tried it with THC and also found no effect for him or me so we both kind of stopped doing it but you're right maybe our endo cab annoyed system is so phenomenally balanced and I hope it is that maybe we would not see that effect so that yeah or the other part is that sometimes taking certain amounts of CBD or THC can be more wake promoting for some people and especially taking a little bit too much THC can kind of make you have those racing thoughts or can cause anxiety for some people so that yeah I know this it is so so personal and some people will say I take CBD it makes me more focused and awake and some people say they take it and it makes them fall asleep so it's yeah it's an experimental journey alright so I'm sure everybody wants to know because you're a rebel apothecary in' should we be regulating these substances what's the best approach to regulating them if they should be regulated yeah I mean I really think that some of the licensed dispensaries in California are doing a really good job with with the way that they are providing their products I think that cannabis products with THC should be most likely just allowed in licensed dispensaries but I do think it should be federally legal I do think that people that wants access to cannabis medicine should be able to have access to it I don't think it should just be you know sold at gas stations and have these low quality products on the market I think that there should be should be staying third party lab testing for all cannabis products and all CBD products I do think they should be regulated in a way where they have to you know contain exactly what they say on the label so yeah I do I do think it should be legal federally and just as long as as long as the regulations are in place to keep people safe so we're not going to pull up to the gas station and get a six-pack of beer and a brownie to go I would say make your own brownies at home which there are some recipes AHA I knew I could get a plug in for you there you know with the magic mushrooms and legality and regulation they're the predictions that are happening for those are that they'll be legal within therapeutic settings because they are researching them for depression and even you know comparing them to SSRI depression drugs and seeing you know how they affect people so I think that those mushrooms which are currently illegal as well will will be available for use in therapy and I don't think those should just be you know available a gas station either those should be you know closely monitored yeah Mike Michael Pollan ism has made uh I think a very strong point that there is good increasing evidence that there is some bona fide medical use for these I think particularly in depression and yeah we need and you you know you argue for this that we need to look at this as another federally regulated license use of these products for specific reasons all right yeah absolutely and I think you're right and maybe you talk about that the use of these products kind of in your own home is probably at least in our state of understanding not a great idea this should be taken with a practice professional in a setting in a controlled setting what say you I say if we're talking about psychedelic mushrooms I would definitely recommend that people don't just try it alone whether it's with a trained therapist or someone who has a lot of experience guiding people through these types of sessions I definitely think that having having guidances is the way to go yeah I had a personal experience in college where I one of my members in my singing group dropped acid and decided to we were on the third floor of our dorm and he threw up open the windows and decided he was going to fly and luckily I grabbed him by his belt and pulled him back in this is a true story so I firmly believe from personal experience that this should be done in a guided setting yes yes if you take a little bit too much of a psychedelic compound you mean it can take you to places that you aren't ready to go by yourself so definitely right in 30 including the ground from a third-story window yeah all right well Jenny this has been great thanks so much for joining me and where do they find out about you your book your work first of all thank you so much for having me this has been just such a great conversation and I'm glad you have so much personal experience with the topic too that makes it really enjoyable to talk about so thank you my book is called the rebels apothecary so you can buy that anywhere where books are sold except right now we can't go into bookstores so online you can find that my blog is healthy crush calm and you can find me also on Instagram Jenny sanssouci healthy crush dot-com I'm sure there's a story what's the crush well the healthy cards I've actually been writing there since 2008 so I've been blogging about wellness and personal development topics for quite a long time and the healthy crush just kind of popped into my mind the tagline is a love affair with living well okay the way the way I've always felt about you know finding out about new wellness topics and getting excited about them and very very good very good okay it's time for our audience question Sandra Liliana on Facebook asks is keto diet safe for people with heart conditions believe it or not I do use my version of the ketogenic diet for my patients with heart disease who have also for instance diabetes as a co-founding factor and as a cause of their heart disease the key and my ketogenic diet is you got to eat about 80 percent of your calories from fat but that fat shouldn't be ribeye steaks it should be fats from avocados and for you people who are watching I have avocado socks on today and they should be from olive oil and the more olive oil macadamia nuts you eat macadamia nut oil sesame oil the better and the key of a ketogenic diet is to really severely limit your carbohydrates to really leaves and vegetables that are going to carry olive oil and avocados into your mouth that's totally different than a paleo or carnivore keto diet where the vast majority of the foods you're gonna eat our heavy cheese's heavy meats heavy fats you know three bottles of cream every day that's not what I use for my heart disease patients so you got to be careful in the term keto diet there's a good way to do keto and there's a bad way to do keto particularly for heart disease so that's a great question Sandra and thank you very much all right Jenny thank you again and good luck with the book and best wishes to your father how's he doing by the way he's doing fantastic I've actually been quarantined up here with him for the last six weeks and he has felt so good the whole time we keep saying we forget that he has cancer he's been off of chemo now for the past three months I'm just cuz he's been doing so well that his oncologist said why don't we give you a break and his blood markers are in the normal range his tumors have all been stable so we're happy hey very good very good all right keep up the good work great thank you so much thanks for having me take care and now it's time for the review of the week following my most

food but what is the difference between it and marijuana here to answer that question please welcome medical doctor and health coach dr. Elaine chin and naturopathic doctor and I mean my goodness we're hearing CBD THC we're hearing it all the time so it's nice for us to just sit down and get a definition of the difference between hemp and marijuana so I'll start with you doc what's the difference well definitely it's all confusing because you've got common names and then you've got scientific names so cannabis is a scientific name and marijuana and hemp is what we call common names okay so I think let's just leave it that because we're not doing biology 101 today okay and both of these plants or all these cannabis plants produce a combination of THC or CBD and they're the active ingredients that we get the stimulation or the relaxation effects okay so there's a difference though between the CBD and the THC and what would that difference be well one is what we call psychoactive such as the tea tea and one would say CBD is generally the one that's not addictive and is calming and you'd never get really high on that you wouldn't okay but you might from the THC you technically you do let's talk about how hemp impacts our bodies and I'm gonna throw this one to you Elizabeth great so as Elaine mentioned both the hemp and the cannabis the marijuana they all contain cannabinoids so you've got your THC and hemp it's very low less than 0.3% so there's none of the psychoactive effects your body also makes its own set of cannabinoids to bind to your brain and to different receptors in your body so they have the effect of regulating hormones and of maintaining overall body balance or homeostasis okay so if people are concerned with things like nausea inflammation chronic pain then hemp can be a really great solution that doesn't have any other psychoactive effects okay interesting so I actually I got you took a swab from me dr. Chynn just the cheek swab and it was you know it was very easy in order to give me an exam and to test me to see what the impact would be of CBD right CBD and THC okay so we got my exam results everybody and they were incredibly boring what did it say and we're being truthful here yeah I've got the right here she's boring because she's normal yeah yeah it's like cannot be normal metabolizer normal metabolizer average average and average this would have killed me in grade six what that fundamentally means is that if I gave you a dose regardless of it's a THC CBD combination or one or just the other for different reasons I would give you the normal standard dose and I would expect a normal metabolism rate and a normal effect rate of how you break down your THC or CBD okay and then we also looked at the psychoactive our anxiety side effect risk factors for you yeah you don't have it yeah and equally important you don't have the effects of a THC dependency risk factor the reason why you would administer or take part in an exam like that would be in order to see how you're going to take on and metabolize it something like CBD or th there's a lot of patients are wondering this is right for me so now we're gonna bring slides into this conversation to say if you're not sure let's look at your genetic predispositions and we also in our office measures something called neurotransmitters which are your brain chemicals okay is the impact of THC and CBD so we'll know what to give you more or less of okay do you have is there such thing as like an average dose that you would start out with if someone had average results yes so most prescribing physicians will start at the lowest dose and titrate you up just to be careful another thing worth mentioning is the the form that you take it in so if you're taking it sublingually under your tongue or in your mouth you're absorbing up to up to a hundred percent more than if you're taking it orally and you're actually ingesting or eating it the potency in eating something is vastly reduced so the four makes it each difference so what are the main benefits do you think Elizabeth like why would people turn to a CBD or a THC or hemp products yeah the main benefits are I mean all the cannabinoids have different profiles and so the product that you're getting is dependent upon the cannabinoid and also another class of molecules called terpenes upon the profile of those but the main benefits are they're anti-inflammatory they could help with sleep with mood with brain conditions those are the big ones and also gut health nausea you know cachexia or difficulty with weight loss around cancer there's all kinds of benefits and more being released as the data comes out any warnings that people should be aware of before they decide that they want to go pursue this as a you know as a remedy i would say go to a physician that prescribes cannabis rather than just go to a recreational snoring like wing it right make sure you with a doctor they know what they're doing they've done this before yeah and I understand a lot of people are saying well my family doctor is dismissing it it's only because I think they haven't got that time yet to kind of do the research do the information so but some of it is prescribing anything else we should know give it a go if traditional medical drugs aren't working for you okay good that's good information thank you for clarifying a lot of that for us both of you", "o3fYypXjEeM": "hi buds it's candy here today I'm going to be making THC infused strawberry lemonade that I made with distillate so I'm going to be a hundred percent honest with you I'm leaving a timestamp here so you guys can go straight to the recipe because I've made this way more complicated than I needed to be and basically this video you're gonna watch me turn a mistake into something magical I can start feeling the heaviness right now Dex first things first you're going to need a gram of distillate roughly it does all the grams and I'll be talking more about it later on two cups of sugar 1 cup of Everclear this recipe calls for a two-to-one ratio and we're using Everclear to dissolve the distillate that Everclear is something you could potentially skip next we need roughly two cups of half strawberries as well as one and a half cup of fresh squeezed lemons next you want to preheat the oven at 200 degrees and leave it at 200 degrees so that where we don't activate the THC and I honestly just so it you don't need to activate the TFC because it's already there so we just want to make sure we conserve as much as possible next get the 2 cups of sugar and put it into a pan then get the 1 cup of Everclear important to a bowl now we're going to be putting that one gram of distillate into the so that we can start mixing this distillate roughly houses around a thousand milligrams of THC in it the reason I wanted to put it and Everclear was so that it would dissolve evenly and that way I could put it evenly throughout the sugar my original plan was to make granulated sugar about what I did was I messed up and I closed the oven door and then it turned into a syrup so then I decided to work with what I had but yes I will be making an actual tutorial on how to do the guy kneeling sugar now we just mix the Everclear and the distillate together next you pour the mixture onto the sugar you could use a little bit of a wider pan than we did then we mixed it all together and make sure that everything is saturated evenly next just place to the 200 degree preheated oven and set your timer for 13 minutes and check for daily and this is where I messed up my original plan I did close the other door so it did cook down and it created an actual cistern so if you do want to make granular sugar you simply just leave the oven door open so that way it can all evaporated but then you get this golden to cool this is where the real recipe begins you simply boil two cups water and keep it on a very low simmer because you do not want to activate the THC and then I poured the syrup that I created into the water just to dilute it a little bit now here I'm going to be placing the actual instructions on how you can make it a lot easier and save the headaches basically ideally you would just put the two cups of water melt two cups of sugar into it and then add a distillate right on it I actually enjoyed several clearer taste to it it had a little bit of a move to the lemonade so I didn't mind it now it's time for the lemonade start cutting an equivalent of two cups of hats strawberries put them into a little bowl and then start mashing away you could certainly use a blender but according to my friend he doesn't believe in them use this now it's time to roll some lemons and get the juices flowing and start to squeeze the lemon juice in there I did get a roughly an equivalent of a cup and a half of lemon juice it could certainly be anything ever they want and then I add the mashed and pureed strawberry onto it I actually enjoyed the masher because it left Jack pretty pulpy give it a good stir and then we're ready to add the syrup we created put it in along with two cups of water and that's pretty much it after giving it a good little stir simply serve in chilled glasses and enjoy I really enjoyed making this granted it was a headache and a half just because of a failed experiment but you can always turn something negative into a positive and definitely this was a positive hope you guys enjoy it as we did and I'll see you guys later we're gonna feel it slowly I'm happy you", "-N8_yNPgSpE": "what is cbd oil cbd is short for cannabidiol and it's a naturally occurring compound that comes from the hemp plant cbd interacts with our cb1 and cb2 receptors these receptors are instrumental in managing pain stress appetite and sleep and they communicate through the transmission of cannabinoids when it comes to distinguishing cbd oils from tinctures cbd is most often identified as being extracted from hemp through co2 based methods and then added to a carrier oil for a better preservation and easier human consumption tinctures on the other hand are still a form of cvd but the difference lies in what else it contains in the cbd industry tinctures are by definition alcohol-based meaning that its manufacturing process involves distilling hemp into a high proof alcohol through a slow heating process cbd tinctures can be consumed in the same ways as cbd oils and while they typically don't contain the same concentrations as cbd oil they still tend to possess a higher bioavailability and they tend to have a much longer shelf life thanks for watching and be sure to check us out at justcbdstore.com for more videos exclusive

now channel twos Tom Riggins discovered how this non-intoxicating chemical from the marijuana plant is being hailed as a miracle for dogs this is six year old Cosmo he's been taking hemp derived CBD oil once a day to help him with his arthritis and anxiety and new groundbreaking research reveals it can also treat brain disorders and dogs and potentially save their lives few things are more heart-wrenching than watching a beloved dog gripped by a seizure most pass quickly without lasting harm but multiple seizures in a short period of time can damage a dog's brain Alexa Ram Ford told me her dog jigsaw has suffered seizures for two years he will fall over on his side and start convulsing is a very violent thing that they go through about five percent of dogs have epilepsy it's usually an inherited condition but the exact cause is unknown left untreated it can limit a dog's life even cause death they will either be euthanized early because of the seizures or because of the medication side effects I traveled to Colorado State University to meet with dr. Stephanie McGrath she's doing a groundbreaking study to assess the use of cannabis oil or CBD for dogs with epilepsy for many years now people have used CBD in Colorado a state where recreational marijuana use is legal people were using it for themselves for you know their their various different ailments and so they felt that potentially it would be something that they could use with their dog dr. McGrath launched her CBD pilot study was 16 dogs nine of the dogs were given CBD which has a trace amount of THC the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana the results were remarkable about 90 percent of the dogs in the treatment group had a reduction in seizure activity as compared to 43 percent in the control group like humans CBD works on brain receptors and dogs it's somehow alters brain chemistry to reduce the chance of a seizure but exactly how and why it works remains a mystery there's some theories but we don't know how it works but Alexa knows it's helped jigsaw he's now part of a larger study of cbdu sundogs with epilepsy he hasn't had a seizure for a month and a half that's a record for him back here in Atlanta Chelsey Murch has done her own research of CBD with her dog Piper she's been giving her edibles for severe anxiety and it's doing the trick the 4th of July she can deal with the fireworks now the thunderstorms she sleeps through I can take her to a dog park and not worry about dog aggression in humans and man's best friend CBD is helping to treat a multitude of medical ailments pain inflammation anxiety and perhaps most promising of all reducing or eliminating debilitating seizures it has a potential of saving the lives of thousands of dogs on Facebook many of you been asking how can you find out if a product is safe and legal for your pet regulation on this is still murky and a study found that many products sold online are mislabeled always talk to your vet before giving your pet CBD make sure the product has a certificate of analysis and the company is transparent about their manufacturing process also now that we have links to guides and research on our website wsbtv.com in Midtown Atlanta Tom Regan channel 2 Action News thank", "k2yAcaFR18Y": "this question comes from John Doe in San Antonio Texas he asks on me country you chemically separate CBD from THC me please describe how you did this ok so first of all the way it was depicted on the show is [ __ ] that just there's no way I'm actually going to perform any legal chemical separation on TV when there's that scene where I say arguably I just committed a felony that was salad dressing no felony committed hurry in terms of how that actually happens the on the show the the part that was real as we really did chemically separate CBD from THC and provide it to that child we just didn't do it on TV the the method that was used was this it's a chemical extraction using resin and it's the same resin that's used in thinning plate chromatography and what it basically does if you picture a column where you first take all the cannabinoids and dissolve it in a solvent the solvent I prefer to use is ethanol your men use vacuum filtration to pull it through this thick resin CBD travels through the resin faster than THC so if you have a hundred milliliters of cannabinoid solvent and you pass it through a resin like that and break it up into ten milliliter vitals the first few are going to have much more CBD than THC and the last few are going to have more THC than CBD if you do that over and over again you can eventually have a very high ratio cannabinoid even if the original input material was not high ratio that system works it's it's not a good system though Frank there's there's better technologies in play that are now available to us there's another system that uses supercritical co2 extraction and those systems are expensive and not really don't really work in a home lab but if you if you have a supercritical system you can if you dissolve all the cannabinoids into supercritical co2 and then very precisely inch up the temperature and the pressure the CVD drops out of the solvent faster than the THC does and that makes a very nice clean separation the most typical way that a chemical engineer would want to separate the two uses something called vacuum distillation and with that basic the most typical one is called a roto bake and if you picture just a glass ball spinning at very precise temperatures and so the oils inside that ball create this thin film along the side of the ball and it's done in a vacuum so that as the temperatures rise up certain chemicals jump out of the oil solution into the vacuum at different temperatures than other ones and you can very precisely calibrate those temperatures and get the CBD to jump into the vacuum and then be recollected in another vial and that that's really the typical chemists wave so in terms of parents of special needs children are they gonna be able to do this at home know that it's just not a realistic option for the parents of special needs children if you're a chemical engineer you can do it without breaking the sweat but if you're you know if you're just trying to make this medicine work for you and your family the the way to pursue it is to grow your own plants and there now we have these high ratio plants that are perfect just the way they come and you can grow the plant up pretty you know make an extraction using a variety of different methods that we'll cover later and those methods don't require a chemical separation and they preserve the entourage and they they allow for a much cleaner you know better medicine", "WMNFyC15q-Q": "hey y'all it's Cody from sleep populace and in this video I'm going to introduce you to my favorite CBD products for sleep now a lot of CBD goodies in the market promise to help folks slumber but in my opinion these four are the absolute best now what are they well you'll just have to keep on watching to find out all right first things first let's chat a little bit about what CBD is now if you haven't checked it out yet I highly recommend that you take a peek am i what is CBD video which I'm gonna put right there I think yeah and it goes over what CVD is how it feels the research that's been done into its side effects dosage all things like that basically like it's a full rundown of CBD as a compound but in case you don't have time right now or simply don't want to watch it I will give you a little bit of a breakdown right now but what CBD is so CBD or cannabidiol is a compound found on the flower of the cannabis plant it's one of more than a hundred different compounds or phyto cannabinoids contained on the flower and they range and feel and type but the two most popular ones are probably CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol or THC however unlike THC CBD is not psychoactive and it doesn't trigger hallucinations or intoxication it's usually used in oils creams and pills to treat things like joint pain anxiety poor appetite and even poor sleep I should also mention that it's totally legal to buy and consume hemp derived CBD in all 50 states as long as the product doesn't contain more than 0.3 percent of THC alright now that we've gone over a little bit about what CBD is let's get into my picks for the best CBD products we're falling asleep and I want to start with my absolute favorite CBD product for spalling asleep fast which is the CBD PM tincture from CBD MD now this little baby contains both CBD and melatonin so it is literally designed to send you off to snooze town in a flash and when I tried it myself I found that it pretty much did that within five to ten minutes of taking it I felt totally relaxed and like I was drifting off to Dreamland with ease another thing I liked about this tincture was that I didn't really experience any next state grogginess which is pretty unusual for a melatonin based product so if you're looking to fall asleep super fast and need to get up and go the next day I think this could be a great product for you another good thing about it is that a 500 milligram bottle of the tincture only costs $45 which is pretty affordable when you compare it to other see many products on the market next up is what I find to be the most relaxing CBD oil and that's the American hemp oil from American hemp and I say most relaxing because I found that this oil had a really nice sort of like calming effect all across the body within 15 minutes of taking it I felt like tension in my shoulders was being alleviated my mind was quieted and so it helped me to fall asleep at night for sure but I also found that it was really just nice for lounging around the house reading a book watching TV and when compared to other products that I've tested I found that the effects lasted for a longer time around an hour and an hour and a half so if you're looking for a subtle CBD oil that'll sort of carry you through an afternoon or maybe carry you through your bedroom time routine I would highly recommend this one as I found to be very relaxing however it's like caveat is that a 2,500 milligram bottle of American hemp oil retails for $140 which makes it one of the more expensive ones I've tested next I want to share my favorite CBD oil for general use and that's the CBD premium oil from CBD MD now you'll recognize the brand from the first one I shared with you all for falling asleep fast but this one is different in that there is no melatonin here it is all CBD oil and I like it for general use because it helps me fall asleep at night but I also found that it had a really nice subtle relaxing effect during the day you know if it was like a weekend day and I was just hanging out I could take it go see friends go to the gym you know do errands and I found that it was just a really nice Zen tone I was highly recommended for general use and something else I really like about this oil is that you can choose your flavor so you go on the website and they have like four or five different options so you can choose the flavor that's best for you and something else I like about it is that a seven hundred milligram bottle of the CBD premium oil from CBD MD regionals for seventy dollars which puts it in a nice mid range between the least expensive ones the most expensive ones and finally my absolute favorite value buy has got to be the CBD oil from some soil now here as 600 milligram bottle retails for $30 and a 1200 milligram one retails for $60 so it's definitely more in a budget friendly zone for those of you who want to try CBD but maybe we don't want to fork over more than $100 to try it and even though it's less expensive than some of the option other options on this list I'd say that it's just as good it helps me to fall asleep fast and it made me feel really relaxed during the day so I think it's a great option the only thing I really don't like about the CBD oil from Sun soil are the flavor options and either comes in chocolate mint or cinnamon and personally those just aren't tastes that I like well folks that does it for my guide the best CBD products for sleep for more sleep related content and

bad for another episode even though you can't see me today pop peach just like any other week I'm always excited to come back and do another fun episode so my team has gotten together and we've come up with a new episode and guys this one is pretty creative this one is how to make weed moon rocks you heard me pop peeps we're making moon rocks you know you heard everybody in the rap game talking about moon rocks what is moon rocks believe it or not pie peeps pop mom I've never had moon rocks so I think this is probably the second episode if you hurt me last week or a couple weeks ago I mentioned there was something else that I hadn't done before a particular brand I hadn't had I'm not gonna tell you but you should have been watching now you've learned something else pop mom has not had any moon rocks so for all my pop peeps that are new to the show and maybe just you know my regular pop peeps you follow me you may not know what moon rocks are there are rumors that the dispensary Starbuzz 761st concocted them with legendary West Coast rapper corrupt he popularized it and made it popular and it became corrupt moon rocks a version of his trademark version of corrupt moon rocks they are saying that historically they use Girl Scout cookies and you dip it in hash oil with key so if you go to Leafly that calm they'll give you just a little bit of history to rumor history it'll give you some other stuff about how strong moon rocks is but it's pop on 4/20 pop fans I just want to make sure you had a little bit of history there's reasons why people take moon rocks they're very heavily it concentrates super buzz I know a lot of people in a medical community that I know love moon rocks because it takes that pain away once you smoke them use them however it really hits the the place you wanted to hit as far as concentrate on it it really gives you any got advice about a turn so let's get into how to make moonrocks Pat peeps y'all know I love everything simple so when we was doing this video I had to make it very simple for you guys and literally you only need three things and I'm serious my peeps just three things so today we're going to be using will be called in the industry is to concentrate it's a dissonant oil so this is a 0.5 this one in particular shout out to essence dispensary right here in Las Vegas Nevada on the strip they got this to me and just to let you see pop peeps this is the packaging this is the lucid distilled oil so you do need some type of the steel or hash oil for this recipe the next thing that you're going to need is some bud this one in particular I think I'm using biology to be honest with you this one I believe is tested at about 19 percent THC this is fire OG I had it in my mason jar I believe I was gonna cook with it or do something else but we're gonna make it so we had that the next item we have is basically this is nothing but another concentrate it's called kief all of you all have it if you ever grind wheat up in your grinders you have keeping that third chamber and final chamber it's all the trichomes that come off of the but when you're grinding it and all of that so those are simply the three things you need to make the moon rocks today we're gonna keep it simple because I wanted to do something that you all can perform at home and have fun with moon rocks are fun I'm gonna make this one and I'm gonna try to save it but I doubt it but it's nice to do moon rocks holidays birthdays if you're in a lot of pain so let's get started one of the thing pop peeps that you might need just simply some tongs whatever you got pick it up cuz you're gonna have to be able to roll some of this around so you'll see how we're going to use it pop peeps I love this syringe if you're dealing with any discipline oils I'm sure they come other ways with the syringe is a lot more easier because you can kind of like just dab it all over it's sort of like you know so basically we're just gonna take this and I'm gonna sit it down and I'm just gonna kind of run all of my dissolute oil or if you got hash or you know a lot of hash at makers out there and then then I'm just gonna drizzle and as you can see this is gonna be super sticky and we want that because this actual discipline is gonna have it's gonna have Terps in it so this is where I'm gonna come and use these little tongues so I can bring it up to the camera and I think these might be a little too big okay all right so I'm just gonna keep this oil going around as you can see it will glob up on you so just kind of try peeps try to do this the best way you can it's gonna get a little messy and that's okay that's what the tongues are fourth and as you can see I'm trying to do it and do my camera the tongues are like a little bit in the way but nonetheless we don't do this okay so got all that on it and what you want to do is make sure it's on there it's tacky which it is I see I got a little bit of oil here I'm trying to scoop it up and put it on it we want all of that on there and then can we see that I have to oil on there it's really sticky can we see all that stickiness on it so I'm gonna hurry up and get ready to roll it into Keith so that's what we're gonna do see the oil a hash or whatever you use it you're gonna be able to roll this around and a Keith oil that stuck with it and if you have any oil left you can just like totally put that on top sorry pop beeps this is real life stuff and see how that just covers that because of that dissonant wheel or your hash oil is gonna let it just stick to that and I just want to make sure it gets all that Keith and pop beeps if you have a another way that you made move rocks definitely make sure you hit me up we're gonna have a conversation about this young I'm doing this for the first time my team shout out to them coming up with new recipes with a summer to keep you pop peeps interested and keep liking and subscribing but we're trying new things around here trying to keep you guys entertained we know we all staying at home right now I think that looks great I can't believe I just made a moon rock with my papi this is really legendary seriously no but you guys can see my camera guy he's pretty sharp too let me bring that over so far how's that looking in the camera see that the nice thickness and you want to use pop keeps a nice bud that's sturdy you don't want something that's flimsy once again shout out to essence we're getting this oil in and Keith to me and this Lucid oil is perfect for this so if you have any discipline oil use it if you have any cash oil use it it'll work perfectly fine so five peeps as you can see I'm left with a messy needle and one moon rock my peeps this is how simply that was literally a three-step process I don't think I've done anything that's simple but now the next part to this is letting it dry so pop peeps this is gonna dry for a few days and because of editing and video I'm gonna come back at this dry and then I'm gonna show you how to smoke a moon rock all right pop peeps see you when it dries", "k9KWiGlViyA": "in this video I'll explain what CVD crystals are and the three different forms in which you can get CBD crystals I'll then explain the four different ways the four different ways in which you can use CVD crystals and in the description box below I'll give you step-by-step instructions so that you can confidently do this yourself at home so as a member of a cannabis trade association I do need to let you know that we do sell CBD healing UK as a film supplement only so I'll make Normandy still claims whatsoever in this video so I do hope you like this video if you do please be sure to give it a thumbs up and hit the subscribe on so that you can learn live and share you cvd journey with me let's get into the video [Music] so what exactly are CVD crystals well Celie crystals is just a cannabis concentrate that has been extracted from a low THC non psychoactive hemp plant usually it's an industrial heavy plant now there are several different ways in which this can be done it can be done with butane gas it can be done with alcohol it can be done with rosin press extraction but the cleanest and purest form of extraction is supercritical co2 extraction and that is because it requires no additional solvents so when you'll choose a matte CBD product or CBD crystal product what you want to make sure is is that first and foremost it's being manufactured in a GMP facility that is good manufacturing process and that's a global recognized certification you also want to make sure that it's you know preferably organic or if not organic it at least it's free of pesticides you also want to make sure it's free of any residual solvents and they it's got more heavy metals in there as well so you can check this because a good CBD supplier will have had their CBD product tested at third-party laboratory so there are three different forms of CBD crystals it can buy the first is CBD crystal isolate now all this is it's just isolated CBD has been extracted from the cannabis plant that's all it is it's just CBD on its own and it usually comes in a fine white powdery soft consistency and it will say something along the lines of 99% pure CVD or 98% pure CBD the second form of CVD crystals are CBD wax crumble now simply wax cruel when it was extracted from the cannabis plant its extracted also with the essential fatty oils and also the tare paints from the cannabis plant so it doesn't mean that the turbines are what make the cannabis plant smell and taste the way that it does so it does mean that if you choose a wax crumble you can you can add variety in in the widow tastes and smells the third form of CBD crystals is shatter now shatter is a process of extraction that uses beauty and gas to extract it so it gives it it makes it into like a glass type consistency so if you were to drop on the floor I would shatter hence the name shatter there are four ways in which you can use CVD crystals the first way is by mixing it with an e liquid move hemp suggests mixing 200 milligrams of CBD crystals with 10 mil of a liquid now they recommend a 70 PG 230 V G ratio split now PG and VG oils can be bought very very cheaply from Amazon I put the links in the description box below so you would just use if you were doing a 10 ml bottle of e-liquid you would use 7 mil of PG and three mil of VG then all you do is you get an airtight container an airtight bottle and you put the liquids into that with a 200 milligram of crystals make sure it's an airtight container seal it up and then you're going to put it in some hot water now the water needs to be sixty degrees Celsius or around about that now if you don't have a thermometer at home and you guess in then Walter is boiled at a hundred degrees Celsius that's when it hits boiling point sixty degrees Celsius if you were to get in the shower and it was sixty degrees it would burn so you want it to be hot but not boiling so place it in the water and leave it there for about 10 minutes and that's just so that the crystals dissolve into the liquid now I would suggest using that CBD isolate for this form and if you do then you may want to add a food flavoring to it as well there are some people that will use wax crumble in an e liquid but the difficulty with this is is that it will be a thicker liquid a thicker consistency and it can mean that it can clog up the coil in your e-cigarette the second way to use CBD crystals is by adding them to a carrier oil so you can use olive oil coconut oil hemp seed oil and we would recommend using the inside amount of crystal so as an example a thousand milligrams of crystals into ten mil of your preferred oil all you would do is you will put them into an airtight bottle the liquid and the crystals and then you will put it in some hot water and heat it to sixty degrees Celsius just so that the crystals can dissolve into the oil the third way in which you can use feebly crystals is by making your own CBD edibles and it's really simple to do this all you would do is you would get some butter and melt the butter down do it very on the lowest lowest heat let the more butter just gently gently melt then add the CBD crystals the desired amount into the butter what wait while it dissolves and then you can use it to make cookies or delicious cakes or even if you just want to put a little bit of butter on your toast in the morning it's a great way to get CBD into your body the fourth and the final way to use CBD crystals is by dabbing them and dab in CBD crystals is where you would use a specific dab rig a specific pipe that is for dabbing because what the dabbling will do is it will vaporize the crystals so that so that you can inhale the vapor now with this method you can you see buddy wax crumble you can use the shatter or you can use CBD isolate thank you for watching this video I do hope that you've enjoyed it if you haven't already subscribed don't forget to hit the subscribe button so that you don't miss my next video which will be my first time dab in CBD crystals so once again thanks for watching and I'll see you soon", "h_nEypnwdLs": "what's up you guys I'm about to show you the easiest way to make a cannabis tincture yourself at home if you have cannabis distillate at your disposal it's as easy as three three three all you need is three ingredients takes three steps and it should be about three minutes so the three ingredients are going to be is a high proof grain or ethyl alcohol this is a 151 proof so it's seventy five point five percent alcohol by volume I have a gram of some candyland distillate it's a nice sativa sounds delicious from vaping extracts Phoenix Arizona and I have a tincture bottle these are the only three things that you need okay I have an extra one which is a shot glass this is going to help me mix it I'm gonna make sure that it's mixed clearly you don't need it okay now now I've got my grain alcohol I'm going to add it in here I'm just gonna eyeball it for right now hopefully that's not too much because I have a thirty milliliters dropper I'm gonna actually use the tip of this dropper as a stirring stick alright so this is completely dissolved in here you can see the alcohol has turned a little bit yellowish when you do a picture with flower it's gonna be a lot more green so I'm going to transfer this by the dropper so that I don't waste anything alright this was so easy that I overthought the hell out of it and I kind of messed didn't go as smoothly as I hoped but we have a cannabis distillate tincture right here is fully infused it's ready to go was wonderful about the alcohol tincture is that you can add it to just about anything to put it on your skin you can have this thing right here you can put it in a spray bottle I actually got this idea from another youtuber something Canada labs or something like that you can put this in a spray bottle spray it into your mouth okay this takes getting medicated to the very next level and tinctures used to be the main form of ingesting cannabis before prohibition so it's a lot safer it's a lot cleaner this is freaking awesome here's about 15 milligrams it's all approximate I could have been a lot better myself that stuff is strong all right so it's best to actually probably put this in like a little bit of water to dilute it and you look at the effects but I think that the alcohol also helps your body absorb it faster this is overall really just a great thing to do here so next step with this for me is I'm gonna make the most delicious homemade from scratch you're gonna see a medicated soda you can make 450 milligrams worth of soda for like 20 bucks if you have the certain things it's gonna be great stay tuned like this", "ZIZTnOm3E6w": "hey y'all I'm chef Lex grant and today we're going to talk about CBD CBD is a cannabinoid from the cannabis family it is a look like feel like sound like cannabis but has no effects of getting you stoned so ladies you do not get high from this but your body feels all of the amazing effects that it does for you there are different types of CBD there's CBD isolate which is the one that is used in cases of epilepsy it gives you that instant relaxed feeling and it gives your body this all over a sensation of calm which is something that a lot of us need now the other form of CBD that gets you way more relaxed as full-spectrum full-spectrum uses the entire plant including the flower whereas the isolate really only uses like the hemp stock and full-spectrum CBD makes you way more relaxed so yes you will feel sleepy when you have this THC you will feel it more in your body than you would with the isolate I want to give you a list of all the things that it is amazing for it is an anti-inflammatory so CBD oil or CBD honey is used to help with our menstrual cramps our ex and pains our sore spots it is also a vascular relaxant it helps our blood to flow better through our arteries so anybody that is suffering from high cholesterol would significantly benefit from the uses of CBD oil or CBD honey another way that it affects us greatly is helps with our bones prising lee CBD allows the calcium to enter our bones CBD has been most effective in cases of epilepsy in children and in adults as well it is a neurological stimulant a digestive aid this is antidepressant anti-anxiety and it all comes with no side effects you can incorporate CBD oils directly into your food which is what I love to do for my clients now a great way to infuse CBD into your food is to add it at the end of a meal because you don't want to ever get it too hot because you don't want to compromise its value so adding it to the end of a meal has no taste guys not no taste at all you can add it directly to your meal in butter into a sauce you can drizzle it in some salad dressing another way to incorporate it is candy they have CBD candies that you can just pop in your mouth lollipop they have them in a lot of different forms now ladies you", "nhOzQWWsWt4": "[Music] hi I'm Manuel Trevino the executive chef of by Chloe and we're here today to make an A to C V de cookie just one of my favorite friends giving treats it has a little CBD in it to get everybody in the festive mood and ready to have a great time so to start we're gonna go with a little bit of vegan margarine and to this margarine that's when we want to add our CBD oil and to that we're gonna add our sugars so here we have brown sugar and cane sugar start slowly at first we start at a high speed everything's just gonna end up on the walls great so what you're looking for here is a nice well blended product to this we're gonna add our dry our dry consists of flour cornstarch baking soda and a little bit of salt mixing everything together building up from there to about medium speed at that point your cookie mixture will look like wet sand now for the wet ingredients we're just gonna put a little water and a little vanilla extract now we want to mix this as well starting slow building up till everything is well incorporated in the mixture looks fluffy so then I'm mixtures nice well incorporated and fluffy so we'll start with some chocolate chips mix the chocolate chips just - they're all mixed in and incorporated off the bowl now we'll go with the pecans you just want to run it slow until it's all incorporated just a couple turns will do that's good now we do pretzels these are little salted pretzels that we love to use the salt is nice it gives you a nice contrast of the sweetness of the cookie marshmallows these are vegan marshmallows and last but not least potato chips so the potato chips are gonna crush themselves inside so we just fold them in I'll let the machine do the work now we're doing this at the slowest speed possible and that's it we'll take the cookie dough right out of the bowl and so what we're gonna do is we're just gonna grab small handfuls and just form them and then almost into a patty shape almost like little pucks and you lay them on a sheet pan and then we'll bake them in a low oven we bake these at 320 degrees you really don't want to bake anything with CBD in it higher than 320 degrees because you'll lose those wonderful effects that it has so we bake these at 320 degrees seven minutes on one side we'll rotate the tray and bake it seven minutes on the other so they're nice and even so everything kind of melts the marshmallow Browns a little bit you see the pretzel sticking out there chocolate chips are nice and gooey and it's just an overall fun cookie [Music]", "rm1Rkwpo7mI": "how to use CBD isolate as CBD becomes more and more common of a solution for so many medical conditions in the United States and worldwide many people are starting to explore their options with it one of those options is CBD isolates which have a lot of benefits over something like a full spectrum CBD product in the next few minutes we'll cover both exactly what CBD isolate is in the most common ways to use it what is CBD isolated CBD isolate as the name would suggest is just CBD a good isolate product on the market today is 99% pure CBD this means that all the plant material other cannabinoids Terrapins and oils have been removed and all that you are left with is CBD there are a few benefits to this including the complete removal of THC ease of use and dosing and isolates tend to be less expensive we cover all of this in much greater detail in the video that we link to above how to use CBD isolate because CBD isolate comes in a very refined white powder it is very easy to use it is tasteless and odorless making it a perfect candidate for mixing with several different substances the four ways that you can use CBD isolate are ingestion sublingually inhalation and topical application let's start with ingestion this includes any form of consumption where you eat or drink the isolate because CBD isolate is tasteless it is a great to add to water juice tea or smoothies and it is an easy addition to baked goods the only thing that you need to keep in mind if you are baking CBD is to keep the temperature under 350 degrees Fahrenheit generally speaking we don't recommend ingestion for users the digestive tract will lower the bioavailability of the CBD you're taking and you will absorb much less than you would with the methods that we'll cover next our favorite way to take CBD is sublingually this way is a great combination of ease of use and you'll quickly feel the effects just place your dose of CBD isolate directly under your tongue and hold it there for a brown a minute the membranes under your tongue will absorb the substance directly into your bloodstream you can also make your own CBD oil using isolate powder just mix the desired amount of CBD with a carrier oil and place the oil under your tongue in the same fashion that you would the powder MCT olive and grapeseed oil are all good candidates for this next up is an inhalation you can both bathe or dab CBD iceland with the vape you'll need to add the isolate to an e liquid and for both methods you'll need the equipment to go with it dabbing rigs will cost upwards of $50 and vaporizers range greatly if you already own these things and are familiar with the process involved in using them this can be a great option for fast relief lastly CBD can be applied topically this is a very direct method of applying CBD to a sore muscle or joint but the big drawback of the topical application is it the correct dosage is very hard to get to make this simply mix the isolate with a body lotion cream or slab that you are ready use and apply it directly to the desired area of the body you'll want to take close notes as to how much CBD you add to the lotion so that you can get consistent relief or up the dosage if you didn't get the desired effect the first time so there you have it CBD isolate can be used through ingestion sublingually by inhalation and topically do you have more questions related to CBD isolate or CBD in

free because of the oil for some patients who experience multiple seizures a day CBD oil appears to be helping that's what we're seeing in families like the Eagles of Lockhart we do want to warn you though some of the video in the story may be difficult to watch ready oh good try it's always a full house over at the Eagles we are all cnames we are Chad CJ Clark Kellen and Conway and the dogs are chaos and crypto this is Kalin he's the middle child he makes everybody else smile taking a closer look around the house you'll notice things that may seem out of place my life is full of gates and

see here Mama's right here mommy's right here Kalin has a rare genetic condition called KC and b1 and he's one of about 65 kids in the world diagnosed with us they don't fully understand the ramifications Helen but it is epilepsy is a huge component of the disorder Kalin his mother says he started having seizures at about 17 months old and mom was right here from there began having seventy to a hundred of them each day also causing him to become nonverbal those would also knock him down and kind of he would sleep the rest of the day things began to change though once the family got their first dose of CBD oil back in June and has been seizure-free since starting that medication and this past Christmas we went to see Santa what did Santa say moments like these that the AYGO say might have never been possible had they not picked up the phone compassionate cultivation this is Rhiannon families like the Eagles depend on compassionate cultivation for their CBD oil doses the

nothing less than the best form of CBD oil and hopes there are steps done to make sure all organizations are doing the same and he's not alone will that make regulation so we'll have to inspect test make sure that it's not you know contaminated with too much THC Commissioner Miller was very outspoken about the farm bills passing but solely for the sake of helping Texas farmers and families like the Hegel's let me just make this very plain this is not backdoor you know to grow in weed or marijuana that's not what this is this is about producing a lot of products over 2,500 products made from

about a really hot topic cannabis oil and dosing aka I don't like using this term nobody should use it he was the founding father yes but it's not called Rick Simpson oil it is called eco full extract cannabis oil and before we start this is gonna be a video about dosing because there's a whole misconception about it but first I would like to give a shout out to a very special woman who was almost like a mentor and she is my mentor Robin Swan Firebird touch therapy I love you very much and thank you for changing my life for the better so we're dumped we're gonna jump right into dosing okay and there's a misconception and it's you know it's 60 grams in 90 days or a gram a day and you know what I'm sure it works yes it does work but you're gonna you're gonna you're not gonna function Dara Daley okay I don't care if you smoked for 20 years if you wait 100 brownies you're not functioning okay it's tough and this is just a more effective way to have your body saturate in it okay I look really time with the white t-shirt and the chain but let's get into it okay well we like to call it what she started was a thing called micro dosing and this is a really great way to start and this is the way to do it and it allows your body to saturate in this and and it really absorbs it and you're still able to function throughout the day and do your thing okay if you're taking a gram a day you're gonna be tripping balls somewhere in a bush or they're gonna just be sleeping a lot like you know mommy likes her valium like one it always you know you don't want to do that okay my crack jokes in this video once in a while they might not be appropriate but I hope you still share it so I had this little card here that they made I kind of memorized it but if I look down at it you know don't frown upon I still know what I'm talking about okay so like it says here you know first of all I want to say make sure you know you're getting there there are people out there who mean well and they want to make this oil and they're making they're freaking backyard okay good stuff ain't cheap and cheap stuff ain't good remember that know what you're getting you want that golden color you know that golden tint to it you want to you know if you can get the lab certificate you know that'd be great tells you the percentages you want that eighty percent mark it's it's gonna work okay um and like they said you know you want to work up to 150 to 300 milligrams a day you could do the math you know five grams syringe obviously if there's 800 gram 800 milligrams in here per you know the deal will get into a to another time that'll be another video okay so this is called micro dosing okay and instead of starting instead of starting in the morning we're gonna start at night and we're gonna work our way backwards and we'll get into that so pretty much it's gonna it's called micro dosing I know if I said that already we're gonna you're gonna unscrew this top you're gonna take a toothpick you're gonna slide that just a tip just a tip like in high school you take the tip the cannabis oil eat it whatever your bedtime is an hour before bed I'll take it 10 p.m. by 11:00 I'm feeling nice it goes off you're good to go do this for two three days if you feel like it didn't affect you then you could skip the two to three day thing you're gonna go for hours prior which would be if you took it at 10:00 p.m. it would be 6 p.m. so now after that third day take that toothpick again do it at 6 p.m. then again I 10:00 p.m. go to bed guess what do that for 3 days another 3 days you're gonna jump another 4 hours prior that would be 2 p.m. I had to look down I'm bad at math ok so you're gonna start at 2 p.m. with the toothpick 6 p.m. with the toothpick 10 p.m. with the toothpick your fourth dose for fourth dose will be at 10:00 a.m. okay after another 3 days your body should be getting accustomed to that toothpick dose and guess what you can either decide to continue this way start it backwards or the scheduled start at 10:00 a.m. and work your way down to 10 p.m. and see how you feel and increase the dose every week you know I think I go I just go just go with it you know if you feel like oh I really didn't feel that drop at 6:00 p.m. take a little bit bigger drop at 2:00 p.m. but remember you can always eat more you can never eat less okay so be cautious what you're dosing cuz this stuff is strong okay and it is you shouldn't have any crazy side effects except rip balls and you know if you get really that hot you can end up like panicking I don't know or sleeping too long forget the picky kiddo from school I don't know whatever you got going on with yourself okay but this is called micro dosing okay it's 2019 no disrespect to the founding father and all this stuff that's 60 grams and 90 days is just a whole new thing you know and and don't forget this is the this is the basic way of taking it there's other ways to use cannabis oil dabbing it smoking it guess what for lung cancer yeah people vape this stuff and it's healthy for you okay and for cancers like I've seen like in the lower back or like cervical : you know prostate suppositories okay look into this stuff do your research me and Robin are gonna go on Facebook live and do our own videos and we're gonna get deeper into this stuff but this was on my head and there's a lot of you know you know they people don't know they're not educated on it you know and this stuff is medicine and it helps people and it helped me and I'm excited about taking it this way because the other way I could not do I was getting too high I couldn't function throughout the day I got fat it's not a bad thing some people need to gain weight and eat I'm back on track now

they are how they occur in nature how we're extracting and isolating them so the first thing that I'd like to bring up is terpenes are actually a variety of organic compounds and these organic compounds are naturally occurring in all sorts of areas of nature the main things that you will find terpenes are in is cannabis conifer plants like pine trees spruce things like that are one of the most abundant sources as well as a variety of insects and even some mammals now it's it's interesting these compounds because they serve a variety of different purposes so in plants they're mainly signaling it's signaling for a predator to stay away or for a sweet you know delicious smell to be eaten by a certain mammal and there's kind of this underlying communication standard with these terpenes amongst everything in nature and in the universe and if you start looking at these compounds and where they're placed and what they do it's it's quite amazing the the matrix of what's there with that all being said you have other terpenes that are produced by insects that are produced by by mammals and these are actually produced in some cases biosynthetic aliso in many cases humans produce terpenes biosynthetic Lee meaning within our own body they come endogenously produced and our signaling receptors not only are they signaling mechanisms but they're also biosynthetic building blocks so a good example of this would be squalene and the steroids that are derived from that and things like that you can look into that but it's very very interesting so understanding these molecules and what they do is very very important to understanding why they're valuable to an extraction process and why they're valuable to the cannabis plant and with understanding all of this it's really important to know that they are anti microbials they're anti virals to help keep your body into a homeostasis into that balanced state that we've spoken about before so in many many cases there actually have a lot of similar properties that they exhibit on humans the same way cannabinoids do and the key to all this is that you get this entourage type effect and it's almost like nature's produced and packaged to this perfect little plant and this perfect little combination of terpenes and cannabinoids in order to aid a variety of medical conditions and bring your body back into balance now what we do at precision is we're highly focused around the extraction and isolation of these terpenes the extraction of isolation of these terpenes is a very special process because the molecules in and of themselves whether they're monoterpenes or sesqui terpenes or triterpene there's a bunch of different types of these terpenes but in general they're all very delicate when I say they're very delicate they're very prone to degradation they're very prone to really being diminished or their molecular structure being changed with any sort of heat any sort of excessive stress will say to that molecule without getting into overly technical terms so what we're trying to do from an extraction process is extract these very very gently extract them in a very low temperature and and do that in a manner that is going to actually render that molecule unadulterated in that extract well we commonly end up with as a process for extracting cannabis and extracting these terpenes that uses a very light hydrocarbon mainly butane or propane but most cases moving more towards a propane dominant blend not only we do do we do do that but we also actually take the plant and harvest the plant when it has peak terpene content and the peak terpene content ultimately is extracted with these very light hydrocarbons and we get this soupy sort of saucy type mixture and the key to this is being able to remove that solvent because that solvent is a very light hydrocarbon for example propane can boil off at negative 41 degrees and what we'll actually do is we'll just apply a very light heat so it'll be enough heat to remove the solvent but not enough heat to disturb or degrade any of those terpenes ultimately we can centrifuge those terpenes and separate them from the cannabinoids because the the two layers obviously separate able by the centrifugal force and we have a purified terpene compound and there can obviously be further from chromatography purification steps and things like that but isolating and extracting these cannabis-based terpenes are a key value stream and it's interesting to know that you can isolate these terpenes from many different types of plants now one of the things I said when we when we started out was conifer trees were one of the most abundant sources of terpenoids or terpenes in the in the world right now that that we know of and basically you get very high levels of Alpha and Beta Pi Neen that's why a pine tree alpha and beta piney and you can obviously put that one together but they also have things in there like limonene and lena law and these other different terpenes that kind of make this perfect package and turpentine ironically is mainly alpha and beta pining and it's used as an in cleaning a cleaning agent antiviral antibacterial and insecticide and for a variety of other uses works really well as a solvent in addition so the question is why can't we just isolate these terpenes from these high concentrated areas like say conifer trees and combine them back into cannabis well the answer is is that many state laws actually restrict the use of outside terpenes or non cannabis derived terpenes to be entered back into a cannabis based product so for example in states where we have like a metric system that has a traceability throughout the entire we'll call it seed to sale of the of the cannabis value stream they want those terpenes to be extracted isolated from the original cannabis crop and them to be re-used and re-entered into ultimately that suite of products that's going to be sold so understanding terpenes what they are what they do this level of science how to extract them isolate them refine them very very important to an extraction business it's very very relevant particularly in the cannabis space because most states don't allow for the use of outside terpenes to be reconstituted into a cannabis based product for traceability purposes so with that all being said I really hope you enjoyed our short talk today on terpenes hope you have a better understanding of what they are how they're relevant how they can aid in human health and conditions and how they are specifically relevant to the cannabis industry and how we use them within canvas thanks so much for watching we'll see you on the next video", "pMMfp7lEyB0": "CBD is taking over the wellness industry the Center

and most importantly to the bold claims behind these wellness products actually stand up to science CBD more formally known as cannabidiol is the cannabis extract but no that doesn't mean it can get you high so that's THC THC is the primary psychoactive component in in cannabis THC and CBD are both cannabinoids in the cannabis plant they differ because THC is intoxicating and CBD isn't and it has

health shops and pharmacies CBD oil is one of the more popular ones but it's also made its way into shower gels bottled water gummies and even tampons people claim that the wellness DVD helps with general aches and pains anxiety daily stresses and sleep but there's little evidence to say that it actually does help with this and now the NSA is cracking down on the sale of wellness CBD products under a law they're classified as normal foods this means the claims that they make and how safe they are need to stand up to testing before they can be authorized for sale there have been a few studies now where they've taken bottles of CBD from health food shops and looked at what's inside them and sometimes they found that there's actually teach seeing them little or no CV some of them have alcohol in them to the level which they could be considered sort of an alcoholic beverage if companies don't adhere to these regulations by March 2021 then their products could be taken off the market the second type of CBD available is medical CBD there are a small number of approved medicines currently available on the NHS that contain much higher doses of CBD and there is some evidence to show that they may be effective at treating certain conditions that's epidural X which is approved for two very rare childhood epilepsies and then there Sativex which is licensed for like pain and spasticity in multiple sclerosis only doctors on the specialist registrar can prescribe these on a named patient basis with very little scientific evidence about the effects of wellness CBD and what the shorts or long-term risks are the Food Standards Agency says healthy adults should think carefully before using it and if you're pregnant breastfeeding or taking medication you shouldn't take it at all I also think that when it comes to CBD there's probably a really big placebo effect out there sort of global placebo effect because people are looking for something in their life that can really help them and they're not getting that from their general medications so then they're turning to sort of herbal medications and those having medications should be a quality standard that we all

make from hemp that we grow on our farm so I guess it's a little bit like asking a barber if you need a haircut but all I'm gonna do here is share my story and what's worked for me I also want to say that none of this is medical advice this is just my experience and what's worked for me in my life with that being said let's get into it so I think I first started noticing feelings of being down when I was probably 9 or 10 and I didn't even know what it was at the time and it wasn't until I was maybe 12 years old I started getting these really sharp shooting pain headaches like I called them lightening headaches B couldn't know what was going on and so I remember 12 years old and I started researching on the internet what this was and I finally found a website that said that it could be related to depression and before then I had never even considered myself to be depressed I'd never even never even crossed my mind started talking to somebody and then they said yeah I think you should go on some medication so they prescribed me Zoloft and they had to keep upping the the medication dosage and they said if this doesn't work for you we're gonna have to put you on antipsychotics luckily that dosage of zola off actually worked enough to where we didn't need to take that route however you know the depression didn't go away it was always sort of there and just maybe wasn't as deeply felt and as I got into high school I discovered cannabis and that actually really helped with with depression and insomnia fast forward I go to college I begin drinking I begin experimenting with pills like benzodiazepines which is an anti-anxiety med things like klonopin which changes your brain chemistry to where your brain is then dependent on these drugs it can't really function without them you know that kind of led me down this path of of substance abuse and dependence and and felt no joy and felt no hope and was just at about his rock bottom as I think I could give where I just realized that something needed to change and I'd say that's probably the first step is determining that you want to change and I know people are gonna say it's not that easy look I know it's not that easy that's just the first step it's just creating that intention in your life to say but I want to take steps to try to get better the first action the simplest action that you can take is start eating healthy I cannot stress how important that is and and I didn't realize it for so long it I was eating crap I was I mean in college I was living off of things like hot dogs and pasta and beer and that was like my diet I mean it was just putting crap food I mean 25 cent burritos just the worst food you could buy just putting it into my body and always wondered why I had no energy and why I was always depressed again this all comes down to brain chemistry and your brain chemistry is very dependent on what you're putting in your body if you eat like crap you're gonna feel like crap so the first and simplest thing you can do is change your diet and eat something I eat a diet that is rich in fresh fruits and vegetables lean protein just overall healthy food limit the junk food limit the alcohol intake and you will notice a big difference right off a bat that's the first thing easiest thing you can do step number two konna ties into that and that's to get active to exercise and if you can if you can do that exercise outside I think there's an added benefit to being outdoors breathing in fresh air and and being under the Sun the Sun is good for endorphins and I want to say when I was getting off of all my medication like you can't just cut it off cold turkey so this was a battle for me I had to go down sliver by sliver and the way I did that was I worked out like a maniac I mean I would go to the gym and I would just go hardcore for about two hours completely exhaust myself but what I was doing and I didn't even know it at the time but what I was doing was rebuilding my brain chemistry I was releasing those those chemicals naturally so that I didn't need to get them from a he'll third thing I would recommend is to develop some sort of a spiritual practice now this could be prayer meditation this could be sitting quietly in the woods this could be finding a way to just serve others I believe serving others is a form of spiritual practice and what that does is it gives us a sense of purpose it gives us a sense of meaning it gives us a sense of community and you know it kind of helps tape the focus off yourself which when you're in that state can really be useful because when you're in it it's like a negative loop pattern you've got these negative thoughts that just keep on circulating and they wear you down I mean it's just non-stop all day from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep and a lot of times you can't even sleep because they keep on going around and around I've been there I understand I mean just trying to do random acts of kindness if helping people at this point is a little overwhelming I get it that's why I would suggest develop some sort of a meditation you know there's so many guided meditation practices out there which I think really help until you can kind of get into the flow yourself and and just trying to establish that sort of calm that peace that quietness fourth thing that I would recommend doing is surround yourself with good people you need to surround yourself with positive influences and you need to cut out all the negative influences in your life now that might sound really harsh these could be people that have been friends or even family members that are maybe just constant negativity and you know they say misery loves company but all that company does is keep both people miserable so you know it almost becomes a codependent relationship with two miserable people keeping each other miserable and that's not good for anybody focus on the people that bring positivity encouragement and love into your life you know find people with common interests join a meetup group volunteer your time we as humans need that we are tribal people and we need support from other humans especially in times of hardship and that's why I would say definitely find a group of people that can encourage you and kind of pick you up when you get down now the fifth thing I want to touch on is supplements now I left this one for last and this guy's back to our original question can CBD oil help with depression CBD oil is a supplement right and so I feel like yes it can absolutely it can but it's not a magic bullet what CBD oil does for me now personally when I take it is I typically feel within about five to ten minutes and it's sort of just this like it'll kind of just bring things a little bit more into focus calm my mind down enough to where I can think clearly and that's the thing we go back to these negative loop patterns when you're just in that you can't see any way out of it and you can't even begin to uncover what's really bothering you so none of this is a magic bullet none of this is easy but what I believe supplements like CBD oil could do is just maybe give you the tools to begin unpacking some of that baggage and getting in there and and really trying to figure out what is actually going on and it's really hard to do when your mind is just in these constant negative loop patterns a lot of times people from the outside might look and say what's what's the matter what's what's so bad and the thing is is they can't see it because they're not in it and you can't see any way out of it because you're so stuck in it you have no other perspective I want to make this very clear that if you are suffering from depression it is not a sign of weakness in fact it's oftentimes a sign of greatness and I believe that once you do overcome it you have a tremendous amount of power from having gone through it so keep that in mind you know I am the person I am today because I went through these things and I wouldn't change it because to be honest I never thought I could be this happy I mean I really didn't and so for me I'm incredibly grateful for everything in my life because I've gone through it because I've seen the other side and know that things do get better and I want to encourage you if you know somebody who is currently suffering with depression please share this video with them and I'm gonna put my email in the cop in the description down below and and anybody out there who's watching this who's suffering with depression shoot I want to help I want to help other people get through this because I feel so incredibly fortunate to have come out on the other side and I want to do whatever I can again if you're interested in CBD oil you can check out our website at Caribou tanika's com I don't care if you buy it from us or even if you take it at all I think you can get through this without it but I do believe that it is an extra tool that can help kind of get things moving in the right direction find a trusted source make sure that they're doing testing make sure that it's a pure product and and just kind of go from there because there's a lot of snake oil out there and I wouldn't want you to to try it and then say oh this doesn't work and you've wasted your money I know that it works but you got to be getting it from a good source anyway thank you guys for watching I'll see y'all next time if you guys like this video and you'd like to see more like it leave us a comment down below and don't forget to hit the subscribe

of training and education for nature's ultra one of the questions we get asked often is how to properly store our CBD oil this is a great question finding a high-quality CBD oil can be difficult and when you finally discovered a product like nature's ultra you want to know how to store and preserve it in this week's episode of CBD 101 we will go over proper storage of CBD oil how should you store your CBD oil research indicates that exposure to light can be a significant factor in the deterioration of cannabinoids this is why we keep our CBD oil in black bottles to preserve the potency keeping your oil in an airtight bottle and storing it in a cool dark place is vital to ensure the product stability the refrigerator can be a great place along with a cool dark pantry cupboard cabinet basement or cellar now you might be wondering does CBD oil need to be refrigerated not necessarily but it is the easiest way to store your CBD oil without working for somewhere else cool and dark what is the shelf life of CBD oil after it's been open a CVD oil real maintainence cannabinoid concentration and overall profile for around six months assuming you store the bottle appropriately the CBD oil expire now you might be asking the DPD oil expire the answer is unfortunately yes there is a period in which the product is expected to remain potent after this period the CBD oil may change sense and consistency as a result your products will no longer provide the benefits at once did we recommend using the product within six months of purchase how to tell if your CBD oil is bad if your CBD oil smells different is cloudy and a different viscosity to normal you should probably think twice before using the oil if you've been using CBD oil for any extended period you'll be able to tell the difference we hope you found this video informative and are more aware of the proper storage methods and maintenance of your CBD oil as always please like and subscribe and leave your questions and comments below we'll see you next time 101 [Music]", "FymCTaaSMDY": "my name is Willie Christie and we're in the kitchen at civilized HQ down here in Venice Beach California we're in the kitchen today because we're going to make some DIY topicals this is going to be an infused topical infused with cannabis obviously doing topicals yourself gives you the freedom to choose you know the quality of flour you want the ratio of THC the CBD you want or other cannabinoids if they're present the scent you like the medium you like you may be vegan you may not want beeswax in your products so this just gives you all the control for the topical we're making today you're gonna need coconut oil shea butter flour cheesecloth a container to put it in and a stove and an oven Toodee carb and to infuse the oil with step one is going to be decarboxylate in your flour what decarboxylated does is it activates all the cannabinoids in the flour if you've ever eaten just raw flour you'll know that you don't get high from it it doesn't have the same effect as inedible versus when you cook it in a brownie per se that's when the psychoactivity starts happening and essentially all that does is remove a co2 molecule from the THCA and it becomes THC so today I've got some Henry's original ritual flour it's CBD flour which I really appreciate around 2530 dollars for this eight it's got 500 milligrams of CBD in there so let's get started so in order to decarboxylate your flour you're going to grind it up and put it in the oven I've got 3.5 grams here I think that's a good start for today you can do more you can do less just do your thing so here we're grinding up the flour this just increases the surface area it helps all the heat reach all the areas of a bud we've got our pile of flour we're just going to spread out a little bit we're gonna try our best to preserve the terpenes by cooking it at a lower temperature we're at 250 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20 minutes so now we're putting it in the oven we've got our timer set and we'll check back in in 20 minutes all right so we've got our decarboxylated flour and the next step is putting that into our coconut oil so we got a cup of coconut oil we're gonna start simmering this we're gonna melt the coconut oil and start simmering the flour into it so right now I'm just getting the coconut oil down melting it so it's a liquid the last thing you want to do is burn off any cannabinoids keeping temperatures low and a very low slow simmer is gonna make sure that your cannabinoids are retained and chillin inside of the coconut oil because not only will it be weaker if not completely inactive it'll smell bad it'll taste bad if you're gonna eat it much more to the consistency that I like that's smooth smooth liquid so now that our coconut oil is melted it's clear and it's liquid and its pretty and it smells good we're gonna put our decarboxylated flour into the coconut oil you ready and this this is where the magic happens this is maybe the most important step this is the easiest step to mess up if you let any of this get too hot it's gonna be you're gonna be starting over which nobody wants to do so what I'm doing is just carefully monitoring this a little bit of movement is good that means that he is moving things around but as soon as you see bubbles or smoke or anything like that then it's too hot so patience is key we're gonna start the timer again for 20 minutes and we're just gonna simmer this it's been 20 minutes on the stove I've turned the heat off and we've got ourselves a hot hot little hot little pot of pot alright so the next step we're going to put the cheesecloth over this bowl in order to pour our cannabis in there or cannabis oil and all this cheesecloth is going to do is catch the flower and so we'll just be left with infused coconut oil [Music] so putting on these gloves really lets you get the rest of this oil squeeze out it's gonna be warm it's definitely warm but the gloves help and you're just gonna squeeze that little bit of oil out all right so we've got our coconut oil in our Bowl and our next step is going to be adding the essential oils and adding the shea butter to thicken it up and make it more of a topical I'm not one to put pure coconut oil on my skin some of you might so you can really just stop at this step if you just want to smell like weed and coconut oil these next couple steps are just to kind of make it more for your mom or more for your own personal touch or say you don't want to walk around smelling like a toasted cannabis plant so I'm adding our shea butter in there now so I am now going to put some essential oil in here hopefully that's too much because I love this smell yeah that smells good so I'm just gonna separate these into different jars one of my favorite things about using cannabis flower especially prepackaged cannabis flower is you can use the jar again this is what I'm going to store the topically [Music] very DIY usually you would want to use a funnel or a baster or maybe a pot with a lip that you can pour but you know you work with what you got okay so we've got three different jars they're all the same right now and if you're happy with how it smells if you just want to do one scent for yourself then that's it you're just gonna put these in the fridge and let them chill and once they're cool it's just as just like any other topical but today I'm just adding some more little lips so I've got some Jasmine essential oil put a couple drops and let's see if it's beautiful I think some bergamot oil would be real nice and this one one two three four stir it these little babies up make sure that oil is evenly distributed well the only thing left to do is cool it down here we are four little jars yeah that's it folks we've got our DIY topicals if you're already getting flour at a dispensary if you already live at home if you already cook for yourself it's really not too extreme to be able to put those two together and make yourself a nice little topical or lotion you can add whatever else you want aloe vera gel vitamin E anything else it's the choice is yours as as we say here your body your choice", "7_m23_-ER6w": "by now most of us have heard about the benefits of using cannabis for sleep but with so many products on the market to choose from these days how are you supposed to know which is best in this brief video guide we break down the effects of thc and cbd on sleep and offer our opinion on which type of product is best if you're looking to achieve a sound healthy night's

offer hundreds of doctor reviewed articles on all things cbd and cannabis anyway back to the topic of using cannabis for sleep with the meteoric rise of cbd products in recent years one of the most common questions we hear on a day-to-day basis is should i be using cbd or thc to help me sleep we know from published studies that thc can act as a strong sedative in fact a study published in the journal of pharmacology biochemistry and behavior found that the more thc a strain has the better it will work in helping patients get to sleep the reason for this researchers suggest is the way thc interacts with cb1 receptors in the brain however this same interaction is also what's responsible for the psychedelic high that thc produces for many users a potent high can result in increased levels of anxiety and paranoia which is exactly what you don't want when you're trying to get some quality rest another issue with using thc for sleep is that it may have a negative long-term effect on circadian patterns a person with normal sleeping habits will start to feel sleepy based on their circadian rhythm which is essentially an internal clock that tells us when we need to rest when it's time to sleep the body produces hormones and chemicals that help settle the central and peripheral nervous systems into a state of rest under long-term influence of thc chemicals like melatonin can actually be overproduced meaning that you start to feel sleepy in the middle of the day this of course can entirely throw off the body's circadian rhythm and can result in erratic non-productive sleep patterns using cbd for sleep on the other hand appears to have fewer negative effects instead of acting on cb1 receptors in the brain cbd appears to work on 5ht1a receptors these receptors influence the body's reaction to the presence of serotonin which is the precursor to melatonin the body's natural sleep compound in a recent study published in the permanente journal researchers observed that cbd produced improved sleep in nearly 70 percent of subjects suffering from inadequate sleep patterns a separate study published in the current psychiatric reports suggests that cbd holds promise for rem sleep behavior disorder as well as excessive daytime sleepiness for these reasons it appears that cbd-based cannabis and hemp products may hold the upper hand among patients that are trying to improve their nightly sleep patterns it's also worth pointing out that cbd helps tremendously with things like pain and anxiety both of which can have a major impact on short and long term sleep quality of course finding a quality reliable cbd product to use for sleep is no easy task in today's oversaturated market whatever you do be sure to look for a reputable brand that offers verified lab reports with each product they sell this will allow you to get realistic unbiased information on what's actually in the cbd product you're using also be sure and take your time read reviews do plenty

a really important factor to understand there's lots of different ways to extract we personally here at sweet hill start with the flower obviously and the flower within it has a lot of different things that make up the total mass of that flower now in the extraction process we're actually going to go in and reduce what's in there and take certain fractions out so I'm going to start talking about this at the different layers of what we were moved so starting with the hem we we begin the process by removing the natural terpenes and this is the smell these are the fragrances these are also used very medicinally pineys and other things that are out there that are terpenes these are the same terpenes you're going to find in mother nature so we extract these terpenes through a steamed distillation process that steam distillation process removes the terpenes from the plant in its steam is then cooled and turned back into a liquid that liquid is then deposited into a flask that flask removes because the turkeys are actually lighter they're going to float to the top and the water has been heavier so it's going to follow the bottom and create a separation layer that separation layer gives us our pure terpenes at the top and water at the bottom from the terpenes we then take that same flower substance and we bring it in and we put it through an ethanol extraction process the ethanol extraction process produces what we call a crude oil that crude oil contains a lot of components that we'll talk about in a minute but the ethanol process that we use we reduce we take the flour we put it into a reserve that reserve has alcohol that has been kept at a temperature of negative 40 degrees Celsius to negative 70 degrees Celsius we take that alcohol and wash it over top of all of the flour what happens the reason that we winterize it we take it through this process is because everything that is connected to the water molecule is frozen at that negative forty or that negative 70 degrees temperature that frozen matter stays tied to the plant we remove the trichomes the CBD the cannabinoids as a whole and then as we remove them we do still end up with fats and waxes and lipids and anything that sticks to that water molecule sugars and other things and that's what's in here this Prudhoe oil is filled with all the chlorophylls and all those dark contaminants we'll call them for right now and they're really not a contaminant they could contain omegas and other things that you would actually walk with in your diet they're very healthy as a whole but in our industry we create a lot of cosmetics and human consumables and it's very important to have a purity level we extract crude but then we take it to the next level of purity that next level of purity ends up being a pure gold this is 98% ca\u00f1on total cannabinoids so we'll have CBD and THC in a CBN CDC's all of the whole major and minors of that profile what it doesn't have is terpenes right now because we pulled those terpenes out previously we put those terpenes back into the natural oil that was created and that's this process is done through a wiped film process that white film process what what happens there is we take that crude oil I showed you a moment ago we put it into a charging flask so we charge the flask the flask is charged with our crude oil and it's heated to a very specific temperature that temperature then allows that crude oil to move through the neck of the short bath white film system it's then white onto a glass surface that glass surface is at a very specific temperature that temperature is where we're going to pull the fraction out of the total mass whatever is at that temperature whether it's the THC CBD whether it's the fats waxes the lipids whatever we're going after with process that is the temperature that we would set the system to and so whatever is at that temperature turns into a gas and then it is immediately cooled on the finger in the center of the system it's turned back into a solid and that solid drips down into one of these flasks at the bottom whatever is not at that temperature falls to the wayside and we then rerun that through that material and that's why we do three to four runs at our material which gives us the purity of that 98% and so coming back to our perfect gold battling with that perfect goal what I was talking about we remove our fats waxes lipids sugars anything that sticks that water molecule and that's what this is this is a byproduct of that end result and so it's as hard as tar when it's heated back up to a pretty significant temperature it becomes a very different consistency but the cool thing about this by-product that most people are actually throwing out or getting rid of we end up reusing and we reuse it in one of our newest hemp sustainability products this head of sustainability product is what we call our fire firestarter it has an incredible acceleration rate when it doesn't affect it we are producing these now for the open market it doesn't have any smell of hemp because in fact we've gone through and refined everything and pulled everything out of that that plant matter and and you as you see within the plant matter that we have in in some of the different points of this video the everything's been stripped of it there might still be some proteins and there's fibrous mass and there's a couple of other components but we've removed all of those extra the CBD and cannabinoids the fats and some of the chlorophylls and the waxes and so forth and so that's what this by-product and made of it's made of our heavy dense fat flexes and removed product and it's made of hemp that has been run through this entire process which gives us the ability as farmers to be able to take advantage of more than just the CBD that we're growing this plant is an extraordinary thing and it gives life back to the entire cycle and by us just having plant matter that we use in a compost pile or plant matter or fats and wax and lipids that are end up being some type of a by-product that we have to get rid of in some other way whether it goes out to it a plant or a disposal location so we're trying to use that hundred percent of what's there and in fact we continue on down the story and we've started to make hemp plastics these hemp plastics these are our sample lotions or our travel sized lotions these lotions are made from an hemp plastic that hem plastic is dejar we know that we're giving out a lot of samples we know that we're providing a lot of awesome products to people and so we don't want to really pollute the environment so we've gone ahead and made em plastics additionally with our hemp plastics we've made a mask so this mask can be reused the filter that's actually in the mask is additionally hemp it's a head mat and it has charcoal in between it so two layers mashed together to create a filter and this mask was a prototype that we put together we didn't end up going to market with it just simply because there's been a lot of business for the companies that develop this extrusion process they've been focused very much in the medical industry with our current pandemic obviously in producing plastics that meets the need of of those organizations as opposed to the head plastic so it's become secondary in the markets demand and then finally we have one of our other byproducts or one of our other products that we're working towards and it's our hempcrete the hempcrete is very strong very resistant now hempcrete is just a combination of a couple of items normally concrete has sands and silts and rocks and other things that are within it in this case we only have about four major components water my and all of that's mixed together and it creates a nice strong structure however is not as strong as the concrete that's in our driveway in order to accommodate that I think you have to be able to mix in a number of other items to be sands and other things so unfortunately I'm not a concrete guy I am just a heme farmer and and we're trying to find other ways for our farmers to be able to reuse these byproducts

CBD stands for cannabidiol and it is one of the roughly 500 compounds\nfound in the marijuana plant. CBD is perfectly legal and is actually the second most prevalent\ncompound found in cannabis. Falling short to the more\nfamous and semi-legal THC or tetrahydracannabinol. These compounds are very\nsimilar on a microscopic level. Both CBD and THC share the\nexact same molecular formula. C21H30O2. Both compounds also interact\nwith the CB1 and CB2 receptors, which are found on the\nendocannabinoid system present in all mammalian species. But while THC is known for\nits psychoactive effects. - I feel like a slice of butter melting on top of a big ole' pile of flapjacks. - [Narrator] CBD acts\na little differently. Early research shows that\nit has the opposite effect on dopamine compared to THC. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter associated with the feeling of reward\nthat you get when taking drugs like cocaine and heroine. THC causes dopamine activity to rise, but CBD seems to decrease its activity. Some researchers think\nthis raises CBDs potential for understanding and treating addiction. Early studies have shown that CBD is also fairly helpful in\ntreating anxiety, insomnia and sleeplessness and chronic pain. There's also early evidence\nthat CBD can prevent seizures and some forms of severe epilepsy. And can help normalize brain\nactivity linked to psychosis. In the last few years, its found its way onto\nmillions of people shelves and topical, ingestible,\nor oil-based forms. It's still the early\ndays for CBD, but so far, the world health organization\ndeems it pretty safe. Cannabidiol is, for now,\nlegal and potentially a pretty helpful compound\nfor a lot of people.

go ahead and hit that subscribe button now let's move on to the video first you're going to start off with your infused butter i did not clarify this butter so the little gunk that you see on it is from me not clarifying it and i really kind of don't care to clarify it but that's just my business if you guys want to know how to make and fuse butter definitely comment down below and i'll get up on that thing girl so now i have melted down my infused butter i put it in the microwave for like 30 30 seconds and just stir it around and it should admit that melt down very easily so i'm just going to go ahead and use my rubber spatula and stir this around and i'm going to portion out my chips so there really isn't a cut dry type of cookie cutter when it comes to dosage it really just depends on you and how much you would like in your bags of chips i'm using five milliliters um that's my little dropper that i'm using right there to determine what my dosage will be per bag um this bag i made i believe i made like two to three ziploc bags of this and i was able to determine that each bag had about 23 me um milligrams of stuff inside of it and to me the average milligrams are five so i think that's kind of pretty good so whatever you use your cbd for you don't want to overdo it but you can definitely kind of calculate that if you guys really want a detailed video on how you can calculate this then we can go from there but you just want to make sure that all of your chips are nice and covered not soaking wet but covered enough so everything can infuse well then you want to lay them out very like in a single layer i really take my time to lay them out in a single layer because if they're on top of each other you're going to kind of like if that defeats the purpose basically so look you want to put a nice even roll do not overcrowd your pan like we never do easy bakers then you're going to move on to the next step now that i have them in a single layer i'm just going to add a little bit more butter on top of them because i'm a little extra and i like for all my foods to be a little extra when you think you got enough i'd like powder you don't so i'm going to put this in a 350 degree oven for three minute intervals taking them out after the three minutes just to really check on them to make sure that they're not burning because maybe they will burn when i tell you they will burn grow they will burn burn so i'm taking that same rubber spatula that i use to mix up that butter and just kind of mixing them around again just to make sure that everything is evenly coated and nothing is sticking down to burn then i'm going to go ahead and place them back on in that oven for another three minutes until they get to the smell in the infusion that i like [Music] and what you guys are seeing here i'm just trying to make sure that they're not on top of each other so much just trying to make sure they get that even layer as much as i can and i end up placing them in the oven about three to four different times for those three minute intervals [Music] just between you and us girlfriends good judy's honey if you guys get this video up to 4 000 views i can definitely show you how to make cbd infused butter tinkeridge as well as all so let's just get these views up and you guys will know how to make all of these good stuff [Music] so now i'm just going to let them dry for about 10 minutes but now that i'm done with that i can pick it up and you guys still see there is a crunch still to them it is not soggy like some other people they're very crunchy they're very nice and just to add up that flavor i'm just taking a little bit of chips putting that in my food processor grinding them up until kind of like powder because i want that heat just to be like packed out um the people that i invite to my parties and different things like that they like as spicy they like it crunchy hey so that's what i'm doing right now just giving it just a little razzie dazzy and i'm putting this over on top of it so when it dries it all just dries together now this is definitely an optional step but that's just something that i personally like to do and i also just put a little bit of tinkering on it too just to make my people really feel the effects of that cbd so that's just my preference with what i like to do but you are going to just let these come just dry a little then place them in your bags [Music] [Music] [Music] so you guys this was only about two bags i just did two bags and i thought it had 23 but with two bags it was at least 45 milligrams inside of both of those bags hannah so girl we were we had fun period [Music] and i'll also show you guys how i heat seal my bags too i just take my flat iron since i do not use them for my head and i just put it on the bags just like that i do this when i use my nerd ropes and heat seal my nerd robes in my cheetos in the smaller bags i just didn't have any smaller bags so i used ziploc bags this time but as you guys can see it is sealed you don't have to worry about anything becoming stale and that's what i love about these cbd chips and cheetos i can just heat seal them in and i can just get them at any time they last for as long as chips last on the chef baby when i tell you girl thank you for watching the video and i will definitely talk to you on my next one", "IIqB1wlfboE": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much

process that starts it in the growing fields News 5s Jessica barreto joining us live with more on that this morning Jessica free right now I'm at the fields at Veritas Farms where we're surrounded by

Colorado Jessica barreto used by", "jWXqzj_TP0Y": "cbd oil was marketed as skin care products for everything from acne to wrinkles in any case is any advantage possible let's get into some facts about cbd oil and skin care what is cbd oil cbd otherwise called cannabinoids is a non-intoxicating component of marijuana or hemp plants cbd is removed as a powder and is normally blended in with oil like olive hemp or coconut all of which improve application and viability hence the name cbd oil cbd oil and skincare won't get you high because it doesn't have the mind-altering properties of marijuana's thc content it's extracted from the blossoms and leaves of the hemp plant whose thc's are standingly low it's important to realize that cbd is not the same thing as hemp seed oil which is another great ingredient for the skin the two are regularly advertised interchangeably however cbd always concentrated in cannabidiol and hemp seed oil only contains trace amounts of cannabidiol if any research has established that acne is an inflammatory condition albeit different components trigger acne we realize that anything you apply to the skin can decrease the irritation and help relieve skin this is where cbd comes in as some suggest it's likely to noticeably lessen breakouts especially acne related redness numerous studies have demonstrated that cbd oil has mitigating benefits when applied to the skin this makes cbd a solid ingredient for acne prone skin while it's calming benefits help responsive skin look and feel good research also shows that cbd can possibly decrease excess sebum oil production possibly due to its balancing effect on the flow of skin's oil however most researchers contemplating cbd conclude that the more definitive logical examinations are expected to affirm these underlying results since it originates from a plant it's not surprised that cbd oil has antioxidant properties the antioxidants in cbd topical use helps lessen the visible signs of aging by neutralizing free radical damage and decreasing the appearance of inflammation cbd anti-aging creams noticeably reduce issues like wrinkles skin dullness and reddy skin tone another advantage of cbd oils that has been found to have huge alleviating properties its significant skin calming and skin normalizing effects can help limit issues identified with skin sensibility including redness and reactivity since all skin types are influenced day by day by ecological stresses cbd's alleviating component can help hold everybody's skin in line cbd skin care products or topical cbd products are intended to permit you to retain cbd through the skin this is an ideal choice in the event that you don't care for the taste of cbd tinctures or e-fluids focal points of cbd include being easy to use much the same as taking a container it's very simple to apply a cbd balm or moisturizer to your skin most cbd products items have a pleasant scent which means there isn't any unpleasant medication like scent for you to stress over after use it may have extra advantages in addition to cbd's suggested advantages for anxiety stress and chronic pain it may also be helpful for treating acne numerous cbd skincare items may be seen as great choices as they can hydrate the skin and for store maturing a huge assortment of products are available past the typical lotions in medicine you can buy cbd shower bath additives or other relaxation products all of which can make utilizing cbd simpler like with different types of cbd there are a few disadvantages to be aware of for instance bioavailability and ingestion speed can defer like of oral cbd topical cbd isn't the most ideal choice if you want to absorb as much cbd as possible absorption rates aren't great and it could require some investment for the cbd to arrive at top concentration using these products can be inconvenient and in the case you're not used to utilizing skin care bombs and other topical products becoming accustomed to rubbing a cbd treatment gel or ointment into your skin could feel unnatural and inconvenient some topical cbd products can move to other people like with other topical meds it's possible for topical cbd products to transfer to your partner as well as your children through skin contact thus it's essential to be cautious while applying topical cbd well everyone we hope you enjoyed

more to stay up to date make sure you hit that subscribe button and ring that bell we'll see you next time you", "ZFOxN5w9gno": "seems like everybody's talking about we these days I hear about all the time it's legal gettin legalized in lots of different states in the United States both medicinal and recreational marijuana and now we're getting the CBD oil and CBD stuff everywhere people are taking C V D supplements people are putting it on their skin people are giving it to their pets what is the deal with this stuff we're gonna answer those questions and lots lots more hang tight we're getting into it right now have you been paying attention to skin care releases over the past year you may have noticed a huge influx of products containing CBD as an ingredient and it is estimated that it will be a 16 billion dollar industry by the year 2025 but should it be is this something that you should invest your money in first we need to decide what this stuff is and what it isn't so all hemp is cannabis but not all cannabis is hemp so hemp is something that is within the cannabis category what you're gonna see on labels is cannabis L sativa and that is the hemp plant it is a low THC version of the cannabis plant within this plant there are over 80 different cannabinoids these things that you can extract from the plant in order to get different effects so one of them is CBD one of them is THC THC is the one that gives you the psychoactive effects so when you've got hemp seed oil it has a very very low percentage of THC it actually needs to be below 0.3% in order to even be legal now what is CBD it's cannabidiol is how it's pronounced and cannabidiol will not get you high in that is not its purpose that is not what it does that's THC it's completely separate and because of that it there's no restrictions on flights you can't get arrested for having it in your car like it doesn't matter where you live in the United States it is a federal law that it is legal as long as there is that 0.3% were less of that THC in the product and products being sold on the shelves are legally they have to have less than that point three percent if they have point four percent they're considered any legal substance now because this is brand new companies are really taking advantage of the lacs rules when it comes to CBD some people are taking hemp seed oil and they're marketing it as CBD but if it just says hemp seed oil it's not CBD there's no CBD in just straight hemp seed oil and because of that you're not going to get the the alleged benefits of the CBD if you just get hemp seed oil so the biggest thing is that the CBD oils have anti-inflammatory properties so anytime you have inflammation whether it's dry skin eczema psoriasis that is supposed to be helped by CBD oil another big one is as an acne treatment because of the inflammation that occurs naturally with acne there's actually a second thing that they're studying as far as the acne treatment which is it's supposed to help control your sebum production that extra oil production so that would help people with acne as well if it were true again there just isn't a ton of research on it right now they're also saying it in certain concentrations it may have pain-killing properties similar to like a bengay kind of product and it also may have antioxidant properties that would help with fine lines and wrinkles and skin dullness it also seems to be safe for sensitive skin which is another big thing so if CBD can do all of these things it'll be magical but again the research just isn't there this is where a lot of companies have gotten into a lot of trouble because they're putting these claims on these CBD products that it can do all of these amazing things that are medical claims but these medical claims haven't been proven they had there's no scientific research behind it and as a cosmetic you can't make medical claims so people weren't claiming this is crazy I know but I mean you think about people that were reading this and thinking that this was a hundred percent true that it could treat conditions like Parkinson's disease Alzheimer's disease depression anxiety PTSD cancer treatment a treatment for schizophrenia for eating disorders and addiction these were real claims that companies were making about their CBD oil products and the FDA and the FTC had to step in and be like no no this is not ok and they got letters kind of cease and desist kind of letters to stop making those claims and they had to pull their products from the shelves so yes this ingredient is FDA approved but just because it's FDA approved doesn't mean it actually does anything the research just isn't there yet in 2018 the farm bill passed and what that did was it loosened regulations on hemp-based products that's why we're seeing this big boom in the market right now my husband and I went down to the Cosmoprof event down in Las Vegas and we went to well I went to a CBD base it's called a cosmetologist and that one was the most full packed people with so many questions I mean it was like wall-to-wall people there are so many brands that are looking at adding CBD to their products and my purpose for making this video is just to let you know that yes it could do lots of really great things for your skin but you also could be throwing your money down the toilet by buying them so you have to realize when you purchase something like this that it may or may not work and if you have tried CBD based products I would love to know your thoughts about your personal experiences with them down in the comments below in the collective brain of makeup awesomeness where we help each other not to buy crap and to buy things that are totally worth it please leave those thoughts because I would love to learn from you and your experiences I do have a CBD product that I'm trying from makeup revolution if there's skincare revolution line right now I haven't seen anything magical with it but I also don't have psoriasis eczema acne those things that will probably be really showing visible results if they were doing those things I'd be able to see them more than I do with my fine lines and wrinkles so let's all work together to learn more about this topic I hope that you found it helpful again anything you want to add leave it down in the comments thank you

at home in this video we will show you a quick easy vegan gummy alternative that sets up in minutes and only requires a few ingredients plus whatever cannabis distillate or infused oil that you'd like to use because this recipe is vegan and it's so simple these gummies do have a different consistency from traditional gummies but for those with dietary restrictions it's a great option this recipe is going to use a powder called agar agar or it can be simply shortened to agar this is a powder that you can buy online or from health food stores agar is derived from a type of algae so it's vegan friendly anyway let's get into the process first get all of your ingredients together you'll need one cup of fruit juice this will be the base of your vegan gummies you can use any flavor but in this video i used a tropical mango juice blend you can get creative and use any type of juice that you want and the type of juice you use will determine the flavor and color of your gummies two tablespoons of white sugar or agave syrup this will help to add sweetness 2 tablespoons of agar agar powder and this is what gives the gummies their gummy texture liquid or powder lecithin this is an emulsifier which will help to combine your oil-based cannabis concentrate and the juice which is water-based since water and oil don't mix on their own you probably need to use an emulsifier in order to make sure that everything gets mixed well you'll also need an activated cannabis concentrate you can use a cbd oil a thc distillate infused coconut oil just anything that's an activated cannabis concentrate here are the directions in a small saucepan whisk together the fruit juice with sweetener and agar agar powder bring this to a simmer while stirring constantly simmer for 3 minutes while whisking to avoid lumps remove the mixture from the heat and allow to cool slightly add in as much or as little cannabis oil as needed i'm adding about 100 milligrams of cbd to this batch and then you'll stir it well use a dropper that comes with your gummy molds to fill the molds with the liquid and place in the fridge for 30 minutes to an hour remove the candies from the molds and enjoy be sure to store remaining gummies in the fridge in an airtight container for up to two weeks discard them if any of the gummies show any signs of mold before two weeks this recipe is so easy anyone can do it if you have a hard time finding a gar powder or lecithin for this recipe we recommend checking with your local health food store or supplement store so there you have it infused vegan alternative gummies at home using just a few ingredients but this is just one way that you can pre-dose your cannabis oil into bite-size little bits and store them in the fridge so then you'll have them there ready for you whenever you want them let us know what you think about this do you like making edibles at home would you ever try this recipe have you tried this recipe let us know what you think in the comments and don't forget to subscribe for more cannabis and health related content we'll see you next time bye you", "ZkiJLLvT4vQ": "welcome to true buds tv we're going to be making some can of sugar today and this recipe is very simple but the tincture itself that we're using takes some time but first and foremost we're going to do our two cups of our pure cane sugar and one cup of our tincture this is a two to one ratio a lot of people call this tincture green dragon as you can see it's got that nice color to it this tincture in particular is 35 milligrams per tablespoon so in the full eight ounces we're looking at about 560 milligrams for the whole batch the t check 2 helped me know this now if we use a stronger batch i did that was 131 milligrams per tablespoon we'd be looking at about 2 100 milligrams for the whole eight ounces so you can see the difference and you can see the importance of the t-check too to know the potency i'll put a link below if you want to check it out learn a little more i'll also put some videos showing how i use it as well but let's go ahead and put the oven on to 200 degrees once it's heated up we'll go ahead and add that in there the sugar and the tincture this is important you want to leave the door ajar 15 minutes or so will come back besides leaving a door jar you want to make sure you have good ventilation a fan blowing because it gives off some fumes and then we'll go stir it also important we want to make sure that we're being very careful especially if you're using a gas stove like myself a gas oven electrics recommended but i like to live dangerously so keep stirring it every 15 minutes so and then after the first 45 minutes i'll stir it about every 10 minutes so you'll see it keeps getting you know a little more grainy every 10 minutes or so come back and do it and the total amount of time that elapsed during this whole video here was about 2 hours and 45 minutes is how long i had it in the oven as you can see it's going to keep getting more grainy and grainy as it goes in longer and longer the total amount of time that elapsed in this video right here that i sped up is about two hours and 45 minutes then i went ahead and just strained it through just break it apart so it's nice and grainy and looks like sugar when it just started just a different darker color i hope you like this video and i'll put links below to all the videos you need to make this and some other videos that you might be interested in like how to make simple syrup which we'll be doing with this can of sugar thanks again for tuning in to true buds tv it's always good to have you here let me know how you like this recipe let me know what you want to see next you", "G7GklIFSSAU": "Delta time THC there's now a huge thread regarding that and don't live when we had a fun little for it for take a little for a layman's background so so depending it specifically yeah everybody's different and I'll all have their own special ways of a festival but depending on where or how the different pieces of the molecule are laid out you you know the difference between THC delta 9 and T and C a is th EA has a carbolic acid molecule in its tail and no boxer group carboxyl group and in another thing there's Delta 88 C which has gotten really popular with the water clear trend and people would you know they would throw a bunch of carbon and some acids and stuff into their boiling flask and then they'd start distilling it and it's coming out beautiful water clear they sent test results or they'd sent testing labs and then it's yeah like very low percentage of Delta 9 THC eventually we started they got standards for Delta 88 C then started quantifying that there's more THC in us that there is but then there's still a little missing piece that like you'd see you know 60 to 70 80 percent cannabinoids and this water clear stuff that you know it's all cannabinoids and there's plenty of isomers and stereo isomers of THC and these are things that happen through different reaction their reactions that happen through heating and the presence of acids and bases and given the different environmental things or what was sprayed on those so that that can actually be a big indicator what's happening into the reactions as well so so good all that distillation method we're like you put stuff in a pot it boils at different temperatures and all that well throw catalyst in that pot that you don't know is there like you know people spray put sulfur on their plants or people you know certain things get sprayed on plants and when you concentrate that thing in a hot flask under vacuum where fires and fire attack there's a whole bunch of ways you could do that but to go back to Delta 10 Delta 10 is simply an unknown type of THC that until recently was it is yes in different income in different ways they affect all three of those can affect a single person completely different no they've been discovered but they're only being mass-produced yeah they yeah macula vanilla and knows about him and he has and we are just now mass producing them because we have the freedom of the market to start and start playing and then we also have the competition in the market to try to make the clearest most beautiful looking oil which you know well it used to be Delta 8 th DW I mean I we can I know use I'm saying historically historically when they first started getting this perfectly clear bottle of oil it was Delta eight and they would do this refluxing carbon acids and but but but yeah and that was it then they would use a catalyst in the flask that they were boiling in one we're talking about people who appreciate the clarity that clear net the secret is that the consumer is that an expert consumers okay and what's your opinion on consumers have been led to believe that the clear the oil is well and and and that clear could come from a lot of different things it can be cut with another clear oil that it makes you know just diffuses what color is in there there's a lot of things that can clarity is definitely an indicator of purity though it was an indicator but the a slight yellow amber tint the these are little little atomic level refractions that are happening with chromophores that hold into the the tail end of the molecule these these are what a chromophore is uncle mela these they're they're basically like atomically small things that will refract light at a different color so you have so by breaking that bond you you like that's when people distill with certain things on the flask you can break that at that chromophore bond and it you can also break that bond by through chromatography as well which people eventually developed a method for Delta 9 THC does anyone clear water clear yeah and it that was just a method of taking a single pass distillate and then passing it through a series of usually magnesium silicate or floor so actually and then but different color remediating adsorbents that were also being used to remediate past asides and they still are used to remediate pesticides and it just happened that you make water clear delta 9 after remediating pesticides properly as sometimes depending on the oil and what kind of colors and that the condition THC 8 and 10 have been known for and their-their prevalent in the same way that THC is in Canada like there is it kind of like a is it a totally different cannabinoid that is in very low percentages in well zombie health of ours not so much on the cultivar it's a reaction through processing so you're not gonna have those you're not gonna have a bunch of Delta eight or delta10 any in your flowers you're gonna have it in a kind of a crazy their isomers correct and it was the one thing everything we're talking about is like the ability to narrow the bands of what you're capturing well if you cuz you're right it's it's these little slices but the only way that's possible is that we've now created these massive machine that will process a lot so we get bigger trends you know we we see information come out of plant material from farms all over California grown differently going different ways different yields different strengths different compounds or the makeup of the cannabinoids in that specific strain like it's really interesting we get to see a lot of those so at the same time as we're narrowing the focus and really like getting to chop down into you know now we're we just picked up a machine that will separate out individual cannabinoids so you can collect them individually it's a centrifugal partitioning chromatography this company called rodeo cron they catch it you guys okay yeah sorry THC eight and ten are kind of like mine or like other cannabinoids that we've known about it but haven't been able to isolate so on the market are we gonna eventually see like THC eight tinctures and THC ten tinctures in the same way that we see other kind of my hair cannabinoid totally and we've been seeing mostly we've been seeing a lot of THC eight cart hay in cartridges and there is subsequently a decent amount of Delta ten THC that's in there well no they're just calling it if you're buying a card off the traditional market you they're saying it's one thing but who knows what really is in that cartridge right so but because you can take garbage oil and by attorney by doing this process to convert it to Delta eight clean it up to make it look clear a lot of guys do that ii buy a really cheap oil get a little bit of a fraction of that off and this really nice-looking oil and then it's just cheaper the way that that's produced then I like water clear Delta nine it takes extremely expensive absorbance and a process to do it with the Delta eight you throw some activated carbon in their flask and if you distill right here you can get water clear I mean there's a few other a few other parameters to change but you just dump a bunch of garbage in your flask and then just mix it with your oil and your oil is coming out nicely that was what a bunch of people were doing to fix their dark oil especially in the early day when people really weren't distilling very well", "wsjRME4Hjrk": "[Music] don't forget to like the video and subscribe to our channel to see more videos hello everybody welcome back you work berber cannabis in today's video i want to be showing you how i infuse our gummy recipe but first if you wouldn't mind if you are new here to the channel please consider subscribing and if you've already subscribed thank you very much I appreciate the support and if you wouldn't mind give the video a big thumbs up so folks today I'm gonna be running through a lot of the ways you can infuse our gummy recipe that which we just posted at the same time as this video now the reason being is I want to make sure that that gummy recipe stays by itself and that I'll show you where along the line you could infuse that with that being said guys there are so many different ways to infuse this gummy recipe so I'm gonna take you through my favorite way and then bring you all the way to my least favorite way and I'll kind of explain why one is better than the other at least in my eyes so let's get right into it let me show you how I infuse our gummy recipe alright folks so now we're gonna talk about how I infuse our gummy recipe so first and foremost a couple of the things that I will be using you can find on Amazon and I'll leave all that information in the description below so hopefully you can check it out if you guys are interested in any type of flour or Keith don't forget you can always email me and that will be in the description below also so today folks we're going to talk about my favorite way to add CBD to our Gumby recipe and that is with Keef now this is a premium product for the cannabis plant you have to extract it whether it's dry extraction you can wet extract it although it's a lot more time consuming but you can go ahead and check out our video on how to extract Keef but this is by far my favorite way to add Keef to that gummy recipe now it has to be d carved and typically what I like to do is use 1 to 2 grams depending on how potent you want it and UD kharbut for approximately 15 minutes on two hundred and fifty degrees in your oven now the one downside to using Keith in the raw form and just adding it to the gummy recipe is that it will float to the surface and it kind of creates a weird surface on the gummy it's nothing you can't taste it really but it does create that weird textured surface only on one side of the gum the other side is perfectly fine and of course guys when I talk about infusing the recipe I'm gonna tell you exactly when to infuse it now this goes for everything that I'm going to show you today but the number one time the best time to infuse the gummy recipe is after the blooming stage so you were looking at our gummy recipe it's it's at room temperature for approximately 10 minutes and then we start to heat it up during that heating up process that is when you would add the key for any of these other things that I'm gonna go over so one of the ways I found that you could get rid of that texture in the gummy recipe if you use Keith is you can use sunflower lecithin or vegetable glycerin now when it comes to using these two things it doesn't really affect the recipe too much but it will dissolve the kief and the way you do it is you use about two tablespoons you put it in a little bowl like this you add all your ingredients you add your one to two grams of d carb Keith you mix it around as best you can try to dissolve it and then again you add that during the heating up process on the stove and you let it mix in and you continue to continuously mix it so this is by far my favorite way just adding raw keef I like to keep it on natural the texture does not bother me but if you want it like a store-bought gummy you're gonna have to use one of these two things I actually prefer the glycerin for the gummy recipe over the lesson but the lesson is well known for absorption so either one of these will work guys it's just your personal preference and what you like I know some people have a little bit of an allergy to vegetable glycerin not a lot of them but some do and so they go with less certain I I do not like the soil a certain I go with the liquid sunflower less it's in you can get granular but I don't really see the point in the granular for this process so definitely get the liquid less certain so that's that and using Keef and how and how I use Keef in the recipe the next thing I'm going to show you is an efficient way to add CBD to our recipe but it is not my favorite way by any means it gives a harsh flavor and honestly guys it's a little dangerous and you got to know what you're doing with this stuff and if you guys haven't checked it out yet go ahead and please do so on our how to make a CBD tincture recipe you can find that in the description below but here folks is our alcohol tincture now for this you will use a half a cup and you will cook it down on the stove and when you're cooking it down on the stove it becomes kind of pasty towards the end what you're doing is you're cooking off the alcohol because you don't want to really be making alcohol gummies and so once you do that you again you add it during the heating up process when making those gummies now when you add either is the key for the alcohol tincture when you're heating up that gelatin you want to really mix it in just really mix it in get it three to four or five minutes whatever it takes there's no rush just make sure you don't burn the gelatin keep it at a medium low temperature and just make sure that it's getting mixed in but I'm not even going to show you this today guys because I just do not like using this I did it at home I do not recommend it it's not my favorite way to do this at all so I will refer you to our friends over at the magical butter machine if you want to learn how to cook down your tincture but again guys you need a pan need on low temperature on a stovetop preferably electric folks and if you can do it outside it's best to do it outside the fumes are rough on the smell and it's just a really harsh way to do it but this is an efficient way to add CBD to our gummie recipe now these are the two ways that I really do not like it changes the entire texture of the gummy and it changes the flavor of the gummy and it gives it like this weird oily flavor and so folks you can use MCT or olive oil that's been infused already with CBD or you can use coconut oil and you're also adding about two to three tablespoons of coconut oil or MCT oil to the gelatin recipe you can add more if you want again that really depends on what you like and how strong you want it now here's the problem with using oil it changes the entire texture of the gummy it tends to float around and make it weird it also comes with a very similar harsh taste that the alcohol tincture has not as harsh and definitely a lot safer to use but the gummy itself it just doesn't look good and it doesn't really taste that good it's just not a great way to add it but however you can do it but it's just not the way I recommend it and again I'm gonna go back to D carb Keef and the lesson or glycerin if you want the nice looking gummy but you can just add straight Keith it's just the safest way to go folks and again if you are interested in Keith or flour to make your own at home feel free to email me that information will be in the description below but that is how I infuse my gummy recipe that is on our youtube channel and that link will be in the description below also I hope you guys liked this recipe and how we infuse our gummies if you guys have any questions feel free to send me an email leave a comment below and I'll get to you guys an answer them to the best of my ability again I'm not an expert at this but this is what I found works for me at my home and I hope it works for you guys too and that's all I have for today folks I hope you enjoyed today's video and as always take care and I will see you in another video", "r_mF84ZqsdA": "hey guys it's Nick with precision here and today I'm gonna be doing a product overview of our CDU 3000 distillation apparatus and I have mark here from you labo that's going to talk about the paired youlab low temperature controllers with the unit so some of the great features that you're gonna see on this CDU 3000 are the 10 litre crude feed vessel and the great thing about this as well as it has stop [ __ ] at the top so if you've got a big barrel of crew that you want to feed in on some sort of automated system or with a dosing pump you can do so following your your feed vessel down this is of course jacketed now the entire path of this system is heated in order to avoid the gumming and the residual sort of clogs that you would get in any other distillation system with this you're going to feed your distillate in through your through your feed pump down here and you can see your adjustment for your feed pump right here now you can feed slower or faster depending on how you want your product to come out you want it more pure do you want it less pure do you want it at you know up to 4 litres an hour throughput or do you want to run it a little bit slower so you're trying to do single pass these are a lot of parameters that you can play with with this system in order to optimize your distillation how the original crude oil was made was a hydrocarbon extracted how clean is it how well was it extracted at what temperature how good did the biomass look like right so we have varying ability to handle any sort of crude in this machine and get it up to a very very high level of purity above 90% and sometimes even above 95% purity with this distillation apparatus so with feeding your distillate through this reservoir you're then coming up it's coming through this heated feed tube and this is actually coming into your evaporator here now your evaporator is going to evaporate that distillate and it's going to reconvince on an inner coil which is where you're gonna get your separation between your your cannabinoids and your non-kinetic right so all the gunk so to speak or the chlorophylls and residual phosphides and all the other compounds in the plant that are undesirable are going to come out on your left side here right which is your we call this the residue side that'll be your black sort of reject right and you'll have your amber gold on this side which is your distant now on this particular unit you have output metering vessels and basically what that is is you don't want to starve your distillate or your residue pumps you don't want to starve your feed pump right this is meant to be run as continuous operation a continuous feed system right so it's very important that those pumps don't get starved that you keep everything heated right because if you've ever played with distillate or with crude oil you know it can be very very sticky right the viscosity of finished distillate can be like a warm Jolly Rancher if it's kept at room temperature right and with this being said we want to make sure that everything is heated we have our discharge and you have ultimately your residue coming out of this side and you have your finished distillate coming out of this side so continuing to follow this path here we have a cold trap the cold trap is basically what is going to be your channel of vacuum through your roughing pump and then back here we also have a diffusion pump and those work in tandem in order to bring this apparatus into a very deep vacuum so that you can achieve a very precise distillation that vacuum is controlled via a vacuum metering valve so I know that there's people that like to run different parameters on this machine and again talking about the different variations and crude the different variations and output right we can adjust the temperature of each individual zone right we can run a little bit hotter with your colder we can we can adjust the vacuum levels in order to accommodate now when we install this product we install it for you we train your staff and we give you an SOP but there's a lot of people in the production community and scientific community that like to play with those parameters so to speak of myself being one of them so there's a lot of different variables that you can do in order to make these different products and optimize the process of what you're doing here with this machine a couple cool features with the cold traps is you actually have a terpene removal call this flask that can remove the terpenes simply by opening this valve and you're never breaking vacuum cool a little feature of this and you do have a dual cold trap and you can see the secondary beaker down there I'm sorry in secondary flasks in order to remove your terpenes with your secondary cold trap as well now as Marc's gonna discuss all of these individual zones right so your your your feed zone your pathway for your your distillate your evaporator your cold trap all have individual temperature zones further compounding the ability to run custom parameters on this system and make a desirable output product so we have two core EOC DBC for heating temperature circulators and 230 volt these provide two kilowatts of heating power of the temperature capability up 250 degrees C and on the CDU 3000 they are plumbed to various zones to provide temperature control to make sure that the highly viscous cannabis extract and distillates can flow through the system properly on this side of the system we have the SE six high temperature heating circulator this has three kilowatts of heating 30 volt with the temperature range up to three and a degrees C and in this case the SE six is plumbed to the outer jacket of the still itself providing the the heat to do the actual distillation next to it we have the choreo CD 600 F and 230 volt this has a two kilowatt heater with 600 watts of cooling power at 20 degrees C and 220 watts of cooling power at minus 20 with an operating temperature range of minus 35 250 degrees C in this CD you 3,000 it is plumbed to the vacuum trap here which protects the vacuum system and also enables you to get a turbo down below we have the F p-51 SL refrigerated heating circulator this has a temperature range of minus 50 to 200 degrees C with a three kilowatt heater two kilowatts of cooling power at 20 degrees C one kilowatt of cooling power at minus 20 degrees C in the CDU 3000 it's plumbed to the condenser inside the still where the distillate collects and then goes into the lights collection flask on the C 2 u 3 the CDU 3000 provides quality engineering from Detroit ped with German engineering from UIC and olavo providing a perfect setup for a turnkey solution catered to the hemp and cannabis industries one thing that I stress is really fantastic about this unit is its you already right so if you guys understand the compliance issues between CEC SI and ul and understanding the electrical inspections and parameters this is a unit that becomes pre-certified with your paperwork that's compliant in any regulated jurisdiction so if you would like to have one manufacturer to see e compliance for introduction into the European Union or South America that's something that were completely capable of as well as CSA compliance for Canada the main units that come to the United States here are of course ul compliant we wanted to take a look around the back here about the UL compliant power distribution boxes the great thing about the UL power distribution boxes is that you have all of your hubs connected into one central location and you have a singular whip to connect into your power source right this is gonna make it very easy for an electrical inspector to come in look at your paperwork look at the compliance look at the integration and understand hey this is what I'm looking at this looks good it's compliant here's the you all stand for the CSA stamp for the Cee stamp or whatever it may be which gives us a very much more ability to vastly integrate your product into your laboratory a couple other key features if you have ever worked with a variety of different distillation devices you'll know that there's all sorts of courts to them right in terms of breaking them apart breaking vacuum taking the blast off putting the blast back on reaching up in order to put your your distance re your crude oil into your device in order to be distilled you can see with this system everything is very very economic right anywhere that I want to reach to do anything it's all right here right makes it very easy to operate and very user-friendly so to speak the other thing that I love about this system is that your body is all stainless steel right your entire pathway here this is all jacketed stainless steel making an extremely extremely reliable the glass units while they're excellent for laboratory scale and introduction their glass right you have somebody come in and you know hit one of your machines with a pole or something like that all of a sudden you've got a you know $35,000 piece of glass that can potentially be broken not saying that's gonna happen I'm sure all of you are very careful but the reliability of stainless is certainly a benefit and the throughput ability of stainless is certainly a benefit as well I hope that this video was helpful for everyone to help understand this piece of equipment what its capabilities are what it does thank you guys for watching the videos please leave comments if there's anything else that you wants to talk about or specific features that you'd like to know more about on the unit you can always give us a call or shoot us an email its info at precision extraction comm or eight five five four two zero zero zero two zero thanks so much", "V-_945QVfU0": "THAT'S WHEN MARCOS AND TWO OFFICERS WENT TUMBLING DOWN SEVERAL ROWS OF

water soluble CBD nowadays there are so many people that are hearing about CBD for the first time just discovering it and the odds are they're hearing about it in one of its many oil forms like a tincture like a cream like vapes oil and water don't mix well we know that and the vast majority of use cases out there are gonna be water based I'll explain a bit more leg or what I mean about that really it all comes down to bioavailability the way in which you consume the CBD dictates how bioavailable it is so before I get too deep into it let's go find a place in the woods to sit down and talk and a little bit more of a beautiful [Music] [Music] [Music] so the first thing that's crucial to understanding why water-soluble is so important is known as the first pass effect or first pass metabolism and this is a physiological phenomenon where basically when you're delivering a drug any drug compound to the body the concentration gets greatly reduced before it can effectively be absorbs and basically what's happening is that this drug compound whatever it might be in our case it's CBD is getting processed by the liver before it has a chance to effectively enter your bloodstream what that ends up meaning is that you have a great decrease in bioavailability and it's not really a novel problem it affects tons of different drug compounds from curcumin which is the active ingredient in turmeric to morphine and tons of other things that are pretty normal in drug delivery and pharmaceuticals but they have the same exact issue which is the first pass effect preventing it from being efficiently absorbed in a certain state so to overcome the first pass effect there needs to be some sort of conversion process for these molecules the first pass effect only affects the bioavailability of CBD if consumed into the stomach or oral consumption if you're absorbing a tincture properly under your tongue through your skin or you're vaping it it doesn't have those issues because the first pass effect is specific for the stomach so the good thing is that scientists have created techniques to successfully overcome the first pass effect which means that you can take something like CBD which normally has extremely poor bioavailability in the stomach put it through this conversion process and then all of a sudden you can drink it or eat it or however swallow it into your stomach without sacrificing effectiveness so what's the big deal why does all of this matter really it all comes down to the fact that we can't effectively absorb CBD and our stomach as is and you might be thinking what about all the CBD oil capsules out there isn't that just an oil that I'm swallowing into my stomach or what about CBD drinks am I not getting the full dose for those either and the answer really is it all depends on how those companies formulated their CBD for example what we do at in uncanny allows it so that in a capsule or in a drink or however you want to take it by swallowing it you're still getting the maximum dose because of this unique conversion process that we do but basically a lot of CBD oil capsules out there are not converted in any special way and actually gonna have really poor bioavailability this is science that not everybody's aware of or if they are aware of it they've chosen to ignore it for some reason so what does that look like it looks like if you took a 25 milligram CBD capsule you could only be absorbing 5 milligrams of that expected dose so the reality is that out there in the world of science and drug delivery science up to 40% of new drug compounds a lot of them being from plants have this same issue of bioavailability in the stomach so the techniques that have been created to overcome this problem are tried and tested and well known in the scientific community and are being used every day for other compounds it's still just new to the cannabis hemp CBD industry one of the best ways to overcome the first pass effect is to convert the oil-soluble CBD into a water soluble form by doing this not only does it increase bioavailability in the stomach but it also greatly increases the ways in which you could use this product because with an oil-based extract you're confined to mixing it with other oils and using it that way because of course oil and water don't mix but with water soluble you can much more easily incorporate that into baked goods frozen goods coffee tea juices and so much more the technique that we use here at uncanny wellness is recognized for possessing unparalleled potential for increasing the oral bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs and I know that's a mouthful but basically it means that the technique converts the soil into a form that increases bioavailability in the stomach so how does this work basically you could think of CBD oil as a big blob and this conversion technique takes it from a big blob of oil and breaks it down into a bunch of really really really small pieces and all of those small pieces are micro or nano sized so that ends up being what's known as a micro encapsulation literally encapsulating pieces of that CBD oil into small enough segments so that I can effectively enter your bloodstream in the stomach and overcome the first pass effect the end result of the conversion process that we use to take the CBD oil into a water soluble form ends up creating a off white powder it's very fine to the touch and still has the smell from all the terpenes and other naturally occurring compounds in the extract besides at the CBD so why should you care well you know maybe water soluble CBD is not for you if you really like creams if you really like holding a tincture under your tongue then by all means stick with that but if you want to expand the ways in which you can use this substance water soluble is for sure the way to go because otherwise you're gonna be throwing your CBD oil into your smoothie or into your water first of all it's not gonna mix well second of all you're gonna be absorbing maybe 50% likely less really to incorporate something and build it into your daily routine it has to be easy so water soluble CBD allows you to just consume it in a much more friendly way without having to guess what dose you're expecting without having to sacrifice bioavailability and without having to deal with holding a oil under your tongue to properly absorb it when we take a look at what's on the shelves of health food stores like if you walked into Whole Foods if you walked into any natural food store near you what you would see is you'd see powders that you could add to a shaker or smoothie and you'd see pills there are some textures but there are a very small minority compared to what is in the supplement department as a whole and so those two pills and powders either way you're gonna use those it's entering your stomach and so to use CBD in that way it really needs to be in a converted form for increased bioavailability and a water-soluble CBD can do that for you now I believe that if CBD is really going to go mainstream like we all know it can it's gonna be in the most user-friendly way and in my opinion I think it makes the most sense that the most user-friendly way for CBD to be delivered to the body it's just by swallowing it drinking it using it in a capsule and that way it has to be converted otherwise you're losing out on most of the dose you know there's a lot of people out there that have really great CBD tinctures but when they start dropping that tincture into a smoothie it's really misleading to their customers because yes the tincture is perfectly fine absorbed under the tongue but if you're just dropping CBD into your smoothie you got to know that you're getting only half that dose or less a good example is if you go to fill your car up with gas okay if you go to fill your car up with gas and you pay for a full tank would you be okay only getting half a tank or even 20% of a tank probably not so if you're paying for a dose of CBD and you're just swallowing oil then you got to know then that's exactly what's happening so that's it everything you need to know about water-soluble CBD really what it comes down to is we all have these incredible endocannabinoids systems in our body that are the precursor to our nervous and immune system and are essential for the full functioning of those systems and maintaining health and balance within our body CBD is arguably the best way to supplement that system and support yourself on so many levels so however you want to incorporate CBD into your life is up to you but just remember that if you're going to be swallowing it in a capsule or in any other form it needs to be converted in order to overcome the first pass effect what we do is create a water-soluble powder which does overcome that bioavailability obstacle and also greatly opens up the opportunities for you to use it in creative fun and interesting ways so that's all for this video thank you all so much for watching if you made it this far and you enjoyed it please like the video it would also mean a lot to me if you can

research on the plant and its derivatives suggests that it may be useful more useful than once thought in this video we'll cover one particular derivative known as CBD I'll introduce CBD and the ways in which you may interact with the body I'll then further outline the potential health benefits of CBD oil including hair growth let's jump in so first guys let's have a quick introduction into CBD now can a video more commonly referred to as CBD is an extract from the cannabis plant CBD is the second most prevalent compound found in cannabis with up to 40 percent of the plants extract with the first being Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol which is known as THC now what is the difference between CBD and THC to understand CBD is important that you first understand what it's not cannabis more commonly referred to as marijuana or weed is a plant that's often harvested for its psychoactive effects the compound found in cannabis which contributes to this effect isn't CBD though it's actually THC THC is the compound which induces the high that uses of marijuana receive if CBD doesn't have any psychoactive effects though why is it so often used well the answer is simple CBD has many of its own benefits which are independent of THC or other compounds found in cannabis what about CBD and how it interacts with the human body well believe it or not the human body is actually adapted to the use of cannabinoids like CBD let me explain found throughout the body a cannabinoid receptors which a part of the endocannabinoid system these can be classified by cb1 receptors mostly found in the brain and cb2 receptors found mostly within the immune system these helped to stimulate and regulate a number of physiological processes including appetite mood pain and memory as you'd imagine the cannabinoid receptors aware plant cannabinoids like CBD doc but cannabinoids produced by the human body and synthetic cannabinoids can also interact with these receptors once these receptors have been activated they are then able to influence various intracellular effects a neuronal excitability so what are some of the health benefits of CBD oil well before we discuss the effects that CBD oil may have on hair growth let's consider it's more general benefits first is it reduces pain and inflammation since circa 2900 BC marijuana has been used to treat a number of medical conditions these include muscle spasms joint pain and other such conditions which trigger pain and while scientists are still unsure of its exact mechanisms there were a few studies which highlight CBDs use in the treatment of pain SATA vex is an oval spray which contains a combination of THC and CBD the drug is a purely approved for use in many countries and is often used as pain reliever for those with chronic medical conditions one study on the topic published in 2015 offers a bit more insight into the drugs uses and mechanisms the study consisted of 30 patients all of which had been diagnosed previously with multiple sclerosis or MS the goal of the study was to determine whether the drug could relax the muscles and as a result improve spasticity and reduce pain the patients were given an extensive clinical and neuro physiological examination before and after the trial the parameters which researchers used to gauge results included motor threshold motor evoked potential amplitude into cortical excitability sensory motor integration and H Mac stroke m-m-max ratio as the researchers noted the results of the study showed an increase of intra cortical inhibition a significant reduction of spinal excitability and an improvement in spasticity and associated symptoms as such they concluded that SATA vex may be an effective drug for producing symptoms of MS how well the researchers speculate that the drug works along into cortical pathways this suggests that THC and or CBD can relieve a number of neurological symptoms including pain the next thing is that the alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression if you suffer from anxiety or depression you know too well for the conditions abilities to SAP you of oil energy joy and overall mental well-being there are many drugs on the market which target various pathways in order to treat these conditions the most common drug classes include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs but did you know that CBD may also be an effective intensity and the antidepressant were there were many triggers for individuals who suffer from generalized social anxiety disorder also known as si D but one of the most common triggers is public speaking with this in mind researchers from Brazil recruited 36 individuals to test the effects of CBD on si D the study consisted of 24 patients who had never received treatment for their anxiety disorder and 12 healthy control individuals the subjects were then required to participate in a simulation public speaking test or spst to determine whether CBD had any effects on those of SA D the SI d group was split into two groups the first group received a 600 milligram dose of CBD while the second group received a placebo dose these were administers one and a half hours before the test and both the participants and the researchers were blinded to the treatment the group which consisted of 12 healthy individuals didn't receive anything as the results of the study showed pretreatment with CBD significantly reduced anxiety cognitive impairment and discomfort in their speech performance and significantly decreased alert in their anticipated speech these results are especially significant when you consider how the placebo patients performed is they displayed higher anxiety cognitive impairment discomfort and alert levels the results of this study are certainly interesting but is there more pieces to back these claims or one study published in 2016 showed the effectiveness of CBD oil in the treatment of insomnia in children with post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD but just as with the previous study there were still many questions left unanswered the most pressing question is whether dependency on CBD is a possibility as of now there is no evidence to suggest that CBD dependence or abuse is a problem that's not to say that the possibility has been ruled out entirely however so CBD is a pretty interesting medication it's quite popular at the moment but now we're gonna go into how it could be used for hay growth well it's currently no evidence that CBD can directly stimulate hair growth or tree pattern baldness that doesn't mean that it doesn't have his hair benefits though let's take a look at what we do know about CBD based on current research the first thing is that it may treat psoriasis psoriasis is a skin condition that consists of flaking inflammation and thick patches of skin this condition can develop on any part of the body though areas with high sebum content such as the scalp are often a target there were an array of treatment methods including photodynamic light therapy steroids and immunosuppressive drugs but as you can imagine these can come with their own risks and potential side effects the good news a literature review published in 2016 indicates that CBD maybe a future treatment option for psoriasis patients it's well known that psoriasis is an autoimmune disorder that may trigger an interaction within the nervous system the endocannabinoid system is one such system within the nervous system this means that is possible for CBD to play a role in mitigation of symptoms there is still much research to be done of course it also may stabilize sebum levels now we've already discussed about the benefits of CBD oil for treating inflammation inflammation plays a significant role in hair loss and whether it's the underlying cause or just a side effect of another condition we know for sure that inflammation must be controlled in order to stop hair loss and even be grow hair but another factor that's often overlooked in hair loss is sebum sebum is the natural oil produced from the sebaceous glands which are founded inside the hair follicle a healthy scalp can regulate sebum production so as to ensure a well-balanced environment medical conditions including male pattern baldness may trigger an inbounds however so how does CBD fit in according to a 2014 research study CBD exerts SIBO static effects on human see besides the research was performed in vitro which means it was performed in test tubes to culture dishes etc in a laboratory setting the researchers use cultured human see besides which highly specialized sebum producing epithelial cells as well as human skin organ cultures to determine the effect of CBD on sebum production as the tests showed the administration of CBD sasebo sites and human skin organ culture inhibits lipid genic actions of various compounds these included arachidonic acid linoleic acid and testosterone but how exactly does this work well it appears that CBD activates certain ion channels namely transient receptor potential of vanillite 4 or T or P v4 which then suppresses sebum proliferation and expression but why is this good for hair growth there are quite a few dermatological conditions that are triggered by the presence of excess sebum dandruff and seborrhoeic dermatitis are perhaps the most common the build-up of sea burden can cause irritation inflammation and itching over time this may dislodge otherwise healthy hairs from the scalp or even the follicles and prevent hair growth if CBD oil can suppress excess sebum production as at the previously mentioned study claims this may be a significant breakthrough for sufferers of many dermatological conditions and finally it provides nutritional benefit in some cases nutrient deficiencies can cause hair thinning and loss this is particularly true when it comes to vital hair nutrients such as iron Neeson and biotin hair loss can also trigger a nutrient deficiency within the follicles as the follicles become inflamed and are unable to receive oxygen and nutrients they were acquired from the blood vessels CBD is full of nutrients such as omega-3 omega-6 and omega-9 fatty acids as well as gamma linoleic acid or GLA these ingredients may help to promote hair growth but they can also protect existing hair strands fatty acids are beneficial in two main ways foremost they provide moisture to the scalp and hair they also protect the cuticle against outside damage too so as to reduce breakage and split ends and we can go even further and say that the amino acids within CBD lend themselves to the structure of the hair on the hair is composed almost entirely of the protein keratin and there's amino acids are the building blocks of protein CBD oils contents can ensure the protein is strengthened okay great so CBD is looking like quite an interesting thing to add into a hair care routine what about legality issues there's much debate worldwide about the legalization of the cannabis plant in its derivatives including marijuana and CBD oil let's take a look at the United States for example well thanks to the 2018 farm bill which was signed into law in December 2018 CBD oils obtained from hemp plants are legal at the federal level but CBD oil which are obtained from marijuana are only legal in some states you may notice that the qualifier this bordered above what exactly does this mean marijuana and hemp both terms which often used to describe the derivatives of the cannabis plant the difference however lies in the THC content marijuana by definition is any kind of his plant very high variety that contains greater than 0.3 percent THC by dry weight these plant varieties are known to produce the height that's associated with weed hemp on the other hand is any kind of is plant varieties that contains less than 0.3 percent THC by driveway and this means that it's a non intoxicating variety hemp derive CBD oil are more widely legalized throughout the world so how could you use CBD for your hair well there were two ways to utilize CBD topically and by ingestion to apply it topically you would massage CBD oil into a hair and scalp to receive the direct benefits of the oil there are many brands of CBD oil shampoos and conditioners on the market these products may take the deliverability of CBD easier and they can also make it easier to add CBD to a routine a shampooing and conditioning are likely regular parts of your routine already the next thing you can do is you could take it over lay the vast majority of CBD oils are produced as an older supplement so as long as the brand you've chosen indicates that it can be taken orally you may want to consider that option this method can likely provide with the greatest benefits in regards nutrient absorption what should you look for in CBD oil well if you're on the market for CBD oil then you'll need to pay special attention to the quality of the products you buy what exactly should you be looking for well the first place to start with is full-spectrum CBD the oils derived from hemp plants are often classified as I have the full spectrum CBD or CBD isolate full-spectrum CBD contains many more beneficial components including proteins fatty acids and flavonoids the same cannot be said for CBD isolate which is likely good to contain just CBD and perhaps a few traces components listed above unfortunately there is very little regulation of CBD all around the world in the USA for example CBD oil is not regulated by the Federal Drug Administration this means that the manufacturer is responsible for quality and accurate reporting so if the FDA doesn't back the claim to these companies how can you know that their labeling is accurate the only way is to choose a reputable company the putable companies will often provide the results of third-party researchers this offers an additional assurance to consumers now the evidence on CBD oil for hair growth is slim in fact no trials which directly studies the use of CBD for her health have been performed that doesn't mean that we can't draw conclusions from other studies on the cannabis derivative though we know that CBD may control sebum levels and this is important for a healthy scalp environment we also know that CBD oil contains many nutrients which can provide the hair with the Bluefish that they need so guys that's what one of Chevys day on CBD oil now if you're worried about your hair loss don't forget to click the link in

Margaret Haney thank you so much for joining us appreciate that thanks so much you you", "Q5xorweaNTU": "So you want to add terpenes to your THC\nproduct. Well how much terpenes do you use? That's called the dilution ratio. My name is Drew, owner of MrExtractor.com, and\nI'm here today to tell you the truth about what dilution ratio you should be\nusing in this week's episode: \"Terpene Dilution Ratios\" from The Terpene\nInstitute. So you want to start mixing terpenes in your product, and you don't\nknow how much to use, and your products are expensive, and you don't want to mess\nit up. I totally got that, all right. So what I'm gonna do, is there's a whole\nbunch of different products that you can mix terpenes with, and I want to do a\nvideo on every single one. I'm gonna give you a tutorial, whether you already make\nproducts, or you're just thinking about it, on how to make every single different\nproduct with our terpenes. But the fact is, I just don't have time right now. So\nI'm gonna give you a basic understanding on how much you should use with all\ndifferent products. And I'll skim through it, and hopefully this gets you going, and\nlater you can watch a full tutorial on each individual product. I'll just give\nyou a walk down on how to make it. Make it, sell it, knock yourself out, alright? So\none of the main things that people are doing right now is they're taking our\nterpenes and they're mixing them with distillate and they're making a vapor\npen. So how much do you want to use? Now, always, every batch of distillate is\ngonna be different. And all terpenes are a little bit different, but they're all\npretty much the same. So I tell everybody; no matter how professional you are, no\nmatter how big you are, no matter how small you are, you always want to do a\nsmall batch first. If you have a thousand grams of distillate, and a big jar\nterpenes, don't just mix the two together because if you blow it, then you're\nscrewed. Start with the 1 gram batch. Get your\nratio- I do that on every product I ever make and so do large companies. Small\nbatch testing, that's the term for it. So what I recommend is that, well first off,\nyou need to understand that the ratio between terpenes and your product is\ngoing to differ every single time, because your distillate will always come\nout a different viscosity and it depends on what pen you use every different pen\nand cartridge that you use has different hole sizes in there and burns\ndifferently if it likes specific viscosity that it works best at\nknow your cartridge first and make a few different samples and see which one\nactually tastes best and smokes with the biggest clouds in the cartridge that\nyou're using and then don't switch because you're gonna have to do it all\nover every single time so basically with distillate you want to start out at 10%\nof terpenes no you take your distillate say you got 100 grams of tur picking a\nhundred grams of distillate 10 grams of terpenes now you're gonna want to mix\nthat heat does help the smallest amount of heat quickly mix it and make sure it\nemulsifies all together now if you heat something at a low temperature for a\nlong time at darkens I've personally found that if I heat it high really\nquickly and stir it and then cool it down I have less darkening because it's\nreally like a baking effect in my opinion high heat doesn't always like\ninstantly flash it everyone's got a different opinion on it so whatever you\ndo you have to heat it up a little bit make sure that it emulsifies in and take\nthe heat away from it and then you want to let it cool down to room temperature\nbecause your client is gonna be using that pen at room temperature you want to\nput it in the pen while it's still warm check your pen at room temperature not\nhot see how the bubble moves see how it smokes and if I were you I'd make a\ncouple different pens at different rates and find out what works best for your\npen like I said it's gonna be different there's a million types of pens out\nthere you may live in Arizona where everything's 100 degrees you may live in\nAlaska you're gonna want to make it a little runny or in Alaska and a little\nthicker in Arizona so all custom work here so you've mixed in 10% this works\ngreat it's probably not gonna be too runny I could pretty much guarantee that\nbut if it's too thick still then you can just add a little bit more terpenes and\nstir it in being that the terpenes have already emulsified in your distillate\nyou don't need to reheat it at that point it will mix in just by hand just\nfine now if you've made it to a thin add more\ndistillate in there stir it back up until you've got it the right way you'll\nnever really ruin a batch if you're doing that ballpark ratios for\ndistillate 10 to 15% is what we recommend now like I said we work out of\nLos Angeles we supply some of the largest pen companies in the country\ndown in Los Angeles and we always talk with their R&D teams what they're\nfinding is you can get the amount of terpenes to make it function in the pen\nbut customers are actually just getting more flavor they you know they\njust really want to taste some things and that's what we're just seeing across\nthe board always work with what your clients want because that's your main\ngoal not what you want nobody really cares what you like just remember that\nyou got to keep it in perspective you may be the owner of a company nobody\ncares customers want what they want so make sure to give them choices and let\nthem choose you know it's one of the fallacies that we all have as\nmanufacturers that everybody thinks like us so give them a few options let them\nchoose if they want a more flavorful pen or a less flavorful pen cannabis\nprofiles flavor profiles whatever remember 10 to 15% is a ballpark in Los\nAngeles in the major areas we are finding that they like a little bit more\nterpenes for a more robust flavor in their pen thistle it tastes like crap\nanyway I think it tastes like plastic and I don't like the taste of it I'd\nrather have a little more flavoring a little weaker pen and take an extra hit\nof something I liked then one less hit of something that I don't now when\nyou're dealing with shatter and hard extracts you have to remember there's a\nwindow here the scale you've got liquefied oil down here you've got solid\nshatter over here you are taking either end of this spectrum and you're trying\nto get it into a liquid obviously this oil over here is closer\nto a liquid already so all you have to do is add a little bit of terpenes if\nyou're over here in a solid state you're gonna have to add more terpenes so on\nthe hardest shatter we've ever seen just like some glass the most we've ever had\nto add was 50% by weight cool thing about my products which makes them\nbetter than other people's products as other companies give you a max dilution\nratio of 5 to 8% because they do not know how to blend their terpenes watch\nmy other videos on how to blend terpenes and why our products are better\nscientifically our products will taste fine at 50% you try doing that with\nanother company your throats going to get all jacked up because they don't\nknow how to do it they're just reading a piece of paper from a lab we don't do\nthat we handcraft our blends so that regardless of what product you're using\nit's gonna taste good and it's gonna taste the same and it's not gonna be\nharsh so for BHO some solid shatter you're gonna want to use a up to a 50%\nratio we can pretty much guarantee that all of our products will taste good up\nto a 50% ratio and it's kind of unheard of other companies require the use of\nMCTS or polyethylene glycol as a cutting agent I don't like it it's not how we\ndeveloped our product so one gram of BHO shatter 2\nthe half a gram now our terpenes are about 48 drops per gram so if you don't\nhave a scale and you have a gram of shattered what does that 24 drops will\nliquify that down so what about wax isn't crumble well that's just in the\nmiddle of the scale so you know you've got 10% over here 50% over here you\nwaxing your crumbles are going to be at about 25 to 30% those things usually\ncome out fogging when you stir them up if you have an extract and you mix them\nterpenes and it's kind of foggy hit it with a little heat those are your waxes\nthat are showing the waxes loosen up they melt and then they emulsify\nthemselves back in there and then it stays clear it's a really cool process\nso what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do demo videos on each one of these I'm\ngoing to take some distillate I'm gonna mix it I'm going to show you the\ndifferences in everything I'm gonna take some BHO it makes it teach you how to do\nall that and another time right now I've just got a lot on my plate so hopefully\nthese basic ratios help you out in your products and go try it out start with a\nsmall batch always make sure it functions at room temperature always\nscale yourself up there's companies out there making millions of dollars that\nstarted in their garage and so can you alright so thanks for watching the\nterpene Institute was created just to give you a simple common-sense\nunderstanding of terpenes and the cannabis industry make some money help\nsome people trying to help you guys out alright thank you for watching go to mr.\nextract or calm I will see you in the next episode take it easy", "yaz3a5lNY88": "hello everybody it's nikki i have a cool video for you today i had just got my order in i've been waiting waiting waiting for this package i have never tried it before but it is a cbd

bubble gum honey bubble gum flavor pure and clear so i got this because it doesn't have like all those types of i don't know explain it it says no pg or vg that's a type of ingredient they use that's

derived tested pure blah blah blah mind body spirit fast acting really so this is 250 milligrams and this is 200 milligrams this is not bad for 20 200 milligrams for like 500 puffs or something i said i don't know but this is 250 milligrams what does it mean to experience pure spectrum enlightenment intuition creativity compassion vitality relationships and grounding this is like chakra status guys this is chakra the promoting chakra status so let's open the vape pen it slides out i'm so excited to try this uh it's stuck here we go oh it's just a charger with a sleek pen all right see it looks like this all right and then this is the charger that goes with it a usb charger if you had any of this before you just screw that in i guess do i have to charge it now is there any instructions oh here we go has a little bit of instructions they gave me silver i don't know if i chose silver specifically but on off settings push button five times change heat settings push button three times preheating set settings push button two times charging up to four hours or when light turns green okay so i don't know if it's charged yet doesn't say and this is my oil it looks like this they had this one that was called fruit fruity loops i was gonna try but i didn't know if this fit inside the thing i wanted to use but look it looks like this and the top is rounded and the oil is in there i don't know if you've seen that but um the oil's in there in the reservoir it's pretty cool all right let's stop this cheddar chatter and try it hopefully it's charged i really hope so i'm gonna go ahead and screw this in 0.5 ml that's how much okay okay i don't know how tight i'm supposed to why is it crooked is it crooked this is weird all right okay so what is it how do you do this charging press button two times i hope it's on oh on off one two three four five oh look it was red now one two it's preheating now it's preheating pictures of products are not to scale cartridge not included how come this tip is different from the other tips the other tips look like they're like more not not as rounded is it done now what do you do i don't know how to do this you have to hold the pen you have to hold the button i mean so bubble gum tastes like a weird light version of medicine let me try again it's like i don't know what it's supposed to do at the moment this is just interesting it's like i feel like it's something supposed to happen like right away it's light i taste a little tint of bubble gum but it's very subtle very subtle i don't see no nothing as of now but it's pretty cool i don't know let's try one more that's cool though maybe i'll feel an effect later i feel like i feel like i don't know if it's the placebo effect but i feel like a calmness settling or i could just be bugging out i don't know but this is cool i guess i'll do an update on another video to see my thoughts on it like some vlog type stuff so that's it that's all i have for you today i'm gonna do

marijuana extraction videos and I post them on the internet for other people who watch learn from and smoke along with now today I have something cool of the clear from Thompson caribou concentrates I got ten separate syringes all containing one gram I get them first like they sell them for $60 a gram which is really really really reasonable because a lot of people sell their short path distillation for about 100 bucks a gram even more sometimes and this stuff's really really nice it's flavorless it's basically Congress it has a beautiful golden tinge to it it's not too liquidy it's fairly stable compared to some of the syringe soil I've seen yeah it's like 97 percent 60 bucks a gram so this was a six hundred dollar river right here but that's fine because this is gonna be worth a few months like this is a few months worth of medicine mixing it into shatters and stuff this will last for a couple months without further any without any further ado we're going to heat up the Omni nail by Santa Cruz shredder we're gonna heat it up red hot leg cool down for a couple seconds we're gonna go in and take a nice quick down but I'm not gonna be able to tell you guys about the flavor or anything because there is none but before we do that I will bring these back in over here quickly show you them off like I was saying there's ten of them they were sold out of this stuff for a really long time and then they put 350 grams on their site sold out in three days so yeah we're just gonna pop open a random one there's a little tag in these you when you're putting it back on you don't want to bend that or else you'll never keep it on I'm gonna bring this in and show you guys the first push and then I'll heat up the nail off-camera and we'll be right back see that so as you can see it comes out fairly slow haven't had distal in a long time you just grab it break it off drop this camera down actually yeah I do focus come on it's a fair-sized ab okay fix this camera and then I will quickly as you can see right there the distillate is actually coming out oh there grab focus there so the distillate is coming out it is moving some people dab off the syringe and honestly you're gonna melt the [ __ ] plastic tip and then you're gonna ruin your oil you're gonna put impurities in it you're gonna cross contaminate it with [ __ ] polypropylene I'm sure it's a food-grade plastic but you okay so we're back Neil's hot cooling a bit we're going in Cheers yeah that's sweet make stuff nice on set that's really really nice stuff again this was from Thomson caribou concentrates guys this shirt was brought to me by waxer not calm don't even smoke flour I'm a cush connoisseur I'm a shattered snob and I'm on to the distillate that sure path the distillation son until next time let me know if you guys have tried this stuff peace", "08qTKHI26Uc": "when people see CBD or they see a marijuana leaf or a hemp leaf they automatically assume drugs you know illegal activity and that's not the case with this type of product this this product is supposed to be presented in a more medicinal way what's it like to be on the ground floor of a new industry that few people fully understand welcome to the business of CBD the CBD superstore in Queens New York actually used to be a vape shop but a few years ago the owner saw the potential in CBD and gradually started changing his business originally we started off with a couple of products that we tested ourselves some for anxiety some for pain and we saw the growing popularity of the product and the results that customers were getting and before you know it it just it grew into a full blown-out CBD business though this company this is actually a specific facial serum yeah CBD infuse but it has some great ingredients in it my name is Nick Aragon EC I own CBD superstore here in Whitestone New York and what we do here is provide high quality pharmaceutical grade CBD products to our consumers but the jar the jars are those jars the seven gram jars are forty-five but the ones that we have loose those are fifty four seven grams don't necessarily get caught up with the strongest only because every strain could affect you differently in a better way so just because something says 20% doesn't mean you might not get great results from a 16% the Sun sets 19.5 the juicy fruit is 16.7 this is 7 grams that comes in a jar or you can get 14 grams which is doubled so in the beginning obviously there was a stigma you know people thought that when they heard hemp and they heard CBD it was automatically a marijuana product it was an intoxicating product and that really wasn't the case the fact is that we actually had some kickback from community people who actually thought we were a dispensary or we were opening up a marijuana dispensary in selling marijuana and you know the police department came in and we spoke to them and we spoke to the community groups Whitestone itself as a conservative community you know it's a family-oriented community so our job was to actually inform them and send out you know mailers to everybody's homes and reach out to the civic associations to explain what the product was how it works and how it does not conflict with any type of illegal substance that's on the market today unlike marijuana which comes from cannabis plants containing high levels of the psychoactive compound THC CBD is derived from him a different variety of cannabis with very low levels of THC that won't get you high despite its many uses the hemp variety of cannabis has been mostly illegal for decades due to its close relationship to marijuana but last year the 2018 Farm Bill legalized industrial hemp production CBD products are still in a legal gray area and potentially subject regulations the brightfield group an industry analyst estimates that in three years the CBD market could hit 22 billion dollars everybody was looking at the THC version of cannabis thinking that that's going to be where the real market is is people wanting adult use cannabis for recreational purposes you know fast forward to the hemp legalization in the 2018 farm bill and all the sudden everybody realizes wow we can put him derive CBD and just about everything under the Sun the companies kind of did this pivot and thought well of course we want to have this THC type of cannabis product but we might be able to make big big money having something really mainstream that could be sold on Amazon or even a Walmart typical would be a oral ingestion of either a tincture or a capsule all comes out the gummies different types of gummies dog treats we have isolates we have fruits shoes it's not necessarily the cure-all for everything it's not a miracle type of product you know we market the product as a natural relief while new products seem to be hitting the shelves of stores like NYX each week CBDs actual health benefits are still being studied now that hemp is legal and CBDs popularity has exploded a flood of new products claiming CBD content has hit the market the challenge for Nick is figuring out what's actually good you know obviously I would still buy them from you if you got them but we need to know where they come from well not by here I said you have to really talk to the farm owners you have to talk to the manufacturers and you have to talk to the companies you have to see how their products are being made how they're being sourced you also have to confirm that there are third-party lab results so there's no conflict of interest of companies testing their own products and that's been the problem for the consumers they don't know whether they're getting a good CBD product or a bad CBD product you know we need to know the cannabinoid profile in these products prior to getting them we need to know it has a medicinal benefit that's our job in the industries to be able to prove to a customer the validity of the product and the legitimacy of the company that we're buying from hey NBC News viewers thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down here and click on any of the videos over

issue when I make a big batch of oil is like sometimes I really don't want edibles I don't want cookies I don't want any of it sometimes I just want to you know consume I will hey is it that hard it's really not so what I usually do is I get this little capsule machine you go to GNC or Vitamin World or any any health food store they sell these capsules and they also sell this press right here so the capsules cost like a dollar you got like 200 oh and this cost about $10 money well spent let me tell you so all you're gonna do is you take your capsules okay your tops you put your bottoms in this really can't get any easier and the best part about this is these friggin things work you you can make your oil as strong as you want and then you can really really hone in on how strong is my caps and you you can really master this so you get it all filled out and it'll come back in a set but say if you don't have one of these fancy presses which isn't that fancy or expensive but you just you know you're not gonna spend the money it's just you don't you don't see the point so you could what you could do is get a bowl of sugar and say you take your tops put your tops to the side and then you just stick the bottoms into the sugar or the salt and it works pretty perfectly you'll lose say if you do about a hundred you're probably gonna lose a good 15 in falling and just not just whatever but that's not that bad and on the other half you're gonna put your tops so what's gonna happen is we're gonna put or oil and then we're gonna spread it around it's gonna fill up the caps perfectly and then we're gonna put this top on and then squeeze and then when you squeeze they all perfectly become capsules it's amazing and the best part is you give it to one of your friends or or a different medical patient they're gonna look at you like you're just how did you do that so before you go any further you really want to make sure that each one has a capsule in it because if you miss I'm just gonna have oil everywhere and you get a waste of money and you're gonna be pissed so next you take your card so I'm gonna take it I'm gonna pour it in a center round a little square and it'll disperse around and the best part about this thing is if you do too much oil you just pour it right back into your glass so you just spread it around so a little excess oil that I got all right so now I'm gonna take my tops and I'm gonna sit it on top and this is where you really got to be focused when I say really got you focused I mean not really but just squeezed evenly is really what I'm trying to tell you so you're gonna take it and give it a nice squeeze make sure it's all in then boom got canvas castles oh now you can go to work boom boom boom you know no big deal and now ain't no big deal but they work they look great and this is exactly what we're going we're not going for half-assed you know edibles that kind of work like we want stuff that's gonna work so give me a little close-up well thanks guys for watching like how easy was that get yourself out there instead of making cookies or being boring with your oil do something different make some capsules and and you're gonna find that you love these things because I know I did but if you liked what you saw today don't forget to check me out on Instagram at the NJ chef and as always smoke [Music]", "2VCDFUeC3Ow": "hey everyone and welcome to hemp in a pan today we'll be showing you how to make CBD pills [Music] so if you're looking for a great discreet and portable way to consume CBD then you've come to the right place because today we'll be showing you how to make CBD pills we'll start first with making CBD infused coconut oil to fill the capsules coconut oil works well for this because it solidifies at room temperature so that the pills are more stable when transporting around and because of their high saturated fat content they'll infuse well with the CBD I used a quarter of an ounce of medicinal hemp per cup of oil you can add more or less to this recipe depending on how potent you want the pills to be but I found that a fourth of an ounce is a good starting point for most people we'll start first with grinding of the hemp and then decarboxylated in the oven at 250 degrees for about 30 minutes now that the hemp is nice and toasty you'll want to place it in a bowl with the coconut oil place it on top of a pot of boiling water and then use this double boiler technique to infuse the hemp with the coconut oil you'll want to let this boil for at a minimum an hour and preferably two to three hours to make sure that as much of the CBD is infused in the oil as possible now you want to take it out the heat and let it sit for about half an hour to let it cool down not so cool that it solidifies to room temperature but not so hot that I'll burn to the touch strain everything through a cheesecloth [Music] [Music] squeeze as much of the oil out as possible and now we're ready to place them in the capsules you'll probably need to wait another 15 minutes or longer for the oil to cool down just a bit more the melting point for the gelatin capsules are around 90 to 95 degrees because it has to dissolve at below the human body temperature of 98 degrees so you'll have a range of around 75 to 90 degrees to work with since once you're below 75 degrees then the infused CBD coconut oil will start to solidify we now need a few supplies for this part starting with the capsules I found that the zero zero sized capsules are a good compromise between size and ease of use if you want a smaller capsules you can go down to the size zero which is easier to swallow but harder to fill I don't recommend anything smaller than a size zero as they're just really hard to work with you'll also need a way to fill the capsules most food-grade syringes work well and the ones with the needle tips or a tapered deep reach will make it easier to fill the capsules accurately now there's a ton of capsule pill holders on the market to help hold the capsules in place to fill it quicker and to automatically cap each pill afterwards but if you're not making that many pills you can always make a simple one with a small cardboard box and a drill which is what I'm doing now now that I finished drilling in the holes for the capsules I placed each inside as you can see well the hole i accidentally drilled too large so i'll just skip that one now I just used a syringe to fill each capsule cap the maus and that's it [Music] for long-term storage I definitely recommend keeping them in the fridge as warmer climates will keep the coconut oil from solidifying and here's what they look like once solid", "8YlNC_nlebI": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to be

YouTube's new terms and conditions this video is now age restricted if you are not 18 or older please exit the video thank you hello everybody and welcome back to your query cannabis in today's video I'm gonna be making cinnamon flavored CBD oil but first before we get into today's video if you wouldn't mind hit that subscribe button if you're new here and you've already subscribed don't forget to give the video a thumbs up and I really do appreciate you guys supporting our channel so today we're gonna be making a cinnamon flavored CBD oil now the first ingredient of course is going to be our hemp flour that we grew this summer and today we're going to be using our cherry wine have flour so this came in at 17.4% CBD so we'll be doing 13 grams of decarboxylated hemp flour per cup so a total of 26 grams of d carb hemp flour but and today's recipe I will be adding cherry wine shake or trim now this is just trim buzz the sugar leaves or buds that fell off during the trim bag process and these are great to add CBD a now CBD a is the raw plant material so when it's d carved it removes the a and then you just have regular old CBD that we're all familiar with CBD a has its own good properties so we are going to be adding about 4 grams of raw material on top of the D kar material and as you just heard the oven is preheated so is that 250 degrees Fahrenheit we're going to put it in for 30 minutes so while we're waiting for the D carve our I'm gonna gather all the materials in the magic butter machine get that all set up so we can start making our flavored CBD oil 10 grams of cherry wine trim or shake whatever you want to call it this is raw plant material that is not decarboxylated and I'll get our decarboxylated hemp flour in a minute so I did 5 grams per cup of MCT oil so the first time add that material right into the magic butter machine next I'm going to measure out two cups of MCT oil okay so that's 2 cups now I'm going to add our cinnamon now this is all-natural ground cinnamon and you really don't want to overpower it now is the cinnamon going to eliminate the plant flavor no it's definitely going to knock it down but it's not going to taste like a big red or anything like that ok and I do just about a half a spoonful and right into the machine it goes now machine has a blender and a grinder so don't have to mix it around or anything like that now I'm going to go ahead and grab our D carved hemp flour now that's 26 grams of our cherry one head flower at 17.4% cvd so and it goes I can never get all the buds into the magic butter machine without losing a couple of them ok get this out of here and that's the recipe folks and of course I will leave the recipe down in the description below we're going to plug in our magic bard machine get it ready to go all right and we are going to do 160 degrees for 4 hours so I'll see you in four hours and I'll show you the finished product okay so it's been four hours and it's time to get the product out of the magic butter machine so stereotypical magic butter machine style you know you've got to get all the plant material off the base of the blender you know nothing crazy but you don't want to lose that material or at least try the best you can to get it off you're gonna do the same thing on the container you can see in there all that plant material so it's gonna get that all out of here all right looks good now again if you're using another kitchen gadget you know it really depends how messy you want things well that's why I like the magic butter machine so we're going to get our magic butter micron filter and put that into our four cup Pyrex and dump it in you know see if we can get all that out of here again the reason why you want all this plant material is the more you can get in this micron bag the squeeze the more will you're gonna get out of it because all this plant material has got oil in it okay it looks pretty good for now we're gonna get the love gloves silicone gloves just shake it down we're going to give it to squeeze you can see all that material coming out of there all that oil coming out of there so I'm excited to give this a go I know it's gonna be great in some like chai tea stuff like that that cinnamon really holds some good flavor again it doesn't get rid of the plant taste but it definitely covers it a little bit so that's it for today guys I really hope you enjoyed this video hope you use this recipe to your advantage and before we close out the video I want to remind everybody you can find us on Instagram and Facebook now I'll leave those links in the description below along with the recipe that I use today and thank you for watching if you haven't subscribed yet please do don't forget to give a thumbs up on your way

our all new line of KPD series of industrial extractors [Music] precision first conceptualized the KPD series of extractors about two years ago when we saw the shift towards a large scale processing both in cannabis and hemp what we did at the time is we searched for the best most well qualified manufacturing partner that we could build an industrial scale modular extraction platform with we found AMG engineering in Dayton Ohio and they've been a pleasure to work with ever since we've combined our expertise in the cannabis and hemp manufacturing arena with their expertise in the AG reprocessing and Industrial Engineering competency and what that's allowed us to do is build a massive but easy to use modular processing center that can be dropped on the farm can be dropped into a building and it's very easy turnkey ready to operate so a lot of people ask why build a modular self-contained industrial extraction skid and the reasons are numerous the first one is that this whole apparatus that you see here takes four people to operate the second thing is it's extremely simple right it's plug-and-play you drop it and you can drop it onto a slab in a farm you can drop it into an industrial processing building or any number of easy turnkey solutions the flip side of this is people typically have unreasonable expectations when it comes to batch processing batch processing is extremely laborious and if you think about having seven or eight or nine extractors to be able to equal the throughput that something like this does you're talking about running those batch extractors 24 hours a day you're talking about having three shifts of people and you may well employ 40 50 60 employees in order to do the same work that four employees could do with a plant such as this so it's really oughta mating the process its streamlining your efficiencies and it's allowing you to operate a business with an extremely low overhead and as we all know that the price of commodities of THC and CBD eventually are declining it's very important to be able to operate your business with very low operational overhead costs to be able to make margin continually as these large players come in and put competitive pressures on the market so we've designed all this in mind when you look at the design of this extraction plant not only does it have the modularity but we'll talk about some of the efficiencies that this plant does as you can see behind me one of the components we have reflux stills so that your reap roofing your ethanol so you're not having ethanol loss we have a number of different high efficiency methods to take the ethanol back out of the biomass and any a number of these small problems that you run into a batch processing all these losses add up and we've designed this with our processing expertise and AMG's industrial manufacturing expertise to be the most efficient most effective way to extract and that's what you see here today [Applause] so now that you understand a bit about the concept of the KPD series of extractors why we built it how we built it how we conceptualized it let's take a look at some of the more technical components on how it operates and why it's so efficient so the first thing that we're gonna look at is our contacts motor control center and basically what this is it's the brain of the entire operation so what's gonna happen is this skid will be placed on a slab somewhere in a warehouse but your motor control center and your plant control center will be separate the reason that that's designed like that is to keep all the components that could come in contact with any solvent that are flammable it keeps the the risk level down basically so that those flammable vapors aren't coming in contact with any of your motor controls so let's take a look inside the control center so inside what you're going to see is you're going to see all your variable frequency drives you're gonna see all of your motor controls and ultimately this is all linked through one interface right so it's all computer-controlled everything on this entire plant you can see all your temperatures all your motor speeds all your input your output your discharge every single function within that plant is controlled from this brain so you can see on your wall all of your shut offs all of your VFDs all of your control panels all of your power input everything is controlled from this room so remembering our HMI interface and our computer brain interface from our con X you also have a display and a touch screen interface on the actual plant so not only can your controllers see what's going on from your control room your operators can see what's going on in the plant from your HMI interface on your actual machine so the process all starts here and basically what this is is you're gonna have your conveyor feeding in your biomass and this is the first step of the process this is a cooling screw conveyor so what will happen is you take your warm biomass and you cool down your biomass in order for when it hits the solvent it's not warming up the solvent obviously you're putting a massive amount of biomass into this extraction plant you're putting a massive amount of solvent so you can understand that the heat energy if the biomass is not properly cooled is going to raise the temperature of the solvent and therefore that affect the extraction efficiency and the extraction quality so what we do is passing it through here this is jacketed and it's controlled to about negative 40 degrees centigrade in order to cool the biomass and take some of that heat energy away to have a nice efficient consistent extraction so the next step in the process once the biomass is cooled you can see that it drops into this first extraction tank and basically what this is is a counter current ethanol extraction so you've got ethanol coming in from one side you've got your biomass coming in from the other if you have a set retention time they mix the solvent strips that cannabinoids from the plant and ultimately you have your micelle a stream coming out so biomass into your first tank solvent into your third tank and through the entire process they mix through the tanks until they're ultimately separated you will have your cannabinoids and solvent go to one area and you'll have your biomass go to another area so let's follow the stream of the cannabinoids through to the next step once your extraction process is started you're gonna have your micellar stream which we call my salad your cannabinoid and solvent mixture in your micelle a holding tank right here this folding tank is constantly going to be processed through your finds filtration which is going to take out most of your fine particulates that might clog your evaporator any residual waxes and we actually do that with not only the Candela filters and the michela but we use a pre-code as well so this precoat tank will have any number of three coats it could be diatomaceous earth it could be any number of absorbance or things like that that will actually pre coat your filtration and allow for a more pure more efficient extraction so let's take a look at how this all works you have your micellar coming here you have your pre coat tank coming here both of these streams are mixed and they're pushed upwards into our filtration mechanisms which are up here so let's have a look at those so once that micelle a stream is coming up here it's being pushed into our filters and these are three candle filters that basically are filtered with precoat coating the filter membrane and then we have our micellar coming right behind that and basically that's creating a filtration mechanism that's taking out all those impurities highly refining your masala stream ultimately your filters will become caked when they become caked after a number of hours could be a day could be three days could be you know 12 hours it really depends on the consistency of your biomass and how you're extracting what you're going to do is do a blowdown on your filters so these filters are extremely easy to clean as you can see the graded bottoms what you're gonna do is we're just gonna take a bucket or some sort of a bag discharge bag you're gonna wrap it around here and you're gonna do a blowdown to blow down the filter and all your discharge cake is gonna come out again same thing you have redundancy so if you're discharging one filter that the other filter is still in use so that you're never losing your continuous process so that takes us through our filtration step what we're gonna do once we have that micellar filtered and we have it clean we're gonna move on to evaporation and evaporation is the process of actually separating that solvent from the original cannabinoids that we have so it's no longer going to be a micelle a stream at this point we're gonna have crude oil and we're going to have solvent so the next step in our process is evaporation and as we stated evaporation is taking that micellar stream of your cannabinoids and your solvent and separating it so we're gonna take our micelle and separate it into two streams ones are going to become crude oil one's going to become our purified ethanol and that's done with this section of the plant right here what you're seeing is you're seeing two giant distillation towers so you can see they started all the way up here and they go all the way down to the second floor beneath my feet about 20 feet tall and what that's actually doing is applying heat to the solvent in order for the solvent to vaporize once the solvents vaporizing it's coming it's separating from the heavier cannabinoid mixture and as the solvent vaporizes it reconned ences on a separate condenser column behind me which creates a liquefied solvent that's been purified and that leaves us with our micelle a stream that's been purified into the purified solvent of course and then our purified cannabinoids which we refer to as crude oil so let's take a look at the next step in the process which is one that's very crucial and often overlooked so once we have our solvent purified from our micellar stream it's very very important that we do a reflux distillation on that solvent and here's the reason why ethanol is what's called a homogeneous azeotrope with water as you know we're extracting a plant there's a lot of water in the plant when it comes out of the field we dry most of that water out through our drying process but you may have anywhere between 2 to 10 percent water and your residual biomass now what's gonna happen because ethanol is a homogenious azeotrope with water those two molecules are just going to want to stay right together the boiling points are so close that they can't be separated with the traditional evaporation why this is relevant is because over time your solvent becomes diluted and becomes less effective at extracting your cannabinoids so you can imagine that you start with 190-proof pure solvent and over time it's going to be diluted with water once you hit around 170 proof or a little bit lower than that your extraction efficiency becomes greatly compromised which is the reason that we have reflux stills so reflux stills are a different type of evaporation they're used with a very tall tower without with a packing material in them and what that does is it allows that very close boiling point to separate from the water and the solvent so we've integrated this into our plant so it's a turnkey system solvent never needs to be replaced in this plant because the efficiency is so high in terms of not only the reclaim rate from your biomass and your evaporation but also the reap roofing of the solvent it's a completely closed system which makes it extremely efficient and extremely easy to before when we were talking about operating your business on really good margins and maintaining efficiency and how you operate your extraction process this is one of the central key components to do that for for your ROI for your business now that we've walked through the evaporation process and the purification of the solvent we need to follow our crude oil through the other output stream so what happens with the crude oil once it comes out of our evaporator as it moves into these holding tanks and basically what these holding tanks are doing is holding the oil and heating it to perform the decarboxylation process D carb is a very very common process that's used in preparation of your crude oil for not only consumption but for final distillation that's what these tanks do right here and ultimately these tanks can be routed and pumped to a distillation machine or any types of popes post-processing that you would like to use so now that we've followed our micellar stream through the entire plant through refinement all the way to D carb and through re proofing of the solvent the other side of the aspect of the processing of this plant is the actual biomass that's coming out so we have a lot of spent biomass that's coming out of this plant and once it comes out of those extraction tanks that we looked at earlier it's ultimately pumped as a slurry up into these separators so we have these rotary strainer separators and basically what they do is they separate that pulpy sludge of biomass it's the first pass that takes the solvent off and what that's doing is it's taking kind of that like I said pulpy sort of really wet biomass and separating the ethanol from it in order for the biomass to then drop into a heated mechanism which is where you're going to regain the remainder of your solvent out of the biomass so let's take a look at that next the last and one of the most crucial processes in our plant is the reclamation of the final solvent from that biomass so as we saw before we separated the majority of the solvent from the biomass using our strainers but it's still think about you know wringing out a sponge you get most of the of the of the moisture out of the sponge by using that pressure but in order to get the remainder of the moisture out of the sponge or in this case our biomass acting like a sponge we need to heat it and that's precisely what this heated screw does here so you can see it's quite lengthy there's a lot of heat energy that goes into that but the flip side is we're taking a typical 94 93 95 percent efficiency and we're taking that efficiency up above 99 percent in terms of reclamation of your solvent now the reason that's important is because obviously we're on industrial scale here we're talking about tens of thousands of pounds of processing per day you can imagine there's quite a bit of solvent that's being used there so when you're losing 5% of that massive amount of solvent you can imagine what the cost is last we checked Evan all's you know 32 dollars a gallon for for azeotropic ethanol around seven dollars a litre depending on your region if you're losing 5% of everything you're processing with which is the case with typical plants typical batch installations batch installations could be even higher than that you can imagine how that's going to affect your effects and how that's going to affect your ROI especially as you have margin compression on your commodity one of the reasons that we designed this in is exactly that so you may have been wondering what are these giant for tanks on the end of this skid and it's very important because these are our CIP tanks CIP stands for clean in place clean in place is a protocol that's used throughout manufacturing throughout GMP throughout any type of protocol that requires food grade or pharma grade compliance now these CIP tanks are meant to hold an acid wash a base wash and then you have a reuse tank so basically what we're doing is we're imagining any sort of contamination that can get into this system based upon what that contamination is you may need an acid rinse in order to dissolve that contamination you may need a base rinse in order to dissolve that contamination you made into ethanol rinse in order to dissolve that contamination which is basically what we have in this entire plant so again through the HMI interface through the control center you have a completely automated CIP process in order to clean this plant the reason that that's extremely relevant is has more regulations and more restrictions come into the cannabis and hemp space you're going to be subject to testing for pesticides for mold for mildews and you can imagine that if any of that stuff's on your biomass and gets into your plant that you're automatically going to potentially contaminate your plant with a contamination source from the field one of the prime examples that we could use is micro butanol in California it's virtually everywhere and in order to remediate micro butanol audit your processing equipment there's a variety of processes that are needed to do that right now in batch equipment everybody does that manual and it's very laborious and time-consuming but as GMP restrictions and regulations come into play you're going to need to have a set standardized process that can be replicated and duplicated in order to be accurate every single time that's exactly what this CI piece kit does and that's exactly what our control center an automation skid does thanks for watching our overview on our KP d series of industrial extraction plants these plants can be engineered to process anywhere from ten thousand pounds a day up to several hundred thousand over a million if that's what you want our engineering partners as well as ourselves with our engineering expertise and our product expertise know every step of the process we know how to make it the most efficient and that's exactly what we've done here and what we've seen today we look forward to working with you and please give us a call if you have any questions you", "6q4tuD_NtWc": "okay so what is up you guys Sydney shady here come on hey everybody's busy in shady here from restart DVD well you're gonna come on here and tell you guys the difference between a CBD isolate full-spectrum and a CVG broad spectrum well yes and also if you like cannabis like CBD like THC make sure to LIKE this video and we would love to hear from you guys keep on watching those are pretty much the three types of oils that you'll see being sold on the market today that says full-spectrum as containing trace amounts of THC in addition to other cannabinoids and terpenoids Evo oils are going to contain only CBD no other cannabinoids or terpenes then a broad spectrum is going to essentially be the other cannabinoids intervenes just with THC extract now okay come back so what we're gonna do now is prima just talk about our sick products because it recert we make everything ourselves basically CBD is unregulated that's federally legal based on the farm bill so really only industrial hemp is legal in all 50 states looking at CBD products specifically when it comes to full spectrum chances are its containing less than the legal limit which is 0.3% if you're buying in a dispensary you're probably getting a higher THC to CBD ratio everything that we sell is within the legal limits federally so we ship to all 50 states you purchase in store who's your located in North Austin and we have a location in Cedar Park that has confirmative hours so just check before you had there and also obviously like you said and ship online all 50 states have plenty of products besides just our teachers we have topicals not the products alves pet products but obviously we're gonna go over today is the difference between the three different way they're gonna really see on market so we're gonna start with our Islip this is our main product that we sell we offer this product in three different bottle sizes you'll find them in ten ml bottles like this bottle 30 ml bottles and 60 ml bottles the amount of CBD per dropper also in four different kind of categories on the low end they'll start at 20 milligrams of dropper the next tier is 30 milligrams a dropper the next tier is 40 milligrams per ml and then the last tier is 60 milligrams per ml essentially with any of our Islip products just by doing some math with a dropper you can get to a 10 milligram dose or a 20 milligram dose or higher people like to take CBD isolate because it is THC free our CBD I split test out is 99 point four percent pure CBD very very industry standard is kind of around a ninety nine point one percent and so anything higher than that you should feel confident as a consumer that you have a quality product but anything lower than that from an isolate I would be questioning what else is making up the you know rest the percentage of that isolate pie if you will isolates also because the cannabinoids and terpenoids gonna have no flavor at all except for the carrier oil which is mixed with it and in our case we use MCT oil which is liquid coconut oil the next product we're going to dig into is the CBG oil or broad spectrum oil you can think of the spectrum of CBD oils we just talked about the isolate so no THC is present we're gonna get to full spectrum which means THC is present broad spectrum sits actually right in the middle so it's a little bit of a combination of both it's going to contain the terpenes and other cannabinoids there's actually over 130 of them by the way but in a broad spectrum what it does is it isolates out the THC component people who stay an isolate product isn't as effective as a full-spectrum product and what they're simply referring to is that for CBD to be effective some people believe that the other cannabinoids and terpenoids called an entourage effect here a restart CBD feel that's really preferential to what you want to consume in your body we both take our Islip product every day and have found a lot of relief with it also will take full-spectrum products from time to time it'll just comes down to personal preference do you like the way grassy Humby flavors taste do you want the other kin drawings and Europeans to be present maybe for getting drug tested I'd probably steer away from any products that contain even trace amounts of th just because it can build up in your system here are some you know guidelines for why you may choose one product over the other it comes to CBG oil in particular CBG is again one of the many can monoids present in both hemp and marijuana plants and CBG as a cannabinoid specifically is known to help with sleep and Sydney actually has a story about one of her friends who used CBG oil in particular which I thought was really cool though the difference between the two like she just said was one is an isolate that contains just the CBD no Turkey and other cam noise and one of them that we call our CVG oil is technically the broad spectrum that we carry I sent two of these off to my friend that works at Under Armour and he's one of their sleep experts to compare the two tried CBD for the first I think it was three or four night and he said he got a much better sleep than what he was getting prior a new dad has two kids and really it's obviously values his sleep he's an expert in it then I sent him along a CPG oil as well even the same explanation that Jay is giving you guys and tried this one in the first night he tried it he said I got a much deeper sleep than what he did with the ice lid but still an all-around great slave CBD I slit on its own is quote-unquote a tranquilizing effect what that simply means it's gonna help calm you down it's great for someone maybe with anxiety it's great for someone who maybe just wants to get a nice restful night's help quiet your mind if this EVG specifically is called a sleep they're kind of tomato tomahto but in this case this one obviously gave my friend a deeper quality of slave he said that he got great night sleeps with both of the products he and what he was getting prior but again comparing the two quality of deep sleep he got a much deeper sleep with the CVG or the broad spectrum coil the last oil that we're going to type into today is full spectrum pretty much what I would say is the most popular type of CBD oil on the market I think it was definitely more of the first to market type of CBD oil I think it's just a lot of preference when it comes to the legality of cannabis in general a lot of people come from other states where it is legal and so they love being able to have their CBD with a little bit of THC and other cannabinoids there's no wrong way to CBD in our opinion we believe that CBD should be something that you feel good when you ingest and when you absorb and so if you don't want to put THC in your body this will be a product that I would you know honestly steer away from just because depending on how much you're consuming and how frequently you're consuming those trace amounts of THC can build up but for those of you who may not mind kind of just like getting into what's the news mentioned about CBG in particular unfortunately in any given string those other cannabinoids present can varies so THC is obviously a super big popular one that is getting a lot of press time CBD is a newer one so you're hearing a lot more about that CPG is just another candidate it's not just another meaning it doesn't it obviously has benefits and properties to it that are healing and restorative imagine there's 130 of these guys and gals who all have some unique effect that impacts your body so some people believe that if those trace cannabinoids are present in their CBD oil in a full spectrum oil there's added benefits to making CBD a little bit more potent if that's something that you're interested in trying know that we carry actually all three obviously tensor product isolate broad-spectrum CBG and while spectral product really comes under preference what do you want to put in your body reading those ingredients we oftentimes find with full spectrum products that we find on the market they contain other additives and preservatives to mask that grassy humpin taste ours is going to be super pure it's going to have that taste so just know that but those are the things I would just be mindful of when looking for full spectrum products it's just the quality and the other ingredients that will be present there's a lot of different options depending on your preference and thankfully here at restart CBD we have a lot of different ways for you to try CBD out and see how it can help you I'm going to say to that how much we love the cannabis industry so whether you're someone who is for a full spectrum for an isolate feels very strongly you know we're just here to give you information mm-hmm and we're here to educate you and we're here to have a little bit of fun and open up the conversation so feel free to comment below feel free to have that conversation feel free to stop by our shop call us email as DMS whatever it may be because we are here and we're not going anywhere and we want to learn like Sidney said we're obviously really big fans of cannabis no matter which way you like to consume it I am team THC and team CBD it just depends what time of day it is and what I'm trying to treat so hopefully with that information you now feel a little bit more equipped to make the right choice for you and your body remind you guys to subscribe to follow us on the instagram send us an email come visit us at our store in person here in Austin Texas by all buy things [Music]", "exJy9bTXxIA": "hello everybody from aromatherapy 101 this is my module 3 project number 1 for discussion and what I wanted to do for you guys is make a short video about exactly how to distill essential oils and what we're looking at right now is my still and this is essentially a standard chemistry set and for the home distiller this is going to be one of the most practical setups for several reasons cost effectiveness fire safety or lack of a fire hazard and also the amount of material so let's take a closer look at the still and how it all works starting with the heating mantle and there are several different heating sources available from hot plates to heating Mantle's even a kitchen stove can be used but this is the safest in the most reliable it really heats up evenly around the boiling flask beyond that you have the boiling flask as we can see here the water is boiling consistently so that is the boiling flask from the boiling flask you have the reservoir flask and it's pretty self-explanatory that's where your herb reserves are held so the steam can go through following up the reservoir flask you come to what's known as the distilling arm or the still had a couple different names but essentially this is a key component to connect the reservoir flask to one of the most unique parts of the system the condenser and so the condenser is this long tube that you see here it has coils inside of it and the steam is pushed through those coils while I simultaneously push cold water around the outside of the coil and this is what condenses the steam back into the liquid and allows me to collect it as an essential oil underneath that is the collection flask and that simply collects the essential oil that's dripping in there and the hydrosol as well which they need to be separated and hopefully we'll get a chance to show you that ah a reverse osmosis filter is really good for this kind of work to keep your chemistry chemistry glassware clean and also for distillation purposes distilled water is the best and I just want to show you this is a normal everyday fish tank aquarium pump and it simply pumps the water getting a little lost here starting at the bottom and it's good to start at the bottom and have the pump push the water all the way to the top where it can again drain back into the sink and that is important for getting complete coverage around the coils as you can see the water completely surrounds the coils if it was dripping from the top it would just run over the coil I've tried it both ways I've had decent results both ways but from the reading I've done this is the best method and the last piece that's not always necessary but great to have this is the separation funnel this funky-looking piece you see here tear shaped and since the essential oil either sits on top or sinks below the Hydra saw this allows you to separate those two out as you can see there you just flip the switch and drain out the liquid until you have everything that you need so again distilling essential oils really is easy you start with boiling the water you turn the water into a vapor or a gas the gas travels through the herbage this is catnip just quick FYI the steam continues to travel until it reaches the condenser where it's cooled back to a liquid you collect the liquid and separate the oil from the hydrosol so you can see it's darker around now the still has been running for about six hours and you know I'd let it go longer except for I didn't have enough herbage to completely fill up my resin wear flats so I'm going to cut it off here I've already turned the steel off so I just filled up the separatory funnel with the hydrosol essential oil here you can see that more yellow liquid at the bottom that is the essential oil and it's actually pretty interesting catnip oil is heavier than water so it sinks to the bottom it's one of two oils I've distilled that's done that and so when separating it out you want to make sure that you don't get any hydrosol with the oil we read about that earlier how hydrolysis can affect some of the constituents of the essential oil and so I'm going to let this sit here for a little bit and completely separate out then separate the oil from the hiker saw and it'll be ready to use some oils do smell a little bit funky at first nitrogenous like a fishy or sulfur like and this is because of some of the constituents that are distilled out and a lot of essential oils actually need to cure for a period of time before they are effective and I think in the end I probably got about two milliliters of oil roughly twenty drop excuse me forty drops so that's distilling essential oils at home easy process that's why I really love it good medicine easy to make simple chemistry they can't get any better than this I tell you what thanks for joining me", "llUiZVO0TEE": "hey everyone and welcome to hemp in a pan today we'll be making CBD infused coconut oil using a double boiler hem there are multiple ways to make diffuse oils and today we'll be going with one of the most common ways the double boiler method which is an easy and effective way to infuse health into the oil note that this method works with all oils and not just coconut oil olive oil vegetable oil grapeseed oil they all work so depending on what you're using it for you can substitute the oil you want to infuse so here you want to start out with a quarter of an ounce of buds or trim per cup of oil of course trim will not be as potent as buds so if you're using trim you can add more if you want the oil to be stronger or if you want it to be less potent then trim is a good choice as always I recommend using decarboxylated hemp to get the maximum amount of potency however here today I'm feeling lazy so I'm just going to add them directly into the oil and let it decarboxylate while it's being infused all I need to do is grind the pound then mixed with the oil in a bowl that can fit on top of a pot inside the pot I'll add about 3 cups of water this will vary based on the size of the pot you're using but you'll need to add enough water so that it doesn't completely evaporate after two hours of simmering but not so much that it'll touch the bottom of the bowl you want the bowl to be heated by the steam of the water and not the water itself for a consistent temperature I'll then put the pot on the stove let it boil and then turn down the heat so that it's slowly simmering and finally place the bowl on top of the pot the bull should fit in such a way that almost no steam is escaping from the pot although there should be enough pressure from the steam that a little will constantly escape the steam will consistently heat the oil up to 212 degrees a perfect low heat that will infuse a CBD in with the oil and not so hot that it will burn off any of the CBD if you saw my video on making butter note that both this double boiler method as was directly simmering in the water method are interchangeable when infusing I like this method more when working with oils because other than coconut oil most oils won't turn solid when cooled which makes it harder to separate from water so although this method will have a stronger flavor since there's no water to remove some of the terpenes and chlorophyll which gives flavor it is a lot easier to produce I stir it a little bit from time to time and let it sit for about two hours to properly decarboxylate and infuse now that the oil is infused you'll want to let it sit for a while before straining it since a lot of the oils are stuck to the plant material you'll want to make sure the oil is not hot to the touch because after filtering it through a cheesecloth you'll want to squeeze out all the remaining oil from the plant material to get every last drop and that's it the oil is now ready for use and you're storing the oil be sure to keep it in refrigerator or freeze it if you want to store it for long-term use", "yNjvAdbrOFA": "I'm not alert and I'd like to find out if CVD all is going to work for me [Music] anxiety sometime a month to feel a little by now so it's something I'd like to see the back off there's a cannabis extract that's now so popular that you can buy it in just about everything from oils and vape liquids to shampoo and makeup to drinks and even chocolate its classed as a supplement and is being sold in shops and online it's called CBD and at high doses a regulator type is being used in medical studies and it's getting some positive results it's everywhere but there's just so much conflict in advice as well and this song which to choose from two months ago I haven't taken any yet I'm not sure of but I'm not sure how they'll interact okay now some are I mean I've since been diagnosed with other things I've tried a number of prescription drugs mainly antidepressants nothing or pulling me through so you get to a point where you'll just try anything especially when it's been advertised as something more natural I've looked at a couple of sellers website I'll try five milligrams but also a percentage strength I'm just not really sure what all different colors mean I guess the fundamental questions that I want to know over the next couple of days is will it work for me will it work for others how will it work what dosage should I return should all those be taken hi I'm Nathalie thanks for showing us around hi [Music] so we go never look a crop that I planted ten days ago yeah that's good yeah I'm just curious to find out what you grow here and how it works from your side well we grow hemp and flax for fiber we've got a whole processing plant so we can sell clean fiber 4 goes into mattresses and loft insulation by the beginning of August hopefully this will be 10 feet tall travelers people are interested what's the difference between this and marijuana well hemp and marijuana of both cannabis plants yeah but you've got different varieties that produce different cannabinoids how illegal is this and when does it get to the point where it becomes illegal we are perfectly legal because we're licensed by the Home Office to produce hemp strong we're not allowed to harvest the leaf and flower so we have to leave the leaf and flower in the field what do you do with the leaf flower do just leave it there for rest ok so the bit we're throwing away is the part of the plant that the CBD has been extracted from it frustrates me somewhat that the OL CBD producing companies in the UK are allowed to bring leaf and flower in from abroad but we can't produce it if the leaves and flowers go to West well of are they CBD UK are y'all coming from all the UK produced products it's a the core information Europe Oh America ok didn't realize that I'm much of loss people don't most people do when people hear cannabis they usually think getting high and although CBD is cannabis it doesn't get you high and it's legal and that's because cannabis is actually the name of a group of plants and both marijuana and hemp belong to that family cannabis plants have around 100 different chemicals in them called cannabinoids and they can have various effects on us marijuana plants have been bred to have higher levels of a psychoactive chemical known as THC whereas hemp plants have high levels of the chemicals CBD which is not psychoactive and can sometimes have pain relieving and calming effects from researching the CBD oil I just assumed I it was all made in the UK well what I've read nowhere states differently I've been learning today that the local homegrown farmers kind of amused a bit that make the CBD just a little bit of doubt and confusion once again so it's a really exciting area I think especially in psychosis because we don't really have treatments there are as effective as we'd hope and they often come along with lots of very unpleasant side effects it seems that CBD is relatively safe and well tolerated so the study that I worked on looked at people who were at risk of developing psychosis and we gave them a six hundred milligram dose of CBD or a placebo for three weeks and we found that CBD was able to normalize the dysfunction that you see in certain brain areas have got involved in psychosis I haven't tried it but I've opened it and it stinks like I bought this one offline and it's two point five milligrams of CBD per drop that that's probably not going to be very effective if you're looking at 300 milligrams or 600 milligrams I think the risk here is that we just don't have the evidence of whether it works or not the research that we know about is looking at sort of quite high doses 600 to 2,000 milligrams and we know that this could have a clinical benefit but there's the things that you can get on the high street often they have much lower levels and we just don't know basically whether they work or not I know lots of people report that this is helpful however it's difficult to know how much of that is sort of because of the drug or because of a placebo effect and often a placebo effect isn't a bad thing what would you recommend what was your advice before purchasing a product online I think it's important to speak to your doctor if you're considering it because the other thing that we don't know about CBD is the effects that it might have when you're taking another medication for example our bodies are full of receptors that react to cannabis these receptors are part of an internal system which helps control our bodily functions such as our appetite pain relief and coping with stress and anxiety it's called the endocannabinoid system or ECS and it got its name because it was people's use of cannabis that helped lead to its discovery we naturally produce these chemicals all the time and the chemicals THC and CBD from cannabis plants also affect our ECS and can have various effects on our bodies and that's why scientists are now researching potential treatments using them it looks fairly positive I might help man it might be a good impact something but I am still there looking to see what is inside a lot of thought and how much CBD is in it my vaults been open and passed around a little bit so I bought a new bottle do the testing on to make sure that it wasn't contaminated in any other way [Applause] [Music] and can this machine tell us what other chemicals and that being the CBD while CBD and THC are the main ones it also looks for other THC precursors within your product well CBD oil is legal that does depend on how much THC it varies depending on your product and no matter if you had a one meal bottle or a one liter bottle you could don't you would only be allowed one milligram of THC right now in the UK there isn't regulation or manufacturing standards specifically made for CBD supplement products but there is a law that means that the amount of THC that's a psychoactive chemical that gets you high must be less than one milligram per item and it doesn't matter how big the bottle or product is it can still only have one milligram of THC in the whole thing there's strict regulation around the type of CBD that's being used in medical studies that you can't buy online or in shops and there will probably be more official guidance and even laws around low-dose products like CBD oil very soon so of all CBD products in the UK tested and regulated in the same way that we're doing now so in theory yes for every product released in the UK they would need to comply to labeling standards they have the correct amount of CBD that they're advertising within their product if you've ever want to check a supplier should be able to provide you with a certificate that says we've had it tested for this match this is what's in it we ran a series of tests on the product and identified that the THC content within the product was just over four times the legal limit so the legal limit is one milligram per container and we identified just over four milligrams in this in this product four milligrams of THC isn't gonna do anything notable to a person you'd have to have a considerable amount of THC in there for there to be a psychoactive response we found that the CBD content was was pretty much spot-on to what they'd claimed on the product when you extract CBD from the hemp plant you end up with THC as a by-product so it could be the extraction process wasn't cetera as it should have been at separating the cannabinoids properly it could also be a pure misunderstanding of the law the problem is and if you know how to interpret it it's just a page with a load of numbers on it so I think the there needs to be a simpler way of explaining this to to the consumer that doesn't rely on complicated reports on this I would say to Natalie don't worry you know that the THC content in there is very very low don't fear CBD products as a result of this experience and as the industry grows and becomes more mature brands will be explaining better to consumers about their products and making sure that those products comply with all regulations [Music] [Music] [Music] all I have learnt so far I don't think I meditate CBD oil just until a few more studies and tests of being completed I've never seen no attacking it especially because it's becoming more prominent in the media and in the research labs but I definitely keep an open mind about taking it [Music]", "qOa_EvfGSqE": "hey ladies keith richardson here today to talk to you all about the difference in the cbd oil and the cbd flour when you smoke it so whether you're vaping using the vape pan and oil cartridges or smoking the hemp flour in a hemp flower joint or pre-roll i'm going to go through the different effects and kind of you know the different just forms and methods of consuming the cbd in this way so let's get into it first i'm going to talk about the oil we just recently added the cbd oil cartridges to the site and the main difference with oil and flour is that the oil is extracted from the flour in my opinion it is more potent and it takes less for you to feel the effect so either uh when you're smoking the actual hemp flour bud like this like how these are this is orange gelato i have here so whether you're breaking this down and smoking the hemp flower buds or using the pen both of these methods are going to give you a buzz you will feel a high when you smoke it is not as intense as smoking marijuana but you do have a very euphoric to me the buzz feels very similar similar to drinking wine now for me and my tolerance the vaping the oil through the pen is stronger to me than smoking the flour like i only have to hit this like two three times and i'm good like good good so the oil is in my opinion stronger than smoking the flour but for you it may be different so they both work well for anxiety for pain stress relaxation for sleep the effects of it are the same and even the activation times are very similar so after you hit a joint a few times you know you're going to feel it the biggest difference in consuming is going to be that the vape when you vape through the pan like this it has no smell and you can really taste the terpenes so we have four different flavors this is bala berries i have here we also have plushers which tastes more like grape we have golden say banana and we have orange gelato so when you vape it in the pan you really can smell and taste those terpenes whereas when you smoke the flour you can smell the terpenes but you don't taste it as as well as you do when you vape the oil but they give you very similar effects so this is perfect for moms and even dads who don't want to let their kids know what's up they want to be very discreet with the smell you can have this in the car you can even take this to work nobody would know what this was zero smell the smell that gives off is actually very fruity and pleasant so that's the biggest difference this is a little bit um you know smoking hemp when you're smoking through natural methods isn't harmful for your health but this is a little bit milder on your throat for people who are concerned with smoking the flour sometimes smoking a joint is a little bit too harsh for people some people hate the smell of smoke they don't want to smoke in their homes you know it may be a little bit too loud to cover that smell up a lot of people don't like the smell getting in their clothes or on their fingers so this is what the oil is really great for because no smell very discreet and you're going to get all of the effects immediately so it's up to you and i'm going to show you guys really quickly too how to use the the batteries that we have on the site that go with the pins so let me grab a new cartridge so this is what a brand new cartridge will look like you have a little your oil thing in here so you get the oil in this one and then these are the batteries this is a five zero one thread battery it's rechargeable so you get the battery and you get a charger in the pack so basically the cartridge screws off and on and i already know a lot of you guys are going to want to know how long will one of these last based on research they say one cartridge should last from 50 to 100 hits but it depends on how often you use it so it may last a couple of weeks for some people it may last some people a couple of days for people who only use it you know sparingly a few months so it's going to vary from person to person but basically you would get your oil cartridge you take your pen and you just screw it in very simple very simple screw the cartridge all the way in with this pan right here you click it five times to turn it on so one two three four five the pin is now on then you click it twice to preheat the oil i actually had turned it off that first time my bad so that was turning it back on then you click it twice to preheat the oil and you see the light is turned in color so once it's green it's ready to go you just pull it you don't have to hold the button you just pull on it and as long as this lit up is ready you could probably offer each one pull it two three times say reheat it you just click the button twice that's it and then it's going to be ready to go within a couple of seconds so you hit it as soon as it turns and again very few fruity very mild but you immediately feel that cbd getting your system it's like immediately uh a gush of relaxation comes over you so you start to feel it get into your system right away and then to turn it off you click it five times one two three four five so now the pin is turned off and that's how it works very simple so we have all these products available for you guys via the pwlc online canon boutique you can visit us at www.pwlc.store make sure you like subscribe and share this video drop a comment below um let me know your feedback what you want to know next so just to tie this all up with a bow smoking the flour and vaping the oil give you very similar effects in terms of how impactful it is for pain for stress anxiety relaxation for pms but the major difference in smoking the two products is that the vape oil no smell you can really taste those um terpenes and with the flour is very effective as well but you're definitely going to smell it once you burn it and so you know to each his own i recommend them both for me my preference is the flour but you know the oil it's kind of something i'm still getting used to i'm such a flower girl like i think i'm gonna always prefer smoking the flower but the oil is beautiful it really is beautiful so let me know how you all like it and i'll see you guys next time",

everybody uh so it is about 11:30 right now I do have a noon meeting with some whoa Coria actually nerd queue have to figure out a Content plan for like a local business in town so yeah there's that and I spent the entire morning trying to figure out the best setup for this video so now I only have like ten minutes left to film and I don't know what to do first because I got some CBD here to beeps but I really I really want to do a rolling smoke a blunt sesh but I think I'm gonna go with the cbdu so here we have a CBD isolate from the Seabee distillery here you pop this open and it is just this SuperDuper cool looking [ __ ] like a white I don't know it's a nice look like slab but crystallite form super super interesting just this like white material stuff here um so without further ado let me just get dabbing on some of this also I feel like what the once I wouldn't be able to roll and smoke it comfortably exactly in those 15 minutes so I just cleaned up this piece oh that looks fresh as [ __ ] I'm not huge into cleaning and I haven't even really used this piece much because I don't even have a flower bowl for it and I haven't had concentrates really so this piece has only been used a few times in the last [ __ ] forever I guess but how should I do this I guess I should get a dabber or could I just drop it in there oh I can't want just drop it in there let's see how this works out um but yeah wait let me just get to it and then I'll talk about it a little bit this is I don't know what the current laws and stuff on this are the [ __ ] is changing all the time but basically I bought this 100% legal off of CB distillery calm so they just shipped right to my doorstep 30 bucks for this gram eight bucks shipping and yeah apparently just [ __ ] legal just showed up at my doorstep and that's that's incredible especially my mom has stage 4 liver cancer right now we're helping treat it with this it has helped her gone down from four morphine a day just to one which is a huge difference on just this legal non psychoactive [ __ ] thing it's awesome so yeah let's get this on straight up here after the first smoke of the day too so yeah okay she goes okay I dropped it onto the ground hmm that was definitely a lot tastier than the last CBT we had hmm how does this taste this is a really [ __ ] weird thing it's like um how would I describe this it's like I don't know if anyone's ever taken DMT that's watching this that hasn't taken CBD probably it's almost like DMT without the lye taste so for 500 subs I threw some CBD into a joint just just cuz and it tasted it did taste a lot like this like a weird not anything like Bud it's almost like a like a burnt plastic taste it's not like bad it's just weird so almost like I'll give you licked BPA Plus like like a crappy water bottle I can now gene you know like if you have a really really old water bottle and you take a drink from as kind of like almost like a plasticy taste to it but that's good cuz um I'm already feeling a little bit and it's not like taking a hit of a weed I guess so it's more of a the warm part of it you know that warm melty body high part of wheat that's honestly my favorite part like the biggest reason why I ever smoked at all was always just for that feeling so it's pretty badass also I haven't smoked today but last time we did CB I've only done this once up I'd like some Rick Simpson oil it helps it definitely crosses with the THC it's not just like it's own little thing it's right now I definitely feel a little bit warmer which is awesome I don't feel like baits but just like my favorite part of being baked basically so I could just go off with straight CBD all the time except for the price the price is kind of a funky thing here but that was just a tiny little piece from out of here probably like point zero five G I don't want to do a whole lot of this since it's my mom's right now but that was a tasty little tiny little dab there but their house really good but I just don't know if there's anything else that I have to say about it specifically hmm but I mean that yeah like I'm basically just looping here but that is the biggest thing with it I'd say just that warmness definitely really alright I mean that's all I have to say for the video but I don't want to just end it right yet so just like this is just so this is what the container looks like here the CB oh [ __ ] I'm so clumsy I'm sorry okay the CB distillery CBE was check that out isn't that awesome but you have this is pretty incredible I can't believe this is like over 99% CBD so it just forms almost like Crystal Light really interesting kind of [ __ ] but yep that is that CBD right there and yeah I don't have much else to say about that so thank you very much for watching that's a good dad I oh I really like that feeling I can't wait until I get somewhere legal like with the dispensary so that the prices start going down because that feels really good and I could go days on just CBD and I'm sure I would get so much [ __ ] done because yeah non psychoactive and it's yeah but like my legs melting right into the chair right now so thank you for watching this very much and I hope you like the setup I mean I spent spent the morning on I think I'll probably keep something similar to this I've always wanted the table in front of me and yeah", "dbwjb94BBHo": "[Music] today I'm going to be talking to you about taking medicines sublingually this is done by putting a cannabis extract usually a tension under your tongue or rubbing it on your gums and letting it absorb there for a few minutes taking your medicine this way allows the extract to go straight into your bloodstream without passing through your stomach or your digestive tract now this is useful because it offers high bioavailability it has a longer effect at inhalation and is a really clean way to take medicine this intake method has a wide range of uses and it's a wonderful way to start your relationship with cannabis it's predictable and hasn't even killed onset and this can be really useful for a more subtle effect for instance when taken for general lifestyle enhancement here are some key things to keep in mind with sublingual intake products use sublingually come in the form of tinctures infusions or concentrates this method allows for extremely accurate doses tinctures are often measured by the drop and concentrates by weight and if you're using a concentrate we recommend that you use a high-quality digital scale as well because this will really help you with your accuracy it's really important to use clean safe medicine and be aware that not all cannabis extracts are created equally the concentration levels and the extract processes can vary quite a bit and as always we recommend lab tested as best as you can easily see what you're getting now the onset time with sublingual in takers generally between ten and thirty minutes and depending on your goals we suggest starting with a minimal dose and if more is wanted or needed you can easily increase in a really short period of time now if taking a THC dominant cannabis oil there is likely to be some cycle activity you may like to go back and revisit the introduction to cannabis intake methods video in which we shared some typical effects of psycho activity tinctures are typically dissolved in either olive oil coconut oil or alcohol we like the oil versions because cannabis interacts really well with fats and they also tend to be a little bit more pleasant to take as well in terms of taste today we have some examples of tinctures infused oils and concentrates to show you and they're going to demonstrate how to measure your dose and take each of them sublingually so let's get acquainted with products that can be used for sublingual use now remember sublingual use is when you put a product under your tongue or on your gums and inner cheek so that it can be absorbed into your body now today I'm going to show you concentrates as well as liquids or tinctures that can be used for something we'll use before I get into those specifically I want to make a point really with sublingual use and with any of these products you know the form of the product whether it's a concentrate that hasn't been dead looted into any other substance or a tincture for example that has been diluted into something like alcohol olive oil or coconut oil but remember no matter the form of the product you don't necessarily know by looking at it how concentrated it is you can dose it but without knowing the concentration of cannabis within that specific product you won't know exactly how many milligrams you're taking so it's a little bit of what we're gonna get into today now concentrates obviously from their name are one of the most potent purest form of cannabis usually this is a pure form of cannabis that has been extracted from the plant either from bud from shake or any other forms of the plant itself now given that how highly concentrated the medicine is you really want to be careful with it and be able to measure it one way to do that is through the syringe where it has actual measurements but the other tool you want to use is a digital scale so that you know exactly how concentrated the medicine is inside as well as the exact weight that you're getting when you take when you actually put it in your body and those two combinations of pieces of information really tell you what dose you're taking and that way you can track what dose measure its effects and then dose effectively going forward now a great way to do this for concentrates is to use a piece of a rice paper now rice paper paper because it's edible and it dissolves in your mouth and that way you can actually get to concentrate on the scale put it onto the rice paper weigh it know what you're taking and then simply put it into your mouth under your tongue and let it dissolve there that way it's not messy rice paper is also great if you want to just measure your medicine once maybe put it in the fridge or the freezer and then take it later you can have those doses for yourself ready for at a later date so that you don't have to create as much of a mess these products can be a little bit hard to deal with they're a little bit of molasses II as you can see from the color of this all right so constantly it's very effective usually they're used for much more severe conditions when you're trying to get much higher dose of medicine into your body let's move on to liquids or sometimes called tinctures now these can be infused into a number of liquids as I mentioned that you're usually alcohol or oils which can be usually coconut oil or olive oil what happens with this process is the medicine is extracted through various methods there's co2 there's butane there's other alcohol extracts and then that concentrate is then infused back into an oil or they leave a little bit of the alcohol and put it back into alcohol that way diluting the medicine a little bit to be able to take and be taken in liquid form when taking it's pretty intuitive it's nice because you can dose the medicine very effectively with the dropper now ideally your dropper has some type of measuring mechanism on it so you know exactly the milliliters that you're taking and can dose that again you really want to know how concentrated you dis medicine is it could have for example one corner oil and a lot of medicine that's a very concentrated tincture it could have you know 95% oil and 5% medicine those are very different products very different medicines depending on the dose okay so pay attention to that know from your labels and from your medicine providers how concentrated that medicine is now when taking medicine simply put it on your tongue as mentioned let it absorb there and that's how you can take a sublingual tincture all in all sublingual medicine is a great way to take medicine get it into your body effectively with high bioavailability remember the points that we touched on it's really important to know how concentrated your medicine is and it's important to measure it effectively to be able to track", "Ij46cs0RuvM": "[Applause] [Music] bath bombs are an easy gift idea and adding CBD isn't hard to do so if you want to give the gift of relaxation here's what you'll need baking soda corn starch Epsom salt and citric acid these are your dry ingredients you'll also need essential oil coconut oil CBD infused oil bath bomb molds water and food coloring I mix the wet ingredients first starting with the coconut oil it's a solid at room temperature so I put it in the microwave for a few seconds and then I added it to a mason jar with the rest of the wet ingredients [Music] I used two types of essential oil here peppermint and eucalyptus [Music] one thing to keep in mind is that the color of the CBD oil will influence the final product so my first batch was very yellow I used less CBD oil and more food coloring in my second batch and I ended up with a nice light blue shade if you care about the color of the final product just make sure to use enough food coloring to counteract the yellow from the CBD oil it's time to mix the dry ingredients when citric acid and baking soda meet water they undergo a chemical reaction and that's what you're seeing when the bath bomb is fizzing up and making bubbles the cornstarch slows down the chemical reaction so you can actually control how long your bath bomb fizzes just by playing with the ratio between these dry ingredients I'll leave tips on how to do this below the video this step isn't hard but it does require patience slowly mix the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and when I say slowly I really do mean just a few drops at a time you don't want the dry ingredients to start to react if the mixture starts to get really fizzy you're going a little too fast when you're done the mixture should feel like damp sand now it's time to pack this mixture into the molds as quickly as possible press the mixture into the mold firmly you'll want to slightly overfill each one so that when you press them together there isn't a gap between the two halves [Music] these will be dry in a few hours but I recommend leaving them overnight removing the top half is easy sometimes the bottom half comes right off but if it doesn't just tap the metal a few times and try again this whole process involved about 15 minutes of actual work you do have to factor in drying time but this is a great option for inexpensive gifts that can easily be made in batches if you're trying to tackle several gifts at the same time if you choose to add CVD supposedly there are anti-inflammatory benefits but with any wellness trend you should do your own research to see if it's something you're into you can find more information about the instructions and the materials down

of an educational video hello everybody my name is Ana and welcome to [ __ ] back to my channel for today's video we have a bit of an educational one because this video is sponsored by herb strong so I figured why not take this opportunity while working with such a company and make it a little bit educational and explain the difference or differences about a few different things specifically hemp CBD and weed because I made videos like this in the past and there's just so much confusion between those terms and that is why I'm here to clear it all up for you guys but first before we get into that let's talk a little bit about herb straw so herb strong is actually hemp oil full-spectrum an oil to be exact what does that mean but simply it means it is extracted from head but what is hand Panna is hemp weed no it's not we I'm going to incident in just one second but first let me show you this so this is what my friends over at herbs drunk sent me and it is [ __ ] great I always talk about how much I love packaging and all my sponsored videos and look how cool that [ __ ] Wow I love speaking English how cool that packaging is I love it it's kind of hard to see because of the material because it's so cool but it says recovery drops a thousand milligrams full spectrum hemp oil guys look at the packaging of this I [ __ ] love it also it looks like it's not open but it's open and it's used I used it a few times I just never took the piece of plastic off so it looks like it's not open but it is you guys can see right there look at those drops packaging people I'm telling you packaging is key if you want to work with me on my channel you better have good package like look how cute this is a can't get over it but the cuteness doesn't even matter the effects are what we need to talk about also its cuteness a word I'm not really sure so I'm gonna talk in depth you know the differences between hemp CBD we need a cannabis all that good [ __ ] in just a few minutes but first what I will say because this is full spectrum hemp oil within hemp you will find many cannabinoids and cannabinoids are what is known to help pain nausea sleep anxiety you know the list goes on and on even things such as inflammation now I was happy that herbs drug sent me that when they did because I used it you may or may not know that I had a bit of a difficult week if you follow me on Twitter or followed me that is you know that the last thing I was tweeting about was having like a major anxiety attack which I still don't know if who wasn't attack or if it was just mania induced by the prednisone it's a long story maybe I'll make an update video on it called prednisone made me go crazy but we will talk about that you know later the point here is I had really really really bad anxiety just a few days ago and being honest when I had that full-blown anxiety attack that I was tweeting about I tried those drops for the first time and they didn't do anything that's how you know this is an honest review the reason why they didn't do anything is because the anxiety tech that I had when I was tweeting about it it was just like out of this world like I said I don't even know if it was an anxiety attack something was induced in my brain due to the prednisone that I was on and you know that just couldn't really counteract it however the next day I had a lingering anxiety and this was still really hard to manage but it wasn't anything near what it was when you know I deactivated much okay my camera just stopped I meant to say that it wasn't anything compared to the day before but the next day it was still bad I tried the drops again and it [ __ ] worked like almost instantly and literally made me think like is this a placebo but I know that it wasn't because I've used CBD in the past every time I do CBD videos I'm always blown away by like how much it can help you is it really does help you so much and this was almost instant not like instant like you know 30 seconds but it was so so quick and it's literally so easy to use all you do is put it under your tongue and wait put this up here boom and you guys know I would never recommend something to you especially medical if I didn't actually stand by and I stand by this [ __ ] so if you guys want to go check out herbs drawing just go on over to herbs join calm yam cream which is what I want next so hopefully they work with me again because I want to try that [ __ ] they even have products for your animals so like I said going over to their website to check them out and if you're gonna make a purchase you know I have to hook it up use discount code and a-15 so now that I talked about that let's get into the educational part of this video what is the difference between CBD weed hemp cannabis marijuana what of all these terms mean first let's talk about cannabis I feel like the term cannabis has became like a term that we just associate with weed or marihuana we're getting high but that's not the case at all cannabis is a type of plant within cannabis there are different strains of this plant so yes we does come from cannabis but hemp also comes from cannabis let me explain a little bit more thoroughly let's go back to the cannabis plant so like I said there our different strains of the cannabis plant some will get you high some will not so how do you tell which strain is gonna get you Stoney baloney in which strain is not gonna get you Stoney baloney that is where the term THC comes into play what does THC in for it's like tetra hydro not tetra hydro something I'll [ __ ] know and if I looked it up probably wouldn't even be able to pronounce it we're just gonna say THC THC is in cannabis plants if the cannabis plant has more than 0.3% THC it is considered marijuana meaning it will get you Stoney baloney if you smoke if the cannabis plant has less than 0.3 percent THC it is known as hep meaning it will not get you Stoney baloney if you smoke it however because what is known as cannabinoids both strains of plants have medical properties so let's get even a little bit more scientific air throughout our entire body we have what is known as the endocannabinoid system cannabinoid cannabis right and like I said this system is all throughout our bodies and our legs it's in our backs it's enough Summit's it's in our [ __ ] face it's in our brain it's literally throughout our entire body and that is why there are so many medical like properties and effects when it comes to ingesting cannabis such as inflammation pain anxiety nausea insomnia the list literally goes on and on and on and that is because of the endocannabinoid system within our body so when you ingest hemp or CBD it's going throughout your body however when you smoke THC that is the psychoactive ingredient even though it's not an ingredient I don't know if that's the right term I don't know how else to put it though it's the psychoactive part that is found in the cannabis plant when there is a high level of THC also let me say most cannabis plants that are like marijuana they're mostly between five and twenty five percent THC whereas non like marijuana cannabis hemp CBD all that good stuff is less than 0.3 that difference is huge does that make sense when I make these educational informative type of videos I never know if it's gonna make sense until I'm editing it so right now future Ana editing this is probably like yes you explain that so thoroughly good job or like you stupid [ __ ] you didn't make sense at all so hopefully this is making sense to you because that's pretty much it put simply really quickly again like if I had to sum this like 30 seconds or less trying to explain the differences to you this is how I would put it there's a cannabis plant there's different strains of the cannabis plant all cannabis plants have THC if it has more than 0.3% THC it's psychoactive if it has less than 0.3 percent THC it is not going to get you high it is not psychoactive this is where CBD comes into play and that comes into play when you ingest CBD or heme it still has the medical properties because of our endocannabinoid system however it is not psychoactive so it's not going to get you Stoney baloney make sense well I just summed up the difference in like 30 seconds watch you guys watching this order to be like this [ __ ] made no sense at all but I hope I did because like I said that is it and I don't want to drag this video on and just add in a bunch of like unnecessary details because that's what this video is about and it is as simple as that oh I guess another cool fact about him since this video is kind of like hemp face is literally everything is made of hemp paper can be made of hemp loli can be made of hemp furniture can be made of hemp literally like anything you can imagine can be made of hemp and hemp and Abyss whatever is one of the like oldest crops it is so frustrating that this camera always shuts

its function what it doesn't show is really the the clinical applications this information yet we have a long way to go to make those strongly correlated in terms of what actually can be used and applied for patient populations what we've identified is a mechanism by which the intestine naturally protects itself from inflammation people wondered how that occurs because we're kosta bombarded by not only bacteria but also all kinds of things that we eat and some people suffer from colitis and other conditions related to the inflammation that occurs in their intestine what other people don't so what's the mechanism and how do we control that from happening all the time our publication that's coming out identifies cannabinoids as a critical element to protect the human intestine from that that Auto inflammation that can occur in response to these environmental cues we've understood a lot in terms of how inflammation can be induced and and that's very common but we'd like to know is how people really can be protected from that inflammation and so we've been looking for now the factors that the body naturally makes to protect us that was more difficult challenge it's easy enough to find the things that start the fire so to speak it's hard to find the fire extinguishers that are sitting there quietly waiting to be turned on every once in a while as they're needed so it's taken us a long time to get to this point to find out how to protect ourselves from these inflammations and where the cannabinoids do is they actually provide that that sort of passive kind of suppression system what we're very concerned about is making sure that people appreciate the value of this and the understanding of it that this is not anything more than an explanation of how the inflammation occurs at this one location in the body it's not a we're not condoning the use of application of anything at this point because we have a lot more studies to do to really understand how to apply this best", "ReCqlXbnBGg": "children who couldn't go a minute without having ten seizures being able to live relatively normal lives that's just one part of one of the scheduled things that has changed

strange city um today sorry madam today we're gonna be smoking on a good little variety here of this concentrate and I just I like going over concentrate because it is a new thing and people really know about cannabis already they know about the flower they know about weed and what it all is but not a lot people know about concentrate and concentrate is just like if you're gonna take an olive and squishing squishing squish it and get olive oil out it's the same concept except we apply heat some solvents and sometimes it's solvent Liss so it just really depends on what you're getting what type it is and that's what I'm gonna go over this but people you know not in Colorado and not in a legal state that can get this kind of stuff or even knows what it is that they can be careful and that they can they can understand what this is and that it's not crack it's not heroin it's not anything like that and I kind of get the sense that people think that because sometimes you need a torch to smoke cousin just no concentrate and you don't really need that we've got our email set up which is an electronic mail a lot of people know what these are some people don't it's an electronic mail it has a titanium coil and it wraps around a titanium nail let's see if I can get these separated here so yes this is my email what it is is a type this is my titanium nail and what it does is this part is wrapped around a center see if we can get yeah you guys can see where that little hole is and right in that ring where there's not the hole is where I put my mic concentrate or you know my man I like to call it my medicine because I actually do smoke for medical purposes so one by one will slowly go over what these all are I have wax I have shatter my co2 so this is gonna be I'm not sure visit I would call this an oil so I've got an oil or shatter in a wax so without further ado this wax this is gonna be a wax now wax can be anywhere from clay light consistency to a buttery like you know play-doh like consistency you know from a hard clay to a really soft play-doh so this one right here specifically is platinum blueberries so the color and the name don't really correlate all the time but that kind of shows you guys kind of what wax is like it kind of has a see if I can get a good it's kind of it's kind of chunky I tried to break some rock but that's not gonna be able to see that too well so we've got a wax that's kind of buttery like and kind of play-doh like consistency alright and this is this is really good for like bait pins anything like that I enjoy it butter and stuff more in bait pens and stuff I don't really vape at all of them so this is gonna be another wax just to kind of show you guys this one's a little bit harder consistency and a little bit more grainy but you guys can probably get the gist of what I'm talking about a little explaining it correctly so those are waxes I'm gonna move to a shadow which has a more glass like consistency to it and a shinier and is more solid I guess in a form so this is shatter and this is very beautiful shatter at that this is another name is cuz my favorite critical mass that's what it is it's my favorite strain this is very good for pain this is a very high CBD count compared to other strains so I'm honestly gonna be taking a DAB to this first - tbh you guys but this stuff is really really beautiful I'll go ahead and give you another little there's through the song but I do enjoy all different types so chatter is more glass like and more and more hard I guess a more hard and harder my girl might be so mad right now and then harder and it's consistency and it's glassy that's the best I can put it is pretty much like glass or like plastic you're gonna snap it it's gonna break so this stuff it's in a syringe and a syringe dumping needles crack down on all that chronic crap so this right here is full of you can kind of see it's got a shim not shimmery but it's kind of an amber e color mmm this right here is a used one obviously but it only comes with a gram of concentrate in it and this is made with co2 so the difference this is an oil so if I if I do this with it it's gonna this little string of oil come out and that's in that soil so you've got oil which is really runny now we've got shatter which is glassy and hard and we've got wax which is play-doh light consistency is the best way to put it so that is a run around of all of not all of the types but a good mix of the types of concentrates the consistencies they don't really change like live resin can be shatter YX come you know oil it can be all of those so the the main ones are gonna be oil wax and shatter until you get into like the crystal lines and in the crystal it and that kind of stuff so that's a that's a crystal and I would still call that shatter at that so with that being said we'll take a DAB for you guys what do you need to mean you need a ver Cheers oh well guys I appreciate you watching enjoy", "prC-C0HpFJM": "all right today guys we're going to be talking about tank chips alright so today we'll be talking about tinctures all the textures that we'll be using in this video will be our essential CBD brand good thing about our brand we use all the same drivers for all the bottles so they're all going to be calibrated you're never going to be guessing on how much oil I should be taking so it's something like this you could see where we would have a calibrated dropper that way you can get to that one milliliter line and know how much you're supposed to be taking instead of taking about 20 drops or about five drops you know just fill it up to where you need it to be take your dose easy enough something else that we have would be something like this this would be a different kind of tincture we offer so the first one I showed was an isolating sure that was 16 milligrams for one full dropper this is a full spectrum tincture and what full-spectrum means is that instead of getting just that CVD isolate you're gonna be getting the full plant so rather than being just CVD with the carrier oil which we use MCT oil for you'll be getting the vitamins nutrients the other amino acids your fatty acids as well as the other candidates and there is some THC in a full spectrum formula one thing that we do not have to offer here would be a broad spectrum and what broad spectrum is is isolate with all the cannabinoids vitamins nutrients but with no THC still so what we're really looking at here is isolate and full-spectrum we do not have a broad spectrum option at least as of right now so this is what we'll be working with today two more options we have would be these two teachers and what these are are the red is a isolate tincture just like the yellow one but instead of being 16 milligrams for a full dropper it is a 60 milligrams for a full dropper and this blue one it's a full spectrum just like the green one but instead of being 10 milligrams it's 40 milligrams one good thing to know to just while we're talking about the bottles is the big number on the outside of any tincture bottle that might not always be right at the top but there's gonna be one big number somewhere on here that is always going to be the full contents of CBD in that bottle that is not what you're getting per dose a good way to look at it is the big number divided by servings that's how much you're getting per serving all right so I wanted us to ask Patrick you know one super common question we get when people come into the shop so are you able to use any of these tinctures and put them in food beverages or are they specifically only for like under the double use yeah of course I mean like he said you know we need asked that a lot one thing that I usually tell people is it doesn't hurt you're not you know I mean you might lose some you know of the CBD through digestion but you're gonna get that with an edible anyways you know just the same way the only thing you really lose is traditionally you would take the tincture under your tongue but you know we died you tell people yeah it's it's okay the only thing you're losing is instead of taking it under your tongue and getting into your system quickly it will have to digest you know so instead of you know under the tongue right into the blood vessel you mix it in some water mix it in some food you just got to wait until it gets in through your system that way but yeah nothing wrong with it really you know nothing wrong with doing it that way okay and I heard them for you explaining the differences between the isolate and the full spectrum and I've also heard you know the term water-soluble being around with tinctures are these water soluble or no these are not made with a water soluble CBD what we use is just a you know regular isolate extract it's a pure co2 99.99 now you know a completely pure clean isolate rather than the water soluble yeah that's just kind of what we go with her now so what we're gonna do is we're gonna now show you just a quick demonstration on how to use the tincture or how we suggest use the tincture you know like I said before you can use it you know just put it in food or put it in a drink but this is the suggested way in the best way to use it we're gonna start by just filling up our tincture dropper to that 1.0 line or at least to as close as we can get it to and again we're talking about the very top line on this dropper that's gonna be that one milliliter mark that would be one full dose so that's what we're gonna try and do we're gonna try and get up there you know sometimes the tincture doesn't fill all the way with just one squirt so yeah so with here we got to just about the 0.75 line and I'll take this point seven-five I'll fill it back up to the point - that'd be a full dose but what I'm gonna do just for the demonstration is just one one shot at the 0.75 so you take your dose and we're gonna put it right underneath our tongue hold it for about 30 seconds and then swallow at 30 seconds - 90 seconds is what suggestion that's the longer you leave it the more time it has to soak into your blood vessels the more we'll get directly into your system and hopefully the quicker you'll start to feel that effect so without further ado we'll take our tincture all right so 30 seconds is what I counted in my head just swallow and after that mouth clear took my tincture so now that I've taken the tincture that's really it there's nothing much more to it I know it might look a little bit more intimidating than it you know truly is but once you get that step down I'll just getting it up to your dose under the tongue holding it for 30 seconds it's not bad it's bearable good thing about us here on earth is that we don't add any artificial flavorings or any additives or anything at all besides what's necessarily needed so like you've seen on those isolate bottles that says unflavored because it has a no taste to it at all there's no taste the MCT oil we used is completely under flavored CBD isolate has no natural taste as well so it has less flavor than a glass of water you'll get from your sink the full spectrum formulas on the other hand they have some type of a hemp you know natural earthy flavor but they're not unbearable a lot of companies which you if you are afraid of that hemp taste when you go to buy a tincture if you don't end up going with our own you know check essential see be calm if you are interested or come on down to earth dispensary but if you do decide to shop with another brand and you know you're just watching this video for you know tincture advice or you know how to is things like that if you don't want that real heavy taste and you don't want those artificial flavorings to try and cover that up just don't get a brand that uses hemp seed oil some companies like to use it to throw in the extra vitamins and nutrients when it's not full spectrum and some people use it as just the carrier oil but hemp seed oil will amplify that hemp taste to places you never wanted it to be before so again if you don't want that hemp taste don't get hemp seed oil stick with us MCT oil flavorless or even the full spectrum with that watered-down flavor where it's not as strong and that was all thanks for watching the video then forget to check our central CBD comm for all your CBD needs tinctures topicals smokeable vapor bulls anything you can think of we got it or just stop on down to Earth's dispensary at 1200 East Oklahoma in Bayview Milwaukee Wisconsin thank you", "ibM9J9t9jkg": "hey all trevor here with ready to leave and today we're actually gonna be diving into a cbd dominant vape we've got the 20 to one ease cbd vape from sundial that we're going to be diving into today we've got that right here i can't wait to get into this and all the other goodies that are involved with the reviews today on the other side of this intro so i will see you guys over there when we've got the intro in and out and uh we'll be tapping into some information on this 20 to one cbd ease vape from sundial y'all cheers and i'll see you over there back you guys so as i said in the intro we've got ourselves a 20 to one cbd dominant vaporizer from sundial this is the only pure cbd cartridge on the market that i am aware of there may be other ones but i only know of this one right now so before we go into the actual information for this cartridge we're gonna dive into the information that's on the box so this came in with a thc total of 3.5 a cbd total of 70 percent nice and rich and high with that cb d on this cartridge it has a package date of the 20th of july 2020 and it came in right around that 49.99 plus tax so at 50 plus tax you guys is uh what the price of this 510 cartridge is going to be i do have the sundial cannabis website pulled up we're going to dive into that a little bit and cover this 20 to 1 vape information that they have there before we actually get into the urban scale and start smoking on it so the cbd 20 to 1 vape is a part of sundials ease series which is going to be primarily the cbd dominant strains so the cbd 20 to 1 is a natural cannabis extract high extract rich in cbd with a good concentration of cbg and cbc and only minimal thc this non-intoxicating vape is ideal for any time fitting into your cbd routine sundial vape produces sundial vape produce okay let's try that again sundial vape products are grown and extracted at the care of using co2 processing and packaged in a c cell glass ceramic cartridge that flows smoothly with every draw so you can get it in a 0.5 gram 510 cartridge which is what we've got screwed into the fireside battery here we've got a 510 car starter kit which is going to be the cartridge a power supply and a usb power charger then you get the all-in-one or disposable vape pen you guys so i'm really curious and excited to see how this vaporizer is gonna do um the missus tried it out last night one big thing i've noticed from last night to today is it looks like it's crystallized in this cartridge here and i might have just gotten one that's a little bit wonky but uh we'll we're gonna see if it functions i took one quick haul at the lowest temperature on the fire side you guys to see how it was the misses definitely really enjoyed trying it out last night so it's my turn to dive into it and really see what it has to offer so we're gonna start out with the fireside battery you guys after that we go to the g pen battery we throw in a little bit of glass to find the final taste to see if the water percolation changes any of the flavors that we experience then we talk about the high and the overall finally to wrap up the video we've got all of that we've got to dive into you guys but first we've got the urban scale intro before we actually get into the fun part the smokable part of this review i will see you guys on the other side when uh we're diving in with the fireside battery on this cartridge cheers and i'll see you over there [Music] welcome back you guys so as i said we're diving into the fireside 20 to one cbd vape we're starting out with fireside battery so these containers at sundial puts their cartridges in are quite unique if you guys haven't seen the way these ones work you actually have to push that lid down and rotate it to line up right there before you can pop it off there we go come here line up and there you go pops off it just sits very deeply in there and i'm this type of packaging personally i would say is a little bit extravagant and excessive for what you're going to need but it isn't the worst one i've seen you guys now going into the cartridge we're going to dive in with the fiber side battery first and see what we get through here we're going to take a haul on the lowest temp medium and then the highest before we do the exact same thing with firestep battery then we bring it back to or the g pen battery you guys and we bring it back to the fire side we do it all over again but through the rigs so we've got a 16 holes on this no a dozen we're gonna be taking a dozen rips on this pen and maybe one extra at the end but uh the only way we're gonna find out how this cartridge does and uh overall experience is by tapping in and smoking you guys so let's tap in and start smoking this cartridge cheers and i'll see you guys on the other side of uh the lowest tampa rip we'll chat about it a little bit then we'll go to the medium and the high change you guys okay guys so it had a really light earthy kind of flavor it's nothing overwhelming it's not really it's actually reminding me quite a bit of the shish kabari the fireside cartridge you guys where it doesn't really have any strong overwhelming flavors or leaning towards one way or another with the strong overwhelming flavors but just kind of hit you with a really nice and light cannabis flavor that i'm enjoying quite a bit you guys let's take the next rip see if it continues along this way [Music] still really smooth really mild for its overall hit when you do haul off of it it is just honestly a really nice and light experience when you're smoking this it's not harsh by any means and it doesn't hit you with that heavy vapor lung that i found some of the other cartridges do but again it's just kind of hitting you with that generic cannabis flavor which personally i don't mind but i could see a lot of people looking for more that flavored kind of experience too where you get more that with the heavier thc stranger guys but we're uh gonna go ahead and take a rip of this at the highest level and see what experience we have to look forward there cheers you guys [Music] okay guys so i've got the fireside battery marked at a 7 out of 10 for the score it really wasn't overwhelming with its flavor or exciting or anything along those lines it was just kind of enjoyable and light and just that mild cannabis flavor there's nothing really special about this it's enjoyable and the cbd is definitely where i think this is going to be the beneficial factor of its where it doesn't have that heavy duty thc hit with it it's just the cbd and i think that's gonna be the winning point the flavor itself although enjoyable isn't really memorable or exciting in any way so that's why seven out of ten is the best i can do now through the fire side we've got the bigger ports on here so we're able to usually get a little bit of a heavier haul which typically helps with the flavor so i'm hopeful that we get a little bit more flavor and experience through this cartridge you guys but we will not know until we actually dive in and try it out let's start doing that right now cheers and i'll uh see you guys on the other side of the low temp through the g-pad again stage really smooth really easy to draw through definitely one of the smoothest carts i've had to draw for functionability of the the cartridge itself and how smooth the concentrate in and of itself is now we're going to bump up to the second temperature on the g pen you guys and see what it does through there before we finish it off in the high cheers again it's just staying that really light mild cannabis flavor that hints and leans towards one another but it doesn't like it it hints towards a sweeter canvas flavor but then it sits that on that earthy side hints towards a more earthy flavor but then it sits on the sweeter side like it's very mid-range non-memorable enjoyable but nothing really exciting you guys and even on the highest it just doesn't have the oomph that i'm looking for in the flavor to really get me excited and looking forward to it you guys i think i'm only going to give it a 7 out of 10 still for the g pen just because there wasn't any different experience between the g pen and the fireside battery honestly it was just overall kind of a midline experience you guys and i although i enjoyed it i didn't although i enjoyed the smoke i didn't experience i didn't enjoy the experience that's the better way to go it's smooth it's nice to smoke on but it's just not exciting but we're gonna see if the glass helps out with that at all we're gonna take our way through all three of the rips starting with the lowest temp working our way up to the highest you guys and the way we do that is we preheat the last temp and we just quickly flash through three ribs so i will see you after we are done our three rips through the glass on this and then we'll uh be chatting about it before we move on over to the g pen you guys let's uh let's get going on this cheers almost running on the highest temp let's run on the lowest actually to start off choose you guys still incredibly smooth you guys and um but nothing really that exciting there's a little hint of mint on that one you guys interesting interesting that this is the first time i'm starting to get it but let's uh tap into the highest temp when it's preheated cheers all in all you guys not that bad not overly enjoyable not overly exciting but not that bad i'm uh impressed with the flavors that i'm getting off the cartridge for overall experience but they lack of like a memorable flavor is disappointing so it's enjoyable to smoke while you're smoking it but afterwards i think you guys will forget it quite quickly and it definitely seems more as a complimentary cart so it uh it would be great to smoke this and then start smoking something else that you have that stronger flavor stronger thc effect that you're looking for but if you just want the cbd this is definitely an interesting card and worthwhile checking out you guys i'm uh i'm enjoying it so far now we're gonna take our rips through the g pen before we move on over into the score for the taste from the glass and the high before we wrap it up with the overall yike guys but uh oh excuse me i'm getting ahead of myself let's dive into this cartridge combo with the rig see how it does y'all cheers and i'll see on the other side of these three rips we will be pre-heating the last one like we normally do there's the pine starting to play a little bit of a factor what in the [ __ ] now we've got cart issues you guys and this one that's exactly why we had the crystallization in there is what's going to cause the issue on this cart you guys this whole cart has just solidified with the crystallization overnight what in the hell i thought we'd be able to get through this whole review you guys but we're not not getting anything through there let's preheat the water the hottest and see if that helps anything or is it that the batteries just dead we'll see we'll see [Music] okay that's all it is folks battery's dead cartridge still works um honestly i'm not that worried about diving into the other two um temperatures on here you guys i didn't get anything different from the g pen the first time i don't think i'm going to get anything different through this other two temps um the taste from a glass i i am going to bump it up to the eight just because that pine flavor started to play a factor and i'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt i am going to give it the benefit of the doubt with that g pen to be experiencing a little bit more pine a little bit more flavor in that uh in that rig you guys but it wasn't overwhelming it wasn't really anything that memorable about it but that little bit of pine makes it enough to go i enjoyed it you guys and i like i look forward to smoking some more through the g pen more so than the fireside battery just because the extra large ports and the easier the mobility of the vapor through there but the amount of flavor that i did have just doesn't constitute anything higher than a weak eight out of ten for the fire side on the the glass and the g pen on the glass you guys that the little bit of pine flavor that i was getting through the glass is the only thing that really can justify that eight now going on with the high i am i'm not gonna give this a 10 but i will give it a nine it is extremely clear-headed extremely easy extremely relaxing just a nice clear-headed medicated type of smoke you guys if you're looking for something to just give you that little bit of emotional support and emotional pick-me-up very very worthwhile cartridge to look at for an all-day smoke um saying that you're not going to get the benefit of the thc in there so if you're looking for the pain relief or anything along those lines you're not going to have that benefit as big of a factor as it is through the cartridge however they've each got their use they've each got the purpose they've each got their intention now using the cbd in correlation with a heavier thc strain is something i personally really love to do i really do enjoy mixing my heavy cbd and my heavy thc i find the highs are a little bit more balanced it's a lot more encouraging uplifting that like very much more of the assisting versus the recreational dosing that i tend to experience with just pure thc strength um the pure cbd are gonna be that raw medical that that just assistance kind of smoking experience that i have and that's really the big difference between the two you guys is i find that the cbd is more medical more supportive the thc heavy thc is more recreational it does have its medical place for certain people myself i like a combination of cbd and thc to kind of alleviate all the uh all the stuff that i like and prefer to use cannabis for versus pharmaceuticals or anything else you guys but um for now we're quickly going to wrap up i'll be back when i add up the overall and uh let you guys know how this cartridge did 31 out of 40 it ended up doing for the cartridge which is surprisingly well it's not quite in that beautiful garbage i think it's only a point off but it it just lacked the intensity of the flavor that's really what brought it down if it had that pine experience and flavor throughout you guys i think it would have done well i really do i think it would have had eights throughout the flavor because that light pine flavor was enjoyable and hinting and just a nice and unexpected performance for a cartridge that i wasn't all in all expecting that much flavor really that well over performance from but it did well it definitely did a lot better than i was expecting you guys and i think it is worthwhile checking out if you like the cbd dominant content or the cbd dominant cannabis based product you guys um especially if you're looking at the vaporizers give it a shot i don't mind it myself but for the time being we're going to wrap the sucker up we're going to be diving into some oregon golden goat tomorrow you guys voted on it from canica you decided you want to see that strain so that's what we're going to be diving into tomorrow i'm really looking forward to seeing how that one does i haven't smoked that strain yet you guys so

the the content because i'm enjoying making the the content let's wrap this one up cheers you guys i will be back later with some more content", "bn2khiRXFZ4": "hey everyone dr nessie here again and today let's talk about how cbd oil may help you lose weight that's up next [Music] okay so getting right into the subject today we are talking about cbd oil and how it potentially can help you in your weight loss journey cbd oil is the hot new thing in healthcare in general really people use it to treat anything from stomach ailments to anxiety all the way up sometimes to cancer treatments so we're not going to talk about any other uses of cbd oil other than how it may help you lose weight this is a weight loss channel after all so to do so we are going to look at two specific studies and we're gonna use the white board so we're gonna look at two studies one on mice or rats and the other is a study in humans so this first one is a 2011 study using mice and what the researchers did was they treated mice with cbd oil and they found that the mice that were treated with cbd oil had a significant decrease in their body weight after treatment the rationale that the researchers gave was there's a cb2 receptor and cb2 antagonists lead often to appetite suppression so these rats were eating less because the cbd oil was an antagonist to the cb2 receptor and it caused the rats to eat less therefore they lost weight so if we talk about this in humans while a human study has not been done yet we can surmise that potentially the same effect would happen in humans a lot of people believe that cbd oil is an appetite suppressant now if you think about marijuana marijuana and cbd oil are two completely different things there's thc in marijuana marijuana often causes hunger and that's a pretty common uh thing out there you know getting the munchies when you when you uh are doing marijuana so that does not happen when you do cbd oil there's no thc in cbd oil so cbd oil potentially could cause you to have less of an appetite therefore eat less and then lose weight research study number two this was done on humans and it was done five years later we're talking about a 2016 study now and we're talking about the activation of browning in white fat cells so they so humans this time were treated with cbd oil now there's two types of fat white fat and that's the fat that we typically think of like if you grab a hold of of your love handle and you've got a love handle there and that's white fat brown fat is a different type of fat so what we're trying to do is get the white fat to turn into brown fat it's called the browning of white cells white fat cells so what the reason we want that is brown fat is oftentimes termed as good fat brown fat is what keeps you warm it it undergoes a very high level of thermogenesis or it burns a lot of energy based on how big it is so it's often thought of as a treatment for obesity because of how much energy it can burn relative to its size so the more brown fat we have relative to white fat the more energy we're going to burn and the more weight loss we can expect so this wasn't a particular weight loss study it was a study seeing how cbd oil reacted to white fat cells and if it could cause this browning effect which it did so there's two studies there again one in rats so we've gotta make sure that we understand this was in a human trial and then an actual human trial and with two different effects we're looking at two different processes appetite suppression and then actually the changing of the white cell the browning of the white fat cell so i particularly i we don't use cbd oil we don't use cbd oil in our clinics we don't use that for treatment as of now the reason more research is needed this is just not enough to give us enough information saying that it's actually going to be a weight loss aid more research is coming out it seems like monthly we're reading new things about cbd oil and its effects but it's not there yet so we don't use it quite yet but it looks promising alright i hope this was informative if you like these type of videos please consider subscribing to this channel you

"kptr6yrH37E": "hi friends I'm Whitney welcome back to another episode of the sitch today we're talking about CBD who knew that's something I thought I had the left behind in my wild college days would become so popular in the health and fitness world Oh what it's not the same thing as never mind cv d stands for cannabidiol which is one of the two major compounds found in the marijuana plant unlike THC though CBD doesn't produce a euphoric high and it was legalized as a supplement in 2018 under the farm bill however CBD regulation is a little murky and foods and beverages containing CBD are still technically illegal in some states CBD belongs to a class of compounds known as cannabinoids there are a hundred and twenty of them and they exist in many plants not just cannabis this non-intoxicating compound has become majorly popular in the past year or so and it can be found in everything from sunscreen to cocktails to coffee I took like ten shots of espresso today but I'm totally joking service DVD in it some of the more outstanding CBD claims include that it can help fix leaky gut syndrome can be used to treat multiple cirrhosis and can cure cancer as there are no human studies supporting those assertions we're gonna move right along to the more plausible and clinically tested claims about CBD as always remember I stick to clinical research that means it was performed on humans animal studies don't rise to the level of evidence-based practice first off there's solid research supporting the use of CBD for at least one condition intractable epilepsy a condition where drugs are ineffective one study showed a 42% reduction in seizure frequency and children and adults taking twenty milligrams of CBD per kilogram of body weight per day for 28 days in fact CBD is the key ingredient in the only cannabis based drug approved by the FDA at the dialects many studies have also looked at the effects of CBD on neurocognitive disorders such as anxiety and depression in one small study on adults with social anxiety disorder a single 600 milligram dose of CBD reduced anxiety and cognitive impairment on a simulated public speaking test in another study a single 300 milligram dose of CBD also reduce symptoms of anxiety during public speaking but not a 100 or 900 milligram dose suggesting that too much or too little effect CBDs efficacy against anxiety several studies have also shown that CBD may possess antipsychotic properties in one study CBD was as effective at reducing psychotic symptoms as the most commonly prescribed drug used to treat schizophrenia another common claim about CBD is that it has the ability to reduce pain whether due to diseases like cancer and arthritis or under normal conditions like post exercise muscle soreness unfortunately according to a recent review of eleven systematic reviews and observational studies there's insufficient evidence to suggest that CBD is effective at reducing pain related to cancer or GI and rheumatic conditions and only limited evidence to suggest efficacy for neuropathic pain studies have shown that while cannabinoids may increase one's pain threshold they don't decrease pain intensity another understandably believable claim that I've heard about CBD is that it can help improve sleep now I have a lot of trouble sleeping so I wish this were true but unfortunately research doesn't entirely support this claim some studies show that CBD has a mildly stimulating effect other research indicates that the dose determines the effect and suggests that while low-dose CBD promotes arousal high dose CBD may increase total sleep time and decrease the number of nighttime wake up's more research in this area is clearly needed so now let's talk about safety a World Health Organization report found that CBD is safe and non addictive up to 1500 milligrams per day has been shown to be well tolerated but it's not without potential side effects some studies have noted nausea vomiting dry mouth decreased appetite and diarrhea and CBD users drug interactions may also be concerned as CBD can behave like grapefruit and may increase the amount of certain drugs in the bloodstream talk to your doctor if you're taking any medications before trying CBD I found like an infomercial now don't I finally because CBD is an unregulated supplement it's difficult to know exactly what you're getting one study showed that out of 84 CBD supplements 68 percent contained a different amount of CBD than was listed on the label and 21 percent contained detectable levels of THC the psychoactive component marijuana's now this is especially important to consider for athletes as THC is a prohibited substance and consuming it violates anti-doping rules CBD has not been tested in pregnant or breastfeeding women or children and therefore should not be used by these groups and that's this edge what do you think about CBD have you tried it would you try it now after learning more about it let me know your thoughts in the comments below and if you like this video please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel for more evidence-based nutrition information and healthy plant-based recipes I'm Whitney thanks so much for watching", "N3Yw3dtj6Pc": "hey guys so today's video is gonna be me talking through my experience using CBD oil I've been using it for about a month now so I thought it was about time I share my experience with you guys and yet share if there's been any benefits for my skin so the CBD oil that I've been using is by Zen CBD I picked this up in Planet organic so any of you guys given the UK or live in London then CBD is stocked in Planet organic and yeah and you can pick this up I think the reason I picked this up is because it was firstly a really good price it would being discounted from I think 30 pounds to 20 pounds and I say a good price that it's still super expensive but yeah I went in there and actually spoke to a sales consultants and they taught me through the different options I'm I explained of what I wanted to use it for I liked the fact that I hadn't ever used cbz or before so they recommended this one it's a fairly low strength I think it's between 3 to 5 percent obviously it determines how much you use I've been using 1 to 2 sprays I started with one spray and I've built up to two so yeah this is the one that I've been using like with other supplements I think it's really beneficial to actually speak to somebody who actually sells the product or is experienced in using the product just because they'll be able to give you like an honest opinion or an honest review on which of those sort of things actually work which kind of brands might be more suitable for what you need them for so yeah like I said I started on a low percentage and that's what I've been using I know that you can build this up but for me I just wanted to start with yeah the lowest strength and just see how that worked for me first so the potential benefits because obviously there's a reason I wanted to try this in the first place I had read so many positive reviews on how this had really been able to help people manage day-to-day stress anxiety and a ton of other really great health benefits for me I've noticed such a huge correlation between my acne flaring up and like my emotional well-being like how much stress I'm under so I really wanted to find something that could help me yeah just manage the day-to-day stresses of life lots of people have reported that they've been able to lower inflammation that they've been able to regulate sebum production and tons of other really great things to your skin as well so yeah I wanted to give this a test see if it actually works and that's exactly what I've done for the last month so the lady that's we this in the shop instructed me to spray once two sprays underneath my tongue and hold it there for sixty seconds and that is exactly what I've been doing I haven't actually applied this topically to my skin because oil is for me really a clogging I know that some people have like miraculous results and are able to clear their skin using things like the oil cleansing method I've tried that but it just does nothing for my skin it just does not work it just makes me produce more oil it makes me feel really greasy and honestly I just I just know it doesn't work for me so if you want to apply this directly to your skin and see if there's any benefits for you then please come and report back because I'm just not going to put myself ones of that experiment but I'd love to know from you guys if that has helped your acne and yeah if you've seen any improvements in your skin so the first thing that I wanted to mention that I've seen as a result of using CBD oil is that my digestion has definitely improved now if you've been following my channel or you'd follow me over on Instagram then you will know that my digestive health has definitely been something that's been playing up since about November last year I've had all kinds of things going on from IBS to a chronic acid reflux and yeah I've just found that using CBD oil has really minimized any flare-ups I've had of those things like for example my acid reflux was really bothering me every single day all day from about January the first all the way through till the end of kind of April and it's no coincidence I've started using CBD oil and I've been able to just relax about it a bit more and I'm not saying it's completely gone please believe me it hasn't it isn't a miracle but it's definitely helped like I don't feel like I'm dealing with it all day every day it kind of comes in waves sometimes but yeah that has been the most exciting benefit I found of using CBD oil and yeah quite excited to see if I continued to use it and what will happen I've also noticed that my severe bloating which I get at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon every single day until I eat dinner and yeah it just continues to get worse and worse so that has definitely been something that's improved to I've also been kind of monitoring why I've been eating I keep a acne diary so I wanted to kind of when I'm breaking out the sort of things I'm eating how I'm feeling all the sort of things that could be tribute to a break out and I've noticed as well because I've been monitoring my in there as well that this is actually reduced as well since using CBD and again yeah it might be a coincidence but I really believed that actually the stress I put myself under about my health has reduced because of using CBD oil this is also really exciting because lots and lots and lots of studies have been done on acne and digestive health and they definitely have found correlations between the two so if you're somebody that struggles with your digestive health and you also struggle with breaking out then this could be a really really exciting thing for you to try and could potentially really heal up your skin another positive side effect I had for about a week was I started to have really great sleep like I was sleeping super quickly fall into a deep sleep and I felt very well rested when I woke up I wish I could say that this lasted throughout the whole month but honestly it didn't I feel like after the first month it sorry after the first month after the first week it kind of just sort of subsided and I just went back to my usual sleeping pattern I haven't slept really badly or anything I don't find that it's really kind of like given me that feeling before sleep where I just yet feel completely knocked out and just really well rested however lots of other people have said that this is an absolute miracle worker when it comes to insomnia and really bad sleeping patterns so if that's you then potentially you could give this a go potentially maybe I need to use a higher dose so I need to take it slightly further in the evening towards bed I've been taking it just after I've eaten probably like 15 minutes after I've eaten so that you're digesting the CBD oil with food I think actually on the bottle it says between meals and let me just check yeah it does actually say on the bottle to defy spray in between meals for best effects spray under tongue so potentially I could have taken this nearer towards bed as opposed to nearer towards dinner and maybe that would have helped me with my sleep better so the next thing the big thing for me that I really wanted to see some help with was reducing anxiety and just reducing like how you handle day-to-day stress so for me this is definitely the biggest one I've been wondering this very very carefully and I know lots of people have said that this is like amazing and has really helped them I honestly believe for the first few weeks it was most definitely helping I felt really well rested like I said and yeah just fell I don't know a little bit more able to cope with certain things and I just wasn't kind of like I don't know letting stress take over my life however for the last few weeks I just don't think that has been the case I would love to say that this has been like again a miracle-worker maybe I need to be taking a higher strength I don't know but yeah I haven't found that this is like miraculously help me manage stress and like I said at the beginning of this video if you're taking this because of stress it's also because you really want to reduce the amount of acne flare-ups you pads for me I've definitely noticed I've been breaking out around my jawline and around my kind of ears with the more kind of deep cystic spots so I haven't noticed a big improvement in CBD oil and my skin today I'm actually feeling like I'm really happy with my skin but this week hasn't been great but it's also worth noting that lots of things that help your skin that you take internally don't just work overnight and that is the case for like supplements that's the case for things like I keep saying that's the case for the pill nothing works within like a month usually so potentially if I take this for longer which I really plan to do to see if there are any additional benefits I think the three-month mark is really a good indication about whether something can really work for your skin however I also tried things for three months and they've absolutely not worked I'm looking at you best your book so yeah if you feel like something's actually making your skin worse than probably best to stop I've tried tons of other things that help me reduce my stress and my acne as well so I think the biggest trial for me was coffee like I am a coffee addict guys I know it can increase anxiety I stick to one cup a day but it really is something I look forward to and I love but last year I actually tried to give it up for two weeks and it was very very difficult guys I've actually filmed an entire blog looking at me quitting coffee the benefits I might have had in my anxiety in my skin and in fact our link it on screen now somewhere around here so go and check it out let me know what you think and I will see you over there I don't know if it tastes that nice I mean really no it doesn't taste like coffee that's for sure hmm just tasted", "ktZuC4cPwA0": "[Music] you [Music]", "WD1NVu2bMuo": "hello and welcome to summit my name is Ellie and I'm here to tell you about how short path distillation technology is changing and what the new standards are and where things are going our first question that most people ask us is what happened to parts three and four in our last series one of the things that happened when we were filming and preparing for the other two parts was the technology changed so fast that there was no point posting it we wanted to advance so fast and with so much progression that the older videos would probably have kept us behind if we stuck to those old SOPs so with the technology changing first thing we're going to go over is what products summit sells and what products we worked with and which ones we're going to discontinue and which ones we're going to continue to work with the first ones we're going to talk about is SP D 1 and SP 2 legacy these two heads are the easiest to operate the most affordable to jump into especially with a host cool trap and they're gonna give you the best performance in the market for these types of designs the cornerstone of our new technology for the fraction collectors came off of sp2 and sp3 Thermal plus series these dual wall heads performed so well that as we started doing research and design into the SPD for MPD we came up with a product called a fraction collector so all of our heads are being upgraded to this new technology and SPD to thermal and sp3 thermal are being discontinued what does that actually mean these heads perform just like an original design but they're a lot more heat written they have a lot more heat retention due to the dual vacuum jackets we aren't ditching the design or the geometry what we're doing is we're upgrading it to the FC series which comes both in 34 and 45 size what this is is a fraction collector installed at the top of the head so even though we retain the same geometry the same design the same functionality of the original SPD throw plus we now have short run times higher any product brighter colors lower much lower residency time up to about half because none of the stuff in the head is now rejecting back down it's being collected in the cup and then it is drained right on the system so we have not only the highest potency highest speeds but best walk best product quality coming out of this series head so that's gonna sum up what heads are being discontinued and what and how we're moving on to the fracturing collector series for all products moving forward that's the first thing so a lot of people have been asking us about distribution adapters we're gonna go over some stuff that will help you guys understand the differences between them we have a legacy mono cow which is above them on account then we have a new series mono cow which is an extended last tube which helps separate any imperiaz that are in line then we have a high efficiency mono cow a very unique product that we've been bringing to market where there is a coil condenser in there that takes off a lot of that condensate out of the vapor stream so from there we moved on to laminar path we're going to show you that here in a second one thing we wanted to talk about was everyone always said you know why do we avoid bellows well we wanted to talk about that and explain why we believe how those should never be anywhere in the short path system directly near the shore path the dislike of using this product is that when you have a very fast pass or you're moving a lot of molecules downstream they line the surface and the easy way out is to just try to attach a bellows straight to a short path head and get a higher CFM the straight talk is for a two liter or five liter system even some larger ones between a quarter-inch and a 3/8 inch hose you get about 10 CFM pull that's quite considerable and it does work everyone's been doing it a lot little bit very successful if you were going to do a an open war pathway like a bellows I believe there's a different way to approach this problem number one we want to ditch these as best as possible and keep them away from the shore path that's the first thing the second thing is we we also have an issue when you use high CFM throughput in the shore path it'll rip right past the cold trap so the benefit of using a basic hose system with an SPD one or SP two actually limits how much how much these these uh saturated molecules creep up the cold trap and into your pump and just just damage and destroy your vacuum depth so with that we also want to talk about the grease updates we we originally had access to basic hundred 50 Celsius silicone grease we chose not to use grease and just do dry joints because we didn't know of anything the market that was better we stumbled onto krytox and krytox solved everyone's problems we started distributing the product and recently there's been branding changes and somehow the product quality has changed so we moved on to a newer newer product called app is on which is an extremely dense grease and it and it will hold even under diffusion pump vacuum rates okay so over here we're going to start talking about the new sewer path and how it operates so first things first we got a nice tight their mom doctor and a thermal well right in here just for taking temperatures that we need to some of them really cool interesting setups that we offer now is direct pipe connections and how this specific short path works is your cooling class you have for instance here's SP 5 FC thermal head and now it comes down to your diameter path on account and we no longer have to actually remove the mono cow off the short path decisions that the short route that the actual distribution adapter itself only requires a pulley blocks so people always asked how did you solve that problem of contaminating all the product without having to change the flask and isolate all the blacks you know removing the dirty glass offices including clean glass on it well the design that I came up with is the vapor will pull right past this point and the discharge from the distill it will flow straight down the center and touch just some parts the glass not much and all this is moving with its very hot all this other vapor creates this kind of a line that you can see when it starts to build up and it just drains off now everyone always asked well why did you put a coil there and just not let it come off well the coil actually serves a really important purpose which solves a problem for full-bore hard pipe connection systems first things first we're able to now separate different layers of vapor from the discharge of the head the first vapors and get converted very quickly down to a liquid and distill it and that's what's going to come off this head if we increase the temperature of his head and decrease this coil we create a temperature matrix and how that affects molecules how it pulls in a molecular vacuum so the the the still it will flow down while these other hotter more excited gases will bounce around and bypass it now this super chilled coil will drag will will condense all that vapor is dragging to the surface and it will now drain right through the trap and out so that's the first thing I wanted to go over is how this new system works with being able to shut off vacuum and just pull the flask and replace it and off the worry about anything else in the system next everyone likes this idea it works great but we want to really show you the heart of this hard line connection technology and that's with this trap so we're going to zoom in here and I'm gonna give you a little bit of an example a little bit of explanation of what's going on here that prevents pump contamination and actually allows a deeper vacuum this is a whole system operates similar to having three traps yes this is would be a smaller one it wouldn't be much but it would give you a lot of heat removal entered like the energy is being removed from the vapor stream it is being sub cooled so fast that it wouldn't heat up your trap as much especially if you have on negative 100 immersion chiller so not only does this portion take down the massive bulk of the energy now if you look very carefully inside of here the dry-ice bung is extended beyond the cone with an upside-down cup and the only thing that's touching the cup is the inlet port right here so all the energy that is usually being ripped off the top of the trap where you see condensate dragged up that energy that cooling power is now chilling this inner cup and the unique portion about this is it terminates the vapor so when it enters this cold section it's slowing down so fast when it's hitting the glass that it almost sort of spins it just kind of like hits it but it stays in there so when you see that fog coming off your distill it it's capturing that turbulent it and turning it to a drip this specific shape actually prevents it from crawling and it prevents the vapor on the throughput system than just ripping right past the trap most people's traps are set up not to prevent this type of system to happen this hasn't ever existed and I'm bringing this technology to you guys to solve all the problems that occur with full-bore type of distillation so on this type of a setup as I've been explained to have a fractional collector we have this lavender path alone account which has an adaptor right here as you can see for the sensor so we're able to see exactly what's going on in the short path right past all of this crazy area where the the reading would be up and down but over and over and over it which is fluctuate right here we have a stable reading of what's coming off right on the tip of the the the the the the ending of the short path path itself right here so now as this cold trap does all the work is an inverted cup cold trap it goes to a hard pipe and this comes in a couple of different variations some people like it at the ground so we have another piece that goes to the ground in this case we have a dual pump setup this is a VFD pump that we haven't displayed and we have on a cart so then people say well how are you connecting it well we're using a bellows here even though our plan is to supply a smooth pipe bellows not a corrugated metal one for the point of argument keeping a bellow at the end of the system to help isolate any vibrations from the pump is actually not as counterproductive as keeping it in the center of the system where you're having the installation so it's a moot point of argument but in my opinion I would love to see PTFE smooth smoothbore bellows being offered to the market which is gonna be a lot harder to get even though everyone is asking for them so it's gonna be very soon that we're gonna see them on this type of a setup we have a vacuum pump sensor that will also give us the reading on our SPG 3 both from the short path and the pump giving you a curve reading so you can understand what's going on it have a leak or if there's a problem ok so how do we have a connectivity between most pumps and traps well the CT one original Cola trap has a DV 1 that's a Swagelok style and and fully assembled part that helps reduce all the leaks that go through the trap to the pump in this case we're going to be upgrading it to the DV 2 which is really high-end leak free edwards valves and how are we doing this and why is it set up like this well we have a valve right here we have a valve right here and this one may also have a bleeder or a needle valve the point of this is when we were doing standard installations we saw that traps and pumps would get soaked so during the initial portions of this lations say 150 to 170 celsius you would be running a diaphragm pump on a valve here on a gate and that would pull all your volatile zout and this is going to prevent anything from getting into your main pump you're actually gonna have a higher performance factor as well because those solvents never touch the main pump and you're able to do your swaps and remove maybe the ball with water or alcohol or herbs in it that are going to cause you distillation issues so after that's completed you would lock off with this one valve and open up the other valve and now your full bore operation with no solvents a dry pump that's been running it's hot it's ready to go and it's not contaminated so here is our lavender path setup with the full bore kit this specific trap you know people ask me what's the difference for distillation and I say if you have $500 or 600 or so in four basic hose cold trap you're in the door and you're going to get the job done if you go down this route if you're talking about almost three times the cost for the kit because of all the connections so there is more of an investment there and there's also costs with the Edwards valves so the technology that we're offering for the inverted cup is only on this type of a system because the amount of flow that you get actually is it's as damaging to a pump typically you know you can you can you can get a lot of terms a lot of air locks up a lot of wet molecules to usually go through a pump and then soak the oil so the way to avoid that is with this type of modification which prevents that from occurring okay so other updates we believe in April or before April the the actual final version of the fraction finder will be available to the market the first ones that were released were for testing and people's hands reminding the data so we're able to actually tell you what fraction you're on based on the wavelength you'll be able to identify when you're going into your heads when you're coming out of the heads when your potency is going down and in your tails the unique part about the fraction finder is it's going to tell you if your product wasn't winterized properly it's gonna tell you what's in the vapor stream if you have all tools or if you have things coming over you actually identify those as well it's gonna tell you overall when you're gonna hit your highest peak potency and then before the head changes color and you can actually notice what's going on it will start to give you different readings that will tell you that this stream has shifted there's something else in there which means your potency is going down the fraction fighter is gonna be the product in the market the largest adaptable product any short path in any manufacturer and we're going to the exclusive distributors and we're going to get them in all the hands of our distributors and all the competitors because we want this product in the customers hands so everyone likes the SVG three touch we also want to do a shameless plug for the SVG three touch the standard SVG three sorry that s we can be regular casting it you have to click through the screens to see where all three points of your vacuum are the touch is going to be a screen that can be loaded up a touch screen that will go right which will clamp right on the system and that one will also release shortly here and that's gonna give you real time graphs with logging and with all kinds of different information that will give you an idea of like what's going on real time not having to click through it both the fraction planet or anything that's pg3 touch are gonna be Ethernet compatible and and Wi-Fi which will allow you to be able to basically look at your phone from a different room and see where your wavelengths are at and where your vacuums out which is amazing okay I hope a lot of this information has answered a lot of your questions on why I have not posted videos in a long time Pathology's and look we're not going to be talking about in this video is the big birth that which is also being made as mini bertha to the MPD modified path installation or there's two two pathways in the system that does different things for refinement mostly for CBD work in high refinement work we have an ultra low pass temperature project two heads that are coming out part of the hobbs project is the HP one and the HP to the HP two is going to be an initial non-selective head that pulls very fast on large batches the HP one is going to be a low temperature distillation head with some pumps and some modifications that we have in our system we're going to be able to hit very very low temperatures roughly fifty degrees lower than you normally would these products are all going to be released here shortly they're all in line with the shows so as the shows come up please come visit us we're going to be bringing this specific set up to Seattle Comicon Seattle can athon so if you want to purchase a complete functional system with all the sensors all the pumps and everything just let us know we're bringing a couple of them there if you are interested in the discontinued sp2 and sp3 thermals they're gonna be half off until stocks gone so we only have about 30 or 40 these heads left to this day and hey they're less they're basically more than half off they still work great but we're making a room for the new heads and we can zoom in here and show you guys kind of what's what's so cool about this is this is the new generation of short pack technology this is going to be what all future technology in the short path is based off of this is our laminar hard pipe set up both the fraction collector the inverted cup and the hard pipe with the valving system it's a combined product which is the heart of the fastest most adaptable highest potency short path distillation system on the planet I mean we have other large-scale systems but for a 5-liter system compared to all the competition you'll be running through product faster with summit with it with the summit set up and you'll be getting the highest potency on your first pass so when you're refining the system works exponentially well especially if you hook it up to like a modified db2 we're running a diffusion pump now you're gonna be running into temperatures automatically twenty maybe thirty degrees less than you normally would on a refinement pass and you're still going through multiple liters an hour just crushing through it and there's really nothing else in the market that can give you the type of accuracy that this system can we don't use bellows anywhere in between our system there's maybe a small connection at the end but we focus on a laminar path hard pipe and that's going to be the heart of our technology and it really does stand out as the best system on the market thank you", "PW3s52kOmBY": "[Music] hi guys and welcome back to pro cbd the uk's number one cbd

"right now there is a bill on the governor's desk that would regulate the hemp industry in Florida currently there are no regulations on what you're putting in your body when you use hemp based CBD products as Action News Jax Jenna borne reports that bill would change that right now there is no shortage of ways to take hemp derived CBD from the smokeable flower to gummies but there is a shortage of regulations this bill aims to change that this could be another super crop this to be like corn natural life sales rep Marco Lopez is one of a skyrocketing number of people who uses hemp derived CBD short for cannabidiol it's legal to buy doesn't get you high and can be used to relieve pain and anxiety it's also unregulated there's a lot of different companies that produce products that are gonna be um you know maybe necessarily not to the strength that they say they will be or they're not fully listing all the products or the other ingredients in the product a bill awaiting the governor's signature would require hemp farmers to be licensed with the state hemp could only be sold if in an independent lab certifies the batch has been tested it has no more than 0.3% THC which is psychoactive and does not contain unsafe contaminants hemp products would need to have a barcode or QR code like this one linked to the info on the lab testing batch number number of milligrams of hemp extract THC content and expiration date I think it's important for people to have an understanding of what it is that they're getting in their body and this bill is on the governor's desk we'll

again with ham today they have I don't know if you can see this very well but it is pretty moist it's a lot more wet than the stuff returned yesterday some of the stuff we didn't yesterday was pretty wet and you would have seen some really good flow rate this is on par with the wettest stuff of yesterday so I'm expecting to see a lot but even even being this wet if you look at this there's nothing coming through nothing now if you go to the other side of my hand no nothing's going through there so this is the problem that people have when they infuse material with the liquid is try how are we gonna get that liquid out you know we'll squeeze with our hands put it in soccer cloth and twist it and you really can't get almost anything out you know you can see my hands are wet but that's as good as it gets now the beauty of our screw press is it'll take out almost all of this moisture or an awful lot of it so let's see how we get on okay we're running at 135 psi we've got juice coming out now a really good flow [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it sure that it's fall the side [Music] [Music] okay this is more for the benefit of video than anything else and the finished processing [Music] and I'm going to do a a weight analysis on this point oh six [Music] okay we finished this test we ran through that one bucket that I showed you just a few minutes ago there's a press liquor it's still kind of draining through obviously you're going to get some sediment so you can see that sediment right there this shows you how much oil we got and then if you go to here it's the idea of the cake and I think you remember how what that was here's an indication of the cake I think you can remember how wet that was my hands our boat this is dry stuff I mean I'll put up I think I'm going to get a paper towel and show you how dry that is okay here we are in sunny Tampa Florida and this is the result of that test we did obviously you saw it in the blue bucket the big one but it was 18 litres of material and afterwards we're left with just Alex about four liters four and a half meters of this the oil and I was about five liters six liters maybe this press cake now this press cake I think you remember how you probably remember how wet it was it was like glistening wet this right here barely gets my hand oily what we'll do real quick is I got some paper towel on here let's put some on paper towel what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna I'm gonna squeeze it in a paper towel or a see if I can please in a paper towel take it off okay there is a little bit of oil there I don't know if that's plant fiber oh there's a little bit of a glisten of some oil in there but that's hardly any so this stuff has come out super dry just like a teacher anyways that is what we're looking at so you

earth my name is chilly back at you with another day pass video and in today's video we're gonna be talking about something super fun today we are going to be comparing delta eight versus delta nine and decide really who wants it more and which one is actually better [Music] okay so we're gonna be smoking a little bit of delta 9 yet egg um got a little bit of bud we're going to get you a little shot here is the bud that i'm smoking on today it is literally nothing special there we go nothing crazy nothing crazy at all and we got ourselves a new bowl boys the other one broke alright that bowl this is the new bowl so that way i don't break it rubber and then you just pop this out to clean it uh yeah so if you are new here remember to like comment subscribe all that good youtube [ __ ] if you guys do not know you won't know i'm on twitch twitch.tv slash chillydilly link in the description as always now let's grind this weed up and actually get into the [ __ ] video eh okay so i wanted to take the time to compare the two of delta delta nine really sit down think about it think about the points and think about this argument okay so delta a being on the rise and with this still being legal right now with you being able to buy it online with all that stuff more people are getting into it and you have two halves of a crowd one saying i don't get high and one thing i get high as [ __ ] if you check out my delta 8 uh negative video you can just go through the comments and you can find people arguing for days about how it gets them high and some people it doesn't uh anyway let's get into our first point okay anxiety all right so i think we both know you know if you've smoked delta nine we both know me you everybody watching this video that regularly smokes sale tonight we've all smoked a strain of delta nine that has made us paranoid as [ __ ] you know what i mean it could just be a certain strain bro smoke it next thing you know you're [ __ ] geeking out um it's not the best we have saved the best for last this is our favorite we played it before before the police officer who himself calls 9-1-1 after he and his wife decided to unwind one evening by mixing up a batch of pot brownies here are the best parts bon appetit i think i'm having an overdose of this my wife okay you and your wife yes overnose of what marijuana i think we're dying how much did you guys have uh i don't know we made brownies and i think we're dead i really do time is going by really really really really slow did you guys do this on a regular basis no this is the first time that we've ever done it you've never done marijuana before par yeah i have you've never had this reaction to it before ever let's just go on the redwings game what what's the score in the red wings game i'm getting uncool i don't watch the runway i don't know you just you know what i mean i make you uh question your life decisions and yeah pretty much it can be a bad time you know what i mean but with delta eight it's the opposite uh it's meant to be less pair like it takes away the psychoactive effect so you're supposed to not be paranoid you're not supposed to have anxiety so yes well for the most part with delta 9 you don't really get anxious every experience that i've had with delta 8 i didn't have any anxiety at all not one bit i felt just fine honestly all right let's pack a bowl boys let me know what you guys are smoking on dab on eating on anything you're doing to ingest the lovely thc cheers boys oh yeah man that shit's good that's the good [ __ ] let's hear it again boys cheers that's rough okay so pretty much i'm gonna say most people have smoked up tonight dozen nine got anxious paranoid most people delta it's the exact opposite so we're gonna have to get this point to delta eight okay now for the next one this is a pretty controversial topic i feel like um you know and all of this really is when you think about it because you're gonna have groups of people that are like oh it doesn't make me paranoid and then groups that say that it does you know what i mean the next one price you like that the price anyway so the price right so this is gonna be a hard one to really even discuss about but i'm gonna throw in all the variables for the most part so i live in a legal state an illegal state so i don't have medical marijuana i don't have recreational marijuana um i buy it i get it when i get it that's it like a lot of people that watch my videos you know what i mean so for the most part i know there are people out there paying 20 a [ __ ] g which is crazy my boys don't don't just don't just smoke delta just try it at that point and then you got people that live in like colorado and they're paying [ __ ] 130 for an ounce of some [ __ ] that you were paying 20 a g for so with that said i think for the most part especially in legal states but is cheap i mean it's pretty cheap you can buy an ounce cheap you got mid shelf top shelf all that good [ __ ] pretty cheap even uh you know people that i know get it cheap i find it cheap in most areas you know what i mean um but delta eight is pretty consistent about the price now you'll find people in my videos that post links to delta eight cards that are ten dollars i don't know about those websites i don't really trust anything that's ten dollars when other people are selling it for 35. maybe that's a dumb thing on my part but like i just think okay you get what you pay for you get what you put you know what i mean like be careful what you play in your body that's all i'm saying okay i'm gonna buy these shady ten dollar cards so for the most part delta eight because you can't really buy the bud because there's no really bud um you can it's just cbd with delta like sprayed on it but that's we'll get to that later anyway those a cards can vary really anywhere from like 25 to 50 bucks to you know 35 40. the gummies are about 25 to 35. uh i'm honestly gonna have to give it to delta nine on this because in most places delta nine is cheaper than delta eight now i understand that people pay that price especially in illegal states because it's legal and they can get it and then they know it's going to work so i'm still going to have to give it to delta 9 on this just because i feel like really at the end of the day delta 9 is cheaper another thing the higher [Music] okay so once again i know this is going to be a very controversial topic hold on let's hit the ball boys cheers we're gonna have to pack that again i know this is gonna be another controversial topic just because once again it's really all up to the person but i think uh you know what i mean if you agree with me on some of these points please let me know so that way it adds to you know you know what i'm saying anyway uh the high so in my experience and most people's experience of smoking delta a they do get high but it's not as long lasting now that is also based on you and i imagine your tolerance and how delta a or delta 9 reacts to your body but delta 8 high definitely lasts shorter whereas cell 29 you know what i mean you smoking eight blunt or something and you're [ __ ] hot for a hot minute you eat a couple edibles you're hot for a hot minute you know what i mean uh with delta eight it doesn't last as long in my personal experience at least um and even comparing like delta a edibles and delta nine edibles well first of all just be careful with edibles i'm honestly thinking about making a video of the true dangers of edibles and how [ __ ] crazy they can be let's uh 10 likes 10 likes and i will do that okay so the delta edibles compared to the delta 9 uh felt a little stronger but only in the aspect of they made me lazier whereas the delta nine edibles made uh more of a tripping experience more psychoactive so i enjoyed it more because you know when you smoke delta nine like a part of you knows that's what you're going for so i'm gonna have to give the high to delta nine okay so right now we got delta a1 delta nine two okay and another point that i wanna make that honestly this is a no-brainer um speaking of a lot of these that kind of go hand in hand is uh the legal situation so obviously we're gonna have to give that up to delta eight right away just because it's more legal and others like it's just more legal anywhere than delta nine so the option of getting it in hand and buying it online is so much easier so i think that's really a no-brainer um i don't even know why i really added it i really just wanted them to be like neck and neck because it makes it two and two okay so anxiety delta eight one the high delta nine one price delta nine one and then this one i mean it's i know i know you're like that's a no-brainer but you gotta throw that in there because a lot of people that watch wetube or watch my content especially a lot of them don't live in legal states so like this makes it easier for these people so for the last one the one that is really going to make the difference the one that's going to make them one of these two win okay so it's neck and neck right now and yes the last final item on the list is the product [Music] yes i know that's once again you're probably thinking what they're like look you got to think about the product itself you got to think about delta 8 how long it's been out how it's made right now it's still almost being like it's almost new now at this point being made because they're putting it in carts and they're not really doing much with the edibles to be honest like they have some cool stuff sour candies whatnot but they're not making gourmet food they're not making chocolate they're not making all kinds of stuff that delta nines already been making um hold on before we get more into this cheers boys okay so delta a really you you can't even buy deltae but you can buy cbd bud that has delta eight sprayed on it now i understand that you know what i mean but like delta nine off rick that's the first thing people think of is weed but okay okay well let's talk about the cards right seems like delta it's really like trying to push the cart situation especially with how big it is right now but guess who still wins that delta nine because delta knight has already been make doing this and they're going so many steps further to make sure that people don't buy fake cards so they're adding their own unique thing to it they're their own brand like they even had batteries designed just for that brand so they're already winning by having so much more options whereas delta i feel like is in its infancy stage of just making these products so it could get bigger and it could get better but you can buy delta wax i'm pretty sure yeah so like they have that but guess what delta 9 has so many other forms that gets you high higher higher you know what i'm saying speaking of getting higher let's smoke you both i didn't know i could do that uh so yeah man gonna have to give it to delta nine on that one they do win just the product alone it's better better everything about it so the final score three delta nine two delta a now if you guys have enjoyed this video let me know in the comments below if you have made it this far i appreciate it so much remember to subscribe for all the new videos if you guys enjoyed it i hope you did i hope you guys with me much love guys be safe i will see you guys in the next video okay", "BmxEhXDFm_o": "what's up guys it's your girl bad girl cache away or many of you know me that girl with PCOS oh whatever anyways today I wanted to go ahead and show you guys how I make my infused treats a lot of you guys been asking I'm always active on my Instagram account showing you guys my advocacy for the mary-jane and I wanted to show you my step-by-step on how I make my rice krispies treats and I am NOT a professional not yet at least and so everything I do is how I like to make them so if you want to learn how to make them you can definitely follow these steps make sure you're legally medicated in your state or that it's recreational before you go ahead and make these treats make sure that you're eighteen years or older make sure that you have a parent if you're not nonetheless I hope that you guys have enjoyed this video and if you decide to make your own infuse rice krispies treats make sure you tag me let me see your treats or whatever and disclaimer there were no cats on this counter and the making of this video and there's never any cats on this counter so I hope there's no anyways thank you guys so much for watching make sure you tie to me and let me see your treats let's get the party started I have a 15 ounce box of fruity pebbles two packs of jet puffed marshmallows not the cheap kind and some chill clear from true leave a nine pound hammer coming at eighty eight percent THC and of course sticks of butter mine are salted that's what I prefer you can get the unsalted kind if you want but I like sugary stuff so here I'm basically just showing you guys all the pots I'm gonna be using two pots a cup in a pan the first pot I'm gonna make sure it gets a good boil and I'm gonna put in another pot inside of that one double boil so I don't want to directly you know melt my butter I'm gonna melt it in another pot that's got water in it it just seems like a lot easier for me to do so that's what I do so here it is here is a cup of hot water that I put in the microwave because I completely my god I missed an entire section I forgot to let y'all know that I stopped recording by accident so I'm gonna let you guys know right here that I put in are you stick of butter and a half a stick of butter so this is basically what I use a whole stick and a half a stick of butter melted that down pretty good I put a cup of water in the microwave for three minutes and then I dropped my true clear syringe in there for one minute I just took it out and I'm touching it and make sure it's good to touch and I'm trying to get the top off which for some reason was very difficult so my brother stepped in and he got the top off for me usually when I make my edibles I just put the syringe out from the end and all of it comes slithering out but for whatever reason I guess it wasn't hot enough um there is a little technical difficulties in my kitchen today but nonetheless we got the whole gram into this wonderful concoction so I'm just showing you guys that once your butter is melted you're gonna want to take that heat it up distillate and put it into your melted butter that way it's evenly proportioned throughout your entire tray of infused goodies so once you get everything melted together you're just delaying your butter you're gonna insert your marshmallows I use an entire bag of marshmallows I got this completely melted down before I did anything else that way again the butter with the distillate is completely and evenly distributed through these marshmallows okay Oh carp oh my god this is very as ASMR if you're into that okay so anyway moving on so now I'm gonna put in this cereal crazy thing is I usually use a whole box of cereal and I didn't this time I don't know I'm trying new things every time I made this exact recipe because I'm trying to make big blocks of it so I'm just trying different things out with the amounts that I've been using so I used almost the entire box I probably left like two good bowls of cereal left the box and I'm just going ahead and I'm gonna mix that all together as thoroughly as possible and then I'm gonna add half a bag if that into this so that way there's chunks of marshmallow and my treats as well because who don't like chunks of marshmallows like Hello I know I do and if you don't you don't have to do this okay to each his own but I'm gonna have a party in my mouth and I'm gonna sleep so good knowing that I ate this so here I am I'm just mixing it up let me tell you I was catching carpal syndrome in my hand I was hurting okay my hand hurts so bad my wrist was not whipping it in the kitchen honey I was ready to give up I don't have my brother come in and step in and whip this thing a few times like I was ready to give up listen I was being so lazy I didn't even flip this whole thing and put marshmallows at the end so half of it had chunks and marshmallows and the other half didn't Here I am just butter in the pan so nothing sticks like it's sticking in this pot and I'm gonna get this all out and then I'm gonna evenly Pat it down onto this pan and that's really pretty much it it's so simple to do again I'm sorry for that other half like not being in the video it wasn't even that deep all you have to do is put a cup of water in the microwave and get it heated for three minutes and then just drop your syringe in there and melt the butter mm-hmm if you need a video for that that you probably shouldn't even be cooking it on let's be honest here so here I am just patting down the goods wink wink and I'm completely done so I'm gonna go ahead and put this in the frigerator for one hour and then I'm going to cut this up into pieces and put it in a ziplock bags tada this was actually two pieces but since I put them in Ziploc bags in the refrigerator they melted together I mean about roughly 16 or 20 pieces if I cut them into squares you do the math if you want to know how many milligrams whatever whatever but nonetheless I really did that I mean look at this it's beautiful it's so freakin good and soft and chewy mmm good anyways if you like this video make sure you like subscribe and comment I will be posting more content in the future and follow me on instagram at castor oil where I am most active thank you guys", "bfORGbe6f9Q": "how's it going on its Michelle lives in the karate honey and today we're going to be doing something super fun one of the things that I love to do when I'm in training camp and I'm sore for recovery is take a nice hot absent so bad just kind of wraps up my entire day so I thought why not wrap it up and instead of just epson salt bath let's do CVD bath bombs so I'm gonna be using my sponsor CBD CBD distillery and they have this product that is a CBD isolate powder and so what CBD is great for is is a plethora of things so many things but when we're including it in our bath bomb it is going to absorb into our skin and it's gonna help make it helps reduce stress it helps reduce anxiety it helps reduce inflammation it helps with your small eggs in the bruising in the joints so a lot of benefits for athletes or even somebody that is just super busy all day on their feet or he didn't you only have to be physically active you can be mentally active because CBD helps with anxiety it helps with depression so it helps with all sorts of stuff so we got the CBD and then you're gonna need some essential oils essential oils also help with determining what kind of mood you want to be in so if you want it to help you know brighten your spirits and invigorate you you can use sense like orange and maybe some flowery scents and rose up if you want things to relax you you can use things like lavender and cedar what if you want things to help invigorate you you can use sense like spearmint and eucalyptus so the sense that I'm using today gonna be eucalyptus because I just love the fresh smell of it lemon because again it is just a fresh smell um and I think it just ties everything together and adds just a bit of summer Flair and then lavender because the majority of the time when I'm doing bath bombs at the very end of my day and I need something to help lined me down so the lavender does exactly that and then we have all these dry ingredients and wet ingredients so I'm just going to get into it and let you know the exact amount of each thing that you need so here we are and we are going to use the CB distillery I split powder and I use about half of this product so I use half of this product and then we have three tablespoons of Epsom salt Epsom salt is also an anti-inflammatory and it helps with your muscle aches and strains and then we have 1/4 cup of citric acid okay and then we're gonna have 1/4 cup of cornstarch and 1/2 cup of baking soda not baking powder baking soda okay so that's all the dry ingredients also I have these very pretty shimmery mica powders and it doesn't stain your bathtub but it does add some color to the water and also to the bath bomb which I love because color can also you know affect your mood and so I'm gonna mix this really pretty green color and this pretty blue color cuz my favorite color is turquoise and I think it will be just very calm and relaxing so we have that and then we have our wet ingredients which is just almond oil and that's just super moisturizing and will help create the right consistency that we need for the bath palms and then so with the with the almond boy oh we're going to use one tablespoon and then we're going to use a half tablespoon of water and then with the with the eucalypt with all of these essential oils we're just going to use I like to get to really smell so I do like three drops of each all right so now that you have all the ingredients let's get started you have to start by mixing all the dry ingredients so here we go half a cup of baking soda 1/4 cup of corn starch 1/4 cup of citric acid and three tablespoons of Epsom salt all right and for the magic ingredient Seaview distillery I flit powder and I've already done a batch of these and I so I use the other half so I'm gonna just pour the rest of it into here all right now for the shimmer oh so pretty I just love shimmer so this color right here is the sky blue and I just ordered these off of Amazon and it came with a bunch of different variety colors so I'm not gonna use the whole thing because my I don't want it to over for wordpower the bath bomb so I just use about not even I think I use about a quarter of the powder and you use about a quarter of this powder oh so pretty alright so now we have all of our dry ingredients and we're gonna mix it so we're mixing it up and it's such a pretty color all the other powers make sure you get it nice and mixed up some people like to grind up the epson salt if you're like bigger chunks got some salt just so that it's easier to break down when you're taking a bath but if you're taking a bath in pretty hot water in a milk pretty fast so now I have a very pretty light blue tart turquoisey color and so my dry ingredients are all mixed up I'm just going to set that aside and put together are my wet ingredients so and I have this little baby spoon that you get from coal stoves after you try the samples so we have the it's a tablespoon of almond oil and you can use any type of oil you can use coconut oil you can use castor oil you can use a Coco oil whatever kind of oil you like and then we got a half a tablespoon of water now once you start doing mix it into your dry ingredients and you feel like the consistency isn't right you can always add more oil and water so here we are I have lavender and I'm going to do a two for party foul alright so three to four drops of lavender one two three what what okay and then we're gonna do some lemon mmm one two three it's so crazy how smells for me anyways bring memories back like certain smells remind me of Thailand de Flor whoops certain smells like eucalyptus remind me of eucalyptus always reminds me of weight cutting because I always liked that smell - to keep me focused and keep me invigorated while I'm cutting weight because it cutting weight can sometimes be quite stressful so I liked using eucalyptus to kind of keep my mind fresh and sharp alright let's bring back our wedding or dry ingredients and we're just gonna slowly pour this in - in and mix so you'll see a little bit of the dry ingredients start to bubble up because of the baking soda and that's exactly what's gonna happen when you put it into the bath and so with the bath bombs there's all different kind of sized molds but I would get the biggest mold that you can find because I mean my bathtub was super huge and you want to have enough ingredients for for it to be effective so you just pour and mix see it bubble up a little bit that's okay and you'll start to feel the powder get a little thicker alright here's the last bit of it and then we mix and mix and mix it so again the consistency should be like damp sand and once you have the right consistency you can go ahead and start filling up your mold your mold here is that is that right your mold the your mold yeah so some people they like to put like flowers some people like to put oatmeal um you like to mix it with milk some people like to put big chunks of lotion in the middle you can put us up like if you're making this for your friend or something you can put like a cute little surprise in the middle I don't know get creative all right so I got my consistency and I'm gonna go ahead and feel yeah so so when you pick it up you should be able to smash it and it will stick together so if you can smash it ahead and it sticks together that's the right consistency okay and I'm going to use my big mold in the in the and the molds that I got I got three different kinds so that the big mold is basically four baths and then the medium mold or for pedicures and then the small molds are firm miniatures so you just go ahead and fill it up feel a fill fill fill it up okay so once you feel that we're gonna Pat it down nice and tight hey gosh is such a pretty color okay so I Pat it down nice and tight one side okay and then you're gonna go ahead and do that to the other side fill it up Pat it down fill it up pat it down okay so now that they're both the both sides are filled up what I like to do is I just like to overfill it on both sides and then you smash them together so then when you smash all together you're just gonna turn turn turn turn turn and just keep turning it until you hear them grinding together and you have to give your bath bombs 24 hours to dry okay so if you have like if you want to double this ingredient or something if you have a group of people you want to make this for just you know double the ingredients but be careful when you're taking these out of the mold let her try for 24 hours so here's what the mold looks like and so I let it dry for 24 hours and then when you're done and I actually I like to put mine in the refrigerator just helps helps it dry up so now I'm gonna have some extra left over so I'm gonna put it in my pedicure one and again I'm just gonna I don't know maybe is this do I have enough powder left no let's do the manicure one see some when you take it out it is already pretty hardened so you can definitely take it out of the mold and set it aside to dry for 24 hours but if you're only making a couple I would just leave them in the mold okay so now we're going to the manicure one so this is perfect for like for me because I was wrestling yesterday and I dislocated my ring finger on my left hand and it hurts so bad and I didn't even bother to look down at it I already knew it was out and so I just snapped it back into place and that's probably what would have happened anyways if I waited any longer it probably would have start swelling so I snapped it back into place and it seemed fine but when I got home it started to swell and even today I don't know if you can tell but it's swollen this is my finger it's swollen so I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use one of these bath bombs just for my hand and let my hands soak so that it pulls some of that inflammation out and helps reduce the swelling of my finger so anytime you're swollen up anytime like if you heat and cold or are really good so but for for instances like this you need heat so you can circulate get new blood circulating into that I went a bit too long but we're almost finished anyways so I got my bath mold set together and then I just did a little manicure one so that's enough and I have just a little bit left so when you're done putting in the mold and you want to use a mold for more you just get a tap the edges and then carefully take the top off and again carefully turn it over and then it should just pop out and it'll be a perfectly smooth remember guys give it 24 hours to dry and then what I did was I wrapped them up with some tissue paper I put some cute like confetti in there and put a little cute tag on there and I'm gonna give them to some of my teammates as gifts because we all beat each other up on a daily basis so it's only fair that I them something to help with their recovery I hope you guys enjoyed it remember I use CB distillery isolate powder for this CBD bath bomb if you'd like to try it all the ingredients are down below and if there's anything else that you think would be interesting for us to do as a fighter mom slash wife let me know in the comments below I hope you guys have a lovely day and enjoy your CBD bath bombs one love", "ATvB4nB4ALs": "ah hi everybody sydney here welcome back to my channel today today i'm going to be going over the math on how to actually figure out how much thc how much thc or cbd is in your oil how potent it is um a lot of questions i know in the last video i posted honest let me be real with you guys really quickly i posted that video thinking maybe if i got lucky like 15 people would see it so it wasn't my best work just gonna put out there it was my best work a lot of you guys have not seen the video i got a lot of comments on it a lot of questions all the concerns mostly great comments so thank you guys for keeping it positive i appreciate that let me preface this by saying i'm not an expert i don't know all the answers i'm just a girl making cannabis oil in our kitchen just like a lot of you guys i do know a little bit of math on how to figure that out i know in the last video i said i was going to give you the math and i kind of tried to in the comments but you know it's easier to just see it done so that's what we're going to do today we're going to visually walk through this when i have my levo machine now levo corrected me that's how you pronounce it levo my level machine is sitting here i made a new batch of oil so we're going to be doing the math on this particular batch what i have in here essentially is a cup of coconut oil i infused five grams of cannabis into this oil it's very concentrated very dark in color i don't know the exact percentage of the flour i was using so i'm gonna just ballpark it in like the 15 range just because that's pretty average for cannabis so let's say it's 15 it's always good to also overshoot it a little bit especially if you're dealing with thc just so you don't really overdo that and then obviously you can trial and error the amount of milligrams on your own personal body to see where you're at before we continue to go make sure you subscribe to my channel thank you for liking this video and watching well thank you for liking it if you like it please like it thanks for watching and keep watching if you want to know how to decode and figure out how much thc or cbd you're actually consuming when you make your own oil let's freaking go y'all okay everybody so what i have here is my piece of paper a pen and then my phone over here is my calculator and let's just freaking go into this thing oh and hello let's just like take a moment and just look at the beauty look at her oh look at her so to start things out i'm gonna write down the amount of oil that i used so up here i'm gonna write one cup um of oil the amount of cannabis that i use which was five grams grams of cannabis canna and those are the two numbers i'm going to start with if you'd like to convert your grams to milligrams one gram equals a thousand milligrams you can write that on the side one gram equals one thousand milligrams that's just for further conversion um and if you want to find out like per tablespoon you can also convert that i don't know off the top of my head so i'm just going to keep going so from here i have my one cup of oil and my five grams of cannabis oh and i know that this is 15 let's say it's thc for the fun of it 15 thc if you're using a hemp flour you do the 15 or 20 or whatever percent of that in cbd is those are the numbers you need to start with those three numbers right there you have three numbers your amount of oil you're infusing the amount of cannabis that you're using in the percent of whether it's thc or cbd they're using into that oil to do that i multiply my five grams of cannabis times my .15 so because if you convert you move the percentage over two decimals and that converts it to the percent or to the decimal rather and that would equal because i can't do math five times point one five equals point seven five so zero point 0.75 grams of this whole 5 grams is actually my thc that's present in my cannabis so from here in my whole cup one cup of oil i'm now once i'm done infusing going to have 0.75 grams of thc so .75 grams of thc into my oil i want to convert this grams into milligrams so in order to do that i just cross multiply so i have my one gram at top per 1000 milligrams i cross multiply you get rid of the grams and so per one cup of oil i actually have and then i multiply these 0.75 times 1 000 i have 750 milligrams of thc so in this entire little guy right here because it's a full cup there is 750 milligrams of thc in here okay so if i want to know let's see i'm using this for baking per tablespoon let's say now i would just convert this into tablespoons so let me look up really quickly what how many tablespoons are a cup cup two tablespoon so there's one cup so let's write it up here in our conversions one cup equals 16 tablespoons so that's another conversion you should know one cup of oil equals 16 tablespoons i can again cross multiply cups to cups and then there's 750 milligrams of thc per i mean this was a long way around just like honestly just switching out the numbers but just so you guys are more visual with it 750 per 16 tablespoons and then i want to find out how much per one tablespoon one tablespoon at the top and we don't know this answer we don't know this answer that's what we're trying to figure out and then you have 750 milligrams per 16 tablespoons pretty much you want to make sure these are always on opposite opposite sides of the line so that when you cross multiply you can actually just um cross it out and that what's that's how you get your numbers i don't know i took math a long time ago this is just what makes the most sense to me hopefully i'm explaining it in a way that makes sense to y'all uh unfortunately i don't know if i am 750 oop 750 why can't i do this pretty much all you need to do is take 750 and divide it by 16 and that'll give you how much thc per one tablespoon so we're trying to figure out this number right here so 750 oh my god divided by 16. so there's actually 46 milligrams of thc in a tablespoon you can also further convert this and you know figure out if you're using a cup in like let's say your entire cup in a recipe and it makes eight slices then you can really go in deep and figure out how much cbd thc whatever is in your slice but other than that that's really the math um screenshot this i hope it makes sense to you guys i mean i made a video about it so again it's just a lot of cross multiplying a little bit of conversions with this up here and then really it's just this percent of whatever you're find trying to find th c cbd whatever it may be and making sure you just take that into account in your total amount of cannabis cool y'all and that's it i hope that that was really helpful if it wasn't if i confused you more i sincerely apologize i am not a mathematician i took math a long time ago i'm just trying to use what i learned in essentially middle school and applying it here but hopefully that explains things a little bit more if you like this video again please make sure to give it a thumbs up a like um if you didn't like this video whatever not sorry about it it is what it is you know i'm just trying to hear live life and make my freaking cannabis oily people so if you would like me to make something with this cannabis oil let me know in the comments below what you think i should make with it i tend to like to bake healthier things like paleo cakes and dairy free items and gluten free items that's kind of the stuff that i personally eat if you don't eat that stuff that's no big deal i literally do not care but also just let me know in the comments what you want me to make with this stuff because i'm planning on making oh actually i know exactly my sister's birthday is coming up if you're watching this in the very very very future it's already happened but maybe i'm gonna make her a birthday cake with it hope you guys enjoyed also levo thank you so much for providing me with this item if you guys haven't got yours all ready i'm obsessed with it i love using it it does make your place smell a little bit like cannabis but honestly in my opinion not as bad as like doing it in the stove top or in your own oven and it's freaking easy cleanup i just love how easy it is you can download an app you can control all the temperatures from your phone it's literally the best so if you're going to make the investment i highly suggest doing so if you want to buy one for yourself i'm going to link them down below so you can go purchase one i do not have a discount code just yet levo if you see this if you are watching i would love a discount code to give to my people so if that does happen and you're watching this again in the future i will update with the discount code below cool great y'all hope you all have a great day bye [Music] you", "14x_U9IrR3E": "so where does cbd come from it starts with a hemp plant which is one of the most productive fastest growing plants in the world the process begins when the plants are harvested and dried from there the hemp is compressed using co2 to extract the cannabinoids to produce cvd oil the process of using organic hemp and co2 extraction is the preferred way of separating the compounds because there's no chemical solvents being used and finally the extracted cbd oil is used in making topicals tinctures and gummies you", "xAW6oB6E4fQ": "hey everyone I'm Shireen kasam the founder of my pain center calm the number one CVD resource for you to try and buy CBD okay what I want to talk to you about today is I get a lot of questions Shireen there's so many different CBD balms and muscle relaxants or muscle lotions out there which one should I get and that is true there are so many different types of CD CBD bombs out there that you have to make sure you pick the right one because you could spend 30 50 60 dollars on something that's not gonna work for you so how do you know what's the right one well one do your research and you can research all the products at my pain center calm we kind of break down what to look for in a product and what are the top things that our products have to check how much CBD is in the bottle and what's the size of the bottle so let's we're gonna get into that in a minute and then third just make sure that the the product has a certificate of analysis make sure that it's the correct amount of CBD that they're selling to you make sure it's not fake you know like a lot of people can now just put CBD stickers on their products so make sure you're buying your product from a reliable source such as my pain center calm we've spent over ten thousand dollars trying CBD products to make sure that we sell products to you that we really believe in that we actually use so like my mom has arthritis I have sciatica my dad has a torn rotator cuff as well as herniated discs my boyfriend is a firefighter so he's always sore and in pain and so we've only used we are only suggesting products to you that we truly truly believe in one of our favorite products is this green rose product is a muscle and joint and relief cream now here's what I was talking about about size okay this is a 1 ounce jar this whole thing is 1 ounce and there's a hundred and 15 milligrams of CBD in it that means the whole thing has 150 milligrams of CBD not every time you use it is it 150 milligrams of CBD so when I say it's a hundred and fifty milligrams per 1 ounce that is the same thing as somebody saying this jar has 300 milligrams in it and it's 2 ounces or this jar has 450 milligrams in it but it's three ounces do you see how it's all the same so technically only the price should be going up somebody shouldn't say to you that the the jar with 300 milligrams that's 2 ounces is any stronger than this one because it's kind of it's the concentration like it's all about the concentration so this one is actually one of my favorite products my mom uses this one for her arthritis on her hands I will use this on my sciatica it's a really cool application it's just a pump so it's it's clean it's easy to use and just pump it on there another one of my favorite products is this one which is a green roach product as well it's a muscle and joint but it's got heat relief in it now this one is two hundred and fifty milligrams for three ounces so it's a little bit less CBD than this one but here are the pros about this one this one I love especially at night this is one of my go-to that night because usually like I've brushed my teeth like I've showered I'm in bed I'm ready to go to bed and then my leg starts to hurt right the flare-ups start to happen either because you're laying down on your herniated disc or now your brain is kind of it's not worried about the day-to-day things you're doing so now your brain has time to focus on the pain so what I love about this one is it's a roll-on like literally it's just a roll-on and the great thing about that is you don't have to rub it and you can if you want to but you don't have to rub it in and it's got the heat relief so if you live in if you like that that feeling of like it's working for you it's great but I love it because I can just roll it on me and go to sleep like I don't have to get back out of bed to wash my hands so I love this product this one is my favorite personally because again I don't have to dirty my hands a new product that we recently started carrying is this active fit recovery and massage gel and this is great if you work out a lot if you're an athlete if you're in the gym a lot if you're if you're just putting a lot of stress on your body and your muscles tend to hurt or you've got shin splints or just sore muscles I tend to put it on before I work out if I'm gonna have a really hard workout and then after I work out after I shower but I've started using it at night too before bed because I have been working a lot out a lot and so my muscles tend to be really tight and really sore and this is a great one because this is just a this is a tub you kind of just put your fingers in it and you take what you want and apply it and then that's it and it's got its got like a menthol cooling effect to it so I really like this product too especially if you are a gym before you're starting for me I'm starting to get back into exercising so I'm I'm really aggravating my body and all the muscles as that are already in pain and all the herniated discs that I shouldn't be aggravating so this has been really useful and then my final product that I really love is Khoi healing balm and why do I love this product cuz one it's so small and compact I keep this in my backpack so it's with me at all times it's always it's always within hands reach it's kind of like having chapstick in your pocket keep this on me it's just a little balm love it like if you're just if you just get a flare-up at work sometimes I get tension headaches at work or my neck starts to hurt because I'm on the computer a lot or I start to get carpal tunnel right in my hand right here in my arm right here I can just pull it out and rub it on there it's got like a it's got like a eucalyptus smell to it so it's not overpoweringly menthol but it's got all these essential oils in it instead so I love this one just to keep in my back pocket so those are the four products that we carry and drop your questions down below and we'll get to them thank you so much for paying take that thank you so much for watching oh I need to see video me", "27dIDqrHsFE": "[Music] hey everybody dr john here with uh extract lab i'm going to be talking today about what is delta eight delta eight is a form of thc that really is a little bit different from a delta nine thc delta nine thc everybody knows that's the thc that makes you guys has some psychoactive effects it's also the main psychoactive ingredient within the marijuana plant and what delta eight is is it's a form or an isomer of that delta nine thc the reason it's been talked about a lot is because a lot of people are using hemp and derivatives of him to create a delta eight thc and they're doing this with some organic synthesis jiu-jitsu really in the laboratory and they're taking cbd and converting it over to delta 8 on thc the reason they're doing that is because the delta atfc of course has some of the same psychoactive effects that delta 9 phc has albeit they can be quite attenuated from delta a lot of people would say it has like a mellow effect so they're using hemp derived materials um they're hooking it up and they're processing it to the point where it now is converting into a delta eight thc molecule that then they can formulate into vapors or gummies or whatever that is that they're looking to formulate for so that's really what delta eight thc is when you look at it just look at it just look at it it's actually an oil and it looks a lot like a cbd oil or it looks a lot like a thc oil you've seen some nice golden pictures of some of that oils as they're flowing out the oil itself is a little bit more biscuit so it's very very thick hard before you need to really heat it up in order to pour it if you want to make products associated with a delta eight a couple different things you need to be thinking about the first thing is you gotta make sure that there's no delta not in your product because the law says that you have to have less than 0.3 delta 9 thc if you have a delta h thc and you have too much delta 9 in it you're not going to be able to use that product for your vapor or you need to dilute it down so that it doesn't have too much delta line in it that really is delta eight how you can use it the oils they look beautiful for them and you can formulate them into different products like that so really guys that's what delta 8 is all about please subscribe to our channel on youtube like us on instagram we have all kinds of calculators for you guys to use on our website we have guides i don't know a lot of people don't know this but we have guide after guide after guide for you guys we have extraction guides we have

"[Music] what's up everybody my name is enya and this is beyond the bud if you're new here click down below to subscribe make sure you give this video a thumbs up if you enjoy it so let's jump into it this week we're talking about something that i've seen be a little bit more popular and talked about recently which is delta 8 thc what is delta 8 thc and how is it different from delta 9 thc most people have heard of thc if you've heard of cannabis unless you live under a rock thc is the most common cannabinoid present in cannabis it's the most talked about and it is responsible for the psychoactive effects we all feel when we smoke it's not as simple as thc gets you high and cbd doesn't like i discussed in a previous episode all cannabinoids must start in the acidic form so thc must start as thca and must be decarboxylated or heated up smoked to activate it converts it into thc delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol i think i said that right delta 8 thc is going to have a similar structure to delta 9 thc they have some notable differences and the main difference between the two is the location of the double bond delta eight has the double bond on the eighth carbon and if you can guess delta nine is on the ninth this may seem like a super small subtle difference and i'm not super sciencey or scientist so this doesn't mean much to me but that little difference of placement makes a huge difference on our body and the effects that we feel although it may seem small has some notable effects on how the body's endocannabinoid receptors bind and respond to the molecule in addition delta 9 thc is less stable than delta 8 thc delta 9 thc is easily oxidized to become cbn which i will talk about that in another future episode let me know in the comments if that's something you guys want to know more about delta 8 on the other hand does not oxidize is stable and holds a long shelf life however delta 8 is about half as strong as delta nine much like delta nine thc delta eight binds to the cb1 receptors located in the central nervous system it also has an affinity for cb2 receptors but there's not as much study done on that delta eight binds differently which is why it may be responsible for a different type of high which has been reported that it is a more clear-minded high with less anxiety delta 8 thc may also help stimulate your appetite something i found super interesting about delta a thc they actually did a study in 1995 on eight young cancer patients those eight young cancer patients ingested delta eight thc for two years and that no vomiting occurred when patients ingested delta a thc before and 24 hours after having the cancer treatment found that really interesting that they actually did a human trial on that it's definitely something that i think we should do more research and look further into you guys may be wondering where can you find products that have delta a thc most cannabis on the market is really low in percentage of delta eight you can look on the coas the certificate of analysis to see what the percentage is but typically it's about under one percent delta eight thc only exists naturally in fractions of percents there are companies now that are extracting delta 8 thc and extracting delta 8 thc and making distillate and putting them into cartridges you guys have checked out any delta 8 thc products or tried them let me know in the comments how you guys like them if the high was different i hope you guys learned something new and you can follow me on instagram at beyond the buds with an s i will see you guys on the next video have a run have a great rest of your week love y'all for free", "JQG72S6GWGY": "what is up youtube this is your boy atg scuffy420 corey coming at you with another video man before we get into this one i am a new jersey medical marijuana patient this video is for 21 plus 18 plus and all that good stuff man so you know there is cannabis use in this video so everybody knows you know what i'm saying but yeah uh yo y'all see the title man there's some [ __ ] i want to talk about man i've been seeing a lot of videos going around about this recently bro like actually a lot of videos bro i seen a video from vice about this about this topic i seen a video from a youtuber named distributor michael i seen uh another video for some spanish dude on youtube i forget his name but you know he made a video about this too you know so i'm gonna talk about this man but real quick before we even get into this i'm gonna roll this blunt and get back at you with the top man all right we're back we got the blood rolled but yeah man you know we got some crazy [ __ ] to talk about man you know and really it makes sense bro what i'm about to talk about to me it does it makes sense but then it doesn't make sense at the same time but you know before i give you guys a topic i'm gonna go ahead and [ __ ] light this one up man cheers don't forget to like and subscribe too if you you know if you're a new person you haven't subbed yet you know go ahead and drop us up actually youtube is saying you know apparently like [ __ ] eighty percent of the people who watch my videos unsubscribe so if you could definitely hit that sub button that would definitely help man i said definitely twice right there on accident but we light this [ __ ] up man a little bit of a floppy blunt man remember man this entourage was all [ __ ] up we had all types of stems and it had a hole in it i had to fix this [ __ ] but yeah topic of the video man is the east coast getting hit with sprayed cbd you know or getting hit with him you know meaning all these packs and stuff that's coming through the mail to the east coast is it getting hit with cbd or hempman you know sprayed cbd sprayed everybody basically what i'm saying is a lot of videos is going around you know or a couple videos i've seen a video on vice about this i seen a video from distributor michael is it somebody who posted a video on youtube with like 10k views on it and another video i saw from spanish dude right and basically they was talking about how and these are people on the west coast man and they're telling you how basically there's a lot of good looking hemp out there that's just cbd products you know and it's not even thc and you can get it for like four or five hundred a pound or less 300 a pound man you know and uh they said that the west coast they've been really just taking that cbd product [ __ ] like that put thing like 40 pounds of it spraying all of it with uh with with you know distillate just spraying it with distillate so it's you know so it's really you can't really see it but i don't understand it i mean or not even like just the distillate spray i guess not even spraying it with distillate you know but spraying it with like some spray some distillate spray so you still get high but it's like you're not really getting a natural tree high or some [ __ ] and you can't complain basically you know how all these [ __ ] be having [ __ ] plugs on snapchat and [ __ ] bro from cali and [ __ ] and a lot of people get shipped to them and it's like bro basically them [ __ ] in cali is just cutting corners getting these pounds for 400 spraying it with some distillate and some terpenes which don't cost nothing bro and making like a thousand dollars on a pound charging 1400 2 600 off a pound whatever a straight cbd flower like with with spray with distillate so it still gets you high you can't complain but that's some crazy [ __ ] man imagine right now smoking cbd flour sprayed with distillate i'm saying that'd be crazy i mean i know i'm not because this is some dispensary blood from breakwater but man like imagine i was though like you know i was in that shit's crazy and everybody by the way it makes sense man because like on the streets when it comes to weed there's times where there's these dry spells and [ __ ] like october time around there and around that time bro the indoor harvesting is like you know it's like daddy bro there's not really much indoor going around you know because it's all sold by them you know at least that's what i'm hearing and it makes sense because there'd be droughts out here in jersey or not even in jersey just in any illegal state there'd be droughts in like you know like random times like october or some [ __ ] like that and it makes sense man that it aligns with cali's with their little their little droughts that they be having and then it'd be a drop for a little bit but then after a little bit there's a whole bunch of weed getting shipped out and it looks like garbage bro like think about it man these exotics bro right right most of the time exotics be 60.8 50. bro i was getting good ass weed four years ago three years ago two years ago even forty dollars or less thirty five dollars a [ __ ] eighth thirty hours an eight twenty five any of some good weed i mean twenty five and eighth was kind of low you probably not getting no fire for 25 but 30 35 40. i never went over 40 of some good ass weed that really was like the same [ __ ] that [ __ ] is getting this exotic for 60 man and i feel like the only reason why this exotics for sixty and eighth or seventy and eighth is really lasting is because of this little [ __ ] sprayed hep situation that that's going on you know i mean i feel like it's a real thing it might not be man educate me if somebody's from cali and they know what's going on educate me man this [ __ ] stem is like sitting on fire if y'all see that but it man it makes sense bro don't you know because why else would these 60 [ __ ] apes really be selling like this bro it's because all the [ __ ] is the spray the hemp you know i mean this is just a theory i don't know if it's [ __ ] facts or not but maybe all the [ __ ] that [ __ ] is just selling right now and it's going around it's just spraying him you feel me that could be possible and that's why [ __ ] just feeding for that exotics even though it's going for crazy prices it raised the demand if only because all this [ __ ] is going around that makes sense man and it creates it's crazy because like if you think about it about two three four years ago the weed just to me the weed that was going around like getting sold by everybody every weed dealer just had it was fire you know or majority of [ __ ] had fire you know good weed that you could always buy and now if you look at the areas who had fireweed they be having [ __ ] now bro like straight [ __ ] and it really makes you think who the [ __ ] the plugs is not even the plugs but the big plugs you know like the [ __ ] and cali who be shipping it because bro this is a known fact that 90 of the weed around be coming from cali and it gets shipped to the mail bro that's just facts or either that or it's homegrown that's the two things you know at least in the u.s like if you growing it yourself all right you got that but majority of the weed that [ __ ] are selling just comes through the mail straight up and it's from cali and it'd be you know i really do be do be thinking they'd be selling [ __ ] you know cbd packs and hitting it with the uh distilling bro that makes it makes a lot of sense at first when i heard this i was like nah that's [ __ ] especially a [ __ ] like me who i take pride in weed so it's like bro i i like you tell a [ __ ] like me that and you're like i'm looking at you like you're [ __ ] crazy like [ __ ] i'd be able to tell if my weed was cbd or [ __ ] weed yeah i'm saying but then i saw on youtube on instagram and [ __ ] like bro in california there's some indoor grown [ __ ] cbd hemp weed that would not get you high that bro literally looks like some fire as we from the dyspo like that'll get you smacked so it's like bro that [ __ ] is tricky bro like [ __ ] really could be getting hit with that [ __ ] man i i didn't want to admit it at first but bro [ __ ] could be getting hit with that it's crazy to think about man like if you just look at the quality of some [ __ ] weed and it it really like it looks like decent weed but then like if you look at it bro it's like there's not really much trichome action on that [ __ ] bro like you gotta really pay attention to that and even if it is bro it's not like i don't know bro i just it's crazy because even going into a cbd store in jersey oh that's gonna start fire i'm gonna put that out my hair actually went right on this almost started a fire but he was going into a cbd store in jersey bro i went to a cbd store and smelled some of the buds that they had and this is in jersey smell some of the buzz that they had i'm like damn this should smell like it's really like a pack you know i mean it didn't look like no zaza you know or whatever his eyes are you know it didn't look like no exotics obviously there's nothing like that for no but it looked like some fire but that [ __ ] would just get off the street and it got me thinking like damn bro [ __ ] can really just spray this [ __ ] with distillate and sell it you know it's the same [ __ ] thing i mean you're getting smacked the same way it's just not the natural weed you know that's crazy to think about man that's why man i graduated dabbing majority i mean i bought a quarter weed today from the dyspo today i've smoked three blunts out of it probably nah i wouldn't say that i'd say four blunts out of it probably this is like an entourage you know and that shit's almost gone bro i'd probably say it's like five grams left maybe maybe more maybe less i don't know probably less than that man to be honest with you so and bro and our dispose be a hundred ten dollars a quarter at breakwater hundred dollars a quarter so like you know that's [ __ ] crazy man i know a lot of y'all listening to it like i'm never in my life paying that much what the [ __ ] hey bro you can on the street you can get quarters of gas for 50 bro you really can you can get quarters of gas for 50 60 but it's like at the end of the day man ever since seeing that video it's like you really don't know if you're getting sprayed bro like you really don't i've seen like i literally watched the video of a [ __ ] showing some good ass [ __ ] good looking weed and the [ __ ] was hip doesn't get you high and it's like damn you know and if you just like you just at least around my area bro if you look at the quality of the weed to me besides the zaza and the raja exotics all that [ __ ] besides that the quality of weed in general just normal weed enemies blind has went down bro for unless it's some platinum i'd say because platinum is really growing in like new york new jersey philly around here like that platinum that should be official you know that's not a spray that that should be grown around here but other than sour too sour be official too that [ __ ] growing right in new york but other than that [ __ ] bro like all these other shits that [ __ ] be saying they having sfv and [ __ ] like that bro you never know man this [ __ ] because it's just you know i don't know man it's just too normal looking man you know not even normal looking but too dull looking man you know i don't even know but then again then you got this is a whole another story you got pgr's with weed man you know so then if you're not getting that sprayed hemp [ __ ] if it look like it's you know just too dull and it might be some sprayed hair then you got you could have some [ __ ] [ __ ] that looks like some zaza and it could be some pgr weed man so like wait is tricky man 20 20. weed is tricky it really is and it's the same [ __ ] you know why like why wouldn't these cali plugs cut corners and make this money man you know these [ __ ] in cali shipping this [ __ ] bro because at the end of the day you're never gonna find them in person like the [ __ ] the [ __ ] who buying it off them you're never gonna link in person for real like you know you're just doing business through the ship and [ __ ] and then also it's like bro you're not gonna know for real bro like if you smoke that [ __ ] you get high you're just gonna assume my word i'm hiding it's just you know it's weird it might look like some [ __ ] but it's meat or it might look like some fire and get you high you might think oh where there's some fire whole time [ __ ] hit you with that four hundred dollar five hundred dollar ounce nine ounce i mean pound of hemp you know that's crazy to think about that [ __ ] crazy to think about at least when you gotta make carter [ __ ] you know for a fact that you're not getting hit with that because the dispensary is not getting this [ __ ] [ __ ] girl that [ __ ] right there you know but then again bro it's like i don't even at my point i don't even smoke much bud like to be honest i just dab delta eight now man a lot i got 60 grams coming in today this is switching the topic a little bit but hopefully today later on i have 60 grams of delta 8 here then i got to order some terpenes i want to order some empty cartridges i just don't know where to go to get that so now i can make my own carts and [ __ ] have a couple cards chilling but i plan on and i want to do a video for this i'm going to use 20 grams of delta eight distillate and make eight [ __ ] brownies bro that's two thousand four hundred and fifty milligrams a piece of delta eight you know so bro and i'm gonna eat a whole thing whole thing i might [ __ ] around to eat half of it you know but i plan on eating the whole thing and jeez man but yeah bro i wanted to talk about this sprayed him situation man that was you know me talking about it you know and my bad if i was talking a lot before i even got to really smoke but i just wanted to get that out of here i had all the [ __ ] [ __ ] in my head none of this [ __ ] is written down none of that i had everything i wanted to talk about in my head off rip so i was like we get that [ __ ] out now we can kind of just smoke and talk man you know but yeah that that [ __ ] is crazy man and my bad if i repeated myself a lot too i just wanted to get everything out but yeah man that shit's crazy bro when i heard about that [ __ ] at first i was kind of angry i was like bro no way i'm getting hit with no [ __ ] like and i don't barely buy wheat off the street now you know i don't barely but when i do there's no [ __ ] way that i'm getting hit with no hemp and not knowing it you feel me but it's like you think about it you think back it's like damn it was sometimes when i bought off the street where it just wasn't smacking like i wanted it to and it was cheap of course but it's like if i'm getting it for the low how much is these [ __ ] getting for and where are they getting it from man they could be getting this ship to them or they could be growing it themselves you never know man something to think about i said it's crazy man i don't know how many of y'all buy weed off of street vendors and [ __ ] i really don't but i saw that video i saw that video months ago actually and i just thought of it today because i saw it again and i'm like yeah i'm about to make a video on that [ __ ] people need to know about that man that's something that has to be talked about is the east coast getting hit with him are we you know like that would be insane bro that would be insane and especially how many real smokers is on the east coast [ __ ] you smoke weed every day bro that would just be an l for us man if we didn't if [ __ ] didn't know you feel me but like i'm a real [ __ ] bro i'm gonna go back and think like damn and i've always said it too bro i've really always said like bro it's crazy how the weed i used to get is like smacks harder than the weed that needs to be having now and the prices is just ridiculous now like if you look at it bro i posted some a picture of some weed i was getting it looked like some [ __ ] that [ __ ] would charge 64.84 nowadays i got that [ __ ] for 35. i said the price i bought it for in the video and this is two three years ago man it's like wow prices have changed the times have changed that [ __ ] is crazy [ __ ] blood flavored up and [ __ ] so what happens when you got these [ __ ] stems you got extra paper on there trying to cover the [ __ ] holes and [ __ ] that blunt came my other blunt cave all moldy so i'm not even gonna roll this [ __ ] up or nothing man [ __ ] that [ __ ] [ __ ] paid what two dollars for that [ __ ] too man you know what i'm saying but these edibles up i plan on i don't know what i want to do man i don't know if i want to do a video of me making them i'm gonna definitely do a video on me making them the 20 grams going in and everything i have a whole video of that 20 grams going in man 20 grams on the scale everything but you know i don't know if i want to do a video of me off the edibles like a quick update video type [ __ ] like you know me i'd say like two minutes to me and like let's say 30 minutes in you know and then i pause it come back come back another 30 minutes after that give a little two minutes of me see how i am and then pause it come back another 30 and keep doing that [ __ ] that's the video i want to upload but the only thing that sucks about it bro it's like i feel like it would be bad quality because i don't got no pc or nothing to really edit my [ __ ] bro once i get a pc which i plan on getting i was gonna get the ps5 but i've been trying to get that forever bro i have the money i've had the money to get it literally for like [ __ ] three months an hour since it came out basically and i just broke you can't find it i there's no stores with it it's i can't get it online it's i can't get it so i'm gonna just get a pc man but i don't know if i want to get a i can't build it myself bro and i'm not about to pay i'm not about to [ __ ] get all the parts and pay for somebody to build it for me that's just going to be so much [ __ ] money i think so probably gonna have to buy a pre-built my range is like 800 is the most i'm trying to spend i don't need nothing crazy something i can run for tonight you know damn high as hell i just started talking about the pc but yeah man definitely plan on getting that so i can get better quality videos for you all man you know keep uploading i'm really [ __ ] sick that they uh deleted me at like 700 subs last time man i would have been and that was three four years ago bro i would have been up there right now with the channel bro this is like the fourth channel i had sadly bro youtube don't [ __ ] with me man youtube does not [ __ ] me well they don't [ __ ] with weed bro really because they deleted me because of weed that's why i got deleted we and i had one copyright from uh some music and i was just getting flagged oh just because of my weed i was just getting flagged for the weed every video man they [ __ ] me over bro i don't even know what time it is it's probably like one o'clock in the morning i don't know if i can check that on fire first thing what time is it the time is 12 56 a.m that's it there you go boom 12 56 a.m man one o'clock i was right there pretty [ __ ] fake though like a lot of y'all but yeah man how do y'all feel about this situation i just broke down to y'all do you think we're getting hit with it especially if you're on the east coast do you think the plugs out here is really getting hit with that [ __ ] bro or do you think that [ __ ] is just all a bunch of baloney you hear me i mean to be honest with you though it makes sense bro it really does make sense just at least from around where i'm at the quality has went down in certain areas i used to have fire and fire the qualities really just went down overall unless you're buying this expensive ass weed you know which is ridiculous and that's this is just an illegal states man if you're in a legal state like where you have recreational weed by all means bro y'all are fine but if you're somewhere where it's completely illegal and [ __ ] aren't getting it shipped to him and [ __ ] like that y'all [ __ ] could be getting hit with the hemp you know especially these plugs who'd be shipping wax and [ __ ] like black spell they'd be shipping like crc down [ __ ] packs and [ __ ] or even pine resin i've been saying or seeing already if you go to reddit fake dabs on reddit bro i don't know what the [ __ ] that little hand motion i just did was but if you go on reddit type your fake dabs bro that them [ __ ] be getting shipped their [ __ ] most of them they post like yeah i got this [ __ ] to me or plug got this shipped to them and and it'd be like pine rising and [ __ ] like that i'm like bro if they wanted to send that [ __ ] then i'd [ __ ] 100 believe the uh the hemp situation with the weed man that shit's crazy actually the first time hit breakwater [ __ ] forever man let me know if you guys want to see some of the weed uh maybe next video if i remember i think the next video i'm gonna do is gonna be the brownie video though to be honest so it might have to be the next next video after this video i'm probably gonna go in i don't know i might play some fortnite or i might just watch some tv you go to sleep i'm kind of tired man it's one o'clock in the morning i might take a look dad and go to bed matter of fact i think i'm gonna take a dab right now for y'all the last dab i took i was coughing like a [ __ ] too i don't even have any delta eight left really to smoke i don't think i got a little bit in here i don't know if i can even get it out this is the 98 percent really [ __ ] to be honest with you yeah it's really not nothing left i really shouldn't have took i took like a grammy and [ __ ] and put it in some [ __ ] call uh some hot chocolate and i was [ __ ] smack boys let me go ahead and uh i guess i'll dab i don't know what i'm gonna die like i said i'll dab some nothing nine i haven't done that in a while unless there's something left in this in this rolled over labs i don't think so but we can try oh there is there's a little dab left why is this just so runny like that bro that shit's annoying uh there was a little dab left it's kind of hard to scoop it out though man we're gonna get this dab out of there bro come on [ __ ] it's right there i'm literally [ __ ] touching it it's just so hard to get out bro [ __ ] that i'm about to die from d9 man oh that looks like a fat ass blob right there damn i just can't [ __ ] get it it's too runny man tried to get the d8 out man tried there's a whole bunch of d9 or d8 let me see if i can get this off i can't really get that all right i'm back i actually got some of that delta eight barry white a little tiny bit left that was in here now my hands [ __ ] sticky as hell but got that someone dab that real quick put some of that in there this is actually another the third banger i think i bought now in the past couple months i got a this carb cap always gets stuck in there so i gotta like heat it up real quick that's probably not even going to do anything but boom that [ __ ] always gets stuck in there man leave a pretty nice dab in there [ __ ] take this dab hi [ __ ] y'all all right i already know how this is gonna go so i'm gonna [ __ ] around and turn the fan on right now man cause i already know i'm gonna be called for like a [ __ ] actually only my third dab of the day too cheers so i'm gonna clean this [ __ ] bro this [ __ ] is like clogged at the bottom all right that should taste good as hell that barry white from [ __ ] highest elevation south florida i slept on this this [ __ ] right here bro i haven't been smoking like i smoked it all but i didn't smoke it too much man like it wasn't my favorite but wow this [ __ ] tastes good the high is nice really tastes fire", "mfawz0ujn_8": "[Music] hi guys I'm going to talk to you about five of common CBD vaping mistakes number one concentration levels of CBD so here we've got a 10 mil ball with 250 milligrams of CBD that's 2.5 percent of the liquid is CBD here we've got 100 mil bottle if that had the same amount of CBD in the hundred mil bottle it'd be point two five percent so that means don't spend more money just because it's a bigger bottle spend if it's got more CBD yeah number two hemp oil CBD low they are not the same thing do not confuse the two with the same hemp oil is way cheaper hemp oil has much much much lower levels of CBD so if you see a bulb with a really high amount of hemp oil and it's still cheap it's because it should be it's got this much CBD in it don't confuse it to number three three number three don't vape CBD oil a liquids are not called oils oil is oil a liquid is a liquid you get CBD oils to find your tongue CBE liquids to vape you do not want to be vaping CBD oil so that's number three don't vape see videos also a liquids are way more bioavailable what was by available me professor bioavailable means your body absorbs they're not better so if you put a drop on your tongue goes into your stomach gets absorbed for your at SIDS and all your hamburgers and your vegetarian sausage rolls and your pigs in blankets and your muesli and then it goes in your blood system whereas you vape it goes into your lungs those strains your capillaries into your blood system that's what being bioavailable means so if you faint CBD liquids more bioavailable just don't pay just don't feet you see video oils number for putting nicotine in your CBD liquid nicotine degrade CBD so if you get a CBD shot of nicotine included give it back to the shopkeeper you want your CBD as CBD came without nicotine number five is the right kit and the right tank for CBD CBD a liquid is pretty runny so if you use a big tank with a big coil the chances are it's going to come straight out the air holes all over your pocket your hands and your device that's expensive so use a simple little device like a pod system or a starter kit the best thing about it is they're also cheaper so if you get sold a big fancy flash kit for CBD vaping give it back to the shopkeeper and asking for a pod kit hi guys I hope you found this CBD video useful if you did please do us a solid share it on to

the treatment I'm getting today is a CBD soak combined with the CBD massage and I haven't seen this at any place else I'm really excited to try this treatment come along with me let's figure this out let's see if CBD really makes a difference [Music] my name is Daisy I am the owner and founder of Despard spa it is a very popular service so she will be getting today soaked we are using Cecil combined with CBD we are gonna add some bubbles I'm a central oils to make it a little more fun and relaxed and fluffy she would be in there for 30 minutes and then we're gonna follow her move her into another room and then she's gonna be getting a nice relaxing sport deep tissue massage we're gonna start using our massage oil which is the carrier CBD massage oil though such that we use for the CBD infused massage is 50 milligram per 1 ounce and for the soap is 100 milligrams per 1 ounce the CBD you can get all the fun medical benefits but you're not gonna get high you're not gonna get a positive on drug test for so you can just get all that fun stuff without being high some people some people experience a little tingling sensation everybody's different the benefits are the next day when she goes home you should go to sleep she's gonna wake up like a brand new woman I'm let into this room with this gigantic copper tub candles burning low light huge bubble bath and there's a smell in the air that's a little bit different than a normal bath smell it kind of has a herbal medicinal smell a little bit strong but still looks super inviting the smell is interesting because it smells like well it smells kind of like weed frankly like smell but it's definitely a strong smell the minute I put my toes in the water it was super warm and I immediately felt warm tingles in my legs and once I settled in I started feeling warm tingles all over my legs are fully floating and like tingly warm and tingly not mad at it okay guys just leave me here to soak I'll be here for the next thirty I'm at work right now [Music] [Applause] [Music] so after the soap go into the massage and that was a very welcomed experience after that warm bath she's using a CBD oil and the CBD oil right when it goes on it immediately you feel like a nice warm tingle and it's mainly afterwards that I still feel that warmth and that tingly feeling from the massage and she left the oil on and I still have the oil on so I still have that heavy warm deep feeling of relaxation I would say it did feel extra relaxed after this because of the CBD which was surprising I actually didn't know if I would feel anything at all I worked out yesterday I worked out pretty hard and I would say all that soreness is gone please let me know what I can be your guinea pig and try next because I'm down to try any beauty treatment so let me know using the hashtag ET style feed [Music] [Applause]", "iXOiyo5eYW0": "while we've probably all heard about the potential benefits of CBD by now what we don't hear too much about is the potential dangers of CBD oil or more specifically the potential dangers of a CBD oil vape pen CBD vape pens are often marketed as a healthier alternative to smoking and it's probably some truth to this whether you're talking about tobacco or marijuana most experts agree that vaping is less severe on the lungs than the smoke that's inhaled from combusted plant material the reason for this comes down to a simple temperature comparison standard joints and cigarettes can burn anywhere between 800 and 1600 degrees Fahrenheit but some high quality vaporizers operate at less than 400 degrees nowhere near hot enough to produce the tar and combustion that wreaks havoc on the lungs in fact there's really no reason to inhale at temperatures much hotter than 400 degrees Fahrenheit as most of the cannabinoids in marijuana are already fully decarboxylated by this point that being said the dangers of CBD oil vape pens come from the fact that improperly processed products may contain compounds that pose hazards to respiratory health the first thing to be wary of is something called cuticle wax cannabis flour is covered in a thin outer waxy layer which when smoked in a joint or Bowl is simply burned off under the extremely high temperatures of combustion in low-temperature vaporizers it may be possible for the wax layer to break off into tiny particles rather than burn away some have suggested that these particles may end up in the lungs as solidified granulomas to avoid this potential hazard look for CBD vape oil that has undergone winterization this is a chemical process that removes the cuticle wax from the plant material before it ever reaches a vaping device another concern to be wary of is thinning agents like polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol more commonly known as PE g and PG in its natural state cannabis oil is much too viscous to be compatible with vape pen heater coils for this reason thinning agents are often added to make the oil more fluid and also to produce the tasty thick vape clouds that so many people love the only problem is both PE g + PG are known to break down into carcinogenic formaldehyde when exposed to temperatures above 440 degrees Fahrenheit a range that even top shelf vaporizers commonly operate in while the dangers of formaldehyde are most evident in other kinds of products it is probably not a substance that you want to be inhaling on a regular basis lastly in terms of the potential dangers of CBD oil vape products be advised that when you're shopping around for a vape pen you're going to get what you pay for some low end vaporizers have been known to operate at temperatures of up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit this quite obviously defeats the purpose of vaping as you're still combusting the oil and plant material into a thick tari residue in other words try and invest as much money as you can into a good well reviewed unit also try and find a vape pen that has manually controllable temperature settings this allows you to adjust the operating temperature to around 340 degrees Fahrenheit which many suggest is the perfect vaping temperature for CBD and cannabis for maximum safety and to avoid the potential dangers of CBD oil vapes as much as possible try and also look for winterized VAE boils as well as oils and eliquid 'z that RP eg free thanks for watching and of course if you have any additional questions or concerns be sure to leave us a comment down below you", "SmYm0-60ZD0": "a boil there is so much buzz right now around these little bottles of oil pictures you hear about have been just about every form of media these days from the news to articles circulating on social media to Senate bills being passed and even on TV shows hemp seems to be all anyone is talking about so what's the big deal well here's what you need to know about heaven first it is a powerful antioxidant in fact hemp oil contains more antioxidants than most whole fruits and vegetables as well as several key minerals and vitamins like D and E as well as fatty acids the second hemp is amazing in terms of sustainability because of the short time it takes to grow where a tree can take many years to mature hemp only takes approximately four months from plant to harvest hemp has many other uses other than just nutritional benefits in fact did you know that the first two drafts of the Declaration of Independence were written on paper made from hemp its fibers have a wide variety of applications from paper to plastic fuel clothing and rope so if we have known about all the uses of hemp for so long why does it seem to be the next big thing right now well here's a small history lesson for you in the 1700s farmers in Virginia Connecticut and Massachusetts were required by law to grow hemp and in some colonies failure to grow hemp could actually lead to jail time in the early 1800s during the agricultural age of our nation hemp could actually be used to legal tender to pay taxes with then around the 1930s with the Industrial Age taking off suddenly hemp was made legal and villainized with a lot of racial and gender related propaganda gross this was all largely due to the paper industry running scared because hemp was so much more cost-effective than paper it's just recently with the discovery of how vital the cannabinoids found in heme are to our overall health that people have begun to rediscover all the phenomenal benefits of this amazing plan there are tons of phyto cannabinoids bioflavonoids and terpenes that are found naturally in the plant these compounds when combined create a synergistic effect to produce a greater response than any of them can create individually so how exactly does hemp oil work inside our bodies every mammal has what is called an endocannabinoid system this is a lipid derived signaling system that was discovered in the 1990s as it turns out hemp is full of the phyto cannabinoids that activate these receptors this system is responsible for memory networks in the brain hemp is part of the cannabis plant family the two strains that make up this family are marijuana and hemp so while they may have many similarities they also have some distinctive differences that are important to know both are high in cannabinoids and these little molecules bind to receptors in our bodies however their phyto cannabinoid compounds are not the same hemp is high in cannabinoids like CBD c VG and cbc where marijuana is high in THC which is responsible for the high feeling you get hemp is quite low in THC under 0.3% which means you won't get the same psychoactive effects as you would with marijuana this makes hemp ideal for getting the phyto cannabinoids our bodies need without the psychotropic effects cannabinoids like those found naturally in hemp are homeostatic regulators and they circulate through our bodies continuously cannabinoids bind to the cb1 and cb2 receptors either directly or indirectly cannabinoid receptors cb1 and cb2 facilitate the responses inside the body which are critical to maintaining homeostasis cb1 receptors are excitatory and can be primarily found in the lungs kidneys central nervous system and liver cb2 receptors are located in the circulatory and immune systems so why does this all matter the signaling systems help your body communicate better with all its different parts this helps support your body's overall health and general well-being see TFO hemp oils are completely isolated through co2 extraction and crystal precipitation they are among the highest grade pesticide free non GMO hemp oils in the world our hemp is sourced from industrial hemp farms that are fully compliant with the State Department of Agricultural regulations and our large

"7V7JmMF50ew": "What does him legalization mean for just\nthe I guess the cannabis and the CBD industry in general Jessica why don't we\nstart with you so it's early you're relatively early in the morning so this\nis normally the part when I talk about this that people begin to look at me\nlike I have three heads or I must be really stoned or I must have gotten them\nreally stoned because trying to reconcile the day to day experience of\nseeing CBD out there versus the legal reality and even the legal reality post\nfarm bill is what's it's kind of a might war because the two don't really bear\nmuch resemblance to each other the farm bill is it is absolutely tremendous\nlonger-term but what it really is is it's about the commercial production of\nhemp what it basically says is the states get to set up a scheme if they so\nchoose which I would expect many of them would and maybe California Department of\nFood and Agriculture will continue to make more forward momentum that way and\nit will being that hemp products will eventually be able to be on the market\ngo to different states and you can use them for all that the farm bill does not\nexplicitly address CBD to the best of my knowledge but a lot of people began to\nget very excited like wow okay if it's drive from hemp I guess for good this is\nall fine and all that stuff Jessica likes to tell me about how the DEA still\nsays it's Schedule one even if hypothetically it came from hemp with\nzero point zero zero zero zero zero percent THC no she's just wrong no\nunfortunately the FDA it came out the next day and poured a bunch of cold\nwater all over everyone and what they have said is and this is again the\nwritten reality versus the actual reality that basically CBD even when it\nis hemp derived remains something that they do not allow for at least human\nand/or pet consumption it cannot be marketed as a supplement it\ncannot be marketed as a dietary additive or anything like that\nthey did agree well we have allowed something derived from CBD on the market\nand we we want to keep doing that and that\nis a Padilla which of course we're then the CBD is actually derived from\ncannabis and they've slotted that in at schedule six so we're still seeing this\npretty massive disconnect between the reality you see every day versus what a\nlot of the regulatory bodies would tell you we also still have the backdrop of\nthe California Department of Public Health adopting the same position as the\nFDA and I do not believe they have revised it since the passage of the farm\nbill so we have what looks like a more grey or confusing legal scheme and yet\nyou hear about CBD every day my inbox is filled with PR emails from people\nrepresenting CBD companies I got something for a CVD coach the CBD market\nis set to be worth 22 billion I think by 2022 what the farm bill does do on some\nlevels is a debt for farmers specifically it allows them to more\naccess to like crop insurance banking the Department of Water going back to\nwhat we're talking about with CBD I feel like it'll come to three different\nlevels so one of them will be like we sleep like epidemics another one will be\npeople will be marketing it like a supplement and then you have also the\nproliferation of the cannabis dr CBD market as well another thing is that\nwe're going to be hearing all these buzzwords around CBDs so full spectrum\nand broad spectrum whole plan to isolate whatever not everyone is using these\nterms correctly and the consumer doesn't always know what these terms mean so I\nthink as the market develops there's going to be there's going to need to be\na lot more oversight even if it's not regulatory because the government's not\nsaying you can or cannot call your plant full-spectrum or broad spectrum or\nsomething like that so the public really needs to start to understand what the\ndifference is between all the different types of CBD offerings where it's\nderived from how its isolated or extracted and start to bring that into\nmore of the mainstream awareness thanks that's a really good point yeah so you\nknow there's by the time it reaches the CBD stage we really at this point might\nnot know kind of where it came from and so like figuring out how to distinguish\nthat is a real challenge really fascinating to see the disconnect\nand in the war from you know the legality and even when the barbell came\nat you seemed he saw saw a lot of yeah everything from forbes teen all these\nincredible and like journalists and publications celebrating the passage of\nthe farm bill which in turn is you know commercial production of it but in the\nreality is you know it's still illegal and and in most cases and with all on a\ndistribution side and before the farm bill you would like say six months ago\nyou're a year ago we would be talking to big-box retailers such as Target GNC CVS\nWalmart and they wouldn't touch it any you know but we'd be at every convention\nand everything like that talking to any of the standard big-box retailers since\nthe passage of the farm bill every single one of them is on board like\nevery coffee shop every bar I mean every brand is trying to stay relevant is\nslapping CBD on the labels and I think was last year in Utah or the year before\nI was an army base and like eighty people got fifty to eighty people got\nhospitalized from vape pens and it was at the synthetic CBD coming out of China\nso there's a lot in a supply chain you know how we originally got into it was\nthat's been where we started a supply chain and that is a huge huge issue\nbecause there's only really a handful of legitimate credible companies on the\nextraction side and the cannabis and CBD markets are very very different people\nand very different you know companies doing it so you know on the on the CBD\nside it's a lot of murky waters on the supply chain and you will get and I've\nseen it over the last two years you know especially a lot of like investment\nfunds or a lot of people coming into the space and and and especially as a new\nbrand coming and they will buy you know they'll get a potency test on their\nEisler other oil and then five days later two weeks later when they're their\nfull panel comes back I'll be filled with heavy metals or pesticides and it's\nand you know essentially unusable and then I'll also understanding the\ndifference in legalities like you know if you have a product you're shipping\ninternationally understanding what those boundaries are having any sort of THC in\nthe product and what's going to have the most buy availability it's really\ninteresting on the international play is on the raw material side so some of the\ncountries where it's still not technically there yet and we will do\nsend it on a medical site leg or on a research side so say like in Italy it's\nthe the Minister of Health you know and so like it's in the UK now it's opened\nup a lot more but they get it they're very strict over there especially when\nit comes to like testing so sending any sort of you know especially run the raw\nmaterial side that goes through you know goes through our customs they go through\nthat goes to their v80 and it's it's really interesting because two years ago\nit was very hit-or-miss and you could send over you know half a million\ndollars with the product and they would get seized even if it was tested at 0.00\nso it was kind of a roll the dice but companies over there we're still still\ndoing it quite a bit now and you know now it's very much so and you know\nplaces like Australia I mean Australia I was just there over the years and it's\nyou know the CBD market but it's highly illegal there still and and and a lot of\nplaces in the EU it's you know it's still kind of opening up but it yeah\nit's it's not illegal to ship to these places but it's illegal for people to\npurchase he be like can see on this a consumer good side for a consumers to\nyou know it's illegal for them to to have it in their country or to buy in\ntheir country but a lot of them you know get it shipped from overseas so it's\ninteresting to see the disconnect and how quickly legislations moving I mean\nbut Thailand just opened up which is incredible and it's gonna kind of\nopening up like you know a lot of these places in especially in Southeast Asia\nit's very very very illegal and now kind of just seeing like how these trends are\ngoing and these really incredible markets like in China CBD is now legal\nfor cosmetics and I mean that's you know an insane industry a very very large\nmarket so it's very exciting stuff yeah Oh", "-ytJBUszHPs": "My name is Eric Moses, i'm 87 years of age.\u00a0\nI've been

responsible for making us feel happy emotions one study found that patients who had a 300 milligrams dose of cbd oil showed significantly improved results than those who had a placebo number two relieve pain another great benefit of cbd oil is that it can help to relieve pain it works through the action of substances called endocannabinoid these are responsible for helping to regulate important bodily functions including sleep appetite our immune system and pain cbd oil promotes the activity of these endocannabinoids and so helps all these functions to work as they should and so

functioning of endocannabinoids and therefore can help to alleviate some of the symptoms and triggers of anorexia it does this by blocking the receptor for the endocannabinoid responsible so it effectively deactivates it and stops the receptor from triggering a signal that could cause the symptoms its antidepressant properties also help to alleviate the symptoms of anorexia for where they

marvelous properties through countless articles and advertisements so now you might be wondering what is cbd oil and what is it good for well you've come to the right place just don't expect any fluff just the cold hard facts is what you get here let's start with the most simple questions first because it's an easy question to answer what is cbd oil according to healthline cbd is one of about 100 chemicals found in the cannabis plant cbd which is found in about 40 percent of the cannabis plant is made by distillation of the cbd from the cannabis or hemp plant it is distilled from the flowers leaves stems and stalks of matured hemp plants then moderated with a carrier oil such as coconut oil next we want to examine a typical cbd oil seller's sales pitch this comes direct from diamond cbd's website although we are not picking on them the same kind of misleading information can be found on dozens of other cbd oil websites diamond cbd says 1. cbd oil from hemp is safe and legal two it's a great choice for those wanting something that comes direct from nature first although cbd is a lot safer than almost any other medication and i definitely recommend it the federal drug administration has serious concerns about cbd oil from the fda website the fda has seen only limited data about cbd safety and this data points to real risks that need to be considered before taking cbd for any reason second concerning something that comes from nature we have to also realize that nature produces many dangerous substances eating puffer fish for example can be 12 000 times more toxic than cyanide yucca leaves and roots can cause paralysis raw almonds contain cyanide raw cashews contain the same poisonous substance as poison ivy two or three teaspoons of nutmeg can lead to convulsion and seizures so nature isn't always super friendly cbd oil will never be a patented medicine realize too that though there is some research trials here and there to prove cbd oil cures certain ailments and has many benefits they will never be more than just minor blips in the scientific process the reason is that even if a cbd oil study proved it cured cancer or cardiovascular disease you can't get a drug approved by the fda for cbd oil as it's a common substance you might as well make the same claim for vitamin c apple cider vinegar fish oil all of which can have health benefits but none of which are patentable sure you can sell it as long as you don't claim any health benefits in your advertising but even if you were jeff bezos with 145 billion dollars and you decided to spend it all on cbd oil research you wouldn't have any competitive advantage over a cbd seller with a minuscule fraction of the resources so there's no point in big pharma doing research because they can't patent it and make money off cbd cbd health benefits so after being such a sour puss and destroying almost all scientific facts about the health benefits of cbd are there any real benefits to cbd oil many hundreds of thousands of individuals who have tried it say yes pain relief one of the most claimed benefits of using cbd oil is pain relief bearing in mind that the health benefits of cbd oil are anecdotal there are millions of people who are in pain and are seeking relief other than through medications they view cbd oil as a more natural form of painkiller according to healthline everyone's nervous system has a cell signaling system within their body it is theorized that the way cbd oil works to reduce pain is to inhibit the cell systems that signal pain people with fibromyalgia cancer pain arthritis aches and migraine headaches often resort to taking cbd oil for relief although there are no trial studies to support that it works some people even give cbd oil to their cats and dogs although the fda warns against it besides warning that there are no studies to support that cbd oil is effective on any type of animal they caution that the fairly unregulated aspect of cbd producers does not guarantee that it is produced under sterile conditions or even contains any cbd at all sleeplessness and anxiety here while there may be a few research studies on it advocates of cbd to improve sleep and also to relieve anxiety may be on more solid ground studies have shown that cbd heavily reduces the anxiety of rats and many humans report the same calming effects it is theorized that what takes place is cbd oil affects serotine transmitters the same way that prescription drugs such as zoloft or prozac do and of course the benefit of cbd oil is that you don't need a prescription for it and it's probably a lot safer for you than zoloft or prozac as to sleeplessness there are studies that cbd can lead to greater and a more restful night's sleep and millions take it nightly an hour before bedtime help with acne many people use cbd oil to treat acne believe it or not there are small studies that show cbd having a positive effect on acne due to its anti-inflammatory effect while some people take cbd orally most acne uses simply rub a cbd cream or balm directly on the skin supposedly cbd oil treats acne by adjusting how the body produces sebum sebum is a waxy oily substance our skin makes for the purpose of protecting our skin from daily damages but too much oily skin causes breakouts cbd helps regulate the sebum so we produce the right amount cbd is also antibacterial and antifungal which helps reduce build up of toxins dirt and other pollutants clogging up the pores on your skin another possible benefit is heart health cbd has been demonstrated in a few small studies to reduce high blood pressure compared to a placebo as we all know blood pressure medications have many negative side effects and the fact that cbd oil may help high blood pressure this is one health benefit to watch especially since it has very low chances of negative side effects another major subject is cbd in preventing seizures unc school of medicine researchers have ran multiple studies showing that cbd may help reduce seizures significantly asides from that there are thousands of people that claim to have had reduced the frequency of their epileptic seizures in half and other claim it has completely gotten rid of their epileptic convulsions altogether some research shows that you may need to up the dose of your full spectrum cbd oil the longer you use it in order to have the same effects all in all cbd seems to be very beneficial in helping treat a bunch of different conditions more and more research is being done on cbd that looks promising but because of lack of funding the research comes out really slow if you enjoyed this video please don't forget to subscribe and hit the like button", "xGIBf71wJ-8": "so you're taking CBD oil or you're considering taking CBD oil but your company or some other organization you're associated with does drug testing and you want to know well that test positive that's a pretty common question these days and the answer is maybe it really depends on the type of testing done and it depends on the CBD product that you're taking and how much you take of that product CBD is not regulated because it's a Schedule one drug and actually federally illegal even though just driving down the street I saw four or five signs between my house and my office that said CBD here or CBD there so there's a lot of confusion based on CBD oil CBD oil has non soap psychoactive it does not contain THC for the most part or it should not however since it is variable it is not regulated some CBD oil contains a little bit or none some contains more and possibly enough to make a test positive for a drug test some CBD oil just so you know contains no CBD oil at all there have been some that have been tested and are out there so it's really buyer beware at this point so if you really want to know you could always if you're taking it take a drug test yourself and find out so the big thing is no matter what you decide to do is if you are subject to drug testing and you do test positive that's not going to be excuse it's not going to be accepted as a medical explanation because it's not legal now there is a slight change to that in the 2018 farm bill which legalized CBD oil from hemp products which is completely different than from marijuana even though it's the same cannabis and that way family we're going to talk about that in another video so make sure you tune back with that so the ultimate question is are you willing to risk it in the situation that you're in taking CBD

your daughter but if you continue to talk see this right now which resonate if you did this over the course of my flowers like Montel is here to talk about this controversial idea to use marijuana to treat opioid addiction also dr. Yasmin herb is a neuroscientist studying the impact of marijuana and opioid addiction Thank You Pat or source but let me start without her the latest research what's out there that might tempt us to think that marijuana which people always criticize is a gateway drug may actually be the salvation for many suffering with opioids you know although marijuana has been used for millennia research is still in its infancy", "OUXC-oNTPfo": "[Music] alright thanks for stopping in with down the road show here today to talk about CBD and more what's the more for ringa the Moringa tree everything on the Moringa tree is edible and good for you good for your immune system good for your stomach good for your skin helps with edema and then on top of that it's got the CBD why am I talking specifically about this brand because I'm having a really rough day with my nerves and my my neck it pinched something about half an hour ago and my I couldn't stop the shaking in my head which was minor and you wouldn't be able to see I have two bottles of CBD and more one is 1000 milligrams now there's lots of companies out there that make 1000 milligrams - guess what sometimes a thousand milligrams isn't enough to stop your pain or the nerve damage or the shaking that's going on even in my hands kind of currently right now so but that is the life I have to deal with and what I have to deal with now so when a thousand milligrams isn't enough five thousand milligrams is what I have to turn to is once again this is CBD so I'm not getting stoned I'm not getting high I can still function like a normal human being and go about my day but if it wasn't for the 5,000 milligrams my CBD and more I wouldn't even meet in my truck right now riding along with my sister to go run errands I'd be stuck in the house in a ton and ton and ton of pain so I I love backing lots of different CD CBD products and telling you all about them and whatnot but as far as I'm concerned this is one of the better ones out there the top of the line if you have a CBD product and you think it's better than this well prove me wrong send it to me let's talk because right now CBD and more 5,000 milligrams that's that's it that's that's the stuff that's the ticket and so when when I'm having my worst days and the things are just beyond my control and no other CBD product on the market can touch what's going on with me or my pain nerve damage this is where I turn to CBD and more so go check them out and tell them down the road show since you thanks for stopping in", "WHR600yzbmY": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're gonna be making cannabis lemonade using powder so let's get into it [Music] all right that's my cannabis if you use lemonade is now done so thank you for watching this video don't forget to Like share and subscribe [Music]", "xaH4LfA7Zmw": "hello friends it is Alina alive back for another video and I help women find balance through wellness videos like these and nutrition tips and in this one I tried CBD for the first time for my period pain and alright guys so as you may or may not know based off of my previous I tried videos where I tried menstrual cups for the first time I am a menstruating woman and through my journey into the health and wellness world I have been able to drastically reduce a lot of the chronic PMS or pee menstrual symptoms that I had like breast tenderness cramps period pain moodiness and so much more that I had to deal with for a really long time growing up before I even knew anything about how my lifestyle and diet choices could drastically reduce those things but I am a human being and sometimes I fall short whether it be because I am dehydrated or I don't focus on hormone balance or whatever it is every once in a while I still experience period pain I still experience a lot of these symptoms so I figured for my I tried series since I like to dive into a lot of these new health and wellness practices and see whether or not they work for me I thought I'd check out the very famous or infamous CBD oil now unless you've been sitting under a rock you've probably heard of CBD or cannabidiol ordeal which is one of many cannabinoids that are found in marijuana now one of the more famous cannabinoids being THC is psychoactive but unlike THC CBD is not psychoactive and it actually has so many benefits and it's been cropping up in popularity for really good reason you've probably seen it as bath bombs and skincare products in drinks in sodas in foods I think are you in saw that Kim Kardashian had a CBD themed birthday shower or baby shower I don't know all of that to say the hype is real and it is for legitimate reasons CBD has been researched for its countless benefits in helping with anxiety stress one of the most powerful benefits that it's been shown has been to help with people with epilepsy and probably one of the biggest reasons why I want to try it for this video is it's powerful anti-inflammatory properties now these anti-inflammatory properties have been linked with helping people with chronic pain bloating migraines and headaches and so much more and guess what inflammatory symptoms are linked with PMS or premenstrual symptoms like tender breasts bloating migraines abdominal pain cramps and so much more so for all of these reasons I decided to try it out during my period so the basic game plan is that I'm actually not gonna be doing it for my full period I'm actually only gonna be doing it for the first three days because that's when my symptoms are really present and the three things I'm gonna be looking out for over these next few days is bloating period pain or general pain and cramps I'm also going to be paying attention to my energy levels and seeing if I feel stressed at all as I know a really big reason why people try CBT is for that relaxation aspect so I decided to go with the CBD brand called clear bright days and they are an awesome hemp oil and CBD company that is really focused on personalizing your experience with CBD and the flavor that I got with strawberry lemon-aid and I ended up doing droppers throughout my time so without further ado let's get started all right so day one started with a road trip because lucky me my cycle started in the very beginning of my 4th of July weekend where I traveled over to my parents house and the road trip was about five hours long and it consisted of me sitting there for five hours without movement and so within an hour into the drive I started to feel the pain and cramping and just bloatedness so during one of the pit stops I had Chris Drive and I decided to try out one full dropper of clear bright days all right guys I'm not gonna lie I feel like it hasn't really been working I like one hour and I started to feel like the bloating and I started to feel like the pain not necessarily like the twinges of cramps but I felt it coming on in my back everywhere so I was like alright it's time to take this so I switched spots of Chris he's driving and as the hour went on our two that's usually by the time usually if I take anything it hits me it still felt bad it actually got worse and after about three hours I ended up having to take ibuprofen because it was that bad I feel like this is a perfect example of how you can be healthy and balanced but sometimes you can be in situations where you can't necessarily do the holistic practices that would help you preventing crams and regulating your hormones like movement something that's important to know when it comes to period pain and cramping is that hydration plays such a huge role not only does it help our bodies to figure out and regulate our hormones which are what controlled these cramps and these a lot of this pain that we're feeling but it also helps us to reduce and handle our pain so making sure you're well hydrated I know for me at least a week before your period and during can play a huge role and it's probably been the biggest habit that I've seen the most difference with which is why I'm pretty sure wasn't the CBD that was the problem it was just my severe dehydration [Music] the next day just so happened to be 4th of July lucky me and it was a really busy day it was a really fun day out in the Sun we got to see fireworks and it was just a lot of movement I was visiting my parents and I didn't have a lot of time to really like settle and chill so I was really excited to try to CVT and see if it could help settle me down a little bit more but also see its effects on my cramps in bloating couples with adequate hydration and I felt really good that day one of the things I was worried about was that because it's so good with relaxation I kind of associated with other medications and herbs that help to relax you and that it could almost a date you or something but that was not the case with CBD I felt really good throughout the day I didn't feel sedated at all and I did not feel any cramping alright fast forward to day 3 we ended up going to Sedona in Arizona now this is such a gorgeous place and it has so much talk and hype around its energy it's actually considered one of the chakras of the world and it's been tested and researched for its energy vortexes and associated with helping you through its electromagnetic fields get into a deeper meditative state we didn't really do too much of that but we did get a tour into the desert and it was really gorgeous but again we were driving over there for two plus hours the actual tour was off-roading for over an hour in the hot Sun and we were walking around all day and I was really worried about that but it ended up turning out to be really interesting because believe it or not I didn't really feel like I was even having a cycle because one I used the CBD and I actually coupled it with my menstrual cups so I wasn't like running to the bathroom constantly to like change anything and it really that day coupled with the hydration and movement of the day I felt like I literally almost forgot that I was on my cycle like obviously when I went to the bathroom and things like that it was in the back of my mind but I felt really good that day and it was really interesting to see so my overall experience with the CBD I would say was very positive but I do want to point out that the biggest lesson that I learned was that you can't use this as a fix-it pill to solve all your problems it helps when it's coupled with healthy lifestyle habits like hydration movement eating healthy foods that help you regulate your hormones and so much more now every CBD company is different and they have so many different ratios of hemp oil to medium chain triglycerides to CBD itself so be sure to do your own research and see what works for you I am not sponsored by this brand or any others for this video but if you are a brand be sure to check out the email and peal box below so I just want to preface that and also

right guys my cannabis kool-aid is now done thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace", "87FgbwgR34E": "hey guys welcome back to the do gross on today's episode I'm gonna show you how to make edible chocolates I'm gonna do pretty much from the start to the finish starting out with infusing butter and enough with a really simple way to do chocolates we're not making it from scratch we're just infusing like baker's chocolate with our and fused butter [Music] well for this batch butter I decided I wanted to go with green crack which is a hybrid strain but it's it leans a lot more towards a sativa side so it kind of wanted a good daytime high-energy kind of butter to make these chocolates with [Music] so I did want to make this butter fairly strong fairly potent and I had two cups of butter and which is basically four sticks of butter and I infused a quarter ounce of this group of cracked flour into the butter with the magical butter machine the first thing that we have to deal with our cannabis is 2d carbon so throw it near oven at 250 ish degrees and spread it out a little bit and make sure it's in there for about 31 well that does is it transfers the THC a and to THC psychoactive property in cannabis so you definitely need to do that before infusing it in the oil little tip if you guys are using this magical butter machine is while your d carbon erat cannabis just throw your like hard butter right into the magical butter machine right now and start it up for an hour on low temperature just so you can melt your butter and then it's ready for the D carb wheat as soon as it comes out [Music] well after 30 minutes in the oven I pulled out all that weed and took it off the stem no need to put the stems in there and ended up having 12 grams of cannabis that went into four I'm sorry two cups of butter all you need to do is just add that right into your butter solution that you have all warmed up and add a little bit of soy or sunflower less at it as well that helps to emulsify and combine the cannabinoids to the butter I love this magical butter machine though it does it all for you adjust 162 hours once everything's in there you are good to go to set it and forget it for two hours [Music] all right so let's talk about dosing that is a thing that's really hard to find exactly the right the right metrics on how to get it I found this website this calculator out there and you need to know the starting material the THC in the starting material I know the screen crack is roughly 20% so that's what I'm starting with and if you're using trim you might not really know what you're getting so this one I wanted to get a more accurate test on on the exact THC percentage per serving [Music] I was gonna be melting down 12 ounces of chocolate and I was gonna add two ounces of the infused butter so I knew that for the 12 ounces of chocolate I was gonna have roughly 210 milligrams of THC that's going to get infused in that entire batch I didn't know the final amount of serving still after I poured it and that's how many the runner and the first one so the first set of chocolates so I do that that was roughly 5 milligrams per chocolate in the first batch all right so after two hours next step is we just have to classify the butter away from all the cannabis material that's left in the bag so there's this bag comes with the magical butter machine which is basically just like a strainer so pour it all in there squeeze it all out get all the butter through hopefully you don't get too many solids that come through with it there definitely want some milk fats that came through but was able to pretty much clarify that out by just pouring it into the jar before I was gonna add that to the chocolates you do lose some starting material as well so even though I went in with two cups of butter I only came out with about maybe a confident corner of of the butter I probably could have done a little bit better like squeezing out more but that was the clearest stuff that I got and that was the stuff I was happiest with so yeah only about 1 and 1/4 cup but off of the two cups of butter I started out just by doing a small double boiler thing you can warm up chocolate however you feel like this I just boiled some water put another pan on top of it in the water and poured in the chocolate chips from there so 12 ounces of chocolate chips and 2 ounces of the infused oil [Music] after that just start for a few minutes want to make sure it's obviously very evenly infinim mixed in they might want to separate a little bit I actually did add a tablespoon of some more lesson to this as well to help with the emulsification of the oil and the chocolate [Music] the first bachelor did two ounces and wanted to see how the consistency was they seemed really good when it popped amount so the second one I was like maybe we can make these a little stronger so I added three ounces to the next batch which ended up being on the dark chocolate chocolate chips that who meld up here [Music] now all that's left to do is just pour them into your molds I use these silicone molds I got off of Amazon I didn't need to oil them at all they pop out super easy so yeah just forms for an ear molds and then right under your freezer only takes about 30 minutes for them to firm up once you have your final count about how many servings you have then you can actually see how many milligrams of your THC is in each serving so my first batch I kind of overfilled a little bit all the way up to the top and I got like 40 for individual chocolates of this semi-sweet stuff with the two ounces of infused oil which was roughly 5 milligrams per serving my second batch the dark chocolate I used 3 ounces of oil actually a little bit more than that and it ended up making 62 I want to say 62 servings so a lot more servings and that's visit and pour in the chocolate quite as much but the THC percentage was roughly the same because I used that more THC infused oil in the whole batch you I have all sorts of different containers and stuff for flour and inedible so I put some of these little ten summons bags and then I'm gonna be leave them in my refrigerator for I don't know maybe a week or so eating them once in a while but also just want to let them dry out a little bit there a little bit moist so yeah leave it in the fridge for a bit and I think they'll be good on the shelf for at least a couple months and that is it I think that is the easiest way that you can make chocolate edibles they're not making any chocolate you're just melting down existing chocolate adding your oil boom done simple as that so it's gonna work for a lot of us that aren't expert cooks like myself and yeah I think these things will be great so check out the magical butter machine if you're interested at all in making infused oils you won't regret it I'm going to post a link down below that you can click as well to get it off Amazon and if you've watched a couple of these videos that though if you subscribed and hung around got more videos coming up about once a week and yeah I think that's about it for now

up nobody sent nobody sent anything in the mail but this beautiful box that I procured and I'm just gonna get into with you look I'm not saying if you want to get on my good side you have to help me acquire marijuana cannabis products but look it doesn't hurt I'm totally kidding basically um there's this couple out of Maine that follow my channel I think they may be found me from this jarred jam music festival review I did or something anyway New England fam we sing together especially fish fam or just jam band fam you guys know what to do they started following me on like Facebook I think um and then I started following them on Instagram and I saw that they have this THC CBD confectionary situation going on I picture it like them living on this big piece of land in Maine and just like in their sugar shack like the making of the candies but I don't know and then I shouted him out in my end of your vid I forget exactly what I said there's this really cool couple at watch that live in Maine and they make like CBD [ __ ] candies if you ever want me to review any of those for you on the channel like I'm happy to and they hit me up shortly thereafter saying that they had some stuff that they wanted me to try so I was very excited and also that was happening when I was going through my dry spell like a week ago that you guys saw and it was like it was like water in a desert you know what I got this box instantly I was like wow look at this this effort put in now if you're not hip to the scene you wouldn't know that this is a fish kind of a fish pattern the drummer always wears a dress with the same pattern but that's not even the coolest part looked underneath how cool when I saw how cool the outside of the box was I knew the inside can only cooler and it was now I already ate quite a bit of what was in here so I can't review everything but they wrote a very sweet note in the box which I was very touched by Oh see you the only one is left these are the three two one THC CBD fruit punch now these these are the three two one CBD to THC now I am not sure how many milligrams any of this stuff is but I always just say there was only one way to know you know you throw down the hatch so I'm gonna do one of these because I'm going out a little bit later and I just you know why are you relaxed my life is very stressful mmm you know the candy itself is very delicious I'm tasting a little coconut oil base am I wrong very good not it's like sweet and tasty but not like gross you know nice green apple flavor like I'm not [ __ ] candy connoisseur rouse them and this was tasty too and okay they sent to Wally's lollies they sent to lollipops I ate those as soon as they send them I had one oh my god half an hour later I just felt like there was like a warm wrap around my skull I was like I feel [ __ ] good a minute slowly faded away and I didn't feel tired afterwards I didn't feel tired at all so I said bucket if one was a gun second one's gonna get had that same thing happened oh yeah that's something I noticed with the other candy - it's like you feel high but like everything feels like it just feels like a warm blanket you know it's nice now the store which I didn't even mention the name of the store the store is called High Times confection they're on Instagram I'll link it below check it out even if you just like looking at pictures of delicious weed candy which I'm a fan of if you like to torture yourself because apparently South Dakota is gonna legalize weed before New Hampshire of course I'm a legal cannabis patient so naturally naturally and 21 plus 21 plus ok so this is hemp CBD one to oneself I think you say solve just most like nice lotion I used once I don't know if it's supposed to be like a pain relieving or just like a nice lotion if you guys want to let me know ok so I've saved the best thing for last this is a two to one THC CBD suppository and each depository is 20 milligrams of THC and 10 milligrams of CBD so pretty nice a suppository you don't know goes either up the ass or up the vagina I was thinking this would be fantastic for cramps and then I had a horrible cramps the other day and I got to tell you the last thing I felt like doing was sticking Li hand of a bloodied vagina so I I just was like it was a war zone down there so I stayed away I mean I put a tampon that was about it there was no room for anything else dan and I are doing the float tomorrow night and I thought Oh like the sleep perfect I'll do the suppository I'll go to the float I'll be nice and high and then I'll report back do a little bit of a product review is but I need your help guys I need your help should I put this up the V or the V and I'm gonna post on Instagram now asking you and I'm gonna have you boat and then whatever you vote is what I'll do and this is how you really need to be following my Instagram for this type of content okay it's the next day and the results are in actually the results were very mixed a lot of people said but a lot of people said vag a lot of people said why not both actually that was like the most popular answer so I went with the but for now but then maybe in the future we can drive the vagina okay so anyway we are heading to a float I'm going back to NH folks and I inserted the suppository I don't know it was hard like it wasn't in an actual pill so I like you know I don't know but I washed my hands with soap after so hopefully that's you know I don't want to contaminate the tank okay so I'll let you know how it goes I know you're not supposed to get like super header high more of a body high but this should be perfect for the float so we'll see all right guys we're post float post depository I'm super relaxed no obviously that's partially because of the float but I will say that once I like got into the tank whatever I was really easily able to kind of just slip into a relaxation and fall asleep and it was maybe one of the best naps I've had in the tank since I started floating the suppository insertion like I think I need to get a little more clarity on that I'm assuming I don't put like the actual plastic inside I feel like that'd be a bad idea but I think I need to get a little more precise like with placement and squeeze through technique but I'm gonna do it of the V next time because I think it would be so good for cramps but I'm feeling a super great super relaxed and gonna go home and make another meal delivery kit which you'll be seeing all about that soon so okay guys thank you for watching this episode of and slating show see you next time goodbye a lot of you wanted me to put it in the B some of you wanted me to put it in the B and the rest you wanted me to put it in the BMV I probably will cut some of this out but",

they do different things THC is the part of the marijuana plant that gives you the high you can use it for things like killing pain and helping with on somnium this website breaks down those lists very simply for you now CBD is a little bit different that compound can work against seizures and depression while also helping to a leave of that anxiety as well now here's how I'm getting you more tonight I talked to people who have used these compounds to see the differences through their stories cannabis makes everything just a little more bright Cape Coral Air Force veteran and mother of three Jaime Cruz has been through a lot she suffers from post-traumatic stress and has lupus two conditions that led to several prescriptions but nearly two years ago she discovered using THC and CBD helped ease her pain has brought a wellness about my body that I've been able to discontinue 12 prescriptions 12 prescription medicines that's that's amazing Jaime tells me every patient is different and what might work for some might not work for others experienced like Jaime cannabis advocate Robert Brown free hears the letters CBD and THC get thrown around a lot this allowed me to treat ten

legalizing recreational marijuana the survey showed that 67% of the people in Florida supported it it's important to know where it comes from though ABC 7 discovered a private party paid for the research and then gave it to make it legal Florida which is a committee that the lawyer John Morgan is backing as he tries to get recreational marijuana passed I would vote no because people are misusing it I'm not 100% sure recreational since many people do believe it's a gateway drug another quit Cook would it be a poll those shows 65% of Florida voters want recreational weed in the end it

I want to teach you about buying CBD on Amazon and what to expect so first can you really buy CBD on Amazon actually you cannot buy CBD on Amazon it is a restricted product and cannot be sold on Amazon and will give you a visual right now so if you go on to Amazon and you hit say key and CBD I'll be really general there's over 7,000 results for CBD let's just take a glance these are all pink atures oil tinctures they look just like CBD tinctures but if you look closely they all say hemp oil so they're not CBD or they're remarketed as CBD it's very deceiving anyone on the front end without a little bit of an educational look at these and click you know choose their flavor choose their milligram add it to cart and buy it but as you scroll down and you see all the product that comes up when you hit CBD you'll notice they also have CBD gummies they have the CBD oil but you'll notice something distinct over here everything says hemp and not CBD so basically two things are happening over here number one you could also look at the milligrams whether it's oil tank atures or the gummies and notice that they have an awfully high milligram over here like three hundred and fifty thousand milligrams for sixty pieces of gummies I mean you're talking tons of milligrams per gummies had this been authentic information or 400,000 milligrams in gummies or half a million milligrams in a tiny little one milliliter bottle of oil so as a professional looking at this you know or manufacturers looking at this they must be saying to myself how could people be buying this junk and so am i and that's the reason why I'm here to explain that these pain creams hemp creams and gummies and tinctures that they're all talking about over here really don't do much and in fact they're going to confuse you as a user thinking I found a natural alternative remedy for pain anxiety and sleep and etc but you did not find CBD you will not be trying CBD and another thing to think about is when these companies like these are using ingredients in their products and they say they're using hemp air on the side of caution because most of the hemp in these types of products used by these types of manufacturing companies are usually filled with pesticides and used if you're a farmer and you know and you could relate that hemp is used to absorb all the metals and pesticides so that they could plant and have a healthy harvesting again so what happens is they end up with a ton of hemp and they know the CBD industry is blowing up and they go to companies and offer them these deals for this type of hemp and that's what you're putting in your body moving on if you're a seller and you tried to list you know real authentic CBD you'll get a notification restricted products removal which essentially means you know warning we're either in a suspend your account forever or you know take this as a warning and remove all those products because these products are identified as prohibited CBD or cannabis oil product I hope you all learn something today and please feel free to comment and stay tuned for more about buying CBD on Amazon [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

is feminine now ladies it is my distinct honor to get to announce to you today that we'd Lube is here ladies I want to make sure you get all the information you need so that's why I am going to sit down with a cannabis expert I just have to find one first so just give me one second hi yeah operator I just need to talk to a cannabis expert please what do you mean you don't have a listing for that sort of thing what do you mean you're calling the cups all right I love you bye-bye all right let me rethink this approach we're talking weed Lube which is a new thing what is this product how does it work this product is basically cannabis dissolved in coconut oil and probably people in New York don't know too much about it because right now it's only legal and available in California and Colorado so we're gonna we're gonna try this we're gonna just spray it on our hands and we'll see what happens this is in the name of scientific research I smell like a bomb so the ingredients are medical cannabis oil liquid coconut oil and love Pro so we'll see what happens not like half an hour though right right that's that's the issue is that you gotta be patient wait and see so absorbing cannabis through your skin how it is how is that different than like doing like a volcano bong right before you know having sex actually the absorption through the skin is not as good as when you smoke it or vape it or in even eat it however the mucosal tissues so not necessarily the outside the vulva where the clitoris and the labia are but the inside the vagina and the Batchelor mucosa you're gonna get more absorption in that area so it's kind of its kind of like your vagina is getting high what is that I didn't even know what could do that well there's lots of ways for them to get high this is just one of them right I did it's got a life of its own down there and it's not telling me anything one of them is dilates blood vessels so you get increased blood flow to the area that's alley oh there's work exactly we have almost as much erectile tissue as a guy does just internal oh so we have inside buggers how do you you know I don't feel like a different a little moisturize but yeah yeah but maybe I was just hungry does smell we don't run into any police dogs on the subway hungry turns out your third-grade teacher was right we are each a unique beautiful flower so it's kind of hard to know how something like we Lube is gonna affect your body specifically now while marijuana is not like a new thing products like for ia's we Lube our new and that they're specifically designed for female pleasure yeah I don't hate that right yeah but don't forget they don't mix well with latex so it'd be like really really careful guys okay yeah so uh if you'll excuse me I've got something I want to try until next time come back next time okay bye hey man I hope you enjoyed that totally awesome weed episode of BAM at if you want to see more subscribe watch more of our videos and it's just like are we even here well one", "eETrUoSBZ4Q": "hello chef here with yet another video I wanted to review a product that I like and I've been taking daily for a few months now and let you know my thoughts about it so with so many CBD companies and everything out there now you hear about it on the radio they sell it at gas stations grocery stores pharmacies all over the place it's hard to know what you're really dealing with and the facts are you need to learn about CBD through education you have to educate yourself you need to go on the internet look around see what's out there but the most important thing is that you make the right decisions and get the right stuff so the quality varies greatly I mean it's crazy the amount of stuff that's out there and and all that so you don't know what you're getting for sure so I've researched this quite a bit and I've talked to various professional people doctors and you know sports medicine people and all that holistic healers and I got to tell you there's just not a lot of information so doctors it seems like are 50/50 who you talked to what they say they all rely on statistics and charts and graphs and proven studies and all that but but that doesn't really give you an answer about CBD and the good stuff what this is all about so the answer is that nature nature encompasses the whole earth and plant power is real it's been used for thousands of years in different cultures the doctors know something about health and about wellness and about medicine they don't know everything so trust me when I tell you that this works and I like it now it works differently for all people it's not the same for everybody and you have to go with what you learn and education so with that said I got to tell you just a few facts about this I'm going to start with my daily dose this is the oil the oil is good and it works but it's also a little more expensive and I'll tell you why it will get into all those facts here as we go so this is 8 milligram and it is CBD made from hemp hemp is cultivated it's legal in all 50 states thank you to the president for passing the farm bill and now it can be enjoyed legally in all 50 states so this is a normal dose right here this is 8 milligrams yeah you put it under your tongue in your mouth it's quick-acting so this is it's pretty good stuff 8 milligrams is a small dose it's not enough for me so I'm gonna go with 2 of these 16 milligrams ok so what are you actually getting in here 16 milligrams well this is primarily you read the label and you check it out it's primarily coconut oil so there is a can avoid CBD and this is zero percent THC this does not get you high you don't get all jittery you don't get laid back and mellow this for me it relieves stress helps at the gym the muscles get bigger I jumped from 15 inches to 21 inches on the biceps so you get stronger professional athletes take it because it makes pain go away as well so you're gonna have a more enjoyable after workout you're gonna eat a little more and you know crave protein maybe but but anyway for me it works it also relieves back Payne I know that for a fact family members have had back pain and chronic issues and I tell them to try they all like it it works it also helps you sleep doesn't mean it puts you to sleep it makes your sleep better deeper more natural noises and you know outside environmental distractions don't bother you you'll sleep better so that's my thought so anyway CBD is a naturally occurring compound found in the leaves stems and the plant of cannabis hemp plant the history of medicine from the hemp plant goes back thousands of years so here in the USA were a pretty new country still learning things writing new laws making new rules all that doesn't matter this goes back thousands of years healers shaman doctors medicine seekers organic people healthy people vegans all kinds of people they like the plant power and the stuff works so this is CBD there's zero percent THC you don't get high you don't feel stone you don't feel intoxicated or buzzed basically it has a lot of positive effects and it works for me relieves pain back pain muscles heal faster better workout relieves anxiety helps people with digestion swelling helps cancer patients I got a buddy who's a cancer patient he takes this every day helps his pain pain management so this is not expensive either you got to go to the right source to get it and when I order it I get free shipping this is the place I get it from right here and I'll put a link in the description as well now this is about I don't know what the price is let me check the price here this is about eighteen dollars and ninety nine cents so this is another thing about education it just depends on where you go and it depends it depends on what you pay so you can buy this at the gas station or your pharmacy for $50 I've seen it for $75 people will charge you $100 crazy it's eight milligrams per drop also this is made in the USA that's a premium thing for me I gotta have made in the USA I don't want the other crap that's out there from all different countries you don't know what you're getting so this is pharmaceutical grade and it's super high quality CBD isolate works for me it's only eighteen dollars and 99 cents for the bottle there's 30 servings in this bottle so at that price I figured it all out it's 63 cents per serving I take double but it doesn't matter it's still a good deal so I like it it works for me you should try it I'm gonna get into the gummies in the next video the gummies are actually a better deal these are 1000 milligram and I did the math and I broke it down and the gummies the gummies are I usually take one a day some people like my cancer buddies they take one in the morning and one before bed in the evening this is what they look like right here so the the breakdown is these 1000 milligrams are much much stronger each gummy has approximately 31 milligrams of CBD so the breakdown is basically these costs a dollar 50 if you consume one of these but you're getting more than well you're getting about four times as much as for droppers so the droppers for 63 cents of serving these are about a dollar fifty so you pop one of these in your mouth and you'll get the effect it's stronger and Wow the CBD is gonna hit you a little bit quicker so that's it I'm gonna be back with some more videos but for now I'm going to leave you with that it's all about education learning knowledge and finding the right stuff that's out there please like share subscribe to support your sponsor if you need some CBD I highly suggest you go to the place that we're getting now and they've been in business for a while it's made in the USA and it's hundred percent natural it's also organic that's important Organic is good and I can tell you that the hemp is sourced from Colorado Oregon Florida and other states it's processed in the lab and it's very very safe and effective it works for me I'm going to mention the fact that the FDA of course has not approved the product for any exact ailments if you have any medical conditions you should consult your doctor if you're taking prescriptions you should consult your doctor shouldn't be used if you're pregnant or nursing and doctors advise take it for what it's worth honestly take it for what it's worth like I said I've talked personally to many doctors they're 50/50 but when you seek out more detailed information like the sports medicine doctors that work with the professional sports players I'm not going to mention NFL or MBA any of these other sports but trust me more than 75% of the players are taking CBD why because it works so do your education and your diligence get out there look around and learn more about CBD please like share the video and have a beautiful day no stress over here yeah", "VXgSqh97zL0": ">>> >>> WHAT >>> WHAT ABOUT >>> WHAT ABOUT MEDICAL >>> WHAT ABOUT

So let me tell you a little bit more about what you will get inside of\nthis little blue bottle cat's natural heal comes in three sizes this is the 5\nml we have a 15 ml and a 30 ml they are all peppermint flavored and it is 100%\nTHC free she uses organic industrial hemp as well as organic hemp seed oil to\nhelp carry the triple distilled co2 extracted hemp inside these bottles Kat's\nNaturals puts all of the third-party test on the product website this will\nmake sure that you can see that there is no THC in her product for example so let\nme tell you a little bit about my experience using cat's natural heal CBD\nsolution I purchased this 5 milliliter bottle for the purposes of this review\nand I used it for a few weeks when I first bought my first bottle I was\ntaking picture and unwrapping it because it does come\nin a sealed topper and I ended up finding out that the bottle is\ncompletely empty that had never happened before so after my momentary shock of\nand actually disappointment because I couldn't immediately take this stuff I\ncalled the retailer they replaced my bottle and I opened it and I actually\ntried it right there in the store it is amazing how good this stuff tastes right\nwhen you open it up you can smell the peppermint it is really strong and a\nlittle bit sweet I love peppermint so that was really really good to me I also\nnoticed that this oil looks a little bit dark to me for an isolate normally the\neye slits are a little darker like this it's really green and it's a little bit\ndarker I'm gonna go ahead and take about a half a dropper full this is about half\nof my typical required dose for this particular product you put it underneath\nyour tongue and you let it wait about 60 seconds so maybe you noticed that the\ndropper doesn't have any measurements on it\nthat's because Kat's Naturals actually recommends that you start out taking\nbetween three and five drops at a dose I tried to take three drops and it ended\nup being more like five drops or so because I really couldn't tell I\ncouldn't feel if each drop was hitting in my mouth and so the dosing was a\nlittle bit hard for me to get at first the first thing I noticed was how good\nthis stuff tastes I didn't taste any plant matter all I tasted was peppermint\nand as far as I'm concerned that's pretty awesome so if flavor of CBD\nsupplements is a big deal this is the best flavored CBD oil I have tried I had\nno taste of the plant matter at all after the first dose I didn't really get\nthe full benefits of my typical CBD supplement it actually took me three or\nfour tries to figure out exactly how much I needed to make sure that it\nreally any existing chronic pain or to make\nsure that it helped me sleep. It turned out that I needed closer to 15 drops or\nactually one full one of these droppers to get the benefits at the CBD which i\nthought was a little bit higher than I normally take. When I finally did get the\ncorrect dose which again is about 15 drops for me I noticed within about 30\nminutes that the chronic pain that I have in my shoulder and my feet and my\nknees they all went away and then when I took it that night it helped me to fall\nasleep and just stay asleep all night. That's basically what I'm looking for\nright with the CBD supplement. Okay so now let me tell you the things that I\nloved about Kat's natural heal CBD solution. This is hands down the best\nflavored CBD oil I have ever tried I didn't taste any of the plant matter it\ngoes down really easy and all I really taste it was peppermint that's awesome\nthe triple distillation process definitely does its thing to help get\nrid of the earthy flavor. I also really appreciate that this is a local to\nTennessee product I am here in Tennessee and I like the fact that the test\nresults are available on their website. Here's the thing the thing that I don't\nlove about the cats Naturals heal CBD is the fact that their recommended dosage\nis by drop instead of by milliliter or by fraction of milliliter with a dropper\nthat actually has measurements. when I was trying to do three to five drops I\njust I couldn't tell I couldn't fill if a drop had hit my tongue or not so I\nstarted trying to eyeball how many drops equaled how much of the dropper so that\nwas kind of hard for me going by drops instead of fractions either half a\ndropper or a half a mil or mil. So just to summarize everything we've talked\nabout so far. Inside Kat's naturals heal CBD solution you get two point five\nmilligrams of CBD per drop. The recommended dose to start out with is\nthree to five drops which is a little bit on the low side I\nended up needing about 15 milligrams myself. It comes in one flavor peppermint\nand because it is a triple distilled CBD isolate product, the peppermint actually\nmakes it taste really good you don't taste any plant matter it comes in three\nsizes 30 milliliter of 15 milliliter and 5 milliliter which is what I have\nhere thank you so much for taking the time to watch this review my name is\nJennifer Dixon with Green Valley Nation and definitely be sure to subscribe to\nour channel if you want to have access to the most comprehensive list of hemp\nproduct and hemp product reviews I can't wait to see you again next time\ntake care bye bye.", "fbMNP_E9YBs": "what are you getting out of full-spectrum CBD hi I'm Danielle with mn1 many people hear about CBD without genuinely understanding what it is and the distinct extraction methods that can end up with very different products CBD is an active chemical compound or cannabinoid found in hemp both hemp and marijuana come from the cannabis plant but are identified differently due to the amount of THC in the plant marijuana contains substantial levels of THC but hemp must have less than 3% THC to make it legal to sell in the United States CBD can be processed as either isolate or full-spectrum isolate it's pure filtered CBD compound but full spectrum can contain other cannabinoids such as cbn CBL or cbc VA as well as aromatic cannabis components like pining or limonene isolate was once a standard but as more studies come out it is shown to be less powerful than initially believed and 1 2017 study on the effects of CBD on seizures researchers found full-spectrum CBD to be 3 times as effective as isolate us-based hint manufacturer can \u00e1former has chosen to use full-spectrum CBD and their euphoric gum and hemp infused skin cream the effects of their products are also enhanced by their delivery methods according to Kenneth Pharma and jested CBD based products like Teachers gummies and capsules are absorbed through the digestive system where more than half of the cannabinoids are neutralized and wasted canna farmers products use a proprietary delivery system bypassing the digestive system and allowing for 84% absorption for more information read the full article at market news first be truly informed", "uUBrUo5YQkQ": "hi everyone I'm Maureen from Mom's maid thank you for joining us today for the CV Sciences webinar which will be presented by dr. Shani & naturopathic physician if you have any questions we'd be sure to type them into the chat window with that said dr. Shani please take it away all right well thanks everybody for joining me I'm really excited as a mom myself in addition to being a doctor this is a topic that is near and dear to my heart not only for everything that it can do for my patients in general but I also think for what it can do for moms in particular because we've got an extra helping on our plates or two or three right and I what I have discovered in my two years of adding hemp derived CBD to my practice and a little more than that to my own life that it can really help us do all the things that we need to do even better and to thrive and to be better parents which i think is something that's on all of our lists to be the best that we can be just a moment to tell you about me I am a naturopathic physician in private practice in Santa Cruz California I have been seeing patients for 16 years my practice focuses on women's health hormone balance you know functional endocrinology so thyroid and adrenal issues things like that in general medicine and although I do specialize in women's health I see men women and children for a variety of acute and chronic health conditions and I am a medical adviser to CV sciences and it's in that capacity that I offer this to you today my hope is that you'll come away from this webinar hopefully having some more clarity on some of the bigger issues and questions that come up around hemp derived CBD at least help you formulate better questions so you can get the answers you need and hopefully give you lots of information so you can start thinking about how you might want to use these products or how you might help educate others about using them so without further ado I'm going to move forward here the first thing we need to do is get straight on our terminology alright so there's a lot of words floating around out there and when it comes right down to it most people don't really know the difference temp cannabis/marijuana you know what on earth is the difference obviously we need to be able to understand that in order to have this conversation at all and then of course there's the alphabet soup of THC and CBD and you know ABC one two three and what do we do so this is the first thing that I want to make sure that we are all wrapping our heads around because words matter in this conversation which can get very confusing and here's really where the confusion starts we have a plant it's called cannabis sativa we have several subspecies of cannabis sativa one of them being cannabis sativa el cannabis sativa el is a source of what I would call medical cannabis which means cannabis that's recommended by a physician for medical purposes some people also call it medical marijuana cannabis sativa L can also be a source of recreational cannabis sometimes also called marijuana pot weed basically something that people are using for its euphoric properties just for recreation and not for medical purposes and cannabis sativa L can also is also the source of agricultural or industrial hemp so all this plant this subspecies cannabis sativa L can provide a wide variety of finished products what we are talking about for this conversation is our products that come from hemp hemp agricultural or industrial hemp has to have less than 0.3% of THC in it by dry weight at the time of harvest so what's THC THC Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol this is called a cannabinoid and it's a component of the cannabis plant and it's the one that most people know the most about because it gets you high right but as it turns out there are 100 of different cannabinoids that have actually been identified at this point he only being one of them CBD what we're going to talk about today cannabidiol being a second one and most famous frankly for the fact that it doesn't get you high but still offers health benefits and then of course there's a myriad of other cannabinoids which you'll certainly be hearing more about in years to come because there's a lot of really important things in this plant so for your purposes you know and frankly for from my purposes when as a doctor I'm thinking about CBD for my patients we need to understand that the big difference between the cannabis that's sold in dispensaries the cannabis that people use to get high and the hemp that's available over the counter is that the THC the psychoactive cannabinoid is going to be only an extremely small amount in hemp in fact less than 0.3 percent THC by dry weight at the time of harvest so that's a really important difference to understand right so it would be really helpful if we had different species we had cannabis hemp Perales and cannabis euphoria Alice but no we just have the cannabis sativa L and what we need to understand is that when we use hemp we're going to have very low amounts of THC and then we're able to get all of the other non psychoactive benefits of the plant so I hope that's more clear there now that we have our words let's talk a little bit more about the history of cannabis use now you may know that cannabis has been used medicinally for a long time in fact it was first reported as medicine over 8,000 years ago so why does that matter it matters not just because we have some reverence and some respect for traditional medicine but because what kind of use demonstrates suggests at least safety and efficacy right if it wasn't helping anybody it wouldn't continue to be in use for that long and if it was killing everybody or hurting everybody that it came in contact with likewise it wouldn't be being used all that time so history does suggest safety and efficacy even though it's been around for 8,000 over 8,000 years we actually didn't come in contact with it in western medicine until the 1800s there was a British physician named dr. O'Shaughnessy who traveled to India and studied with some Ayurvedic physicians in Calcutta and learned about cannabis tincture they are brought it back to England and rapidly it's spread across the pond to us here in the States by the early 1900's many of the major pharmaceutical houses you might recognize some of those names there Eli Lilly and Wyeth featured cannabis products in their armamentarium and if you would walk into any pharmacy in the early 1900s cannabis tincture would be prominently featured for many uses that are now being validated by research everything from being used as an analgesic and an anti-inflammatory for pain on being used as a sedative and an anti-anxiety product as an antispasmodic and an anticonvulsant so we would known about these properties of cannabis for a long time in the 1940s we actually discovered THC and CBD they were named cannabinoids because they came from the cannabis plant and we theorized that it was these cannabinoids that were responsible for the myriad of health benefits that were seen with the plant but it wasn't actually until the late 90s in the early 90s rather let me correct that late 80s early 90s that we discovered why those cannabinoids were so incredibly important and that is we discovered in the late 80s early 90s that we have cannabinoid receptors and not only do we have cannabinoid receptors but we have them in every organ system of our bodies there are two different types cb1 and cb2 cb1 is found predominantly in the brain in fact cb1 receptors are the most densely distributed receptor type in the human brain believe it or not but cb1 is also found throughout the body similarly cb2 receptors are found more peripherally where they impact the immune system and the inflammatory response but cb2 is found throughout the body as well so you can i gen that when we discovered that we have these cannabinoid receptors there were some folks who thought well clearly this explains why we have this amazing relationship with cannabis and some people probably even used it as a reason to promote the use of cannabis other scientists said oh right well if we have these cannabinoid receptors all over our body we must make something ourselves that these that uses these receptors also right we can't just have receptors for a plant and lo and behold in the late 90s we did discover that we make our own endo cannabinoids and you can see here the top two molecules featured there are the two endocannabinoids that have been the most well studied unmanned amide was the first discovered it got a special name an and amide named after the Sanskrit word for bliss or Ananda and then the second one here to arachidonic glycerol - aging a special name their second second child syndrome so those are the two endocannabinoids and then you can see CBD and THC on the bottom there so now we actually have to differentiate between what type of cannabinoid we're talking about right are we talking about an endocannabinoid are we talking about a phyto cannabinoid and you better believe it we're also going to be having to throw Pharma cannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoids into the mix more and more they already exist and I assume we're going to keep seeing that as well so put this all together we've got the endocannabinoids that we make ourselves we've got the enzymes that produce and degrade them and we've got our cannabinoid receptors throughout the body and we get the endocannabinoid system so this was not a system that I learned in school 20 years ago when I was learning about all the systems of the body the nervous system the endocrine system etc but it is a system that is going to be taught right alongside those other vital physiologic systems in the body because it is so incredibly crucial and we just didn't know it existed until the 90s so this is really new when we think about what we know about the human body the main purpose of the endocannabinoid system is to maintain homeostasis that's fancy word for balance and to keep our bodies functioning optimally by adapting to change so when I read that sentence keeps our bodies functioning optimally by adapting to change what I hear immediately is the endocannabinoid system helps us manage our stress response right so our body is constantly responding to internal and external stimuli that's telling us that we have to adapt right the temperature changes we're hungry we're full we're irritated there's new information we have to take in all the constantly things are happening that we have to respond to and so the endocannabinoid system helps us do that well and it does that by modulating the fight or flight or freeze response by by impacting endocrine function so you know adrenals thyroid pancreas ovaries etc and by impacting the immune system and the inflammatory response so the endocannabinoid system is an incredibly important system to help us function on a moment-to-moment day-to-day basis and in fact many scientists are calling the endocannabinoid system the master control system because of those very reasons that I just listed for you on this particular article I pulled this quote out for the last part which talks about this research bonanza that's revealing more and more about the endocannabinoid system and it's shining star cannabidiol so why is CBD the shining star of the endocannabinoid system it is a shining star because CBD helps to balance the endocrine a benign system so CBD can help to balance the system meant to keep us balanced and it does that in a variety of ways it does that directly in the endocannabinoid system by impacting the cb1 and cb2 receptors it also actually does it outside of and\u00f6 cannabinoid system by impacting our serotonin receptors our gaba receptors our dopamine receptors and many different receptors that impact inflammation and immune response so CBD really is able to come in and help us be balanced and and function optimally create stress resilience and respond well to the things that we're constantly being asked to adapt and respond to check this out so this is a little pie graph that looks at various cytokines and the top blue part here are different activities that have been attributed to CBD so when we talk about okay well how do we use it right I mean obviously you want to go back to thinking about that endocannabinoid system so if CBD is going to help me balance my endocannabinoid system then it's going to help me with all things that make me respond better to stress right so sleep anxiety mood stability these are all areas where CBD might help to balance the endocannabinoid system which can make all of those things work better but as you can see here there's a lot of other potential activities too now I want to add that most of these activities have been looked at in animal models and then self studies human self studies in Petri dishes outside of the body so we have a long way to go with actually seeing I think that's going to be if that's going to actually ring true an actual living human organism although the initial studies that we have certainly point to some very exciting benefits but you can see here that the range of things you know as a neuro protective helping brain function to protect the brain even potentially to help restore cognitive and brain function for metabolic health issues to promote informed sensitivity and of course a lot of that's related to those cb2 receptors right that are dealing with the immune system and inflammation so there's a wide range of ways to use this potentially what I would say to all the moms is that starting with helping us all manage our stress better sleep better keep our mood stable this is an area where I think each of us can comfortably start to play an experiment with this ingredient that can really promote better health and function for us on a day to day basis this is a study from the National Institute of Health so it must be true right from 2013 and they were examining how impacting the endocannabinoid system balancing it how it could affect human health and disease and what the author's the conclusion that the author's came to was that modulating endocannabinoid system activity could have therapeutic potential in almost all diseases affecting humans and I won't read that list to you but that's a pretty impressive statement and as you can see on the previous slide there's data to support these benefits so let's talk for a minute about safety sourcing and quality this is extremely important right we have this quote unquote air quotes here new ingredient CBD that we can get from him and obviously as with all supplements they're not all created equal so you know what are the things that are most important to me as a doctor me as a mom write it first and foremost it's safety right and we think we can all agree on that studies show CBD is being non-toxic with an excellent safety profile if you look at the third bullet or excuse me a kind of a third slash on the first bullet you'll see chronic use and high doses up to 1500 milligrams a day of CBD are reportedly well tolerated in humans for those of you who are a little familiar with some of the hemp derived CBD products you will know that 1500 milligrams is an extremely high dose and one that you would not even get near certainly with the CB Sciences product and so what that says is we have this very large window of safety and that of course gives me a lot of comfort in talking to my patients about this product you know and in helping people you know with the idea that they may have to go up and down a bit to find their right dose they've got a big safety window to do that in and additionally I would add that CB Sciences is pursuing something called grasp self-determination grass is a funny acronym in the context of cannabis but it stands for generally recognized as safe we are the only hemp derived CBD company and this in this space that is pursuing grass self-determination we did that by doing formal toxic all studies at 14 and ninety days on our own products so in addition to taking this kind of large meta-analysis that looks at overall safety this is specifically safety to our products and our results very much mirrored these doses and that's in the processes of being published in a journal of toxicology so that's that's very exciting and you know safety first right my first oath my first oath as a doctor my Hippocratic oath is do no harm so here we go now a lot of people come up with a question around drug testing with the hemp derived CBD products there is a very small amount of THC in it and people simply need to know that if they need to pass a drug test whether it's for custody or for work or for parole or whatever it is they are best to avoid all hemp products and that includes by the way hemp protein powder it includes poppy seeds and cost medicine and all of these things because the drug testing is just not that nuanced again there's not enough THC in these products to give any psychoactive effect but it could still potentially show up so unfortunately the answer is is to abstain if drug testing is necessary at this time until the drug testing gets better so let's talk about hemp source versus marijuana source because obviously you can get CBD from a hemp product you could go to a dispensary and you could get a high CBD low THC strain too so why would you choose one over the other source doesn't matter when it comes to the effectiveness of the CBD however knowing where it comes from I think is still important to me the benefits of hemp you know you can purchase it over the counter in some independent health food stores you can get it online the THC level is naturally low you don't have to think about it or worry about how much is in there with hemp hemp can be grown without chemical pesticides and fertilizers that doesn't mean it is seedy Sciences is not grown with any of those chemicals but sometimes it is but you do have the benefit of figuring that out and using a company where it's not grown with chemicals and therefore you're reducing obviously your chemical exposure when you take in those substances have is great for the environment it's sequester's carbon dioxide it doesn't have high power it doesn't use any grow lights or HVAC system it's got low wastewater demand the other cool thing about hemp is that in addition to the CBD you get many other components of the hemp plant which are also potentially beneficial to your health like flavonoids and terpenes and plants darrell's and essential fats and you don't get that when you use the CBD from marijuana also with marijuana it's illegal of course to ship across state lines you can't sell it online it's available to purchase only in dispensaries with doctor's prescription in the states where it's legal THC level is higher and more variable so you need to be on top of understanding where that is lots of chemical exposure so you organs the only state where you're really getting good information about the way it's the way it's grown and what it's grown with other states not so much and the environmental impact can be negative because with marijuana indoor grown you're using using HVAC systems and grow lights and lots of water and so it definitely doesn't have such a great impact environmentally so lots of reasons to consider using the hemp when CBD is what you're after \u00e7b Sciences of course is a is a vertically integrated company which means they're involved in every step of the process from seed to shelf I like that clinically I feel like that's when you get exceptional products is when a company as skin in the game every step of the way we harvest our products using EU certified hemp seeds we have exclusive contracts with a cup of local farmers in Europe predominantly Holland the oil is extracted at an on-site ISO certified facility using carbon dioxide extraction we then import that raw oil to our state-of-the-art laboratory in San Diego California where it's tested for cannabinoid content pesticide residue contamination etc and then of course because that's not enough we've third-party test every batch again for heavy metal solvents pesticide residue cannabinoid content and and those certificates of analyses are available to any one who wants them so that's a big plus for me we then converted into our different oils formulated into the different products and distribute it so but is it legal right this is a question that comes up over and over again and there's been a lot of confusion because as I said in the very beginning hemp is from cannabis right so what you need to understand is that hemp is not nor has it ever been defined as marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act and naturally-occurring cannabinoids in agricultural foods which includes oils we're also never scheduled under the Controlled Substances Act as far as using hemp in in this country it is been challenging until 2014 which is why most of the hemp you see including our own is imported agricultural hemp fiber stocks even oils can be lawfully imported into the United States and these portions can enter into u.s. commerce in 2014 we did pass the farm bill and then in 2016 the Omnibus law which protects the hemp industry and exempts its products from the Controlled Substances Act however all of that hemp has to be grown by state decree under an agricultural pilot program and there's still a lot of gray area around there that makes it challenging which is why we continue to import hopefully these things will be clarified over the next year or two and we can begin domestic production which is very much I know what CB Sciences would like I will mention briefly that some states are beginning to pass some CBD and hemp laws that can restrict availability and even require a prescription for CBD there's not many of these but I would certainly recommend finding out what's going on in your specific state and if you have questions about that CB science is a great resource because obviously they're on top of what's going on state by state and it is a moving target so it does change regularly here's a sampling of some of the CBD oil products for moms we do offer products in encapsulated form in drops and sprays so that you get some sublingual absorption with rapid onset and then we do offer some topical bombs which can be fantastic for aches and pains and skin irritation and inflammation etc this is a dosing titration schedule you know if you're just starting out and you don't really have any guidance with these products you do have to kind of find your dose balancing your endocannabinoid system is different than balancing mine and even balancing my own on a week to week month to month basis may be different so a lot of times we need to find our dose and if that's not something you're comfortable with this little titration schedule can kind of give you a structure to follow you certainly don't have to but it's something that might be helpful for you this is some dosing recommendations that I use around HP a dosing HPA stands for hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis right so basically it's for it's for supporting stress response and and part of that includes supporting sleep and I am using here beginning with the extra strength spray that's what ES stands for and then I'm using the encapsulated products as well so this is some guidelines to look at getting yourself to fall asleep better stay asleep better which will also spill over into balancing the endocannabinoids this system better improving stress resilience and then also how you can use some of those products to modulate anxiety and mood instability during the day that's kind of just what I've found very useful in my own practice obviously when it comes to choosing a product they are not all created equal you want to look for companies that are talking about full traceability that are not offering medical claims or condition specific dosing recommendations it's one thing for me to tell you what works in my practice as a doctor it's another thing for a company to say that this is good for these ten ailments and these are the doses that's a no-no we don't have that research and they shouldn't be making those claims obviously safety is essential and I think a commitment to education and growing research and being involved with trade organizations particularly when it comes to hemp and CBD because we've got a lot of work to do in this arena to educate people and to make sure that these products remain accessible over the counter and so I want to see the companies coming out and really guiding those conversations in a positive way putting the money where there is so to speak and I'm very proud of the fact that CB Sciences is the biggest actor in that way right now we're fine plus CBD oil is available online and in over 1200 different health food stores nationwide and growing again you can contact CB sciences directly to find out where there are some health food store selling it in your area I want to thank you so much I know I probably went over my 20 minutes a little bit there but it's a lot of information to fit in and I'm sure that some of you must have some questions and I am really happy worrying to answer any questions that the audience has thanks so much for your attention thank you so much dr. shining that was great presentation so we've had a lot of questions come in one of our mom ambassador's says that she has been looking to take this for her ID she's totally for the product and and the other half related products but her question is is had and you need the same thing it's a great question no and then no they are not the same thing so I'm assuming that what she means by that is is hemp oil and CBD oil the same thing but let me let me just answer it across the board so you know hemp is the plant and CBD is one of over 500 different constituents in the hemp plant right so it is it is something that exists naturally in the hemp plant when you are in the health food store and you're looking at hemp oil you are looking at something that will have some CBD in it but usually when it's being marketed as hemp oil they are not standardizing or directly measuring the CBD that's in there or guaranteeing you a certain amount of CBD per serving okay whereas if you get a hemp derived CBD oil over the counter what they are doing is usually they are pulling out and standardizing the CBD so that you can see exactly how much is in there and in both of those situations hemp oil or hemp derived CBD oil you are getting lots of the other components of the hemp plant as well in addition you know we tend to think about CBD because it is the ingredient dujour but there are a lot of other important constituents in those plants too and I think that's part of the magic of these formulas too is that it's not just the CBD it's a lot of the other stuff you're getting do you think that answered the question yes definitely thank you yep so another user has seen if you are a doctor what are the top three reasons you suggest your patients use CBD oil so again a lot of that you know depends on what I see in my office right I mean you could ask 20 different doctors and they might give you different reasons in my practice being that the bulk of what I do is women's health menopause management hormone imbalance stuff the three top reasons that I use it are for sleep for anxiety and for pain and of course just because I can't just keep it to three I would kind of wrap sleep and anxiety in a creating a better response to stress - right so people coming in and they're part of what they're complaining of is you know these are the chief complaints as they're experiencing them symptomatically but part of its it's related to stress right so it's you know supporting the stress response which often entails helping people sleep and helping an anxiety but pain pain and inflammation or big ones to that that would be that those are the top reasons in my practice you know you might find somebody else who says that they're using it predominantly for seizure disorders for neural inflammation with Lyme for you know and on and on and on okay thank you CBD oil can come in different forms with the spray and the foam and the supplement what are the different use cases for each of these different products why would somebody choose one or the other sure great question and you know the first answer is that some of it is just simply patient compliance some people are more willing to swallow a capsule than they are to use a spray some people won't touch the concentrate because they don't like the way it tastes etc so one thing is just personal preference from a clinical perspective you know obviously the topicals I would use when you're trying to do something on the skin right so musculoskeletal aches and pains I've also inadvertently found that it's incredibly useful for skin irritation and inflammation everything from you know allergic responses on the skin to wound healing to eczema and even psoriasis in my practice has been it's been great for that the sprays and the drops the beauty of the sprays on the drops is that you're getting some oral mucosal absorption so what I notice is you get a very rapid onset of benefit so if you're trying to calm down somebody's anxiety if you're dealing with breakthrough pain if you're trying to get somebody back to sleep you know the to have to have that quick absorption is really useful the other nice thing about the sprays and the drops is that they're very low potency so they're a nice way for people to often get started and easily titrate up and find their dose the encapsulated product so the the green capsules the gold soft gels I tend to use those when I'm really looking for somebody is dosing for something once or twice daily I want to kind of get it a steady exposure in their body to to the temperature I've CBD and it's just it's kind of easy and it's I believe you know it's not sustained-release per se like we don't put anything in it to extend the release of the of the ingredients but it is more of a sustained release versus the oral mucosal which comes on faster and I think goes away faster the encapsulated products will last a little bit longer in the body because you're digesting it right and then of course we have the concentrates which is are just the oil there's nothing added to it they come in little applicators those are the higher potency products and certainly for patients who find that they need higher doses that's going to be their their best bang for their buck in those in those concentrates I find that in my practice I predominantly use I use a lot of the spray and some of the capsules I don't use concentrates all that often and of course we love the bomb in my practice great thank you hmm a few of our moms we're asking if making cakes CBD oil while pregnant and also another question is is it safe for a breastfeeding mom to take as well so you know the answer to that needs to be that we don't know right I don't have the human data to to to say that it's safe that being said there really isn't data that says that it's not safe people have been using cannabis for a long time certainly it would seem logical that something without high doses of THC and it would be much safer than something with higher doses of THC in it we don't know cannabis to be teratogenic which means we don't have evidence that it causes birth defects for example but any mom that's using it during pregnancy or breastfeeding needs to know that they're kind of out there in the in the nether regions of not really of we don't know and they need to feel comfortable with that based on talking to their doctor and looking at the research themselves great thank you so I know that we covered this but I'm wondering if you could kind of explain this fully how do i how does somebody find right dosage for themselves if they don't think if they feel I mean any effect for it do they take more or keep the dosage right that's a great question so um if you have if so obviously you know necessarily there there's no biomarker to measure and there's no little bell or whistle that goes off when your endocannabinoids justin is balanced right I mean if you have a symptom that's easy to track obviously that's a great way to find your dose right okay with dis dose I sleep better with this dose my mood feels our stable with this dose I have less pain but obviously there are a lot of other things where we don't really know you know which is you know if you're trying to support somebody with cancer if somebody has Lyme and they have neuro inflammation I mean there as a neuro protective or you know frankly you can start reading about the stuff and be like wow everybody should be taking this it's so useful for the body and then what are you necessarily tracking so again we don't have the human studies that say for example 25 milligrams a day supports metabolic health so what I generally will say to people in those situations is if we're looking for kind of optimizing health in general you know I certainly wouldn't recommend more than 25 milligrams a day but I would say work your way up towards 25 milligrams and and obviously the the rate limiting factor would be sedation so the worst thing that's going to happen if you take too much of this stuff is you're going to get tired and you'll learn that the first time and then you'll take less next time so you know that would tell you to back down now if I've got somebody who's very sick if they've got cancer if they've got Lyme if they've got a neurodegenerative disorder if they've got chronic pain you know in those instances I will try to get higher amounts into them and again I'm looking for the way that we're looking for the right dose is am I feeling any benefit and or am I getting sedated and so sometimes if someone's really ill I'll give them higher doses of CBD to tolerance right and then as soon as they start to get sleepy I'll back down on it and sometimes that means that they take less during the day and more at night so you know if it sounds to you while you're listening like wow this is kind of this feels vague this feels like it's different with everybody then you are following the conversation because it's true so and that's okay I think that you know for me as a naturopathic doctor or somebody practices integrative medicine I'm always trying to talk to people about listening to their bodies and biochemical individuality and you know I think that's something that a lot of us intuitively understand that we're all a little bit different and that you know this ingredient really kind of pulls that out so it's it's it can feel a little confusing in the beginning but you can kind of walk your way up slowly and get there great thank you are there any other side effects other than feeling sleepy you know that's the one that's that's the most commonly that's that's most that I hear most commonly my practice and that is most common in the data you know occasionally you will occasionally I will find somebody who is extremely sensitive and can only do very small doses they might and they don't like the way that they feel but that's very infrequent and usually if I default to starting low working your way up even though you know sometimes I don't want to really start totally low I just want to get in there I can usually avoid those issues without a problem great so are there any interaction just somebody wants to use this with any other drugs or prescriptions Authority any adverse effect so a CBD is metabolized in the same pathways that our drugs are metabolized so the cytochrome p450 enzyme pathway which metabolizes all our drugs there are different pathways in there CBD uses that too we do have some data that points to the fact that certain drugs that share the pathway with CBD can impact how much how long CBD is around can increase or decrease that we do not however have data in their reverse that taking CBD can impact those drugs it's theoretically that could be possible but it's not something that we're seeing there are many of the human trials that we see coming out particularly around epilepsy those are some of the most robust human data that we have all of those studies the the kids in those studies were taking anti-seizure drugs anticonvulsant drugs and in fact an average of three of them and they did not experience adverse effects when CBD was administered to them as part of the treatment trial in fact they had tremendous improvement so a lot of times the things that the research is looking at are pretty serious illnesses and so folks stay on their meds and so that hasn't been problematic so far so you know the the short answer then is we don't have data to point to that at this point theoretically it certainly could be possible they're using the same channels but you know the supplements we use so much of what we use uses those pathways to even things that we eat like grapefruit juice right so again I think the point being we just have to be careful as we add things but there's no big contraindications that people need to be concerned about at this point in fact I would add to that that oftentimes if this is being used in conjunction with pain medications for example or anti-anxiety medications even antidepressants we see synergistic effects that can even help people to lower and potentially someday maybe even stop the medications themselves has a lot of potential with CBD in that department great so one of our moms was asking if she should consult her doctor before you in CBD oil yes by all means mmm your you just need to be prepared for the fact that your doctor may not know anything about it unfortunately although that being said I think more and more doctors are learning about it most doctors know about cannabis in regards to THC and the concept of medical marijuana is being more and more accepted by many doctors CBD kind of is the next frontier I mean you know ideally in a perfect world you would tell your doctor whenever you add at any supplement right I mean isn't that what they tell us how many people do that but yeah in a perfect world you would absolutely discuss this with your doctor great thank you so I guess one of our last questions we have here and if moms are looking for more information on this they're a website or a resource that they can go to to get additional information yeah I mean first of all you could I mean I realize it's a product website but you could go to plus CBD oil calm which is something that CV Sciences produces there's a lot of information on that website about that about hemp derived CBD in addition they offer regular webinars and teleseminars to get a better open to the public to get more information about CBD and hemp there's also there's a website called Leafly calm le a f ly calm don't get scared if you go there because there is a lot of medical marijuana medical cannabis stuff on there but if you go to the Help section of that website there are fantastic articles written about the endocannabinoid system CBD THC different health conditions that's a great resource and the articles are written for laypeople so it's easy to understand and easy to follow great thank you so much that was a really great presentation and thank you so much for answering everyone's questions oh it's my pleasure thank you do you have any closing thoughts before we wrap up you know I just want to thank everybody for your attention and for your interest in this area I mean I know it's really out there and there's a lot of information online and it's confusing and misleading and I hope that you know this will help you see through some of the the haze and you know really focus in on the potential benefits I feel like I feel like this is an area where obviously we have so much to learn but we have so much to gain and as moms I you know the first place to start is with yourself I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how this can really help you with your sleep and your mood stability in your stress response and obviously that's going to help you do everything in your life better including being mom great thank you so much again and I just wanted to say to everyone who attended thank you for your time and for spending this hour with us we'll be contacting our winners soon additionally the recording of this webinar will be available on the monthly site in the coming days so look find out if you want to watch it again thank you everyone and we're going to go ahead and log off now and wishing everyone a good day thank you so much", "phWHMSTTVZg": "[Music] what is going on everybody welcome back to my channel if you're new here welcome uh i hope everybody's doing well and staying safe uh this review is not going to be as long as my normal reviews this is actually a product that i use on a regular basis uh regularly uh so i'm very familiar with this company they did not send this to me this is a product that i usually purchase uh my cbd haven uh they're d8 distillate carts uh i've already opened up the box because i got one of these out um to use it i bought three cartridges um it does they come with coas uh there's a coa just for the distillate and then there's a card here for law enforcement so that comes in the box uh it comes bubble wrapped and vac sealed you don't need to back seal these but they're vac sealed and wrapped the one thing i have to say about every time i order from my cbd haven fast super super fast ellie it comes in like two three days max and when you check your um your tracking it tells you a certain day i always usually get mine the day before so if it's this actually wasn't supposed to get here until today it got here yesterday um this product right here is a d8 distillate syringe uh on the coas it says uh 66 delta eight and it has a 0.6 uh cbn so it is delta 8 and cbn so this is a sedative sedative version of the delta 8 distillate like compared to say the rta that's got the cbc i get really uh big sativa effects from that one this one is more relaxed more chill uh definitely body effects i will show you guys how i personally use this to get what i need for physical uh anxiety relief the thing about these guys is three of these cost 54. three one gram syringes fifty four dollars i use this uh pretty regular this is my delta eight distillate go to company one because the quality is really good like i'll show you the syringes they're very uh the clarity is really clear on them they got a little bit of a rose tint to it but it's probably because of the cbn but they're fairly clear like they're not murky i've had some 60 dollar syringes that were very very murky and i've heard murky is bad i don't know i'm not a scientist but if somebody says murky is bad and then i'm getting something this clear or water clear but it was also a 60 it was a 50 syringe uh i won't go go back to that one but these are my regulars 54 for three like one single syringe is uh with no uh added terp flavors is twenty dollars nineteen ninety nine you can add terps to it and i think it's like another four dollars added to it but if you get the three syringes with the terps it's sixty dollars so that's twenty dollars for a one uh gram one milliliter syringe like that's a really really good price and i use this often it's a very clean product and at that price point you can't beat it uh you can put this okay we gotta explain this so i've explained it in my last one you have to run this in water uh to loosen it up because at room temperature it is very thick if you try to squeeze it just out of this it's got a screw on top you can put a they do include a tip like a little metal tip which i can't pop that out they include a metal tip which that can get clogged you can i'll explain that but you have to loosen this up with hot water now i'm going to explain to you guys how to do my uh my patented d8 smoothie this is how i usually take d8 distillate first off you're going to start with peanut butter you're going to take a small spoonful of peanut butter and you're going to eat it it's going to get all up in your mouth it's going to get all on your throat so you're going to be sitting what you're going to be eating this while you're going to be doing the other process then you're going to take a shot glass i make my own delts or my own cbd oils when i make batches i put it right back into the container the mct oil this is all my homemade cbd oil this bottle was 32 ounces i paid 20 dollars for this mct oil that's 32 or yeah 32 fluid ounces for that for 20 bucks and then i have this organic stuff that's 16 fluid ounces i also paid 20 for this so i got double the amount with that one but anyways i'll take two droppers of my cbd oil and i'll put it in the shot glass then i'll take the shot glass with the oil and i'll put it in the microwave for 40 to 45 seconds now while that's going you're going to take this syringe and you're gonna run it under hot water um until that the the microwave beeps when the microwave beeps you're gonna take this out and then unscrew this and you're gonna put the tiniest drop like a a grain of rice size do you want to start small if you've never used this stuff before because it is very potent like the slightest over kill drop will be noticeable it's a very noticeable difference so you put in there and you take like the back side of a spoon or a mental uh like a i use like to use metal to uh start around wait for it to cool you can use your finger to test it and then you're gonna take it like a pink you're going to put it under your tongue for 60 to 90 seconds sometimes i soak it longer uh you know when that's going on uh you take a i take usually take like a piece of tortilla and wipe out the inside all the residue because some of the delta 8 sticks to the inside of the shot glass because it's kind of so viscous get all that out now when i'm getting ready to swallow that i'll swallow the piece of tortilla with it so um that's my d8 smoothie um it usually because of the peanut butter and the added cbd oil it usually takes about an hour hour and a half to kick in but start light on your delta eight drop like work your way up because sometimes i got a little heavy uh thumbed one night and yeah i fell asleep and i slept like a cinder block under a stolen car you had to work to get me up out of there it's very potent so you want to start small that's my d8 smoothie and it's quite effective i feel usually when i do that i feel effects for about eight to ten hours so it to me that's effective but this is a solid solid product especially for that price fifty four dollars for three syringes always fast shipping uh like they're they're really great company their customer service is top notch they sent me a sticker this time finally i've like ordered from them like a bunch of times first time i got a sticker if yeah if you get my if you do send me something for reviews send me a sticker i really really like stickers i'm trying to deck out my laptop and cbd stickers but the packaging's plain nothing too crazy it's that's like typical syringe packaging you know the back it's got the delta eight i got i get the natural i've had the uh terps before um and they're really good but for me i like this one because i get the body effects the vapes is like a different story it doesn't even even if the vape itself says it has indica terps in it and it says indica on it usually it still gives me more or less a sativa effect if i'm vaping it or like say i put this on flour it's not my preferred method but i'll do it every once in a while um but this is such a good product for that price the shipping is super fast like i messed with this company hard uh they just started um dropping custom mix syringes their cbd cbg mix there's a delta 8 cbd cbg mix they're three milliliter syringes so um yeah there's three different mixes there's one that has a third of delta eight cbd cbg there's one that's cbd cbn or no cbd cbg and then there's a delta 50 50 delta 8 and cbd i need to try these mixes but they have a lot of distillates isolates they've got cbd isolate powders and all that jazz bath bombs they've got full spectrum distillates gummies uh cbd mints they've got a couple flower strains they've got a cbg flower strain they've got like sour space candy lifter bubba kush um but they're more or less distillate and isolates but they're solid company their prices are really good and the quality of this syringe is like top-notch uh i recommend this if you're like budget-friendly and you like your delta eight and they have different things like you can get uh there's a five milliliter five milliliter distillate syringe you can choose your uh weapon on that one as well your options are really good and if you ever have any problems with customer service they are quick to uh turn that around my order got messed up and i was literally sent another package like it arrived in two days from the time that i actually talked to him and said hey i have a problem and he was like don't worry we got another one coming out to you refunded my order and sent me out a whole nother order didn't have to do that i would have just been happy just to hey could you send me out which you forgot to send me and that was like that was the only time i've ever had anything with uh me ordering only problem i ever had and literally they resent the whole order that i ordered to me in two days all right that's some customer service if you're the person watching this video thank you dude that was solid i was over the moon i was like man he did not have to do that i was only expecting them to uh they shorted me uh a cartridge or yeah they shorted me two cartridges i ordered three they only sent me one and i was like uh i ordered three you only gave me one they were like oh okay they refunded it sent me three more like you didn't have to do that man you could have just sent me out the two i would have been i've been totally happy with it but this is a good product i know a lot of other people on the market that love these things and at twenty dollars uh for a natural they i wanna say it's like twenty five dollars with flavor for just one but you can't beat the three deal that knocks them down like eighteen dollars a syringe and this is a really good product like i like it i stand by it i put my seal of approval on it check them out go go look at them syringes if you like your delta 8 and you also like your money dude they're quality uh company i need to i need to try some of these mix uh syringes they look really really cool oh no and they've like they're gradually dropping more and more distillate uh things so there's always like a place where i i'd like to keep my eye at because they're dropping new syringes and new uh formulas and stuff but yes i definitely did i give this product a 10 like solid 10 especially at the price point you cannot beat it if you know a place cheaper with this good of product get order this product try this out and if you can find something cheaper blast me down in the comments oh dude and then i will buy that product and i will try it out and i'll compare the two but i stam i stand firm on that like i don't work for my cbd haven but i like that product that is something that i i want to let you guys know things that i use on the regular basis and that is something i use on a regular basis when i use delta 8 this is my usual delta 8 go to but i do like other ones like rta because the cbc and stuff like that everybody's got their own mix but a preference for me budget friendly and i'm trying to get rid of the body anxiety the shakes and stuff like that every time never fails it's good product can't beat that price but 10 solid 10. i mess with my cbd haven i am going to look into getting some of these mixed syringes and trying those out the cbdg distillate and the custom syringes try out the mixtures and see how those work i'm like really getting into like the other cannabinoids but the mix with the delta eight kind of really intrigues me like the cbc with the delta eight is really mind-blowing like it makes me feel like i open up a whole another side of my brain it's good stuff i want to look into more like edibles and stuff like that as well i'm actually looking into a company that does like fresh edibles and i'm looking into getting my hands on some of that stuff but look these guys up follow them on instagram uh show them some love uh but dude this is a definite if you want to try it out and you don't want to like blow like 60 on a syringe and then you end up not liking it you just spent 20 bucks somebody will like it and i honestly i don't think you won't like it if if if you like your cbd and your relaxation there dude straight up i i [ __ ] you not i i i throw you no shits well yeah i wanted to do a quick little review this is going to be a lot quicker than my normal reviews but i want to start doing this i want to show you guys more of the stuff that i use on the regular as well as the stuff that i do for reviews because now some of the stuff that i do use in the reviews i'm starting to use on the regular like the jupiter nights like never really mess that but now it's more of a frequent oh what am i going to puff on and it's boom right there and it's always it's been a go-to for me for like the past couple weeks so i want to show you guys what i've been using regularly and this is one of them and top-notch for that cost there are people on reddit that bad mouthful yeah it's too cheap it's too cheap like uh maybe uh homeboy over here at my cbd haven's not trying to rob people you know i'm not saying that everybody robs people but i don't some people are cheaper than others and then usually when something's like super cheap everybody throws us back to it they're like oh it's gotta be too good to be true too good to be true uh some people are aren't out there just to make make a quick book you know some people are overpriced some people are not it also depends on your formula too like rnt there's they have cbc a fair a fair amount of cbc in their formula and cbc is not cheap like i can justify that distillate because of the cbc involved in it cbc is not cheap at all if you look up just cbc tinctures and oils it's it's very pricey so when you go into like distillates and stuff like that you can price hunt and but people also you got to look at the formulas if you're like that's a lot look at the formula and see what's in it it's cbc is really expensive stuff but as far as just like a a delta 8 cbn formula this is there's a lot of basic just delta cbn formulas out there but this one i i've tried quite a few of them and i still always go back to this one because one the price and then the customer service awesome but yeah dude all right we'll make this quick um i got some uh i got some more delta eight stuff like delta honey sticks and stuff on the way so i'm gonna do those i still got the flower and everything i want to thank you guys for coming back and watching my video i hope you like this if there's anything that you want me to check out or like your go-to's or something like that and do a review of that product throw it down in

E-MAIL US", "rUCymABIOps": "[Music] so we're right in the middle of what's being called the green revolution which is the systematic nationwide decriminalization and even legalization of medicinal as well as recreational use of marijuana of cannabis and this is really a radical upheaval of what was historically a very very huge illicit drug trade that involved multiple countries and thousands and thousands of people and literally billions of dollars for a simple plant kind of ridiculous the idea to try to make something like this illegal something you could grow in your backyard but it was done and continues to be done in some jurisdictions and so it's a pretty interesting time billions of dollars are now coming to the mainstream this is now a taxable good which is creating huge huge tax revenues in states like colorado and washington state and all the other places where it's become legalized and then the question is what does this really mean i'm not a marijuana user i'm not a huge advocate of marijuana culture it just doesn't appeal to me at this phase of my life but what i think is pretty interesting is when you have this plant which has been used for thousands of years and has some very interesting elements like cbd which is stands for cannabidiol which is one of many one of dozens of cannabinoids these compounds that are inside of this plant that has some really interesting properties first of all cbd it's important to remember as we get into this discussion is non-psychoactive which means you can take it and you don't get paranoid you don't get the munchies you don't want to watch you know south park episodes until two in the morning that's the end result but it's proven to be really effective for pain anxiety and sleep those are probably the three main things you'll find all kinds of crazy stuff online about it curing cancer and all these kinds of things i don't think there's really clinical data to back that up but pain pain anxiety and sleep constitute a huge percentage of prescription medications not needless to say opioids for example opioid abuse is on the rise and potentially cbd cannabidiol and maybe cbd plus some thc for certain people could be a much much healthier alternative i'm in no way a cannabis activist or anything like that but i'm all for decriminalization of drugs i can't see any good that's come from that there's probably hundreds of thousands of people in jail right now for marijuana possession which just seems crazy entire lives ruined for a plant which is definitely definitely less dangerous and harmful than you know a bottle of vodka or something like that on this week's podcast we'll be chatting about cbd specifically and i just want to emphasize this is non-psychoactive meaning it's not going to get you high and i say this because i know most of you are not interested in getting totally baked on a tuesday night and so i'd like you to think about cbd the the market unfortunately has been flooded with you know network marketing and all kinds of weird pyramid schemes and things and it's really difficult to figure out what cbd is good and what cbd is bad and hopefully we'll shed some light on some products and some ways to think about this especially just making sure that you get an effective dose if you're new here it's the lucas rockwood show i'm a yoga teacher a trainer i'm a serial entrepreneur i'm the father of three kids but first and foremost i'm a student i like to learn stuff so i go into the world and i meet medical doctors like today's guest yoga teachers

at lucasrockwood i answer all of those messages myself thanks so much for listening enjoy so welcome everybody we're doing a different version of the podcast today and the name of our podcast is cannabis for pain and sleep and i'm joined here with mary clifton who is right here on instagram if you're joining us here and dr clifton is a board-certified licensed internal medical doctor she's an expert in cbd and cannabis which is what we'll be chatting about today her website is cbd and cannabis info.com lots of great resources there she's the author of a couple books one is called the grasses greener and the other is called get wasted and she has a bunch of companion cookbooks and she speaks all over the place and we're happy to have her here again the website is cannabisinfo.com welcome mary great to be here great to connect with you you know i was wondering if we could start off with some uh definitions i've never been able to tell or i don't know if there's a difference between cbd from hemp or cbd from cannabis and i'll tell you sort of my understanding of what hemp versus cannabis is i think of like canadian hemp made for like us yoga people wear hemp clothing and then i think of cannabis as like when i'm in holland they have this crazy sticky bud it is that is there a differentiation to be made between the cbd derived from hemp and that from cannabis you know not really i mean i i think that hemp it differentiates from cannabis in most people's minds or at least in the industry as hemp being cannabis sativa and cannabis indica plants that primarily concentrate cbd or don't really concentrate particular cannabinoids and work really to be very fibery for the development of clothing or ropes or things like that so hemp and hemp is also protected under the farm bills here in the united states so it has a different position as far as its ability to be grown and the restrictions around its growth and then cannabis is also cannabis sativa or cannabis indica but generally those are the ones that grow you know and concentrate thc the cannabinoid that gets you high because remember cbd can't get you high it doesn't have a intoxication effect so having uh so having some uh having the thc concentrate puts it more in the cannabis or marijuana space whereas the hemp space is more for cbd or for uh textiles sure so i i first got interested in cbd i guess it was um nine ten ten years ago i guess it was i was living here in spain and so here in spain it was legal to get cbd coming from holland and so the first cbd oils and things i used came from holland and they definitely had thc in them uh definitely and and it was it was um some of them less some of them more and uh but it it wasn't something that i could just take without thinking about it you know i had a couple of experiences where you know up in the middle of the night paranoid and this kind of thing and i think this is what a lot of people worry about and obviously it's very very different when you're buying things in the netherlands where things are largely unregulated and if you're buying something in north america but for for people purchasing things how should they think about it because a lot of my family's in colorado and there's a lot of people living in states where thc slash cbd strains are you know high cbd strains are legal and these kinds of things for somebody who's like not a cannabis user and is freaked out in some cases appropriately freaked out you can have a really bad night on um how can they think about this if you're making a cbd selection cbd uh it and that is is legal in all 50 states it's available everywhere and you can use it in uh you know safely in all 50 states the only time people get any prosecution or any legal issue with it is if you try to give it to somebody who's under 21 then that's going to raise some flag so if you're using it on a child or you know if you in settings like autism or seizure you just need to make sure you've got all of the right experts around you to keep you safe and protected in that setting but the but cbd that is uh you know sold has to be less than 0.3 percent thc so it can't be intoxicating i mean there may have been some early products that leaned heavily towards cbd and weren't possibly you know properly following the rules but the cbd is is almost always tested every single batch has to be tested and and companies have to throw it out if the thc concentration is too high uh and then and then you know for a lot of situations when i'm taking care of people medically starting out with those cbd products do very well for getting a lot of people under control and then you can add a little bit of thc or a lot of thc depending on what you need to do but most of the time when you're making a cbd selection nowadays if you read the label carefully you shouldn't get into a position where you're getting thc but you're right there are a lot of people that can have sort of a paranoid side effect or a side effect where they get too much energy from using the thc addition or they get too sedated so that's where it's really helpful to have somebody provide a little bit of guidance and support while you're making selections within cannabis um you know when you're using it medicinally or recreationally what's happened to me a couple of times is i've gone to dispensaries we have sort of quasi dispensaries here in spain also and i ask for you know cbd and they say oh we have a high cbd strain it's like yeah i mean maybe it's higher in cbd but this is really it's still a very very psychoactive strain and so um this is this is i guess why i'm bringing it up because many many people live in in decriminalized or legalized states and when they go asking for cbd sometimes they just get high cbd strains which is still i mean that can still take you for a really unpleasant evening if you ingest if somebody accidentally ingests half a gram of high cbd strain or something like that people do really well with a high cbd strain i mean in a lot of cases in almost all cases that's where i start and give people to get the benefit of the cbd and then you know but sometimes in cases where you're dealing with like uh nausea or loss of appetite cancer you need to really get the higher cbd concentrations to get that and to get that treated or lots of you know chronic severe pain syndromes but in a lot of cases a little goes a long way as far as your thc but choosing the pure cbd you know if you have any concerns about thc you can just stay away from the fuller broad spectrum and go with the cbd isolate products and there's a ton of those that have that that go through another level of distillation and any thc that was contained in the product is removed and right now for well for the past five years cbd project products have just been exploding everything from you know cbd smart drinks smoothies face creams everything is is there a quality control issue are some of these ineffective i know like in the supplement industry if you were to buy fish oil or something like that there's a wide range some of that stuff is absolute garbage and some of its medicinal you're going to get a bottle of cbd that has like it'll say 300 milligrams of cbd which seems like a lot except for if you put it into a great big bottle you're talking about maybe 10 mil in 10 milligrams per milliliter so you might have to take three or four milliliters five or six milliliters in a lot of cases before you're getting a result five or six dropper fulls is not something people are going to do they're going to do a couple of drops see how they see how it works maybe go up to a half of uh half of a drop or fold maybe to a full dropper full of work a week later so i mean you know this when you you really have to make sure that when you're selecting a product that you have a product that has enough cbd in it to have an effect because i i do talk to people who say this didn't work on me and it didn't work on my dog either and then oh yeah what did you do with it and they gave themselves you know a couple of drops and then they called it a day and so but they're a lot of times i think that's almost like a prohibition uh concept talking because they're not willing to increase that titration very quickly they're not really willing to move through a process with it so it's a uh so it's a you know it's a it you have to be sort of ready to think about this in a little bit higher administration amounts and be ready to start uh uh you know up tooling it up and so let's assume let's assume people are purchasing liquid cbd oil i'm assuming it's in a carrier oil and what is what is the percentage that they should think about because i think especially when i first started consuming it i used to get uh syringes like a gel and syringe it's just like i just had no idea what the dosage was and i didn't know what was strong concentration what wasn't it was kind of all over the place i think in a lot of cases people start a little too low and they stop before they've given themselves adequate time to get enough to see if it's going to work so i think starting at a at a administrative amount of around 20 milligrams and then going up a lot of my patients settle out between 60 and 100 milligrams a day when they're managing anxiety insomnia pain so there's a lot of those settings where where you can get uh quite a bit done you know at that level um so i usually recommend that people go with a product that has at least 2 000 milligrams in the little dropper bottle okay and sometimes even as much as 3 000 to start because then that way a couple of drops is has the potential to make a difference you know uh and then as you're and then as you're titrating your administrative amount you're not going to have to take dropper full after dropper full so i i those weaker uh amounts are you know sometimes uh i think a little off-putting for people getting started and having a great result you know because who wants to have a mouthful of oil so a little bit is okay but i don't want anybody consuming a bunch of it so i mean so i'm guessing like one to three dollars per day is what people are thinking about if they're dosing right in terms of like actual out-of-pocket expense so similar to like a fish similar to like a fish oil like a high quality fish oil same same kind of price range in terms of i think that's a reasonable amount off the shelf you know if you're if you're in a wholesale relationship then you can probably get that near half yeah and the other i mean the other challenge with anything whether whether it's fish oil or whether it's cbd or whether it's deep breathing or whatever people fall into hyperbole really quickly and so you know the the medicine cures everything from you know ptsd to this and that it's like maybe but from an actual you know from a medical perspective from a clinical efficacy perspective what what what are what are just like i can throw this at the wall and feel pretty comfortable it's going to stick of course there's a bunch of outlying use cases but what are the use cases where you're like this is a pretty safe bet this is going to at least move the needle in terms of benefits well i mean it depends on if you're a lumper or a splitter in medicine you know i mean a lot of what is happening and i don't know that i don't know that phrase tell me what that means some people think that you know every little condition has its own little batch of pathophysiology around it and so they've got everything all split off but i think personally when you get to the bottom of anxiety a lot of eating disorders depression a lot of insomnia all of that is boiling down into dopamine and serotonin regulation and imbalance so when you restore homeostasis to that system you you can manage a lot of different conditions and that's true because when we're managing these conditions in medicine you use antidepressants across a whole spectrum of things that don't actually have to do with depression we use antidepressants to manage chronic pain and that's all serotonin and dopamine so that's where it's so exciting to be able to share a product that balances and restores homeostasis at that neurotransmitter level and the same thing is true when you're dealing with inflammation you know the other pathway that cbd and other cannabinoids are so powerful is in restoring i'm running out of juice restoring balance and homeostasis with inflammation so if you can help to reduce the inflammatory response i mean very acutely in the situation we're dealing with right now if you can decrease the amount of cytokine production and alleviate the cytokine storm reduce tumor necrosis factor in interleukin that reduces fever and body aches and mucus production and you know in one rat model took a group of rats who were like laid out with the rat flu to another group of rats who were pre-treated with cbd who were still eating and drinking and even um even solving a few simple mazes they felt good enough to get up and have a little fun and that's remarkable you know that we can modify the the immune response the inflammation response uh that that way and that powerfully so uh so these are really valuable products and and really our bodies were designed for them i mean you have the endocannabinoid system cb1 receptors all throughout your spinal cord and brain cb2 receptors all throughout your immune system three four and five receptors are located in some very limited places in the brain and probably aren't clinically relevant you know because everything's getting stimulated by cbd or thc at various levels or the other 80 known cannabinoids you know so uh so when you're doing uh when you're thinking about uh you know how is this stuff affecting it's you you have this endocannabinoid system you have these receptors and you have a plant that grows outdoors literally like a weed you know if we weren't in prohibition it would be growing in my ditch it's just you know right well i don't have a ditch you know i'm on the 23rd floor here in manhattan but it'd be growing in somebody's ditch somewhere and then and you'd be able to just use it the animals that you would be consuming would be consuming it and it'd be pollinating the air so you'd always be getting that stabilization and that balance to your system even if you weren't actively inhaling the product the the the whole system is is designed to uh to to work for you so i don't see any reason why you shouldn't view this product as more of an adaptogen like along with your mushrooms and your b complex and your your omega-3 fats all of the things that you're doing to restore that balance in your system and mary everybody i talked to who gets into cbd oil they're always starting to add back in some thc and the theory that i've heard is that you know these cannabinoids work in synergy and we're isolating one of them we don't really know how that works and modern cannabis is jacked up for thc um you know like you said it would be growing in the ditch but definitely it wouldn't be like thai stick growing in the ditch like the stuff that they grow now that this is like this is green crack i mean this stuff is so strong it's so so strong it's it's been it's been hybridized for thc and so you know the stuff that would have been growing native in north america or whatever it's nothing like the dank bud stuff they're selling it's nothing like that um i have a uh insurance connection within the cannabis community that said to me recently i um i eat all of my food organic and all of my cannabis is inorganic because i want it i want it under perfect growing conditions i want the highest concentration of thc and and i want i want a very certain type that can't grow in the ditch but he also you know it will take like one half of one puff he's using what he's trying to do is concentrate the thc so that he's not you know um necessarily getting that much higher but he doesn't have to have that much exposure to the inhalation which is really neat if he can do one inhalation yeah you know so but you're right it does if you're like if you were smoking back in the 70s when we were all kids the 70s and the 80s and you're thinking about getting back into it you know you're absolutely right exercise caution yeah things are a little different nowadays yeah but are you are you of the same school are you of the same school of thought where there there is there are benefits to integrating some thc into a cbd protocol if somebody tolerates it in a lot of cases i i i will add a little thc for patients you know and sometimes even when they're starting with a cbd consultation and we're talking about just adding cbd i'll tell them i really wouldn't spend a lot of time on exclusively cbd given your circumstances people who are having you know end stage cancer uh you know pain or loss of appetite that that's not a cbd uh issue although sometimes there's a decent response but there are certain circumstances where i'd like to go straight to a higher concentration of thc to get those symptoms under control but sure you know a little bit of cbd followed by a lot of cbd so you can see how it's responding for you and then add that shift to thc because in a lot of cases just getting the cbd at a high enough concentration is going to get you what you're looking for when i first started practicing yoga the biggest challenge for me was flexibility i couldn't sit cross-legged on the floor i couldn't extend my arms above my head everything was just so uncomfortable because i was so so stiff and i was in my 20s so my body was fully formed obviously as most of you are it puts you in a very different position if you're an adult and you have major stiffness major imbalance the traditional yoga advice to just keep coming to class for a lot of us is just not enough it's not that it won't work for mobility or flexibility but because a typical yoga class includes strength and balance and breath work and so many other things flexibility is number four number five on the list it'll certainly help but it can often just take way too long or at least that was my assumption if i just kept going on the path that i started back in my 20s i figured it would take me three four maybe five years to be able to cross my legs and sit in a squat and lotus and that was just too depressing i couldn't really accept that so i went on a mission and started researching didn't get a lot of love from my yoga teachers meaning they didn't like this idea of flexibility training so i went to other places martial artists i talked to gymnastics teachers dance practitioners and very quickly i learned it's not that complicated flexibility is not that complicated the way to open your body is through long hold passive stretches it's really uncomfortable it's a process i call gravity yoga i have been teaching this in workshop and class settings now since 2007 and just about a year and a half ago i started certifying teachers in gravity yoga our teachers work with two different types of clients one is they'll work privately to help somebody like a triathlete or a new mother or even somebody who doesn't do any exercise at all but they have an imbalance from working in the service industry or from caring around a kid or whatever it is and then the other way they work with people is within group classes and workshops so one hour guided classes um in some cases two day workshops to help people open their hips their hamstrings their spine and their shoulders those are often the tricky areas and it's been super successful it's really really popular it's one of these things that i thought i was the only one struggling with this but no no no turns out many people every day when they go to put on their shoes are hyper aware of the fact that their hips and their hamstrings are problematically tight and this just isn't just about feeling flexible it's also about taking care of your lower back and taking care of your joints if you can't stand and move in a functional way it can really cause problems imbalances in our body are one of the leading cause of back pain and knee problems even shoulder issues can derive directly from imbalances and this is where gravity yoga comes in i'm telling you this story now because we're about to start our last gravity yoga teacher training program of 2020. it's an amazing program it's 12 days long it's live with me and we'll teach you everything you need to know to work one-on-one or in group settings just so you know most of our graduates now are working virtually via zoom due to the coronavirus end and it's working just as well if not better than before to learn more about the chorus go to gravity yoga training dot com gravity yoga training dot com and you can read stories from past students watch a video from me and see if it's the right thing for you courses starting soon hope you can join us the actual course itself was i just want to give feedback and say it was superbly run the use of modern technology and techniques this feedback system i was not expecting this i was just expecting an email saying with a few bullet points um you guys are really set an example to every training college on how things should be done and i can't commend you enough for that it was money very well spent um and i'll be back for more courses i'm sure so um once again thank you very much i'm very happy now thank you cheers bye this week's nutritional tip comes in response to a listener question listener sally s on instagram says lucas i've noticed you've discontinued your nutritional supplements specifically your green me up super green powder why did you do that and do you have another brand that you could recommend i find some stuff at target but i'm not sure if it's good so we manufactured supplements for over 10 years and i loved manufacturing supplements i'm kind of a supplement nerd but what happened is over the course of the 10 years supplements became really easy to find which is great you can find supplements like you mentioned sally at target you can find really pretty good supplements at target in fact well i've only been in target a couple of times in recent years but last time i was there i saw some pretty good supplements and and so that's why we stopped there just wasn't really a need for it anymore when i first started selling supplements in 2007 many of our listeners many of our subscribers they couldn't find stuff and so it was a really fun thing to be able to do and i like nutrition i like i like putting things together so yes we had a formula called green me up which i also loved it was a really great superfood green powder in terms of do i recommend them yeah i definitely recommend them you know it's especially great when you're traveling to have little superfoods in your bag just because a lot of times the food is kind of lifeless and boring and dull in terms of micronutrients and so it can be a really helpful thing to carry for those of you who are wondering what we're talking about usually these green powders contain things like chlorella and spirulina and barley grass juice extract and other extremely extremely mineral dense micro algaes usually they're micro allergies these things these super green powders that look really really dark green almost purplish that's usually what they contain the gating factor for this is always i this is always my caveat for supplements is your belly and so some of these things will just wreak havoc on your gi system you just can't you just can't eat much of them or you'll end up on the toilet all day but in terms of brands and things like that i i hesitate to do brand recommendations because i don't know these companies come and go and suddenly they're making something great and they switch manufacturers and it's not that great but there are lots of great stuff to find i usually send people to irb like iphone iherb.com great site for buying supplements really great prices and they ship all over the world literally all over the world it's a good place to find stuff but especially if you're traveling i think it's a really great resource if you're at home you know usually if you can have any kind of fresh greens that's going to trump any of those powders but if you don't have access i am certainly a fan hope that helps we have a listener question this week from joseph joseph on instagram says lucas getting into gravity yoga for hip flexibility specifically thanks for that my question is i'm coming off of 10 years in an office we've all switched to remote work now and so i have time to exercise but i'm not sure what to do i have about 18 or 20 pounds to lose will flexibility training help i get some variation of this question pretty regularly joseph so i thought i'd answer this directly and the answer is probably not of all the different things you could experiment with to help with weight loss flexibility training is probably pretty low on the list now it could help with stress and reducing stress it reduces weight loss but that would be a that i feel like that would be pretty much of a stretch if i was to suggest that you know your nightly gravid yoga is going to help with weight loss when you are thinking about weight loss there are things that i think are often overlooked and those are things like sleep and stress mental emotional stress moderation lifestyle balance meal timing carb throttling but none of which involve extreme exercise or extreme calorie counting which is generally thought of as the best practice if you delve into the research around this you'll find really quickly that extreme exercise and extreme dieting is almost always correlated with failure it it has a very very low efficacy rate and the most successful long-term weight loss programs involve moderate to light exercise which would look and feel more like walking the dog i just want to say that out loud so that you know if you're not attracted to extreme exercise if it's not something that you enjoy and it's not something that's safe for your joints depending on where what what age you are and things like this you can be in great shape doing very very moderate things very simple things i encourage you to go back and listen to some of the past shows i have a show called everything i know about weight loss where i share just some of the very very simple high leverage tips that i learned from the years i spent working in the weight loss market and things like this we have a whole number of episodes

been flying off the shelves I guess during a pandemic such as this one corona virus everybody wants to smoke and so they they are moving towards a CBD shisha and the question I always get is like is it good does it work what does it feel like and so I thought I'd make a video because I I do smoke this all the time and I wanted to make sure you guys also knew what it feels like so I'll show you the I'll show you the puffing and all that stuff and the smoke that was my LexA but I don't know why I uh I grew up smoking she should I know that sounds weird but like not grew up grew up but like since a teenager so I would always smoke this one Al Fakher which is actually got tobacco and nicotine in it so the really good thing about these is there's no nicotine and there's no tobacco it's a hundred percent natural product 100% herbal two hundred milligrams of CBD which means there's two hundred milligrams of sous-vide in the entire packet and I get about six to eight uses out of this packet so you just do two hundred divided by six divided by eight I should have done the math before I turn this on it's like 25 finished milligrams of CBD per per serving of shisha I hope I did that math right today I'm going to I'm gonna test review our review product review mega mango and you might be wondering why am i doing mega mango well we've got we've got fizzy bubble we've got mega mango we've got double apple pink lemonade blueberry mint Just Peachy going great and mighty mint so drop it in the comments which one you want me to do a review on and I'll definitely do a review on it I'm gonna do mega mango because like I said I grew up smoking shisha and we smoked all the original flavors so like the top three were mint double apple and honey and so I don't want to test one of those out because you guys kind of know what those would already taste like and I love mangoes like I love a fresh mangos I love dried mangoes the spicing mangoes at Trader Joe's Iloka mango juice mango shake mango lassi I love mango anything so I thought doing a mango one would be a great way to kind of tell you guys how realistic the taste is and if it's if it's even tasty so here we go I'm gonna just unpack it for you it comes with a seal around it so you know nobody's messed with it so we'll break the seal off for you guys if I can got it it's a nice black container it's got the warning on the back it says do not operate heavy machinery after use keep away from children 200 milligrams of full-spectrum CBD hemp oil under 8 sale prohibited ingredients hemp oil honey glycerin camel molasses and flavoring made in the US and I saw somewhere maybe I'm not on this one oh I'm really on that on the packaging itself there is a barcode a QR code so you can get the certificate of analysis so when you open it up its packaged in there wow you can smell it like the minute you open the can it's like whoa it tastes like fresh mango like really does you ever been in on market oh my god I could smell this for days anyways it comes in this little plastic pouch just like this and what I really love about the plastic pouch that they give is that it's got a ziplock on it so it does close tightly again when you're done using it versus like when you smoke the tobacco one it kind of comes in a packet that you cut open and then once you cut it open it's on you to savor it likes make sure it doesn't spoil or get get hard so make sure you're always closing it back when you finish well so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pack my bowl I say that's additionally this this smells so good guide I forgot how it good this smells [Applause] [Music] so now you can see like the cool is lit it's on fire it's burning the she shows burning and you can see like the puffs the puffs are really big like and it's such a smooth inhale like if you're if you're familiar with smoking tobacco shisha you know and you've probably seen your friends do this the first time they smoke when you inhale sometimes if you inhale too much and it's not smooth you get this tickle in your throat and then you're trying not to cop in front of people you wanna be embarrassment happen with this this cvd shisha is so smooth even if you're novice you maybe only smoke before I guarantee I don't guarantee but you should not have that that tickle in your throat that coughing problem unless you do something weird when you're packing it thing but anyways that is your Mecca Bingo CBD shisha I love it it's such a smooth smooth inhale smooth exhale has that mango fresh taste like you literally feel like you're I don't know snorting mangos visit us at my pain center calm if you want to get some seedy shisha we've got all the flavors in stock let us know in the comments which one you'd like us to review next like I said be a fizzy bubble mango mega mango double apple pink lemonade blueberry mint Just Peachy going grape and my tea mint and as I said before I grew up smoking the traditional shisha flavors double apple and mint and honey so if you want to stick to the traditional flavors we've got the mint and we've got the double apple if you want to stray a little bit away but you're not not sure how far away you would astray I'd suggest a blueberry mint and then if you're just looking to have some fun try something new it's your first time trying to see shisha get whichever flavor really satisfies your palate like I love mango so I love smoking mega bingo but if you like pink lemonade eliminates and actually very interesting flavor as well just peachy going great or fizzy bubble let us know again we're running a 15% off sale Rhona 15 for this pandemic because we know you need shisha and you need CBD because I know I need CBD we've got gummies we've got oiled you've got pre-rolled

"YXpfchNKqm0": "hi I was doing some plant extractions so I thought I would share my process here you can see the ground up plant in question normally a chemist will do setup like this this is footage stolen from nurdrage if you don't know him go check him out anyway the key feature here is the soxhlet extractor it is a device that you can load up with stuff and it will automatically cycle the fresh solvents through it it is basically automatic self siphoning device if you like me don't have such logic structure or any glassware basically you can use method that I am using here so this is just basic filter paper that I modified to allow vapor to pass through it of course it has to be compatible with your solvent on top of that you can place random container that you will fill with cold water ideally this should be glass container but in the past I have used even polypropylene plastic cups also here is some kindergarten science in case you wonder how you can make effectively holes in this filter paper you can see that I intentionally offset the first hole from the bottom this offset basically depends on how much material you have now let's put in just a little bit of a solvent I'm using 50 milliliters of ethanol put your stuff that you want to extract into this filter paper do this outside your extraction container because you can contaminate liquid then a few your cooling container with water and be sure to keep outside dry now you can turn on your heat source and just wait actually you should periodically check the temperature of your cooling water one little problem this setup have is that the filter paper likes to suck in the solvent and carry stuff with it this is not a big deal unless you work with extremely small quantities in which case you shouldn't use this setup anyway you should continue with extraction until you see that the solvent that comes out of the filter paper is basically clear I guess depending what solvent and what you are extracting here you can see plant material after extraction and you can see that is quite off-colored and at this point I tested the extracted plant material and I can confirm that the chemical was not there and here's the extract it should be pale yellow oily resin material but you can see that it has quite greenish tint to it this is due to presence of chlorophyll in this part I will try to extract the chlorophyll from the extract itself unfortunately only way I can destroy chlorophyll presence is by UV fluorescence which would not be so terrible but unfortunately my only resource is this PCB exposure unit I built sometime ago this is about 120 watt light source and the radiation from this Fink is overwhelming when you turn this thing gone basically whole world looks like it's dead and I will have to make some adjustments to the scene so you can see what I can see and now we are cooking there may be much better solutions to separate chlorophyll but I know only about one solvents that can do this and that is propane or butane or mixture of two now this will be a little bit crazy but actually propane mixed with ethanol is not quite that volatile but it's still pretty much flammable so be aware of that at least I mean it should be unless you are five years old anyway so you can see that there is quite clear separation of two fractions since that chlorophyll content is not that different though also in the visible light this is really nice but the question is how do we separate this seriously what did you think if you have one you can use separatory funnel just never never plug it up even though it should handle this pressure there wouldn't be much much higher than one atmosphere of pressure I mean do you see any problem here I repeated this extraction about six or eight times now on the left side you can see the butane fraction and on the right side you can see the ethanol fraction the ethanol one is quite muddy it seems like it has some water content in it to be fair I also fill tributon fraction through some filter paper so but still it wasn't muddy it seemed to be contaminated by some solid pieces now both fractions are right and you can see quite clearly the color difference now let's look at this under UV light [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so you can see this reddish fluorescence that is quite specific to chlorophyll this is the beauty infraction even though you can see some orange a green fluorescent blobs there on the other hand in the ethanol fraction you can see that the whole material is this orange green fluorescent pink although even here you can see some quite a reddish spots that could indicate some presence of chlorophyll so the separation is quite good but not 100%", "2dj5xS8e6gc": "Let\u2019s talk about the genetics of THC and\nCBD. These two molecules are produced by a pair\nof enzymes that convert cannabigerol, or CBG, into either THC or CBD depending on which\nenzyme is present. These two enzymes are actually made from slightly\ndifferent versions of the same gene! It\u2019s the same thing as having different\nversions, also known as alleles, of the hair color gene. One version gives you blonde hair, while the\nother version gives you black hair, but it\u2019s still just one gene that controls hair color\n. The same is true for THC and CBD. When a male plant pollinates a female plant\nto make seeds, those seeds get one copy of each gene from mom and one copy of each gene\nfrom dad. If a plant has two copies of the Bt allele\n, then the plant will basically only produce THC. Likewise, if the plant has two copies of the\nBd allele then the plant will only make CBD. However, if the plant has one copy of the\nBt allele and one copy of the Bd allele, then it will have a mix of THC and CBD. At Delta Leaf we can identify whether a plant\ncontains the Bt allele, the Bd allele, or both. This saves time and money by identifying the\nplants you want immediately after germination, instead of waiting months to observe the phenotype. We can also identify whether a plant carries\nthe male, or \u201cY\u201d, chromosome.

about my voice I'm just now getting over being sick and I'm finally getting my voice back but it's still a little bit scratchy so please try to ignore it I'm so freaking excited for today's video because we are gonna be discussing and testing out the latest health trend CBD hemp is a type of cannabis plant that contains a chemical called CBD it doesn't make you high like marijuana but it is creating a national buzz CBD CBD CBD sprouting up everywhere and in everything to put a simply CBD is a component of the cannabis plant with enormous healing potential you can get the benefits of CBD in so many different forms like oils edibles coffee even skin care and so many more now I personally found out about CBD last year whenever I broke my wrist snowboarding I'm sure you guys already know the story with that but after my surgery the doctors prescribed me some really hard drugs to help me cope with the pain and even though the pain was so unbearable I could not stand the side effects of the drugs so I had to start doing some research into more natural ways of relieving my chronic pain and I came across CBD oils and I've been using them ever since it's really cool because it helps you with so many other things like relieving stress anxiety migraines and it even improves my sleep when I first thought I'm doing a video like this I was just gonna use CBD oil for a whole week and kind of see what it does but since I already have a really positive experience using CBD oils I wanted to dive in into a different way of using CBD without actually ingesting it so in this video I'm gonna be sharing with you guys my experience of using a CBD cream for a whole week now there are so many different CBD brands out there and it's kind of hard to find one that you can truly trust that is organically grown the most trusted brand I've tried so far is premium Jane they provide some of the most purest safest and most effective products in the industry they are sourced from a hundred percent or grown Oregon hemp which if you didn't know I live in Oregon and we're kind of known to grow some of the best hemp out there anyways I'll be using this CBD topical solve from premium Jane you can call it assault and pointman a cream whatever I think I was gonna go with the cream it's much easier for me to say but this contains 1500 milligrams of CBD and it has some other really incredible ingredients like eucalyptus essential oil Joba oil argan oil emu oil grapeseed oil Omega 3 and 6 oils soy protein hibiscus flower extract neem leaf extract lemongrass extract chamomile extract aloe vera extract and cocoa butter these are all-natural and very powerful ingredients and I'm kind of excited to see what it can do to my skin so I started applying this every single day on my face and on my wrist [Music] I have a metal plate and screws in there that's holding the bone together and since I live in Oregon this time of year it gets super cold and the aching pain in my wrist gets so bad this cream is pretty powerful as a high dose of CBD so as soon as I started rubbing this on my wrist I kid you not the aching pain went away almost immediately and I do use CBD oils for this kind of pain but that takes a little bit longer to kick in it was really insane to me that I got immediate relief whenever I applied this cream now I didn't really see much of a difference in my skin other than some of the redness and breakouts were definitely reduced and my skin did feel a lot more hydrated and supple but I did notice a huge improvement in my lips I have this terrible habit of biting my lips and I would get these little pieces of broken skin on the outer corners of my lips because you know I feel like this oh well all of that is completely healed from just using this for one week and then that whole eyelash extension thing happened I just got out of the shower and I'm so embarrassed to share this with you guys but I have to because I am convinced this is a miracle CBD cream last night I was washing my face my eyelash extensions were kind of in the way and I don't know where I just started like pulling them out and not just the lash extensions but my real lashes too because you know the extensions is stuck to the lashes whoo I literally pulled out so many of my lashes I barely have any on oh so my eyes swole up they were so red so inflamed they were burning so much pain so what do I do I take the CBD bomb and I started applying it all over my eyelids and almost immediately the inflammation started going down and it felt so soothing this especially it was so bad like you could still kind of see the redness and the puffiness but I was shocked at how quickly the CBD balm work the next morning I woke up my eyes were not swollen anymore they look good again except for this one damn I still feel really dumb for pulling out my eyelashes but it happened I'm so glad I had something like this on hand to help treat it oh another thing my daughter brought her fingers she was trying to help me cook and she accidentally touched the pan and had a little burn around her fingers what did I do I put this on in a couple seconds and the pain went away so good stuff overall I experienced many benefits using this cream I think this is something every household should have just in case of an emergency like I mentioned this helps treat my daughter's minor burn better than anything else I'm blown away with the benefits I've received just by using it for one week I love this little jar of magical healing cream and will continue to use it every single day I've already ordered a couple more jars to stock up just in case I run out if you're wanting to get your hands on this you know where to find it I will also leave the link down below

in my next video bye [Music]", "PBWiZgrQ48A": "hello my name is Ryan from goalie scientific and today we are gonna be talking about winterization and dewaxing first let's begin with the definition pulled straight from wikipedia winterization of oil is a process of removing the higher melting point parts from oil like waxes or triglycerides by slowly cooling vegetable oils and felling saturated slides from the solvent used primarily for oils and salad dressings mainly applied in bio industry the most common oil that is winterized as a rice bran oil which has a high content of waxes fatty acids and lipids notice that it doesn't specify which solvent will be used it could be assumed that the initial solvent used to perform the extraction could also be used to precipitate out the waxes and higher melting point compounds typically the people that extract with hydrocarbons and supercooled those hydrocarbons to precipitate how the waxes would call that technique technique dewaxing while those that use a different solvent altogether like ethanol to achieve their dewaxing procedure would typically call it a winterization but the two are of the same thing and in fact if you wanted to call it the correct term it would probably be called freeze precipitation but the confusion is somewhat warranted the procedure may incorporate several different techniques but simply do waxing or winterization is simply the process of removing waxes but by removing something you're also purifying something and by removing the waxes you improve the viscosity stability or the shelf life so let's quickly summarize how the process is done first we start by using a solvent to completely dissolve the sample typically we would use ethanol and for the best results that's what that would be my suggestion it is crucially important that you completely dissolve the solvent there are a couple ways to speed up this process one would be to use heat a hotter solvent is going to be a more aggressive solvent the let the next would be to use agitation so hot plate stirrer would be ideal make sure you give enough time heat and agitation to completely dissolve the sample but if you want a visual indicator a quick test is to use a laser pointer to shine through the solution if a beam of light is found in the solution then keep heating and stirring it's not completely dissolved if however you shine the light through the solution and you don't see the beam in the solution at all then the solution is completely dissolved and you can go ahead and move on to the next step now it's time to allow it to cool and settle this is pretty easy just put it into a freezer and allow it to sit for an extended period of time at a low temperature the colder you have it the faster it works but too cold is possible so I would recommend to not allow it to cool below 50 Celsius I'm sorry negative 50 Celsius usually this would take 24 to 48 hours for a complete precipitation after that it's ready to move on to the filtering stage here you would use a filtration setup which typically consists of consists of a beautiful and filtration flask along with some filtration paper I would recommend quantitative a filter paper and the pore size would generally be around 20 for fast filtration and no smaller than 5 micron it's best to keep the whole process as fast as possible or as cold as possible that way you don't allow things to heat up and allow stuff to go back into solution and fall through the filter paper so how does this all work basically hotter solvents are more aggressive and dissolved more and colder solvents are less aggressive so think of the solvent will like a hand when the solvents hot it grabs a big handful as much as it could possibly hold on to but as a solvent cools down its grip loosens and now it's no longer able to hold as much now stuff falls out of the hands this analogy is exactly how it works your solvent at a warmer temperature completely dissolves your sample and then by cooling your solvent the solubility is decreased and the sample is precipitated out or in this case the waxes are precipitated out in general the heavier compounds tend to precipitate first and lighter compounds tend to precipitate last so in the chart over here to the right what you'll notice is the ethanol at roughly room temperature will be able to dissolve all the compounds below it so waxes cannabinoids flavonoids terpenes it could dissolve everything at room temperature however if you notice as the temperature starts to decrease the ethanol is no longer able to hold on as much and one of the first compounds that it tends to precipitate is the waxes but as stated earlier too cold can be detrimental so if you'll notice if you continue to go down like for instance below negative 50 some of your other compounds will tend to precipitate - such as cannabinoids possibly your flavonoids or even your terpenes at a certain point once you get so cold your ethanol will turn into a solid although cooling the solvent allows us to precipitate out most of the waxes we also employ a separation based on polarity to help us precipitate out the waxes even more thoroughly so what is polarity the common phrase in chemistry is like dissolves like so polar solvents want to dissolve polar compounds and likewise nonpolar solvents want to dissolve nonpolar compounds so by using a more polar solvent we could precipitate precipitate out more of the non polar compounds polar molecules are asymmetrical in shape and have a net charge this tends to force them to group together with other polar compound and therefore exclude out the nonpolar compounds it's important to keep in mind that polarity is not a discrete measure it isn't absolute things are not just simply polar or nonpolar there's a lot of gray area for example a compound might be smacked out right in the middle between nonpolar and polar and it might be difficult to classify it another interesting examples in motions and soaps these compounds tend to have a polar end and a nonpolar end and because of this they could essentially dissolve both polar and nonpolar compounds this is why soap tends to work so good because the water is polar but the oils and greases on her hands are nonpolar the soap unifies these two compounds and helps wash them away another separation technique is to swing the polarity if there's a range of solvents that could be used to dissolve your sample you first start with the most polar or nonpolar solvent then you do your extraction your solvent recovery etc then you read dissolve your sample in the opposite end so if you started with a non-polar solution that you extracted with you would recover all your solvent and everything use a polar solvent to reduce all your sample in it by using two opposite ends of the polarity spectrum you shake off the compounds on the most extreme ends so for instance if you were to use heptane for your initial extraction you would likely pick up everything dissolve everything cannabinoid acids flavonoids cannabinoids carotenes and waxes then when you swing over to your ethanol you're more polar solution you're gonna drop out your waxes but since you originally used heptane in the beginning you won't have any chlorophylls the same process could be done in Reverse so if you start out with ethanol you're more polar solution you're more likely to have more polar compounds like chlorophyll but when you swing them over to are more nonpolar solvent you're likely to lose the chlorophylls polarity should probably also not be underestimated small differences in polarity could have a Jurassic effect feel free to explore or discuss the eatest topics below you can also comment on this video or send emails any time and I'll try my best to respond to them as quickly as possible so as stated earlier temperature swings will cause precipitation so you could always magnify that effect by swing and an even greater so if you start with a hot solvent and then cool it down very cold you could use a lot less solvent a hot solvent can be anywhere from 10 to a thousand times greater effect same thing for polarity swings you could also have a much greater polarity swing and there have therefore have a more defined separation settling is also important allowing more time and reducing the agitation is crucial by reducing the amount of agitation you not only allow faster coagulation but the coagulation also tends to be bigger and more clumped together and this tends to reduce the filtration time needed another idea that we didn't touch on at all is pH if you alter the pH you will also alter the solubility which is the same effect we use to precipitate out other compounds by altering solubility that is so we've used temperature and polarity to alter solubility but we didn't use the pH at all so it stands that we can have a third hole another tool in our Arsenal to use to precipitate out other compounds even more thoroughly another thing to consider is time if you allow enough time and allow enough or a lack of agitation precipitation will occur even at room temperature so you don't have to actually cool it but it definitely speeds things up it'll probably take at least a week for stuff to precipitate out in any kind of substantial amount and to completely precipitate might take a month or more but it's definitely worth pursuing because significant expenses allocated to the chillers or freezers needed for the winterization process occur at a very low temperature so if you could do that and elevate a temperature you could save yourself a lot of money and a lot of headache okay that's all I got for now make sure you check out more of our

is there's the low and the high we're gonna see how that presses later anyway let's uh yeah let's see how she does all right uh when i said let's see how she does um break the woman up to 170 and i have um 18 grams of 74 to 159 micron dry sift not melt or bubble flash just dry cleaned very very efficiently clean and let's see how she presses those you're wondering um and thank send yourself that's a different press it is um i have a lot when i you know when i'm dialing things in or dialing in um specific psi's time uh press time press times um temperatures etc um i love my rosin press new york 20-ton tank right there beast plates are huge just love it but for tonight again as i mentioned a lot of work to do and a lot of presses and i have everything else out there this is really the only uh one of a few hash presses tonight um i know a lot of people aren't big fans of flower rosin but um it's a very you know as far as the the economics of it it's an undeniable product you know um it's a it's a completely solventless full melt product that that we can shell for very very cheap and it's never bad and that's like as dark as it gets and that's not bad at all always a nice butter consistency um i try to keep it fresh fresh but literally i don't know with flour rosin i can collect it immediately and jar it and get it into the freezer immediately and it's still buttered by the next day all right it's time to give this thing some pressure and by some pressure i mean little to none and now yep there we go we just deployed this place back down to zero psi so around a thousand and it's falling pretty quickly we're warming up and i'm evening out the bag here um again i have no idea how this press is going to go so i don't know if i said that or not yet but if i had been if i didn't say that or not yet now we have no expectations here um no guarantees of gold or anything all right up to about 25 hundo and what do you guys see in there nothing either huh falling pretty fast hit the three and it's falling relatively fast again um we have to be making some rosin i have a feeling i'm going to be heartbroken over the yield but i don't know then again maybe you just needed a minute you guys see both of us we got just in case you're wondering and back down hey turned out to be a pretty decent dry sip hash press after all um and for that anybody that might care this specific strain is cbd kush it's uh it's still very high in thc it's just it's uh well it's much higher you know most of your strains that have any thc in them have you know one percent maybe one and a half or no cbd this has i want to say like six 11 or maybe yeah 11 that's right that's right it's 11 cbd 16 to use so three to two and go ahead and uh run this guy across the top clean that out there we're at max psi there uh if anybody cares i'm i'm not trying to go any higher than six or sixty five hundred um i bumped right up to 6500 there and it fell pretty quickly there's obviously still some more hash to this place let's look at where it looks like we're going to get a reasonably looks like we're going to get a relatively decent yield got about 15 seconds left here there's more than definitely going to be a second press in this but i have had it on the plates for long enough that that can be our second press oof oh yeah all right how'd it come out how to come out um i know we're probably looking at the camera right there going like bro very dark rosin um you know as i mentioned dry shift and let's try something from some cbd kush buds that um let's see we're not only uh dry but they've been curing for a while so there's gonna be some you know the alpha and beta chlorophyll properties some mature maturization of the trichrome head is going to of course amber eyes that milky white or uh even just cloudy i'll tell you what the good reward again i feel like well i mean obviously that's [ __ ] i feel like this guy's got a second press in him but you know i don't know i'll never find out um i keep all my pucks and i keep them separate yeah i keep my rosin chips separate so that i can make solventless coconut oil with them and then i also go ahead and turn it up a little notch there and make that solventless coconut oil that you can use to make edibles you can dose your own you know what i mean let's see if i can get you guys in here really does look a lot darker than it than it actually is if you go you know um it looks it's yeah it's crazy looks darker on the camera that does the eye but it's not it's not a dark it's not too dark sorry of a chocolate color but it is gorgeous and as far as stability goes well let me just show you i can already tell just how it's going to act by holding the parchment for a minute yes my favorite ash rosins come up with this sorry i don't know i mean my favorite presses come up like this um whether they be you know flower or ash or whatever obviously as a smoker i i personally prefer hash rosin but it's uh it can be significantly more expensive and it can also be not available depending on where you are you know what your deal is if you're one of the people that you know follows me or um or has been following me for a little while or maybe uh or you you know you live in the pnw you're in the oregon market the wreck market uh california market washington market etc you guys just i'm not talking to you guys um and but even still you know what i'm talking about you know what i'm talking about as far as the pricing of the hash rosin it's just brutal look at that i want you to see that collection let's go ahead and grab go back and grab our other one there we go right there right right there oh don't break on me oh it broke on me hey we got them all there you go ladies and gentlemen there is our cbd kush dry sift hash rosin not flower rosin damn okay oh we were gonna do yield weren't we i mean why not right okay let's see i'll try not to take too much longer i'm sure you guys are probably already bored if anybody's even uh you know i imagine 90 of you already have checked out and or maybe you just fast-forwarded to here i don't know either way my apologies for moving too slow for you damn that's stable that's the thing man with ah you can get the uh you can get hash rosin to maintain its fresh breast consistency much longer and also of course i'm working in a cold room right now so it's not really going to start to butter like this if you guys can see that or not but we are at 5.4 out of 18 which um 5.4 out of 18 that's almost 33 that's a solid 30 percent yield solid 30 yield on some triceps that i did not take a bunch of time and try and card and get it all clean and perfect or anything i just mucked it all around beat the hell out of it and uh i bet we can get this to 5.4 and above [ __ ] five point four nine five point five five and a half grams five and a half grams eleven sixteen and a half grams that'd be thirty three percent yeah we're definitely into this into a solid thirty um what's beautiful about this is that number one sloppy sloppily collected dry sift this the reason this gave me a third yield and some very reasonable quality hash rosin for a cured product not live not fresh frozen not fresh cured um this gave me the 33 yield because or 30 sorry about 30 yield because of the micron specifics this guy which is 25 to 73 the low microns and the high 160 to 249 i'm sure this guy will probably only yield about i don't know if this yield if the other one yielded 30 this will probably only yield 15 or 20. but there's a good bit in here so you know if we have uh 40 grams of sift in there or 30 grams of sip in there and i get uh 20 off of it well then we got another six grams of beautiful hash ruffles and of course then we can put it all together and it's and it's just full spectrum now let's see here i'll show you one more we'll get it prepared for you a little bit whew yeah it's just yucky i don't know i know some of you going like yo that is dark it's gross ew it's cured resin it's not fresh frozen and again it's frozen it's not gonna have that kind of clarity to it you know um it could have a beautiful color to it but it shouldn't unless it's very very fresh pressed and it's very live and has that beautiful color generally is not a lot of clarity this stuff is already starting to butter as you can see but you know i'm not uh i'm not writing any letters home about it or anything but again this is cured product and i keep forgetting to get this far i keep distracted getting distracted sorry aside from this being cured for the product not being fresh frozen not you know etc the um shoot almost almost as dominant as thc as cannabidiol um look at some videos of uh hemp rosin pressing even the live stuff is nowhere near the color that we get out of our fresh frozen hash rosin with regular canvas so having said that i'm sure the fact that it's a high cbd strain had something to do with it and again um well not live is not live but that's five and a half grams of incredibly high cbd uh three to two so generally my hash rosin comes in between uh 75 and 85 percent cannabinoids let's say usually right around 80 to 85 percent cannabinoids so if we're three to two you know um five goes into eighty what so what are we like uh right around fifty percent thc thirty percent cbd that's gonna that'll smack and it's incredibly medicinal hope you guys enjoyed the video hope i didn't bore you try to keep this baby under 20 minutes and of course this is just a little personal press for me here on the lab and uh hoping to be um submitting for inspection very soon so that i can start to produce here okay guys", "yXyOprAfsGw": "today we're going to be talking

being held as a new way to help your favorite furry friend cannabis known as pot or marijuana is an increasingly popular way to treat arthritis cancer and anxiety in pets new edibles and oils contain cannabidiol or cbd a natural element in cannabis that doesn't get pets high but some veterinarians say has healing properties without the potential harm of traditional pharmaceuticals they can cause stomach upset kidney damage or liver damage a lot of pets are unable to handle the harsher side effects of some of those medications california veterinarian tim shu created vet cbd oil which he does not prescribe and is only available through medical marijuana dispensaries rachel martin says it helped her dog sophie fight cancer for the second time that's my girl i love you sophie's vet gave her just two months to live it just felt like a race against the clock at that point after spending thousands of dollars on traditional treatments martin tried cbd oil as a last resort adding a few drops into sophie's food every day in those two months it was a complete turnaround and i was sold and now over a year later she came back from the brink and got a whole new lease on life jodi beliveau

the district of columbia and illegal under federal law some vets say there isn't enough data to show that it's safe for all animals a lot of traditional veterinarians would never recommend pot for pets why do you if cannabis offers a potential therapeutic route with minimal side effects then it's our duty to explore those options non-traditional healing methods from an unlikely source helping some four-legged family members get through tough times now these pet products do not have any of that thc the element of marijuana that has the psychoactive or addictive effects but medicinal cannabis of course for pets has become this big business potential and it's a multi-billion dollar pet pharmaceutical industry that continues to grow it's amazing yeah it looks like there were some

from liliana luna hi liliana and she asked me what is cbg now cbg is completely different from cbd it's basically a different compound in the cannabis plant and it is quite ideal for the medical side as well now it really is in depth have a look on the page and that will explain all the difference between the cbd and the cbg so that'd be fun right thanks a lot there keep your questions coming in and emails and we'll catch you next time see you later bye me you", "2C0w5kWbAy8": "hi guys welcome back to my channel and today we will be discussing how to choose your oil so if you are getting your oil online if you are getting your CBD oil at a store this is just kind of a guideline to go by to help you choose a product that's safe a product that it really is what it says it is and we'll just get right to it okay so this shows the whole label of the kind that I take so every oil brand see what you over and it's going to be different so I'm just showing you the one that I take because it's just easier and I have a bunch of pictures of the kind that I take because I also sell it so here is the whole label it show in the front and the back so we'll start with the full-spectrum right here so I take the full-spectrum CBD oil and this will also tell you if it's broad-spectrum I should tell you right on the very front no matter what kind it is and whether it's full-spectrum broad spectrum isolate distillate and if you don't understand what all of that means I just made a video on that and the link will be in the description of this video so you can go watch that video after you watch this video and then of course this one is peppermint peppermint it's actually what I take it's just my favorite but hemp works has a bunch of different flavors now and okay so this scannable code right here it QR code is what's called and you can take you're on your phone you can take the just put on the camera and put put it on that like you're going to take a picture of that code somewhere like code QR code I guess it is so and it'll pop up a website and so you just click on that and it'll take you straight to the co ways for that company whatever it is so I know this takes you straight to our website under the documentation and then you'll put in the once you get there you will put in the I doesn't have it on this label bit right here I guess because each one is different the lot I don't know if you'll be able to see that or not you can see it's there's typing right there but it shows a lot on the expiration date right there so I know in ours once you get there you will just put in that lot number right there and it'll bring up the all the different ones you just click on it so and it'll have the COA for that one lot whenever they made the product so we'll go more into that later so amend this is a US hemp Authority certification the seal that's showing that they're certified for quality and safety through the u.s. hemp authority so just looking for this seal on the label is a good way to know that you're getting a good oil because it's they've had to go through a bunch of testing they test your products to make sure that it is has a good quality for potency it's a it does have in the bottle what you're saying it has in the bottle and it has safe ingredients and then we'll go on Tamar that later so having the us empathy is a really good indicator that it's good product so if I were on a trip or something and I ran out of my homework CBD oil and had to go to a store just like I needed some CBD oil that's one of the first things I'd look for these two things right here the way to get the COA for that product and also the u.s. hemp Authority certificate right here okay so the other thing is this big number right here so a lot of people get confused by this and I will explain it at the end of the video all about this number and what it means so but this is the total milligrams of cannabinoids in your whole bottle so it's going to be your total it doesn't mean that every serving is going to be this many milligrams I think a lot of people think that but it's not so 750 milligrams is what's in the total bottle of this one say they come in all different ones ten works is 500 750 or 1500 so and then down here at the very bottom that shows you how many milliliters some bottles I think are 15 milliliters so 50 million milliliters is the norm okay and so over here it's kind of hard to see I don't know if you'll be able to see this a small bit until serving size under the supplement facts serving size and this has approximately 20 drops is one serving so it says 0.6 milliliters or 20 drops I go by the drops because it's just easier and then servings per container and ours all have 50 servings per container so that means if you are taking one serving size in one day this bottle is going to last you 50 days okay and that has other chef's calories fat and then right here it says hemp derived CBD amount per serving 15 milligrams not all of them have this the the labels really aren't regulated right now but hemp works I wanted to kind of be above the head of the curb kind of in put everything on here so it just makes it easier so you know whenever you're doing one whole serving one day then you're getting 15 milligrams okay alright and that has the ingredients and the ingredients are really small to you that says pressed hemp seed oil CBD rich whole hip extract and natural peppermint flavors there's only three ingredients there should only be three ingredients maybe two are natural which doesn't have a flavor is just two ingredients if you get something like this like the strawberry the strawberry has a little bit more ingredients gonna have natural flavors and I think even a little bit of sweetener I guess I could just look this is pressed hemp seed oil hemp derived full spectrum CBD natural flavors and steam yeah so does I'm sure it's got Stevie Assoc on keto or something this and still a natural flavoring all right moving right along okay so this one's kind of controversial I think the companies that do water-soluble they like to try to push water soluble but most of the CBDs that I have seen are fat soluble so it just means how the compound how the CBD cannabinoids are suspended so um hemp works and like I said most others I think are fat soluble so they're stored in oils and fats and they stay in your body and longer so a water-soluble it's expelled from the body quicker and a smaller amount are stored at one time so to me I I just think the fat soluble is smarter okay okay so this is more on the CEO a okay so like I was talking about with the scannable code it's gonna take you to the documentation the documentation is the CEO a certificate of analysis okay and that means that it's it's what the third party lab prints off to show their findings pretty much so what you want to look for on these and I will be doing a video more in-depth showing you an actual CoA and showing you the different parts of it how to read it but um I'll make this video too long if I go too much into it so what to look for on the coa is is it just CBD the molecule if so then it's just it's nice lit if it only has if it only has CBD and no other cannabinoids then you're getting an isolate okay or distillate so is it full spectrum it's gonna have it's going to list more than just the CBD and they a lot of them is very little bit that you're gonna see because there's so many cannabinoids the the hemp is high in CBD and it has like the second highest thing in it is THC which is it's got to be lower than 0.3% in most four point one person or lower so you just have to think okay if those are the two highest how much and of an actual percentage are you gonna see of the other cannabinoids and some of them are like point zero zero one five and so they're not even going to show up but that's why you want to trust with what CBD company you are using so that you know there's actually a little bit in there anyway more on that later or if it's broad-spectrum it's going to show all the cannabinoids and this the biggest thing if you have to take a drug test you want to look at the COAS especially if it's a company you don't trust it's like hemp works I trust hemp work so I would take a broad spectrum I'm not even worried about it but if it's a different company that I don't know and trust I'm going to look at their CEO ease if they don't have to see a way I'm not going to buy it and just that way you can make sure that there's zero th see in there that CoA is going to tell you that okay all right there's no not annoy there okay so another thing you will look for is if there's any hard metals and examples are LED cadmium arsenic mercury um there shouldn't be any and okay is there any bio yeast bacteria or mold mold Israel a big one if it's not dried correctly it's gonna have it's gonna have mold and it could have the other things too so if it's it's made in a facility where they're not real careful about how they do things then it could be kind of a gross product in more ways than just taste so I know him Burks doesn't show their labs anymore because their iso certified so if there's no documentation with the coa about the hard metals and the contaminants then look to see if the company is ISO certified so it is a one seven zero to five as a certification and that means you're certified to have saved products without the hard metals pesticides and contaminants so the ISO certifications just kind of covers all of that stuff if I know that's kind of confusing but I used to work in manufacturing so it makes total sense if ISO certification is hard to get and you have to go through a bunch of tests people come in and test your stuff and if you don't pass you have to do it all over again so it's a pretty big deal to actually to get the certification I know where I used to work there were times when we didn't pass and it was so stressful to not pass but it's very strict I will say that okay his different manufacturing have different is ours so okay I think you want to look into is how it is extracted this is also gonna give you an idea of how safe the product is okay so here's just some examples some real quick examples co2 co2 extract and that's the heme works brand that I take is extracted by the co2 and it's and the black is the plus and the the red is the negatives of each one so the co2 extraction is efficient it's the highest you'll get the highest concentration of CBD it's easier to adjust the concentration there's going to be no toxic residue and there's gonna be no chlorophyll cORFO kind of give it a weird weird bad taste okay so and then hydrocarbon solvent extraction is I think co2 and a hydrocarbon are the two main ones that are used for CBD extraction okay so it's efficient it's inexpensive it's you get a consistent concentration of CBD with it there's no chlorophyll but there is a potential for toxic solvent residue okay the steam distillation it's inexpensive no toxic residue no chlorophyll it's inefficient though and it is inconsistent concentration of CBD and there's a potential for heat damage when heat damage would mean that you're losing you're losing good supplements okay and the natural solvent extraction it that sounds nice it actually sounds like it would be like the best the best thing but it is efficient is is inexpensive and there's no toxic residue but there's presence of chlorophyll and that's gonna be the bad tasting CBDs is most likely then by this natural solvent extraction and it's you're gonna get a lot lower concentration of CBD okay so it's expensive but you're losing a lot of it moving right along okay so when the compound is extracted it needs to be suspended in some kind of an oil so that you can drop it into your mouth okay so here are the most commonly used carrier oils coconut oil I've seen this a tonne coconut oil coconut oil good for you got a lot of good things about it it does make it taste weird let's see if you see coconut oil and the ingredients just know it's going to taste weird hemp seed oil I feel like is the best it says can you guess which one would be the best I feel like hemp seed oil is the best because it comes from the same plant that the CBD is extracted from so I mean why wouldn't it be the best right like it comes from the same thing I'm vitamin E oil sunflower oil grape seed oil vegetable glycerin and olive oil so I mean if if you find one with coconut oil try to make sure that it only has coconut oil a lot of I've seen a lot that have my sister I see a lot of them that will have like coconut oil and grape seed oil has different oils and it's just there from what I've heard and the ones that I've tried they just taste really gross I came and tell you how many people have told me well I might see me do for my husband at the store that's new store down down the road and he won't take it he says it's disgusting well kind of sex cuz it's a lot of money wasted that's why I just I stick with hip works because I love it and I trust it so once you find one you like stick with it because it's it's hard to find a good one okay alright in quality so you want to know so I mean a lot of this you can either ask them at the store that you're getting the oil from if the staff is knowledgeable and if you're if it's online like the head works is online and you go and look at different things about the company the company is gonna tell you everything that they can to show you that it's quality product if they're very vague and don't give you a whole lot of information about how they make it without what the companies like it's probably not a very good quality product and they're hiding something if they're not telling you much so here's just some highlights on quality I do they use organic practices it's a non GMO is it from a certified FDA manufacturing lab or labs does it have the u.s. hemp Authority certificate it doesn't have to have that but it's just another thing that's going to say yes this is a quality product and does it have a money-back guarantee where's the hemp sourced from hemp works is 100% sourced in the US and not to say that there's not great hemp farms other places but ours is totally made and bottled from seed to sale here in the United States is it made in an ISO certified facility like we said earlier that's going to tell you about it's safe from contamination from hard metals lead mercury arsenic so and is there a CoA available for every product and we did talk about that earlier okay so price and quantity this is so that you can do comparison pricing so whenever you are comparing prices just make sure that you aren't comparing a 15 milliliter bottle to a 30 milliliter bottle it's like well it's they're the same price but yeah they're two different sizes so and that's really easy to mess up online whenever you're comparing two because it's hard to know exactly how big the bottle is when you're comparing online and then how many servings in a bottle so like I said the that works it is 50/50 servings in a bottle and it'll also tell you how long it lasts so if you do one serving a day it's gonna last you 50 days for you to servings a day it's gonna last you 25 days so sure and look at that and then what's the strength so when I say what's the strength it's the total number of milligrams on the front so hemp works branda has 500 milligrams 750 milligrams 1500 milligrams and I do I tell people when you're giving it to your kids start at 500 milligrams and do five drops in the morning five drops at night that's your starting point if you're an adult with minor to medium severe symptoms of different whatever and I'd start with 750 start with science five drops in the morning five drops at night and go up from there and if you have something that's really severe if you already take medical marijuana and if you've already taken CBD in the past I recommend the 1500 milligram I probably will be bumping up to it within a couple months to the 1500 milligram and then that's very slow I've been I took the 504 I think three or four months and then I've been on 750 for about two years so I'm just now going up to the 1500 milligram and it's just because the thing that I have on my scalp it comes and goes more often than any other symptom that I have and I feel like doing the 1500 probably would make it almost go away that's my hope so all right so just know just know what you're comparing compare them equally so that you know you're getting the best deal all right so this just kind of explains more about the total milligrams so okay if you want to figure how much how much you're actually getting an aged serving like I said ours tells on here it's like the 750 it tells right on here that one serving is the 15 milligrams but not every bottle is going to have this so in order to figure it yourself you're going to take the total milligrams on the front so like the 500 you do 500 and you divide it by the total number of servings and so ours are 50 servings so 55 hundred divided by the 50 servings is going to give you 10 and that's 10 milligrams per serving so that's a 500 okay to make sense I know Matt's is sometimes not really fun especially late at night okay so also how pure the formula is will determine how much you're actually receiving in each serving so I have actually looked up different brands a lot and a lot of times I will see on the COA this is one that I studied because 34 mistakes that I've been trying to get to carry my the head work CBD instead of what they're carrying and so I thought you know I'm just gonna look up their brand and see maybe it is a good brand brand I'll just leave em alone well I look there's a and some of the some of them showed from the sea always some of the COAS showed that it was actually like a 750 milligrams only had less than 700 milligrams total and so it wasn't even a 70 even have 750 on the label because it didn't have much cannabinoids in it so that was good and this one is supposed to mean broad spectrum but it only had CBD and I didn't have any so I just know from research that a lot CBD doesn't even have what they're claiming to have on their label like I said labels are not regulated right now so you have to know and try the company that you're getting the CBD from because there are so many pop-up CVD companies because they're just wanting to cash in on all the money of this new big craze I say it's crazy but it's it's not really crazy it's gonna be around forever okay so if you have any questions about this please put it in the comments and let's try to leave this up long enough to where you could maybe write it down take notes if you wanted to but so you take the total milligram divide it by how many servings it's gonna give you how many milligrams you're actually getting each serving so what says 500 milligrams you're not getting 500 milligrams every time you take it you're that's just a total it's in the whole bottle okay I hope that makes sense all right so that's all I have for today I would love a few guys would give the video a like if you got some value out of it if you like video and if you haven't subscribed yet please hit the subscribe button I do put out a new video every Monday morning and here pretty soon I will be doing at least two videos a week hopefully next week I can start that so I just get really excited about new videos that I can do I have like a whole book of ideas of videos that I can do to teach people how to find a better CBD and safe CBD that's the most important part um all right I think that's all I have for right now I will see you guys next time and be sure to check out the links in the description I have all of my other videos linked in there so if there is one of the other videos you haven't watched yet the link will be down in the description box and one more thing I keep forgetting this if you are interested in checking out the products that I use I also sell them and the link is also down in the description and if some since you here like if a store sent you to watch my videos or if somebody else that sells CBD online or whatever if they say you to me to learn more about CB please get back with them for their link or get back to the store and buy from them I am here to educate everybody in to help everybody out so I would love for you to buy from me but somebody I was sitting here and please get back with them okay all right that's really all I had this time I will see you guys next time bye", "T2cAFRAX3Gs": "but are these views right is it really true that the skunk out there can play havoc with your mind here at the Institute of Psychiatry I've agreed to take part in a unique medical trial designed to find out it's part of their ongoing research into the link between stronger cannabis and psychosis the [Music] scientists are interested in the effects of the ratio between the two main components of cannabis THC and cannabinoid so on one day I'm being injected with pure THC something like ultra high potency skunk on the other day I get a mixture of THC and cannabinoid more like the natural makeup of the cannabis plant when I get the injections I don't know what I'm getting it turns out that this one is a mixture of THC and cannabinoid after 10 minutes it hits me with the THC n-- cannabinoid no matter how hard I try to take the experiment seriously it's all seems hilarious okay something of it stops or not what does it feel like that looks very enjoyable my god it's fun I was amazing amazing but the pure THC it's a different story that's horrible it's like being at a Funeral it's sort of like um it's just so depressing you don't know him top yourself Jimmy is sort of nervous after 15 minutes I begin a series of psychological tests designed to measure whether I've become psychotic and if so how severely I feel like David you know on the th scene cannabinoid mixture I seemed really flippant on this drug I just don't care I'm experiencing profound insights bolos a word Satan my way to end it with this experience is frightening strong I feel agitated yeah I do I did it with the pure THC I'm suspicious introverted weird every question seems to have a double meaning charlie is my attentions like really interest just a word or something it's like but not another happy so you know more bit more bitter that's how I feel morbid it's an anxiety it's like I mean it's like a panic attacks you know to me it's like can you ask me a question I'm thinking I don't know the answer I'm just one of many volunteers taking part in this trial the doctors are hoping to answer some of the really important questions about cannabis and psychosis for example do people react differently to exactly the same dose of THC and can cannabinoid reduce a psychotic effect of THC it certainly made me uncontrollably giggly two hours later the effects have worn off so just how psychotic did I get the psychiatrist use a standard test which measures changes in psychotic symptoms on the FASTA you scored one for certain you have change from baseline to the peak experience was one which is insignificant above foolish thought to be clinically significant above four would be what you may expect in schizophrenic psychosis and you scored 14 on the second day so you were really quite per security then nearly they felt quite unpleasant that's cool 14 an increase of 14 points on pure THC was very high and suggest that the new breeds of skunk can play havoc with your mind but with no history of mental illness and no predisposition to schizophrenia I was at no long-term risk", "dh5AVKuMJ4c": "the Joe Rogan experience gotta get off the CBD oil man his mess around your brain man you can't be too relaxed right yeah that's CBD [ __ ] it saves vacations for me I don't stress out like it's it's it's I think it's one of the best things I've ever tried for anxiety it's it's weird and I didn't even know I had anxiety until I started taking CBD I think these little jammies these are this is uh this will [ __ ] you up though this is one in one one part CB don't put this one but yeah it does not put this in your you can put in your butt but you will get no nervous you're gonna get paranoid but it's it's a weird like the CBD THC high is a different high because CBD does something to alleviate anxiety it sort of just leaks makes you comfortable with your own demise lets you do the existential angst is the flames don't seem so hot so you like yeah we're all gonna die yeah but right now we're not dead cool look at the colors let's feel that feel the warmth the Sun but this uh this is not like funk this is not functional like you don't wanna I don't do this if I have anything super important to do but but just CBD oil hmm I just find it it did puts you in a great place okay like it but I'm journal not topical its internal yeah topical is really good for muscle aches okay it's really good really the probably the best thing I've ever found for like a alleviating soreness and stiffness and stuff like that because I found I was yeah in Europe all of a sudden discovered that they actually had ibuprofen like cream to put on ibuprofens terrible for you alright really really bad what I found out was that if you let your pets lick it they get liver failure and die so don't did you guys accidentally didn't know I had a person who works at the Humane Society I mentioned you know mentioned that I found this stuff and like I just in desperation and Europe like she had some storm muscles and uh she's like don't let your pets like that cuz they were trying to kind of figure why these kittens were dying Oh God my friend Cameron Haynes is a runner and he runs marathons and runs ultra marathons he runs he's 240-mile Moab [ __ ] ridiculous runs that last three days and he was having like all this joint pain so he's taking ibuprofen every day of st. taking 800 milligrams not just once but sometimes twice a day and he was just constant aches and pains so dr. Rhonda Patrick had been on the podcast she was talking about the dangers of ibuprofen and about what it does to your gut biome and how much it [ __ ] you up and it actually creates inflammation and actually can cause stress or it can cause strokes rather and all sorts of horrible horrible things so I call him up and I said hey man that stuff's fine to take every now and then for a headache but you can't take that [ __ ] every day you just can't do it and you're you're [ __ ] your body up just get off of it and I sent him the recording he listened to it he's like Jesus Christ I don't have a stroke so he gets off of it all his pain goes away it turned out his pain was being caused not just by the running but by the fact that he was creating inflammation by destroying his gut biome by taking 800 milligrams of ibuprofen 2 times a day so the idea of like fixing himself was [ __ ] him up crazy death chasing that yeah yeah so [ __ ] ibuprofen okay well we don't I take it every now and then but you can't take it every day so you're a liar no I mean just saying don't take it every day but if I had like a bad headache I'll take you some Tylenol or some [ __ ] it's not Tylenol right Advil yeah yeah it's it's it's just not something you're supposed to take all the time yeah I never realized it was doing what you said yes I was more achy than I should be and then like you know bad night out you didn't drink enough water right okay boom coming ahead yeah then you're fine you can still do that but CBD does that too it's better better for you than all that stuff seems to be no side effects okay all right the side effects is people think you're a hippie that's the only side effect right", "Y4WBrGxGsgM": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to be

should be coming through all right hey everybody so this is an attempt for me to start to try to connect with you guys uh a lot more than i than i have been and i hope this live stream is actually working i normally have a totally different hardware setup um for how i would do anything for youtube but it looks like my mic's coming through i'm just gonna hope and pray that it is working um so hey everybody i just wanted to get on here and just do a couple of um updates about what we're doing at curious about cannabis and yeah just share a little bit about kind of where things are headed and to let you know that in general i'm going to try to start doing live streams um beyond you may have seen previous live streams that i've done where i just play old uh podcast videos and so i'd gotten some requests to um you know sort of set up a 24-hour stream of of podcast episodes and i've done that a couple of times but um i don't have dedicated hardware to run that all the time but beyond that i'm going to try to start doing live streams where i'm just connecting with you talking to you directly as i'm able to so we'll see how it goes so first of all i want to say that um you know those of you that follow us on youtube if you don't already follow us on instagram i really recommend you connect with us on there because i do make um live streams and posts on stories and stuff a little more frequently there and i honestly share most of my news on instagram because that's where a lot of the kind of cannabis industry is is hanging out but i'm going to try to change that um to let you know a little bit of what's been going on and why there haven't been some posts in a while um i've been teaching quite a lot so our um our curious about cannabis workshop series launched just a couple of weeks ago for this year and i used to teach these workshops locally in person here in oregon for years since at least since 2015 and then of course 2020 hit and had to kind of reevaluate everything in life as so many people have and so we made a really big pivot towards virtual education events and i was very very skeptical and cynical at first but it seems like it's going well so now i'm really really excited about it because it's enabled me to connect with people all over the united states and in canada mexico all sorts of other places and to really have the chance to dive into all sorts of details that i can't get into in podcast episodes or you know kind of casual conversation and um yeah so our first cohort um is underway with that workshop series and we just had a really great um guest lecture from dr anna schwabe it did her phd uh dissertation work looking at genetic chemical and organoleptic variation among uh cannabis flower super super super interesting stuff and she was gracious enough to stay a little extra and talk with my students and myself and answer questions just really really great experience next week we've got kyle boyer coming in to talk about lab testing murphy murray is going to be coming in to give us lab tours and talk about extraction we've also got dr arno hazakamp who's um you know basically one of the first researchers to present this idea of chemovar or chemical variety he's just published tons of research on cannabis since he started studying it professionally in 2001 i believe a major name in cannabis science research but he's going to be guest lecturing in a few weeks and then we also have dr linda clumpers who's a clinical pharmacologist that'll also be coming in towards the end of the workshop and guest teaching so just tons of great guests that have been really really gracious and giving me their time and energy to help make the workshop awesome so that's all been going great if you are interested and you didn't get in on this first cohort i will be opening up the next session uh the next session's registration window is going to open next week so if you go to cacpodcast.com learn you can find information about those workshops and some of our other educational events that we have going on i think they're extremely unique compared to other stuff that's out there and i've had students tell me that you know ones that have taken a lot of the available cannabis education stuff that's currently out there they tell me that there's nothing like what i'm doing out there and that the content that we're going into goes far more in depth and one student told me today it just gets in the nitty-gritty of all of the science of all this sort of stuff and kind of shatters some maybe some preconceived notions you may have even learned in other um cannabis education uh courses and stuff like that a student told me today that he's just got uh more and more questions and i was like well that's a great sign that you're learning um so yeah those workshops have been really really fun and so they are intensive they're six weeks long each um but if you're looking for like the really intense cannabis science you know course um uh check it out curious about cannabis workshop series there's two parts it's 12 weeks series total and each workshop is six weeks we also have a beginner's workshop that is launching in april um the session first session starts on april 9th and if you or someone you know is totally new to cannabis i mean starting out at ground zero basically this workshop is made for them it runs a month long and it covers all the general basics that you could expect you know uh addressing you know just what is cannabis what are all these cannabis products what are these terms that are being used and dispensaries and stuff and how do we think about those terms how does it connect to science or doesn't connect to science in a lot of cases um and how does cannabis and other sorts of cannabis products in general how do they affect the body and are they safe those are some of the basic questions that we go through um it's only a hundred bucks like i said it runs a month um in general the way i see it is if it can save somebody from buying products that aren't actually in line with what they're looking for then they will probably save quite a bit of money that would pay for the the beginner's workshop many times over um so yeah if you know anybody or if you run a dispensary or anything like that um check this workshop out and and please send people there i'm hoping to get the cohort um built out um by the first week of april and we'll be off to the races um some other things i wanted to talk about that we have going on that i am excited about um so if you're into the crypto world then you've probably heard of nfts if you're not in the crypto world you've probably heard of nfts because people are starting to write articles about them quite a bit um nfts non-funchable tokens you know are basically digital assets um the best example to describe them would be like in a video game if you're buying uh um some sort of item in a video game uh that's essentially an nft um although up until now they haven't really been on blockchain and if you're not familiar with what blockchain is it's essentially just a really nice ledger that keeps track of the flow of information and digital goods so cryptocurrency got really really popular and operates on blockchain but uh blockchain is a lot more than cryptocurrency and nfts are really highlighting that and so some common examples of nfts there are like virtual trading cards like mlb and nba have both started producing digital trading cards um as nfts um additionally there are kind of these virtual worlds that you can join where you can buy land in these virtual worlds and develop uh virtual structures and things like people build digital art galleries for instance to showcase their art people build um uh arcades even casinos all sorts of stuff uh decentraland is the most um probably most popular example of of these kind of like metaverse systems but they utilize nfts in all sorts of ways like i mentioned they have art galleries and people post their their digital art as nfts in those systems but also nfts can be applied to things like contracts and intellectual property and i'll be really excited when people start to understand the value in that because nfts are huge for content creators and artists but they're also going to be really huge for all business i mean the the audit trail aspect of blockchain is unparalleled i mean it's just something that if you read enough about it it'll click why blockchain is not going away and how more and more we're going to see more things get on the blockchain and likely we'll see a future of the internet where you have the on-chain internet and you have an off-chain internet and the off-chain internet is sort of uh this more murky side of the internet that's doesn't have this kind of level of audit trail and everything uh more what we're used to right now and then you'll have the on-chain internet where everything is tracked and there's no way to really uh fudge things which might freak people out um regarding like anonymity but the great thing about blockchain and cryptocurrency and everything is that uh even though these audit trails exist um there's still plenty of ways to stay anonymous in using things on blockchain so when people see transaction histories they don't see your name they see this long string of random characters that represent your wallet um and the other wallets you know that things have been moved to so it can be used for anonymous you know internet uh transactions and that sort of thing um or not and so anyway if you're seeing all this hype about nfts that's kind of what it's about is it's you know showing that blockchain is way more than cryptocurrency and digital assets in general are are starting this move over uh to nfts and it's huge for content creators like myself because it gives us a little more power uh to do very interesting things with our art and um also provide a way for our fans to potentially make money um off of supporting the things they like so with all of that rambling out of the way curious about cannabis has launched our curious about cannabis canna card nfts we have well over 100 of them right now waiting to be released and as far as i'm aware we are the very first um you know company that's producing educational cannabis content in the form of nfts and we're one of the first groups that's making cannabis content all at all as nfts at least in some like systematic formalized way there are people that have made spinoff you know little nfts out of photographs and stuff here and there but you know we're putting together a pretty uh substantial system on how to use our cards and these these can of card nfts they basically look like um pokemon or magic the gathering uh trading cards in a way that's kind of how they're modeled um but they're digital some feature photographs or artwork some feature videos um so some of these cards it's almost like uh you know like in harry potter uh the trading cards that they have um you know the the wizards start talking to them and stuff well these some of these cards you know are kind of video format and kind of have that that feel to them uh where i might be explaining some concept about cannabis or whatever and then the cards themselves have educational information about whatever topic's being represented by the card on there and so these cards are you know they're collectibles uh some of these cards are only minted once so they're literally one of a kind others are minted in groups of like 25 or 50 so that's how you get your commons and your uncommons and your rares but beyond the fact that they're fun little cards that have educational information and they're collectible they're going to have very direct tangible value because we'll also be using these nfts as discounts for merchandise discounts for events and tickets to exclusive events so up until now we've had our patreon and we have a nice little community on there people that have been supporting the podcast and all of the work that we do um and we always you know give out discount codes and stuff to patrons to give them free stuff for discount stuff for instance all of our patrons got into the first uh cohort of the curious about cannabis workshop for free not everybody actually took advantage of the opportunity to take it for free only a couple people did but they had the the opportunity to do that which was an 850 value some of these can of cards uh will have values that um range anywhere from a couple of bucks to two thousand dollars or more um so if you like what curious about cannabis does what we've been doing and how we've grown and you can kind of see how we're evolving then these cards could potentially bring quite a bit of value to you if you're wanting to take a lot of our workshops we also have a ton of self-paced courses that are going to be launching next month that are you know in general is trying to give people as many ways to learn about cannabis as possible but if you're interested in gauging and engaging all of those things um then you may want to consider trying to get one of these nfts um especially some of the rare ones and you won't necessarily have to buy them um we will have opportunities like uh giveaways um plus there's a kind of a whole game associated with these can of cards that i'm i'm not going to go into completely yet because we're still rolling it all out and everything in due time but essentially there will be um challenges that you can complete some are free some not the challenges that you can complete that will give you the rights to claim uh certain nfts with higher values you know so for instance if you're wanting to take a workshop you don't have 850 bucks to spend on getting into the you know the month and a half workshop well another approach you could take is trying to complete one of these challenges that may give you access to one of the rare can of cards that you can use to get into a workshop for free that kind of thing and so you know you may spend however much uh to get through the challenge like for instance one of the challenges will be you know taking a self-paced course on the learning platform which in general would be like 15 bucks or something you know you go do that but you also get access to one of these nfts which then gives you access to other stuff so in general it's not going to be for everyone but for those that are kind of into crypto and do like what curious about cannabis is doing and you want to see more of what we're capable of next we're kind of taking things in baby steps as we kind of organically grow here but if you're you know really really interested in in these workshops and everything um keep an eye out for announcements about the nfts and and what we're going to be doing with those if you want to learn more and kind of see some of these nfts you can go to openc.io so that's o p e n s e a dot io and that's the marketplace uh that where we'll initially be launching these and if you search for can of cards are curious about cannabis can of cards because there's a couple people have tried to do some spin-off kind of can of card stuff but as far as i'm aware we're the first and we certainly have the most uh nfts that are called can of cards but you may come across one or two others that use that name but if you search for curious about cannabis you'll find us and you can see uh some of the uh cards that we've put together um and and kind of get a feel for those you should see the one with the video embedded in it there's also a couple of signed cards um i have my signature on them um all sorts of stuff on there and we're going to be collaborating with artists and photographers and stuff in the canvas space to highlight um other people's work and in general um you know going through this process we've learned a lot so we're also gonna be helping cannabis companies get their own nfts made so if that's something you're interested in if you're an artist in the space or if you are if this is all interesting to you and you want to dabble in it um you know that's something that uh you can reach out to us about and um you know depending on the situation i might be able to to give you a little assistance there or we can collaborate and get your art on a can of card and the goal with that is that we'd be uh splitting any revenue that that comes from the cards so it's not like you'll be giving me my giving me your art and then just being thrown to the wayside uh anyone that we collaborate with on these projects um you know we plan on trying to split things pretty much right down the middle uh in most cases um so if you're not wanting to take on the infrastructure of nfts and you've got cannabis related art and that sort of thing that that might be useful reach out and we'll see you know what makes sense to do um yeah with that um another thing i wanted to announce is that it you know like i said at the beginning in general i'm gonna try to do more live streams um they'll be very casual kind of like this you know i don't even have my green screen uh my chroma key stuff running so you just see my green screen behind me you know these live streams will probably take place usually right after i'm done teaching and so i usually have a lot on my mind then but um yeah so be on the lookout for these live streams one thing i would like to talk about right now is delta eight thc a big subject um that is really really getting hyped especially after i think a new york times article came out not too long ago about it but i was recently interviewed on a podcast called brave new weed and um on that episode i think it's their most recent episode you can go look it up and listen if you like um but uh and we talked all about how delta 8 thc is generally made um how i'm getting a little thing here telling me my mic's too loud sorry if i've been yelling at you didn't mean to um you know basically how delta h thc is made how what we see in labs when we're testing these products um what sort of safety issues might be involved and what consumers need to know before they consume them and some of the main takeaways so once again go look up brave new weed and listen to the whole conversation i was also stoked that um apparently raphael machula heard the episode um and and sent an email out um you know um saying that he liked it and everything i was super super excited about that um one thing i need to do in one of these live streams is i um i had a back and forth with dr mushullum last year and just asked him some questions through email and stuff i would like to interview him on the podcast at some point but he's not always in great health and so it's that can be challenging but at some point i need to read his responses on my questions i think that might be fun but in that episode some of the takeaways and i'll just take a couple of minutes here and then i'm going to jump off but delta 8 thc molecularly exactly the same as delta nine thc except that a double bond is located in a slightly different place within one of the rings of the molecule and that is exactly the same same chemical formula um same 2d structure just like i said there's a double bond in a different place and for the chemists out there if you're familiar with the carbon numbering of the thc molecule i don't even have to explain this to you but the double bond in delta 9 thc is at the nine location uh the double bond and delta eight thcs in the eight location um and this is stuff you can see very clearly in the curious about cannabis book um i don't market myself enough so those of you that may not know uh there is a curious about cannabis book yeah you can find it on amazon barnes noble cacpodcast.combook but we actually talk about in that book how uh you know how chemicals are numbered where the delta nine comes from how delta nine compares to delta eight etcetera etcetera um but delta eight is basically the same as delta nine with the exception of that location of a double bond in the molecule but that small change results in fairly big differences in how the chemicals affect the body delta 8 seems to have similar receptor targets as delta 9 with weaker affinity which um kind of fits what people commonly talk about with delta eight that it's uh not as potent as delta nine in terms of intoxication potential and that sort of thing um and there's been a fair amount of research on how delta 8 could be used um therapeutically because it was looked at for a while as being this possible alternative to delta 9 um that wouldn't get people as high but you know they could still get a lot of the potential therapeutic benefit like anti-nausea effects um possibly even anxiety relieving effects a lot of the same stuff that has been known about thc so that sounds great right you've got a molecule where you're getting a lot of the benefit of delta 9 thc you know if you're not getting as high and it's available in the hemp market so um what's not to love well the problem there are multiple problems one there's a legal issue and we'll get to that in a second um but there's also a safety issue a lot of people assume that delta eight thc is extracted from cannabis for the most part no that's that's not the case now that's not to say that people are not extracting delta athc they certainly are but let's put this into context most of the delta 8 thc products that are on the market are in the hemp market generally you know i've tested i don't know how many samples of cannabis i've tested in the lab thousands upon thousands um delta thc even in thc rich cannabis cultivars shows up in extremely trace concentrations fractions of weight percents when you start talking about cbd dominant cannabis it's orders of magnitude lower um and delta 8 thc in general is kind of an artifact of delta 9 thc because it's it's not enzymatically produced by the plant it's uh the plant produces thca that decarboxylates to thc and then um over time that double bond moves around in the molecule and you've got a little bit of delta 8 thc in there so in general if you wanted to extract if you wanted to make a delta 8 thc product just from extraction and refinement you're talking about having to process absurd amounts of biomass of hip biomass that would just cost probably millions of dollars in between the the extraction process and the refinement process and everything to get um to where you've got some nice bulk delta 8 thc and clearly based on the pricing of delta 8 thc products people are not spending that much money to make it excuse me so what's going on well the way that most delta athc is produced is uh primarily from cbd cbd is isolated out of out of hemp that cbd is put into acidic conditions um usually with acetic acid or sulfuric acid and it's kind of left in a sort of broth like that for a while and cbd will change into delta nine thc and then eventually the delta nine thc will change into delta eight thc and you know you generally um through testing and other things you you know kind of follow that trajectory and um pull the you know stop the process once you've got quite a lot of delta eight thc in there and then often that product then gets um you know solvent purged out they'll then distill it and refine it into these delta eight thc distillates and it's that term distillate i think really confuses people because when you call something at distillate it hides its origin um because you could distill uh raw cannabis extracts you could distill a synthetically derived cannabis product in this cannabinoid product in this case and it's all called distillate and i think that's kind of what's delayed people cluing in on the fact that most delta athc on the market is synthetically derived um if you want to don't want to call it synthetic it's at least semi-synthetic i mean they're taking one chemical and making another chemical and the problem with that is that you get um well the chemical synthesis process is not perfect and so you get unintended by-products and if you listen to the curious about cannabis podcast i made a really silly uh kind of promotional thing for one of the episodes uh that was kind of like a game show and it kind of poked fun at this problem that people were trying to pass off delta 8 thc is an extract and then when they go and look under the hood they see all of these weird uh peaks representing um on the on sort of the analytical graph that would be called a chromatogram they see all these mystery quote unquote mystery peaks that represent these chemical byproducts thc isomers that we don't know what they are xothc delta 10 thc whatever thc most of these things we don't have reference standards for it's very hard to solidly identify so not only is most delta 8 thc on the market being synthetically produced but depending on the producer it can be very impure and depending on the analytical lab testing it um this may not be always obvious labs vary in quality quite a lot depending on where you are and what regulations there are and stuff and so i remember back in the day when i was doing cannabis testing in oregon before there were any regulations whatsoever there were labs we were competing against that were lumping together delta 9 delta 8 cbn anything that was related to thc they'd lump it all together just call it thc same sort of thing happens with delta eight thc depending on the lab sometimes uh they'll take all of these mystery peaks and just add them all up and say yeah that's pretty much delta atc um so unless you're actually looking at the raw chromatogram that the lab produces sometimes even the producer may not know how impure their products are um so just to summarize delta a thc mostly synthetic um there's a chemical byproduct problem we don't know what these chemicals are exactly that are kind of hitching a ride and those uh byproducts can range from two or three to five percent of the final product to as much as 10 15 20 30 i've seen delta 8 uh distillates that were really only about 30 percent pure with huge isomer peaks i didn't know what they were um and you also have the fact that some producers are manipulating test results i mean if you have a pdf editor you can go through and change what a pdf says and in the hip market that you know where the uh the testing world is in some places kind of still the wild wild west um that can be more or less easier to do so there's several major problems um some of which are specific to delta eight and some of which aren't um so you have all that then you have the legal issue that i mentioned so is delta athc legal uh synthetic delta athc is as far as we can tell not legal um and this is not legal advice i'm not an attorney i don't have legal training blah blah blah disclaimers um but the dea has clarified that synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinol meaning delta 9 thc and all of its isomers the thc class of compounds of which there are at least 30 or more that we know of all of those are controlled thus illegal in a very big way um the pushback from the hemp industry is folks say well but delta hthc is naturally occurring in hemp it is it is a natural phytocannabinoid and yes that is true but these products are not hemp derived they're derived from cbd which is derived from hemp but that is not the same and there's a big difference between producing a an herbal extract and producing a synthetic chemical regardless of whether that chemical occurs in nature or not if you have synthesized it it is a synthetic chemical and there are certain safety purity issues that come along with that that i've already highlighted so that's why this is kind of a no-brainer from the fed's perspective in the united states of course it's illegal is there much enforcement on this no are people taking advantage of this kind of lag of enforcement hell yes they are to the degree that there are companies that are spraying delta 8 thc on hemp flour to produce smokable flour that will get people high this is such a short-term vision i don't understand i do understand because human nature they're always going to be those people out there that are going to do stupid things um what all i will say sort of my mantra lately on some of this because i do a lot of consulting around cannabis quality and compliance and what i will say is that a lack of enforcement is not evidence of a lack of violation so just because the dea hasn't come after you just because the fda hasn't come after you um it doesn't mean that you're not doing something wrong and it also doesn't mean that they're not going to come after you later and possibly even retroactively apply um laws later so you may think you got away with it five years from now and they can still come down on you because a lot of these delta 8 thc products are very public a lot of these companies are very public about what they're doing and trying to rely on the gray area for safety i think that's incredibly stupid to do i'm sorry if that offends you um but just coming out of i i don't like the laws around cannabis and cannabinoids as they are i would love to see cannabis descheduled completely um and just totally take care of this issue but we're stuck with things the way they are for now and right now the way the controlled substances act is set up this is the way it is this is the feds have been pretty clear on how they read the law there's not really room for interpretation here uh even though a lot of people may argue that there is i really don't think there is uh in general you've always got to read laws as conservatively as possible because that's how they're going to be applied and interpreted not as liberally as possible that's just wishful thinking um so are delta athc products legal technically on a federal level no they're not not in terms of the controlled substances act um will people continue to get away with uh selling delta eight thc products for a while probably um i don't see indication that the dea is going to take action uh immediately but who knows um and i kind of expect that they will take a couple of bold moves at some point to make a statement that will kind of help balance the market a little bit likewise with the fda our cbd products legal that's a real gray area because the food drugs and cosmetics act says you can't put drugs in food or supplements cbd is technically a drug the fda has said in some of their warning letters to companies that they you know that's how they interpret the rules and even though they are continuing to take comments and and try to figure out how they're going to regulate the cbd industry technically according to the way the law is right now um cbd products sold as supplements and foods pet food cosmetics those are all technically they technically contain drugs once again i don't like that i don't like that that's the way the law is i think that lawmakers when they were writing the latest version of the farm bill and all that they should have been a lot more careful with their language so that we didn't have to deal with this problem and now congress is kind of trying to fix it by trying to get new legislation passed that would make exceptions for cbd uh to get it recognized as a dietary supplement and a signed uh grass status generally regarded as safe but right now that's not the case um it's just there's this lack of enforcement issue but like i said lack of enforcement is not indicative of a lack of violation and the fda is very careful about indicating in every warning letter that they send that just because they don't bring up a certain issue in a warning letter doesn't mean that that company has not violated other things they haven't mentioned this is all to say you know to those of you out there wanting to get into the cannabis industry want to get into to hemp and everything just really got to be careful and recognize that things are changing a lot and there's always hype around new laws there's so much hype around the farm bill and what it's going to do for the cbd industry that was just unfounded um and you know like i said you've really got to read laws conservatively because that's how they're going to be interpreted and applied most of the time a great example of this related to the farm bill is the issue over total thc is the reference to point three percent thc is that uh delta nine thc like the farm bill you know defines it or is it total thc that it incorporates thca the way that i read the farm bill it seems unambiguously that it is certainly total thc because the law as written states that that thc value has to be reported um as a post decarboxylation value which means total thc now does it explicitly say total thc no it doesn't have to though post decarboxylation that is a scientific term meaning after the carboxylic acid functional group has been removed from the molecule okay well um how do you calculate that like if you're doing liquid chromatography where you're actually seeing thca and thc separately the way you do it it's scientific mathematical thing divide the molecular mass of thca and thc you end up with a correction uh factor you find out you know thc is uh 87.7 percent the weight of thca the difference between those molecules the only difference between them is thc does not have the carboxylic acid functional group like uh thca does so you're just accounting for the loss of weight from basically that co2 molecule popping off of thca i don't see this as controversial i don't see this open to interpretation and i think when this gets challenged in courts um that's the way it's going to be read i think it's pretty clear that if you take the literal word of the farm bill and um you know as it stands right now title vii and the language of the controlled substances act which was amended when the farm bill passed to provide allowances for him it always brings you back to this post-decarboxylation requirement which means that it doesn't matter if um your product you know uh would would pass scrutiny under 0.3 delta 9 thc you've always got to assume the thca is going to be decarboxylated and and then add those values together so the actual formula just to make it clear for anyone that's watching or listening you just take thc your thc value and then you add it to uh you know put in parentheses your thca value times 0.877 which represents that 87.7 percent molecular difference and so you correct your thca for decarboxylation then you add it to thc um there's no other way to do it i mean that's that's all it is now one uh aspect to this that um folks may argue as well what about the fact that decarboxylation is never perfect so does doesn't the correction factor of 0.877 um exaggerate the decarboxylation potential i don't know i mean sure decarboxylation rates will vary for sure is it possible to totally decarboxylate thca it depends it depends on what you're doing with it and as i just pointed out with um like the delta eight thc issue i mean people are making are getting into synthetic semi-synthetic chemistry and everything and when you're getting into that world you kind of do have to make assumptions that people are going to completely decarboxylate and take that into account and i'll also point out the usda final rules clarified this issue and even put the formula in there so it's clear that the feds are reading this the same way that i'm reading it uh at least from my perspective that's that's the way it seems to me they haven't indicated in any way that i'm off as far as you know how i'm reading those words and i'm so you i'm very accustomed to reading legislation like i said i've just worked in quality management compliance for so long uh you just get used to understanding um you know how words are being used in laws and what they mean and how you know the writer that was writing the law you know what they were uh you know trying to get across and so it makes this kind of quick and easy if you're used to it but i can understand those that like don't read laws very very commonly they may not know certain things to look for nuances to to check and everything but you know uh the reading of of the farm bill and the control substances act makes it pretty clear that 0.3 percent uh value refers to um total what we often call an industry total thc or post decarboxylated thc um it is what it is uh i do think that when the farm bill is um revised i think that the definition of thc will be changed to represent all tetrahydrocannabinols all thcs all isomers it'll close the delta eight loophole um i'm not saying i want this to happen i'm saying this is the practical outcome that i expect based on my experience and based on my scientific knowledge and and other you know industry knowledge about all this stuff i don't really see it going a different direction but we'll see but i i expect that will change the definition of thc to represent all tetrahydrocannabinols and i think they will also bump up the 0.3 limit as a compromise with the industry they'll probably say okay you want us to bump up the 0.3 limit fine we'll do it however now more things count as thc and so it's it's gonna be kind of a double-edged sword uh sort of thing but um it's really not gonna affect things too much because these compounds are in such trace quantities uh concentrations like like delta thc for instance um uh and it's possible they could even change it to cannabinols which would also include cbn but i don't i kind of don't think they're going to do that i think they'll define it just as tetrahydrocannabinols they'll raise the 0.3 limit maybe to 0.5 or maybe to 1. i kind of don't think they'll go as high as 1. i think they'll they may go to 0.5 or 0.6 i think has been advocated for um but then a lot of these regulatory gray areas will be gone i also think that the next her revision of the farm bill if legislation doesn't pass beforehand uh there'll be something in there that clarifies for the fda how to think about these compounds whether we're going to give them treat them as generally regarded as safe uh how do we interpret these things in context of the food drugs and cosmetics act and when all of that happens which will happen in the next two years i think if i have my timing right how i'm thinking about this all of this ambiguity goes away and then i think we will see a new era of enforcement uh by the dea and the fda throughout um the hemp industry and all all cannabis um markets to some degree depending on how each state's laws are set up to protect themselves um yeah i don't know i could be totally totally wrong and that would be cool if i was but um i kind of don't think i will be um so um i did a recent podcast episode on the curious about cannabis podcast with david heldruth jr which i haven't gotten on youtube yet i need to catch up it takes longer to get things processed for youtube so that's just the way it is but we talk all about these issues and kind of how to prepare for the future of cannabinoid markets in the united states particularly and some of his companies have been working with the dea and the fda for quite a while um to understand how they're interpreting things and that conversation just told me that everything that i've been deciphering from all this seems to be on point based on the messaging he's hearing from the dea and the fda um so i don't know that ramble is just basically to say hey be careful out there and don't assume that just because you're getting away with something now that you will forever and it's generally not a good idea to build a business model with such short-term thinking in mind and for consumers out there be careful about new products in general um something we talked about in the workshop uh our live classroom session today in our workshop it's about contaminants and how uh as time has gone on you know cannabis flowers killing it in regulated markets as far as um you know being very clean and everything but when you get into extracts and concentrates and products made from extracts and concentrates you just enter a different world and the safety issue is just all over the place because when you think about safety of cannabis products you're not just talking about cannabinoids and terpenes you're talking about chemical byproducts you're talking about additives diluents excipients all sorts of different issues packaging hardware are metals leaching into your extract out of your vape pen i mean there's just a lot that goes in there so i don't know this is a live stream ramble so i just hope this has been helpful um stay safe out there don't assume that just because something is cannabis derived that it's safe it might be um but we got to be careful and hold each other accountable and take care of each other and that's you know as a scientist and an educator that's what i feel my role is here i've spent the better part of this decade the past decade of my life studying canada's products in the lab and getting experience in all sorts of areas of the industry and you know sort of view it as my role now to try to pass on some of these insights things i've learned things you know that i kind of see coming and um hopefully hopefully it's helpful to some of you and hopefully it leads to better outcomes with cannabis or whatever so with all of that said um i hope you enjoyed this live stream um if you haven't already check out our website

second series of our fresh installation move videos we're going to talk about part two which is cleaning up your foot your fluid properly so we're going to describe the steps and why we're going to be doing certain things here and why it's done that way so you guys have a better understanding first of all winterization most linearizations are not done complete and they're not done correctly a lot of people don't understand how winterization occurs I'm going to give you a basic step you should follow our set of steps that'll give you a lot of success pulling a lot of this crap and will explain why you're doing this and why would another next step after first of all typically the best water efficient technique is to take say three hundred millions of raw oleoresin and mixed up with about two or three thousand milliliters of alcohol you'll then similar tap in sub-zero temperatures let it coagulate pull that out learn some the table let it warm up to about you know 23 degrees below room temperature but it will still stay roughly coagulated you've now frozen out certain things that will sort of Club and quag lift together and form their own little crystallization bottle and you can pour that out and fill that out first then you can drop a back in sub-zero temperatures and pull out some more waxes and fats and lipids and then do it one more time overnight you will have different things at different saturation levels that will coagulate and one we removed faster this will also cut down filtration time in the half normally on its own we suggest using Pyrex glass whole lot of your filter Bay pour it in there most of wax to be held back in the filter paper will run a lot faster so now that you've gotten that far well why are we going to go to the next step and use carbon so one thing to consider it is before use carbon if you think you've done a good job winterizing you most likely not you have to check it again so when your last depolarization put it back in dry ice or and sub-zero temperatures and try to filter again if anything kind of shows liquid you even want to repass the tool nothing comes out that makes Cartman more effective without that it's very very difficult so now yes why do we use carbon moving for the color and difference but what if you don't have a color resolution side by side what you will do is still have chemical compounds that are moved by carbons so let's ask ourselves why would do that first of all the most important thing to remember is your distillation bandwidth when you're fracture distilling Catalans let's take for example as a numeric value 400 X 400 chemical compounds exist in a raw oleoresin and if you throw in a machine and trying to distill it out you will have a really difficult time separating a lot of bad stuff that's there because there's multiple boiling points that are present so how do we correct that well if you were to win x very deeply and at a sink of argument let's say you remove 200 chemical compounds out of the whole bandwidth that will leave you having to distill out one 200 chemical compounds and to flush between them to find the actual spot where you can Lloyd's are while there are still other boiling ones that are present so with carbon by using carbon and other stuff like bleaching clays there's lots of different mediums that absorb water sometimes or other chemicals they will reduce the ballot even further so remember the original number we came up with si was 400 chemical compounds we reduced it down to about 200 and now by adding carbon nubert is so 100 even further sometimes so that will allow you to focus on so I will allow you to get the perfect color perfect consistency high numbers etc little very good odorless pure product so how do you do carbon properly let's start off by saying this carbon is very tricky sometimes it works and then it doesn't 90% of time it works sometimes it doesn't visually work but it works really well but it does so we'll take a product it's been winterized we'll bring it back to room temperature and we'll crank it up to 120 degrees so remember we had 300 grams as an example in two or three liters of alcohol and when we winterized say the sale argument we lost 100 grams so with 200 grams and roughly 2 litres of fluid 10% of that will be 20 grams of carbon powder so what we'll do is we'll add at 120 degrees in a medium well generally 20 grams of carbon powder then as an example if I have 20 grams of carbon powder I will take a 25% 10 percent rule and add 5 10 grams of granulated carbon usually small and medium sizes half and half that's why I'd only do now and we'll add that mixture to it so you don't take away that 20 grams you just add 5 or 10 grams on top of it and you aggressively shake it you want the molecules to pass by each other you can actually increase the temperature and have absorb more color you can use on a crock-pot that's kind of dangerous may begin the temperatures up you can have it soak up more color so right there you're using three different types of carbons to achieve a step of removing colors removing chemicals some pesticides and as it's designed to remove chemicals and pesticides and other chemicals it's not designed to entirely remove that so it's not a selling point it's just saying that carbon absorbs lobby's unwanted components well how do we pull the carbon out carbon is very very difficult to pull out we have another video showing you how to use it we have a product that will basically strip everything out including some unwanted components as well maybe left hand waxes - behind this stuff here is a silica filtering and you basically pour this in wet and you have a bed and that bed will hold back all apartment it won't allow it to come through which is also some of the dyes that are associated with some of the garments this plus a three part that we send that you out is very very effective sometimes you don't see a color reduction but you will see it in the distillation so it's an automatic carryover of quality because you've reduced the bandwidth of chemical compounds only present now I want to talk about our filter system here there's a lot of really good filters out there this is not to say that ours is the best or someone else is better it's just to say that we really want to bring you a tabletop filter that you can drop on the floor and it will put holes in the ground unlike glass that has you know flow issues with glass frit discs require massive cleaning they're not very well maintainable compared to even the porcelain ones where you get stuff that piles up on the inside can run your next batch so what we've done is we have partnered up with red eyes to create this tabletop filter which is really designed to flow as fast as humanly possible I mean there's there's nothing that we've found the market that will flow this fast the quality is reflected by who it's made by Matt Jennings really put out a phenomenal piece of steel here so we have a hawk Strom filter and we'll show you what it consists of we have a tube here we've done is we put very rugged threads Oh ring and a bass system here with a sealing ring and a plate this base right here is a substantial weight it doesn't move on the table and how these are designed to be ran would be if you zoom in here we have a single vacuum control center here which usually should we run on a cold trap going to a bottle and people will know well to get anywhere from this is 10 liter to 50 liter bottles and they simply create a vacuum system and you can attach 1020 as many as you want of these systems that are meant to be basically ran through and switched every 10 or 30 minutes based on their speeds so in this case if you look carefully what makes this very accurate very fast is a couple of things one we have a billet base so the threads are oh is true the Seelos oh is true you're not dealing with plastic you're not dealing with a glass that might crack and break on here the bad section flows into the drain section and it's going all all concerned with one piece so you're not going to have to worry about ever cleaning sections on the bottom it's basically very very durable as you can see next we have the harlot system this is an example the plate that we're using a high quality stainless steel water jet polished sample one we have patented a very aggressive filtering and very fast flowing system essentially these very tightly packed triangles will have the least of support available with the largest amount of flow unlike just putting holes somewhere which is very cheap to do this system it's not cheap to produce that high low flow with a flat plate and a very strong retention system so we really wanted to bring you something that when you buy it it's the last filter you'll buy one of these for home use will filter or gallons upon gallons per day and you'll never have a problem you put six of these in line ten of these and lying in a huge laboratory we're doing precision filtering all day long you're going to have very fast flows you're going to be saving a lot of time and a lot of money now our very unique concept with this hafstrom filter is the type of papers I need to fit in here are common so we have a very generous contract with the largest United States paper manufacturing company to produce a step one to step two and step three step one and two are chemically paper filters which are designed to sustain all kinds of your uses with different solvents the third step is a borosilicate sub micron glass paper high quality so when we put the second system together for you it will play entirely flat with a ring system seal which also self setters every time you apply this and by hand it automatically seals no tools required each one of these filters comes with 20-foot sorry each one of these tabletop filters comes with 2500 papers you get one thousand step one rough cut one thousand step two general polish and then you have the step three you get five hundred of those glass papers so if you have any questions remember that when you're filtering for cannabis distillation it's very important to have absolutely the fastest flow so when you pour something in here it stays cold as it comes out we don't want it to warm up you don't need a very large filter what you need is absolutely the fastest flowing filters the papers that we're using with our filter are about three times faster than normal papers the glass filter is about 50 times faster than normal cup of filters it's very very important that when you are filtering people will often poor product and it will sit too long they might even throw rice in it we're not really fan of that we want to say the same temperature and go through very very fast to do that is a lot better than having to repass things multiple times because it read azov is didn't stay cold so we're going to post another follow-up to this to this video on the part 2 for fascial installation and we'd like you guys to try to send us some questions because this filtration portion it's not going to have much gravity to it unless we can answer some of the questions you guys have some of the filtration techniques that we do are very advanced very high speed and very high production it's hard to address those issues if you guys don't ask us questions so the follow up will come next week but we'd like you guys to have some questions and let us know if you need any issues or have any issues and how to get this filtration done properly thank you you", "fDMsGUhRSvQ": "hope y'all it's your boy sheldon i just wanted to show you guys that i did go out and get the cbd today i went out and i got sour g i'm not going to get into too much of how it looks but this is a sour g cbd you guys can see what it says right there it's all cbd then i got uh some sour lifter cbd and this is the sour lifter um i want to mix this with my trees to see how it comes out and then i got some uh ruby kush so we're gonna run the ruby cush with it too and then the ps of resist stones i didn't even know that they had this but moon rocks and cbd that's crazy so i'm going to check this out real quick it was only ten dollars a gram um just wanted to show you guys that i did go and get some cbd and see how the cbd regimen works i'm not going to make a video on it i'm not going to do live on the cbd unless it starts having some crazy effects and i'll let you guys know about it but just wanted to show you guys that that's what i was doing and i hope you guys have a truly legendary blessed awesome day y'all stay baked", "bIB_JMhLqog": "CBD patches are incredibly and effective everybody is different so they do affect different people differently my name is Mary we haven't met before I love to make short videos helping people learn how to use CBD essential oils and Moringa based nutrition but these CBD squares go on like a band-aid and they are extremely effective for pain for anxiety really for helping people get a better night's sleep they even helped me with my hot flashes but every single person is different and how CBD affects them and their body it's unique but the main job of CBD is to help the body achieve homeostasis and the best way to find out if there can be effective for you is to triumph I have a link below in the comments for these CBD patches and if you don't like them you can get your money back there are a hundred percent guaranteed if you're wondering - if you're thinking of effectiveness and speed vaping or inhalation of CBD is the quickest to get in effect it is reaching a large surface of our lungs and the alveoli and it gets into the bloodstream almost immediately CBD oil under the tongue is quite quick is pretty quick - and then it can be effective if you can hold that CBD under your tongue for 30 to 90 seconds if you cannot and it's spilling out your livers gonna do most of the work and your digestive system with that first pass metabolism and you are not going to absorb potentially 90% of that CBD oil creams going on are effective in that immediate area but the skin is a wonderful barrier that's how it keeps us healthy and it doesn't let things into our bloodstream the definition of a transdermal square is that it's going through the skin into our bloodstream it is extremely effective is going to take probably up to about an hour for most people to start feeling the effects of the CBD so it's a little bit slower than the other routes kind of a cool thing about CBD is as you keep taking it and you're teaching your body to utilize it and make more of your own cannabinoids and doe cannabinoids then potential you have the outlook that you may need less and less CBD as you go along as I've been doing this for almost ten months now with the CBD patches I'm seeing this with customers and friends that they they're using less and less and getting the same results and how fantastic is that usually you get used to stuff and you have to keep increasing and taking more of a product this one there needing less and less so that is so fantastic if you have any questions please put them down in the comments if you liked this video please consider subscribing doesn't make videos like this every single week have a great day", "DbIvkKuEBl0": "full spectrum cbd oil when and why should you take it and what is it let me explain you and answer all of your burning questions today in this video and hopefully by the end of watching it you will really have a clear idea what full spectrum cbt oil is and why you should be choosing it and when so my name is nadia and i'm the founder of vicario cbd and i'm a holistic nutritionist specializing in cbd oils first and foremost what is the difference between full spectrum and cbd isolate it's quite self-descriptive but cannabis has over 130 different cannabinoids and by the way hemp is cannabis um it's just a type of cannabis and there's over 130 different cannabinoids cbd and thc being the two most popular and prevalent ones but there's a you know over a hundred different ones so when we talk about cbd cbd is one cannabinoid it's an extra they extract that cbd and it usually looks like powder so cbd is isolate is usually just powder versus cbd full spectrum it's exactly what it means it means it's a bunch of different cannabinoids um so cbd still being the main one 95 percent off full spectrum cbd would be cbt but there's also cannabinoids like cbdn cbg and a little bit of thc so cbd isolate would have 0.00 dhc however cbd full spectrum will have a little bit of thc it is usually a very small amount um less than 0.3 by dry weight um that is kind of like the legal um requirements but sometimes it's even less than like significantly less than that it will depend on your full spectrum cbd so uh if you're really worried about thc uh whether you are just taking cbd for the first time um like myself when i started with cbd i really didn't want to have any thc in it because i'm so afraid to get high so because i take it monday morning and i don't want to have teachers in it then go for cbd i sell it however if you don't mind a little bit of thc if you're like smoked weed a lot of times and you're like i really don't mind i'm not scared of it i'm not afraid of it um then that amount of thc isn't really significant enough to you know to get you high that being said um we still most of our oils at aquarium are cbd isolates um thea with cbd isolate being our most popular one um you can get it by following the link in the bio and using the code youtube um it has no flavor it's made with mct coconut oil and cbt isolate and that's it it has 0.0 thc so there will be nothing to worry about and most of our products still contain just cbt isolate however there are benefits to full spectrum obviously there is a whole concept of full spectrum cbd oil having an entourage effect that cvt isolate doesn't have so what is entourage effect entourage effect is when cannabinoids are working together um and so thc will help will it will make sometimes cbd stronger if it's in a right proportion so in full spectrum it is the case so um when it when we're talking about cbd qualities like anti-inflammatory or analgesic or um that it will help you sleep thc and other cannabinoids can really boost the function of the effectiveness of cbd itself so that is what a rush effect is so is full spectrum cbd oil better than cbd isolate well it really depends everybody is very different so you have to make your own decision there is no better or worse cbd isolate doesn't have thc in it so if you are worried about thc whether it's a drug test or just your own personal reasons then it's just stick to cbd isolate however if you're not worried about the liberty of thc full spectrum might be for you full spectrum because of in entourage effect can be better for pain management because um it will be stronger anti-inflammatory and stronger analgesic so whether it's arthritis whether it's headaches back ache or whatever that is cbd full spectrum can be better might be better and another one is sleeping noise insomnia cbd full spectrum cbdo can be more effective in um in case of insomnia and actually falling asleep and relaxing that being said i have had um some customers um report to me that they feel sleepier from full spectrum cbd than cbd or isolate and in that case you don't want to be taking it monday morning right um so let's say you're taking cbd oil monday morning you're taking it for stress you're taking it making sure that your energy levels are stable throughout the day um you don't have pain or sleep problems um then we i recommend sticking with cbd isolate just because thc can make you a little bit more relaxed um to compare it to just pure cbd as i'm saying all of this i just want you to keep in mind that we're all very different and we will all have a very different effect personally speaking if you ask me i will tell you that i don't feel the difference between full spectrum and isolate but that's just me some people feel huge difference and some people love full spectrum and some people love isolate so i don't think there's a right or wrong reason full spectrum is definitely gaining popularity um and we do have our full spectrum that you can also get in by following the link in the bio we ship in u.s and canada you can use the code youtube to get 10 off however i i will insist on saying that there is no better or worse just because it will depend on your lifestyle if um you feel like you're burnt out and you're really tired and you need you know three coffees to stay awake in the day um cb the full spectrum cbd oil might really like make you even more make might make you more relaxed and in that sense um it's a good thing like cbd will help you get over the adrenal fatigue and like will force you to rest so it's not a bad thing however you probably don't want that effect on monday morning and that being said if you are struggling with pain then i would go for cpg full spectrum another question i could commonly ask is whether they taste differently full spectrum versus isolate and yes they do full spectrum does have a little bit of a more like weed taste versus isolate um in a regular concentration doesn't taste like anything and if it's a high concentration it might taste a little bit better but full spectrum almost always has that tiny bit of a weed taste and smell no matter the concentration is so just keep that in mind so i hope you see how both full spectrum and isolate have a time and a place in our day i do highly recommend you trying both and seeing what which one works for you um comment below with which one worked for you better and if you see the difference and if you don't also let us know make sure to subscribe to our channel and i hope to see you in the next video", "Z6OyNB8V7Hc": "welcome to a brief introduction to the principles behind fractional distillation we're going to begin our discussion with a question based upon one of our earlier discussions which you may want to view if you haven't yet and that would be the simple distillation lecture the question we'll be asking in this particular presentation is can distillation be used to obtain liquids of greater purity than those predicted by routs Dalton's and ideal gas laws in other words can we somehow instead of achieving our atmo percent benzene purification as we did in our previous example achieve a higher purity of benzene and a distillate now you'll recall from our previous discussion that if we have a 50/50 mixture by mole of toluene and benzene and we boil that mixture on a hot plate we expect the vapor above that boiling mixture to have a composition of 80 mole percent this is based upon our calculations using routes Daltons and ideal gas laws but of course the question always comes up is it possible to get a distillate that's 99% benzene or 100% benzene and the answer to this question is yes but we have to think carefully about how we build our distillation apparatus in order to achieve this shown here is a schematic of a simple distillation apparatus like the one that we discussed in our previous lecture call what each part is and the purpose for it in this apparatus now if we build a simple still charging the boiling flask with 50 mole percent benzene and toluene we then channel the vapor into another region of the glass we're condensing it with a jacket of cold water we expect the accumulating distillate to be of a composition that is predicted by routes of Dalton's and ideal gas laws to be 80 mole percent benzene at this point I often challenge my students is it possible to create a distillate of higher purity from such a sample the most common answer that I get to this question is yes if you redistill the distillate and that is in fact true what I've got here is a schematic of a simple distillation apparatus in which I have attached the collection flask from apparatus one to yet another still had in condenser thereby making it also a boiling flask for a second round of distillation and let's start this up and see what happens as I boil my 50 mole percent benzene solution in the first boiling flask then recondense the vapor in another region of the glass where the accumulating distillate is expected to be 80 mole percent benzene by our calculations if however I heated this second flask thereby vaporizing this 80 mole percent benzene I would have to apply a new set of calculations using a new set of mole fractions and vapor pressures the consequence of this is that I would have an even higher purity distillate collecting in my second flask in the case of benzene and toluene this is a highly pure distillate of about 99 to 100 mole percent benzene it will be very very pure the reason for this can be seen in the liquid vapor composition plot to the left if I begin with a 50 mole percent liquid I expect to collect an 80 mole percent vapor now if that vapor is then condensed and re distilled I'm starting from the liquid portion of that 80 percent line meaning I get another step along the liquid vapor composition plot reaching a position on the phase diagram where it's approximately 90 with 7 mole percent benzene so I have successfully in this case achieved a higher purity distillate from my 50 mole percent started material however this is a very large apparatus and would require a great deal of time to build and a great deal of energy to run and there's actually a much easier way to accomplish the same effect the tool which we use to achieve the same effect as in the previous example is a fractional still which differs from a simple still only by the addition of something called a fractionating column the fractionating column is inserted between the boiling liquid and be still had sometimes it's packed with solid materials to provide additional surface area and we'll discuss why that's 7 Moll but for now let's just take a look at our fractional still in which we have charged the boiling flask with 50 mole percent benzene in toluene what will go on inside of that fractionating column as the vapor begins to ascend well let's watch a small aliquot of vapor move up the column and we'll see what happens recall again that we're beginning with a boiling of 50 mole percent liquid our liquid vapor composition plot predicts that the vapor which will be ascending the column should be of an 80 mole percent composition however as it ascends the column the column temperature drops and our small aliquot of mixture here is expected to condense along the walls of that fractionating column and in doing so it becomes a liquid this 80 mole percent benzene liquid will then potentially reeve aper eyes and in doing so become even more enriched just as though we had run a second distillation on it so some of the toluene will reflux back into the boiling flask whereas more the benzene achieves a second round of vaporization if we allow this vapor to condense we see that we now have a 97 mole percent mixture if our drop that were to vaporize once more we would expect to have a highly pure sample about a hundred percent pure benzene and toluene this is the principle on which a fractional distillation apparatus functions now that we've considered the behavior of just a small aliquot like a single drop of mixture within a fractionating column let's try to get a better visualization of what it really looks like what's really going on inside of that fractionating column so here again I built a fractional still and I charged the boiling flask with 50 mole percent benzene and toluene let's zoom in on that fractionating column again and see what's going on inside what you notice is going on here is that the toluene molecules due to their lower volatility are more likely to condense and fall back into the boiling flask whereas the more volatile benzene molecules have a much greater tendency to traverse the entire length of the fractionating column reaching the top this is accomplished based on multiple rounds of vaporization and condensation as the mixture moves through the column so we expect that near the boiling flask will find a region in which the composition of the material is about 80 mole percent benzene moving higher up along the column we find region where we have about 97 mole percent benzene so if we were to divert the vapor at this point into a condenser and collect it we would have a distillate of about 97 mole percent benzene looking at the top of our hypothetical column we have a situation where only benzene is reaching that position and therefore if we were to divert vapour from the top of a column to a condenser we should collect a sample which is essentially 100 mole percent benzene or absolutely pure benzene so what we're really achieving here is the same effect as multiple distillation x' but we're only running a single distillation using a fractionating column if we look back at our liquid vapor composition plot starting from a 50 mole percent mixture of the two we expect that a single distillation should yield an 80% pure distillate if we were to run a second distillation we would expect that we would have a 97 percent pure distillate and if we were to again collect that and redistill it once more we expect to have a situation where we have essentially 100% pure benzene if we were to set up a fractional still and then empirically determined that the collected distillate is 97 mole percent benzene we would report that our still is operating at two theoretical plates meaning that it is producing a distillate of similar purity to that which would be expected in two rounds of serial distillation and similarly if we have about a hundred percent pure sample of benzene in toluene we would then report our still is operating at about three theoretical plates this gives us a way to report on the efficiency and the effectiveness of a fractional still", "qowPGYjfRZM": "Green Roads CBD

the abc of cbd with the great mr oliver mammon i'm russ kane this is coming at you live uh from london it's going out all over the world and which way to hear where our special guest is coming live from it's amazing uh you're listening to men's radio station we're available on twitter you can watch us on our youtube channel we're on facebook at the only place we aren't is on perseverance on the mars rover but apart from that i think we're just about absolutely everywhere uh before ollie kicks off i just wanted to say a huge thank you um for all the wonderful comments that we get from all over the world about this show i really appreciate it i never dreamed it would be so popular and it's all down to ollie i'm just the passenger here learning probably along along with you guys um this is week 21 22 22 20 week 22 and they said it wouldn't last so i'm hugely excited thank you as ever let's go over to the cbd guru the mix master extraordinaire and i call it that a mixologist that's because i like cocktails olly mammon hey how you doing uh thank you for everyone who's tuned in over the last 22 weeks uh we have an awesome episode for you guys here today or at least i hope it will be awesome uh i think it will be awesome uh the over the last three four weeks we've discussed uh farming in in the uk and europe and you know producing a cbd extract and farming hemp and the laws around there and we met uh george from george botanicals from uh sativa wellness group who told us all about uh you know his processes and what he's doing with farming in europe and trying to bring a x-ray to the uk and how it's how there are still laws which make it very difficult unless you're gmp compliant however there's still a lot of cbd products on the market and most of our extracts are sourced from america so today that's what we've done uh before i dive head first into the episode because i can literally i could do that let's just get a quick word from our sponsor then i'll give my introduction and then we'll go from there i'm sure you've heard before that good quality cbd needs to be really really expensive this is the new view of cbt a product created by users for users a

it really is an affordable and accurate and reliable product and you know you should give it a go because you know if you're thinking about trying cbd it's uh the house blend so you know i'm gonna say that i was just about to mention uh one of our listeners eve phantom crazy name gracie gal and eve i know that went on fr to the tincture club and she bought some bath bombs from you guys and absolutely loves them chrissy holt over in spain was having problems sleeping she um you know she said what should i do i said talk to wally get some stuff see how it goes sleeping like a baby now so thank and thank you for you for joining us that's absolutely wonderful i'll leave back to you but it's ju it's not just words you know these these products really are that good the quality is that excellent and as always says use the qr it's a qr code look at that yeah i'm going down with the kids just scanning yeah scan it and you get tempo you mentioned men's radio 10 get 10 percent off yeah off to the races okay so yeah like i'm saying over the few weeks we've discussed growing hemp and manufacturing cannabinoid extracts in the uk and how it's a very controlled limited market you can't you know jamie barley was telling us that you can grow hemp here but you can't actually extract anything from it so what a lot of people do in europe is they'll grow their hemp in europe and ship off to america or ship off to a country where extraction is legal uh the the guest we have today a guy called chris stubbs he comes from he comes from kentucky uh his company is called gen kanna over the last seven eight years uh jen kenner has been a very stable supplier of of extracts of the uk now let me tell you a little story seven years ago five six seven years ago six years ago i went to america i went to go visit my brother my brother was living in l.a at the time and when i went out to l.a i was in my buddy's shop and he comes up he goes check out these products someone's just giving me bro brian puts a lip balm in front of me and i remember i'm looking at this lip balm and i just basically saw something i saw a different application for cannabinoids and i'd seen previously i've seen something which has almost multi-purpose use it could be used for different things it kind of got my brain working uh over the course of that trip i met uh a few people you know and my eyes kind of got open to the world of cbd and you know like understanding it a bit more of course i'd heard about it but i mean just understanding it more when i got back from america i reached out to my brother i was like look i need to get my hands on some of that you know i reckon i could make those products you know i reckon i can make something similar or better i can't seem to find anything you know the biggest issue six five six years ago was finding a product that actually worked for me it was finding something which was reliable and accurate and consistent and i couldn't find that still to this day a lot of people are having trouble finding it i just have myself which makes my life a hell of a lot easier now the first extracts i ever used were made by my guest today now this is all just kind of like this was this all came out in our little conversation you know like our pre-show conversation you know you've been at the company for when did you start what were you doing blah blah blah you know like because you know companies have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of employees you know sometimes it's you know sometimes you just get someone you don't get the right one and it's it's pretty awesome that you know chris has been you know chris is a real scientist you know he's been involved in this industry for like 20 years but he's been with john kennedy for like six seven and like i said my original products the first products i ever designed the first capsules the first tinctures the first body oils bath bombs lotions creams i ever made were using an extract that chris made and i don't know there's something quite romantic there you know like i'll be honest with you it's made me a little bit more nervous for the show i don't know what it is it's just made it a little bit more i think synergies like this kind of i'll tell you what it is he's american and if you piss him off he'll invade your house that's mean don't be rude that is right that is a fact i am the one who makes inappropriate comments you're not allowed to you you're the balancer you're supposed to hold this down man i just wondered why you were nervous he seems like we were chatting before the show he seems just an absolutely lovely not nervous in that way but it's kind of like it brings back a whole bunch of memories it's like you know i'm sitting on a show now seven years down the line i'm about to have a guest who is the guy who made the extracts that i first started this journey on with there's something quite romantic there you know there's it's like a beautiful synergy that's what it is it's beautiful synergy so let me carry on my introduction anyway before i start my little tangent so basically chris stubbs uh over the last seven years has basically helped genkena uh create this reliable consistent extract which has given them the formidable market position which they have in the uk and it which has given manufacturers like myself the ability to provide end users like yourselves the products which you are so reliant on now the products that you find to be consistent and reliable and the ones which you know will work for you week on and week out they usually have a backbone which is stronger than the manufacturer you know like with with me i've got companies like jen kenner behind me and you know who supply me the extract which enabled me to supply you the products which are great and there's this this pyramid you know what i mean like in the foundation of every incredible product out there is a farm the role of every farm in this marketplace the role of every farm out there producing cannabinoids is to produce a reliable consistent cannabinoid okay it's not it's all well and good just growing hemp and creating an extract but you need to be able to create the same extract over and over and over again so your customers can provide the same products that their end users over and over and over again so chris like i said has been doing this for a very long time he's responsible for billions and billions of milligrams of cbd you know like hundreds and hundreds of thousands of kilos which have you know which which the world has consumed chris is responsible for the manufacture of those and you know like it's just it it's an incredible role it's an incredible incredible wow sorry um it it's an incredible thing when you think about it that you know you have only a few of these companies as a manufacturer i can tell you there are only few farms who are operating on this level and there are only a few farms who can provide this consistency and you know there aren't that many that there aren't that many suppliers of of this sort of extract and you know with pending novel food and you know potential reclassification about cannabinoids and a general unsteady uncertain unreliable market anyway it's nice to know that you've got something which is reliable amidst all of this chaos you could say and it's nice to know you've got someone you know something which you as end users and me as a manufacturer can rely on in a market that is so fragile and so ever-changing and you know and a market which faces so many hurdles that you know it's it's actually crazy how many people come and go from this industry and you know how much inconsistency there is so you know like like the the topic of today is is bringing a consistent compliant product extract to the uk market and let's bring out chris dubs and it's not what i'd like to do ollie because i've been in this game since 1984 and i've never been able to say this live from kentucky never been able to say that before nice one rat thank you sorry about that chris i think i think olly got a bit over him i got emotional there chris it's like there are stories coming up you know because i think you've seen uh i'm not going to do psych on you but i think you saw how far you've gone from just having a notion to where you are now which i think is just a fabulous thing it's been a long time that's another that's another story for a different thing what i love you is you're around the corner chris stubbs is in is is in kentucky and he looks like the picture's fantastically clear you see that's american know-how for you every every time every one of the houses no devices for this hour clear as day it is clear it's fantastic it's as clear as the as the as the mars picture gotta love that what a feat of genius that is anyway ollie back to you so chris welcome to the show sorry for my over emotional introduction i really do apologize it's just sometimes things get me okay and i think that was just one of those moments uh thank you very much for joining us and uh you know like thank you very much for supplying us with extract and i'm just gonna fire questions at you because i feel like your brain is something they need to hear so let's just start always my first question how did you get involved in this industry um it's a loaded question ollie but uh really comes from the pursuit of science is is number one top of mind right i started as a scientist or at least the realization i wanted to pursue science really really young and somehow cannabis over my upbringing kept coming into my life mostly through family believe it or not so it started in a very helpful and healthful place and as i as i grew up went through high school went into university i discovered this thing called the endocannabinoid system and how that really was the answer behind why and how this plant works so well for so many of us so i dove in in college had a great mentor that studied the endocannabinoid system allowed me to do um you know pre-clinical uh testing work with cannabinoids and the ecs the endocannabinoid system um and found myself at the end of university being very well positioned to enter the emerging legal medical and recreational cannabis space and it's just it's been an incredible journey the pursuit of science coupled with the ability to help people with a natural product has kept me invigorated and will for the rest of my life i mean this is what i want to do what i've been privileged and humbled to do and my time here at gen canada has taken it from you know a small lab scale to true agronomic and industrial scale and along the way we've attempted to make it as normal as possible to your point about the lip balm i didn't really envision that years ago although in the early days of colorado legalization we saw slurpees cotton candy you know cannabis infused into everything um so i knew that was possible the the global acceptance and consumer packaged goods can cannabinoids have a place and so um my time here has been dedicated to normalization of cbd and hemp derived cannabinoids by positioning the firm our processes our people our products against existing regulatory frameworks to say look we can follow the rules just like anybody else you make soap you make sugar you make vitamin c we make cbd and it's all written down it's all transparent i think that's part of the mystery right the the consumer does not have a understanding of the black boxes between the farm and what they are actually using and we have sought to make that a transparent and respectable process and i think we've done really well for like you said billions of milligrams um have made it to people's homes and to their mouths and to their bodies safely and that that was the primary goal you cannot do this work in a predictable and sustainable fashion without starting at the farm and understanding the end um with it which is consumption when you started growing in kentucky had they just opened up kentucky or were there already farms that were growing there so we knew from my time in colorado and some very humbling and special experiences with children with pediatric epilepsy that uh there was a true unmet need and a true um demand that had just started to be realized and we knew that we had to get outside we knew we had to farm because it's just a scale issue right we can't be trapped in warehouses retrofit to grow cannabis and and grow hundreds of thousands of kilos of product just doesn't work and so we looked for jurisdictions that had either existing laws on the books or well poised to make that leap and when the farm bill passed in 2014 which allowed state departments of agriculture and universities to start to research industrial hemp kentucky was top of mind they had a law in the books that said as soon as the feds passed this law we're ready to go and the department of agriculture said come let's grow a new crop together and figure it out plant plants first ask questions later so that's that's pretty cool so basically you were almost ground breakers in in kentucky as well it wasn't even like that because that's the issue in the uk the issue in the uk is that there's so much uncertainty so you said you know like basically check the black boxes all right at least you have black boxes to check you know you have these you you have these boxes they might be a pain in the ass and there might be a thousand subcategories underneath it but unfortunately in the uk and in europe as you know we were discussing earlier in the week and we've discussed over the last five six weeks with you know with jamie and with uh with uh quentin from spectrums and with uh with george with with all these different farmers with alex last week you know we've i like that the boxes aren't there the framework is okay so you almost have like you always have like the page saying checklist but there's nothing on the checklist here that doesn't mean there's nothing on the checklist it means there's nothing there yet well and we encourage to help make that checklist you know either ourselves or through lobbying efforts you know we've brought regulators and enforcement officials to our facilities time and time again and say look this is how we do this there's no secrets here um i've hosted large delegations from the usda fbi the dea the sheriff's department the cops the judges the clerks i mean and it's it's nerve-wracking from time to time because these are the people that have been on the other side of the coin they want nothing more than what everyone wants which is to help each other be healthful and frankly when they have those experiences with cannabis generally medical rec hemp derived you know i'm going to blur some lines here although our business is very focused on what is federally legal and compliant here in the states and worldwide um when people have that experience it changes their minds and it changes their lives and what do they do they seek that solution over time and i thought you know what better way than to get outside and do this at scale and build refinement facilities and formulations facilities and testing facilities that validated all of that work and allowed us to change people's lives uh so and our italian friends right they've got the ecs too so so so kentucky uh in kentucky when when you kind of brought this you know like we started growing i assume you almost you know created jobs created an infrastructure i assume that these farms you didn't go and cut down a whole bunch of tomato fields and start growing hemp i assumed the farms were you know unused agricultural land and you almost brought a purpose back to you know back to an area which was more purposeless before not saying kentucky's purpose plus it has the best bourbon in the world if it ain't from kentucky you can't call it bourbon there are enough things of you know i i like kentucky okay you know what i mean i i i'm a big fan i don't mean that in a negative way just talking about like in terms of boosting economies i assume you guys did that right well let's give farmers a purpose there's risk in this now what is that's that's russ come on that's tennessee we're from london so we assume that like saying kentucky and tennessee is like croydon and peckham you could get there in 10 minutes it's probably 8 billion miles away i know there's only one color of blue here i'll tell you that much what does that mean there's one that's a good one what does that mean wildcats so years ago uh they're absolutely here we are fanatics for the kentucky wildcats and and that's a certain shade is that baseball roller derby roller derby yes yeah roll is definitely roller derby i i saw a documentary on this the some fans are going to come set fire to my house this is not good like the wildcats like of london they're going to come kill me i love you wild cats go cats it's good it's just there's there's definitely ride just like with football like there are lines here that you don't cross and i i showed up i showed up to a meeting with a uh more of a north carolina blue on not a deep kentucky wildcat 41 and i got some looks i got some i'm joking i'll tell you what chris when you come in lessons you have to come to the uk when you next come to the uk and we'll all hook up you can come to near where i am and there's a charming and elegant football club called millwall millwall and what are you doing i'll take you into the local pub chris nice to meet the porters and you're gonna go come on arsenal and then i'm gonna run we're gonna teach you a song we're gonna teach a song it's called forever blowing bubbles okay and you're going to walk into millwall singing i'm forever blowing bubbles pretty bubbles in the air we fly so high they reach the sky no seriously how long do you think yeah i was gonna say i'm nerd strong there's a difference between farm strong and listen all credit due to the team right this is not this is not just a me thing this is an incredible effort that takes a lot of uh a lot of time countless hours i mean you spoke with one of my colleagues the other day and we're going to bring this guy on this guy's called chris macaluso is that right that i pronounced that right macaluso that's right yeah chris macalester he is an incredible green-blooded farmer we're going to bring them on in a few weeks time uh i basically i i chat with them together i was like we need to split this there's there's too much going on uh but yeah so so chris will be here in a few weeks time and he really is just like his brain is just like whoa it's like a you know like a 20 like a magical botanist he's like a botany wizard you know like gandalf the botanist you know brands together and you've got gen canna and you've got a global supply of cannabinoids i mean it's it's been a very humbling experience and to your question um we we we didn't do this all ourselves right there was a clear unmet need and still is in farming we just so happen to be oversupplied at the moment but tobacco farms here there's people for generations that have been struggling and looking for new crops and they still are hemp is not the only answer but it's certainly a viable one over time and and we're in this very volatile period where demand and supply and regulations and and global compliance is is still maturing and so what we did was say look you guys know your farm's the best we know cannabis really well why don't we put two and two together and help each other successfully grow this crop so that when we extract it and we refine it and we formulate with it and we come ask for accreditation of our facilities and our farms it's the same it's the same next quarter it's the same next crop year right how is procter gamble going to say sure i'll put this in my product if it's you know different different different so we've been able to normalize that what the farmers here in kentucky we have previously monitored the certified farming network we've been just an amazing group of folks that um have been able to bring this to life and it has allowed us to move downstream and get this into places like the uk by engineering compliance from the very start let's rewind a little bit all right ask your question and then i'm going to i'm a real outsider to this because you know all i've just been a passenger when i first was introduced to ollie and i thought okay i know nothing about this subject so the last 22 weeks have been dazzling for me now he's an active cbd user absolutely his doggy and so his doggy as well exactly proper family cbd family i love it the point i was going to make uh chris is the way that i understand this idea of consistency and this may seem silly but it will make sense is that my guilty pleasure are cuban cigars from havana i know in america that's a problem but not in not over here in london and if you don't get that consistency of the leaf if you don't get that consistency of the tobacco from the great tobacco growers of the havana cigar industry you know it causes a huge furore and you know the word gets out don't have xyz companies this year because it's just it's not good so i totally understand what you're i totally understand what you're getting if it doesn't sound sound too tangential it's it's it's thanks it's um it's really there's a has to be an understanding of one the scale that you're operating at how you validate each part of that process and where your levers are right you might have something that goes wrong in the field you might have something that doesn't quite meet um you know to the nines but we have ways of pulling levers and ensuring that hey you know the output remains the same once again and that's particularly true with purified compounds but you know standardizing extracts is very possible too so that we we maintain that level playing field and that's that's where i think i think olly would agree with me there are certain companies and people that do parts of this really really well and we've had to refocus our own efforts to do parts of it really really well um it's rare to find a much more holistic approach where everything's done really really well wherever you do it um but i and our team are not the kind of people that say we've done it it's all over right this is still maturing and the pursuit of science and the scientific method is knowledge and truth and a lot more to learn brothers a lot more let me just say uh we have a very interactive show here chris so michael adair is saying lord science when he saw him so that's cool uh luke francis shout out to chris and our friends across the pond thank you all which is lovely now a regular to men's radio and this this is the sort of effect that you guys are having this is a chat called barry j allen not the flash but we always call him the flash and when he's on the other show when he's on the daily show we always play the theme tune from flash by queen um anyway here's a question now i've replied but i'd like you're the expert so i'm just the passenger barry allen says here here's a question three years ago i had a brain tumor removed i've still got a bit of it left presuming that's the tumor not your brain now and barry and it's being watched but ever since my sleep is terrible would this help sorry to disturb you you're not disturbing ever no comments are ever disturbing we love having your comments i've written back and said yeah i'm sure it would but i'd like to hear it from an expert like you know i'm just a punter so chris so i i'm gonna have to be a little ambiguous here and i apologize for that because with my position and what we do in the regulatory environment that we're subject to here and even there as manufacturers i can't make a claim on the product right fair enough can't market it in this way but i will say something all i can say no i i was going to finish your point and then like like i'll talk to the dudes i think that the short answer is most definitely probably you know you can't figure it out for yourself until you have a product you can rely on and that's the key with oliver's approach that's the key with our just saying yeah here's a product that could potentially help you now we're gonna give you some guidance on how to figure that out because frankly some folks are sensitive to cbd like they are to caffeine and they have to figure you know taking it no past eight o'clock in the morning or it's going to mess up my circadian rhythm um others like me i can drink espresso and go to sleep i don't know what it's a weird deal right um i have to and this is what we did is that not normal like espresso and then bed i thought everyone does that it's like a standard right double espresso go to sleep a lot of people that don't do that i don't know what it is cappuccino before bed is like a normal right i begin to see why we like we get on on this show there we go there we are so listen let me let me take this okay yeah i would always say why are you not sleeping because if you're not sleeping because of immense amounts of pain that's one thing if you're not sleeping because of stress that's another thing if you're not sleep because of anxiety it's something else if you're not sleeping because you don't want to sleep because you've got a fear of sleeping that's another thing completely and if you're not sleeping because your bed's uncomfortable that's also something else now it's all about understanding what the reasons are now i don't mean to sound like it sounds rude it's the same conversation i had with russ i was like if you are if you have issues related to anxiety over thought over like over stress there are there there are studies there are there are hundreds of thousands of people who have used cbd for anxiety based reasons i can't tell you that the product will work but i'm saying the chances are it will because everyone seems to use cbd for anxiety seems to get a benefit the issue is is that you've mentioned tumor and because you mentioned tumor it's got me thinking that i don't want you thinking that i can say cbd will be able to cure your tumor do you understand what i mean i don't want to say that okay and and and if you're not sleeping because of something the tumor is doing to your brain i also don't know if cbd will help with that i really don't know i know that it would like for me when i'm anxious cbd helps me sleep i use other ingredients on top of it i'll use terpenes and i'll use like a lavender or a lilanol and i'll use some form of chamomile or something like that in order to give it a bit more of a softness add it to my double expresso sleep like a baby you know what i mean but it's um like i'm saying that's concentration if you want to send me an email man i very happily chat with you and to be honest with you i'll send you a bottle for free just to mess around i'll make you something like i made russ it's it's fun for me and then if it works we know the answer to your question until like you try it and you let me know you're the only one who can really answer your question i can just facilitate that answer in the most affordable way possible do you understand what i mean that's probably the best way of doing it not get you wouldn't get this on any i'm serious and i'm not giving myself a hernia by patting myself on the back but you wouldn't get this sort of level of care on any other radio station you wouldn't you know barry has been really loyal to us and ollie that's a really lovely thing to do that's the easiest way but like i said to you you just said to me you're not hurt look like i'm saying i just gave your dog something for for something he's got i've got no idea if it's going to help him or not but the only way we're ever going to find out if this compound helps that issue is if we try that compound on that issue it's something like a puppy she's dwelling i want to rewind this is very important because i want to discuss it so i don't know i'm going to let chris tell this story okay and i'm going to let him tell him whichever detail he wants but he touched upon this when you were living in colorado you you you you you formulated products for for and you helped people who were who were not well right yes yeah do you want to talk about that i i can absolutely because it's it's it's all about the understanding you know like it's like i said this like like i always ask this question like why do you do what you do you know i ask you what your driving force is but i mean like why do you do what you do i do what i do because i found that cbd really helped me me as a person with my twitches with my tourette's with my general oliverness it i found it really helped me okay and i found that cbd has helped other people and i like understanding how a cbd product can help you with other ingredients which are added to it in order to give you the desired effect i like creating products for the purpose that's why i'm here why are you here do you understand i i think people need to know that yeah very similar and i think when you couple that with the pursuit of science truth knowledge and and you're able to play with plants play with equipment to play with testing and analytics and see that impact in humans and animals your cup stays full as i say right and that's a really nice feeling um so yeah back back in colorado this is in the medical cannabis you know days right when this this whole thing first started i was asked to build a laboratory um to test the amount of cannabinoids in the plants and the extracts in the finished goods and at that time the understanding of these molecules and their chemical and physical properties was abysmal and so you had folks you know fighting the oil and water problem which we still fight today there are oils i want to put them in waters it doesn't mix it sticks to the container it's just a mess right so i got to experience the birth of an industry and the birth of brands and the birth of product types that you've referenced and now do extremely well ollie i mean it's um it had to start in that place with us knowing what was in the product um so this goes on for a few years and i'm able to help a lot of people as as a scientist by saying uh this grower is real this extract is real it's going to be here tomorrow you know what i mean if you find a solution for someone and then it's not a solution tomorrow that's an issue so this is a theme right sustainability sustainability um so years on i meet a group of growers um a group of brothers um the brothers stanley who brought in a bunch of cannabis strains some of which tested very high in cbd and very low in thc and around this same time a couple weeks prior i had met um a very young girl named charlotte who is the um the poster child for cbd she was the girl who started it all she was like the the first media campaign who brought cbd as a as a as an anti-epileptic compound you know that she was like she is the the the educational platform which a lot of our world has been built on you know kids like to kids like tanin's daughter it wouldn't surprise me if tanin only knows about this because of charlotte you know like it's it's sorry sorry for interrupting that that's that that's right i mean her story sparked the demand and the curiosity um canada's helped me you know um so long story short i i spent a considerable amount of time with her and her parents one afternoon discussing cbd and whether it was an option um where they could find it how they could test it was it going to be psychoactive or toxic or interfere with the other drugs she was on and the answer is very similar to the previous answer with with the sleeplessness there's only one way to find out so let's help you find out so i you know having tested the the brother strains and worked them through the process of how to extract and how to refine and test the extracts and normalize everything um i made her first thankful um and a few weeks later we started to see results and a few weeks after that the message started to grow and months after that i was on a podcast just like this talking about it with the brothers and and then cnn publicizes it and there's now tens of thousands of people on a waiting list trying to get access to this product dr sanjay gupta did that like that special i think it's got something like 63 million views on youtube or something and saying like that you know most people who aren't who most people who know anything about cbd know about the story of charlotte and charlotte's web you know it's like that story it's it's it's chris did the formulation this dude's the man like he's the absolute man do you understand like it's hence my emotion at the start this like you can't think of this dude you can't be in this industry and not think of mr dude right here and and not get a little bit emotional yeah i mean it's incredible great and it's and yeah i cannot take you know again it's a team effort again there was an unmet need again you know it's it's i was at ground zero and did so much of this testing work to call bs and say what's real and help people find their solutions and iterating on this same thing over and over again and then saying you know what let's take this outside let's go big um that will there will never be another waiting list again you know that was the inspiration and i don't know brothers it's it's been a very humbling experience and the you know every business has its challenges every individual has their challenges um i mean you all you've talked about regulatory that's extremely challenging but we've now seen acceptance of this product of this molecule and all its other friend friendly molecules um just grow and grow over time and it's it's uh it's it's very humbling work and we call it stewardship we have to be good stewards of this work um because all all eyes are on us right there are people that want us to fail uh from for a number of reasons i mean we've had our own business struggle most people who are your competitors what you like your colleagues want you to fail let alone your like the people outside the industry i mean it's one of the hardest industries to circumnavigate i mean you've got you've got cutthroats and villains within you've got cut fruits and villains on the outside you've got the law you've got when you're when you're afraid of the law you're afraid of your competitors i mean look i've been in the industry for five years now five six years okay five years properly you know and over the last five years the amount of different law changes which i have just seen happen so i mean there was a three-year period between 2018 and 2021 where isolate was banned in foods it wasn't but that was like the law in the uk if you if you're caught using isolating food you know your brain's gonna get shut down it wasn't a law but that was one of the laws during and now they've come out and actually if you're using a full spectrum the chances are it contains thc the chance or it's illegal it's actually you know to be honest with you i don't think you're going to be able to get through novel food with that so all the laws have now then spun on its head and now imagine what that does for business you create a product people get used to it then you have to change it out of fear that you're actually doing something wrong and your clients are breaking the laws then you change it you go through that whole process of hey guys i had to change the product for your protection for my protection blah blah blah they don't like the product you lose all your clients you get a whole bunch of new clients okay and then what happens is you found out you never had to change in the first place but that was just that's the these are the laws that get thrown at you you know that's a really interesting point i i think because we had this debate years ago at gen canada was it full spec was it isolate does the entourage effect which is the combination of multiple cannabinoids and terpenes working together you know is that better than isolate in my case was guess what we can do both and we can do it in a bunch of different formats because guess what everything has its purpose exactly and there are people in this world that can't have any thc in their bloodstream and there are people that can swim in it so let's build a you like that one rust yeah send me a swimming pool show me this one i'll dive heads mostly it's so we thought build a foundation you know build a platform what we call a ginkana production platform to be flexible to be predictable to be able to change as laws change and now with our interaction with with our friends across the pond you know there's there's different levels what we call you know thc free or broad spectrum here you guys have a very it's a hard number and they're trying to launch point naught two but now it's going down to one milligram a container now one milligram of container they're not specified container it's like if someone asks you for a bucket of cake you're like sorry what's the bucket of cake like how do you how do you contemplate a figure of an uh how can you contemplate a a weight or a measure without being given a weight or a measure so it's like saying how much how much does how much does a bucket of bricks weigh so sorry what you know like apparently i found out something new last week cbd as an edible is fully illegal in europe apparently i've already found out from some people and apparently illegal has to be synthesized i heard it from one person but apparently it's facts and he showed me a document which looked pretty real so now i'm sitting there like oh my god like a whole bunch of there go the laws you know like chris i'd like i'd like to ask a couple of questions if i may we're firmly wearing my punters hat as we say number one um you've alluded to your company and everything like this i know ollie's clearly in awe of it which sounds great because if he is impressed i'm impressed how many how many people have you got i mean how many people are involved in the organization uh we're around 50 at the moment um that's good as about six times that and which just speaks to the volatility of the industry it's extremely unpredictable we all have risk i've lost my ass a couple times um but here i mean there's there's nothing better than being able to passionately do what you want to do there are days when i sit down at the end of the day with a very tall glass of bourbon and say and there are other days where i'm just like oh this was great so uh this is called life right russ it's yeah it is it is by the way i've got to come back to the bourbon thing i was at a meeting which was a sort of social thing i'm sitting next to this guy and he's coming from america it was mr beam as in jim beamy was the last of the he was the last lady one of the last in the family was a charming guy yeah charming guy did he speak another beautiful southern accent he was he was delightful um and and and like yourself chris incredibly from those albums done all this and just incredibly modest and you know low-key about americans are the best when you find the good americans i mean they're just awesome you know like the sets i can agree my daughter is american so there we go now um another question i've got for you one of the things which has stunned me and it's been my education that ollie has taken me through metaphorically holding my hand and i just want to ask you this chris i have been amazed that when you've got especially children babies little kids and then we had someone who was 81 and clearly the cbd is improving their quality of life there's no ifs or buts it is okay and yet there's this huge resistance to letting them just you know they're not selling it right also called philip philip was using a a full a full cannabis okay so cbd is fully legal but but the the epileptic kids that they're using a a majority cbd blend i mean it has negligible amounts of thc in it and they are still you know the hoops they've got to jump through to get that cbd product at the same time i just want to thought i'd correct you but carry on russell you're quite no you're quite right and thank you for that because we do want to be legal about it but my question to you is this chris um in um in america is there still this sort of pushback from no no you've got to have you know big pharma you've got to have the pharmaceuticals we don't we don't recognize this as being helpful so it changes every day and it's changed greatly over time and i've i frankly have been flabbergasted i myself have testified you know in in state senates and houses and rule making committees where you know the law is about to change there's a proposal in front to regulate the industry and this particular example is in medical cannabis but i it floored me russ because you have the chief of police association there to lobby against the bill and i'm there to say look we can practically figure this out together and by the way you guys already decriminalized the possession of an ounce or less so running a red light is more egregious than having an ounce of weed and now you're gonna you're gonna tell us that we can't you know meaningfully produce something after the hearing the head of the chief of police association comes up and says so my dad's pretty sick and i'm wondering you can get me stuff this is what we're here to discuss man so times are a changing and the fda here um has not made up their mind quite yet on what the definitions should be but they are actively regulating the industry our state department of health and our state regulators have been extremely excited about yet responsible with how they regulate us and the fda i think is is is looking to um novel foods as a very interesting way of doing this right their concerns are about safety of the products and my argument to this is look if we can demonstrate some safety and we can demonstrate that and produce these products in accordance with what we call good manufacturing practices which exist for foods another set exists for supplements and another set even more stringent exists for pharmaceutical production so if we know how the product is grown and produced and it's very well documented and controlled then you've got the answer right you can say it's safe safely produced and uh resoundingly similar batch to batch a lot to lot you have mechanisms to recall a product if you had to what i'm saying is we normalize this just like everything else people take vitamin c supplement what's the big deal you know this should be no different and so we have invested very heavily in toxicology work and stability work to show that these products are safe and that there's no arsenic or lead or residual solvents or microbiology concerns with the ingredient that ollie might use to formulate and with the finished goods that ollie formulates as an example we have to tap we spend more damn money on testing than you would believe do you spend more money the amount of money we spent on tesla on testing we could have bought a tesla okay and when you figure that out you're like oh my god should have just not tested anything rolling around in a tesla i would have been happier okay this is the way of the world you have to ease those concerns and so what we we have uh become brcgs accredited which you all might recognize more than a lot of our folks here but it dictates a logical risk-based approach to your internal standards and every year an auditor shows up there's one due here just in a couple of weeks and they give you the ringer for two three days if there's an issue they're gonna find it and they'll take your accreditation but the purpose of those independent third party accreditations for us is to say look we can do this and we can change minds there's always going to be sentiment against it just like there was with prohibition of alcohol right people have their strange notions religious spiritual political otherwise bad personal experiences uh but when the evidence really builds and builds and builds time's gonna change if you actually thought about it i mean so like as someone who's watched the cbd industry you know grow in the uk and to be honest with you i like having my brother in america i watched the the cannabis industry over the last 10 years grow as well and as someone like you who's watched the cannabis industry grow over the last 20 years i mean i kind of like the fact that these protocols are being brought in it's like it makes me think that one day you will be able to walk into a walmart at tesco and asda all right tesco azure is our equivalent of walmart walk up to the pharmaceutical section you know where they've got your ibuprofen and your paracetamol just sitting there on the shelf and you'll have your ibuprofen paracetamol cbd you know that's precisely how this is kind of video we we um the api idea this is what you were saying and that like it's the right way you know like who wants a bathroom formulated product you know who wants something that's made in a kitchen with doggies running around i mean like who wants that you know like like it's it's insane but that's what the market's been built on but i like this idea of you know grass-rooted people stepping up a notch because we can there's no reason we can't you know if everyone else can there's like we can also bring bring that quality you know so that's that's essentially what we've seen manifest itself as ingredient suppliers as formulators as um someone that we contract manufacturers as well like we we can't do it all there are pros that make say a soft gel capsule as an example why build a facility just to do that when there are pros it was about convincing them that our ingredient was legal compliant well characterized and able to be brought into their facility so that they could make the soft gel that could then be in the grocery store pharmacy over the counter same is true for those retailers and for those brands they show up and do a vendor approval on it and give us the business for two or three days and tour the site and go through all of our documents to say you know what this is real backwards and forwards and the risk associated with this ingredient or this product is low enough for us to incorporate it into our finished goods and thereby increase access to quality cannabinoids that's my mission in life increasing access to quality cannabinoids and without building the foundation you you can't do that so you're doing well man so all i say is you're doing well like i've seen your footprint and fact the matter is is there's this consistency which i'm going to go on to again it all starts with this consistency in order to end up with that final product coming out of the capsule maker which is perfect and every capsule is exactly 25 milligrams and you've given them an sop to follow the math you've given them an extract to go with that sop if that extract isn't what you say it is then no matter how much you follow the math you're never going to come up with the right product and it's it's so it's all about the starting foundation of the extracts we use and you know like being able to dream big and think you know one day i'm going to be able to walk into any shop and there will just be cbd on the shelf as a standard not some 75 pound 1 000 milligram which you know is extortionately priced you know you know you know it's insane you know that it's market manipulation and corruption like a standard product which anyone can use i mean like like you need to have this this standardization this compliance is consistency this this reputation for being reliable in order for the companies to even humor the idea you know yeah and that's you touched on something that i still i still struggle with because i i i see these product launch press releases and i see the retailers and the online sales promotions and i don't understand if you're in need how you can afford some of the products out there and that's precisely the problem goals obviously is to make that change because i just it's all for not if you can't actually buy it right so i think we work as an industry to make that more affordable more accessible um it's going to happen naturally anyway but i everything happens with climate change our ceo's going to kill me the more it's accepted the more it's accepted by the general population the more you can produce you know the cheaper the price will come down the more you know a lot of money is spent almost educating and you know almost fighting this resistance you know like 30 quid in every tincture is probably spent convincing people that they need that tincture as soon as people don't need the convincing anymore the prices will come crashing down it's like if you had to tell someone they needed an ibuprofen every time they needed they had a headache ibuprofen would be 16 17 pounds a packet if that much marketing had to go in behind it if that much education had to go behind it so like i don't want to say the the the the users are making it difficult but if there were more users taking this on who were educating other users so brands didn't have to market then they wouldn't have the excuse for why the price was so high because that's always the excuse for every product being expensive on the marketplace oh it's branding because branding costs money you know like marketing costs money that's the o cost money part of my thought on this too is how many how many times is the ingredient brokered intestine oh so many times buried costs are there in oh oh it is what you say it is okay well i'm going to test it on it crosses 16 hands before it gets to someone like you or someone like us who formulates it it's it's crazy but it is normalizing russ i mean to your question it is getting more and more normal by the day you just have to i mean the more we are able to directly interact with regulators directly interact with producers and consumers you you just start to thread it all together so this is a new common understanding of what we're doing and that's what we seek to do is educate well i want i want you to know the effect you're having on our uh our listeners and people viewing uh ed grossman russ this is a very seriously great show one of the things chris and and you are an awesome absolute exemplar of this is that i had no idea the sort of folk that ollie mammon was going to bring onto the show i mean i was full of trepidation it's not an area i know anything about so as i said 22 weeks has been a rocket ride for me everyone who comes on is so erudite is so articulate is so passionate it's so genuine and and it comes from and i know this sounds ridiculous but it comes from a good place it's not about just making money it's coming from a good place and that's what's so that's what's so fantastic it really is you know great i really appreciate that um i mean i i think i spoke with ollie for all of 2.7 minutes before i was like this is a brother you know like these people so easily and there are potholes as we we would say out there there are people that are opportunistic and taking advantage of every angle but what we say as as industry stewards um will be here at the end of every day that's a beautiful way to leave this show chris dubs all the way from kentucky i'm so excited thank you so much for joining us i love that beautiful bro always as always it's a pleasure until next week bye everybody bye guys thanks chris", "dPHT72UwbR0": "- What's up everyone? Caleb here with Hemp Daddy's Therapeutics. And I'm here today to\nanswer one of the questions I get asked the most, and it's Does CBD make you high? And how does it make you feel? This is one of the\nnumber one search queries in Google that lands\npeople on our website, so I know a lot of you are answering it so I thought I'd do a\nlittle YouTube video on it. But before we get started, we gotta talk about what the\ndifference in THC and CBD is. So, THC is the component of\nthe plant that gets you high. CBD is a whole 'nother\ncomponent of the plant. It's another cannabinoid. So, the cannabis plant, hemp as well, has a whole array of cannabinoids. All of them have medicinal\nand therapeutic benefits. CBD being the number one\nmedicinal and therapeutic benefit out of all of the cannabinoids. That's why all these\ncompanies are isolating CBD. One of the things you're\ngonna start seeing here in the future is people isolating other\nthings like CBC and CBG. Because they all have unique medicinal and therapeutic benefits. So THC, on the other hand, is the component that is responsible for getting you high. But it does also have therapeutic benefits such as reducing the size of tumors and helping with pain management as well. But CBD, on the other hand, it's got all those medicinal\nand therapeutic benefits and many, many more, but there's no high associated with it. So if you have, whatever it is, whether it's a moral issue, or you just don't like\nthe feeling of being high, like CBD will not get you high. There's no chance of it at all. You could probably drink an entire bottle and not even get high. You know, don't go out and try that, I'm not advocating that at all. But because there's so much CBD to THC, like basically CBD counteracts the psychoactive effects of THC. So, let's say you smoked a joint, for say, if you did that along with a dose of CBD, you're not gonna feel as high as you would if you just took THC alone. So CBD has no psychoactive effects, so there's not risk of\ngetting high with CBD. It just has all the medicinal\nand therapeutic benefits. So let's talk about how it makes you feel. So, basically, it just\nmakes you feel good. So, I kinda relate it to a runner's high. When you get that flood of endorphins and you just feel great,\nyou feel positive, you're completely lucid, your\nmind is in the right place. It's kind of the same as CBD. And honestly, it kinda\nbecomes like your new normal. So let's say you take\nCBD for the first time, you're probably gonna\nreally feel the effects. But after you've been\ntaking it for a full month, you're not gonna notice\nthe effects as much even though they're still there, it just becomes the new normal. Like, you start feeling better. So if struggle with stress,\nor anxiety, or depression, like those things can\nreally benefit from CBD. And so, if you just wanna take CBD just to relax at the end of the day, to wind down, to sleep better, CBD is great for these things. You'll feel nothing but positive benefits. There's no negative side effects. You're not gonna feel tired and drowsy just because you took CBD. So basically, CBD works by\ncalming your mind, that's, so when I say it helps with sleep, it helps with sleep by calming your mind. So if you're the type of person whose mind is always racing when you go to bed and you\nhave a hard time sleeping, CBD is gonna help with that. But if you take CBD during the day, it's not gonna make you sleepy, so don't worry about that. And again, CBD does not\nmake you high whatsoever. It's the THC that gets you high. So if you're taking CBD oil, if it's a full spectrum,\nor a broad spectrum, it doesn't matter, there's not gonna be enough THC content in order to get you high, so consume CBD and you're\ngonna get all of these positive and great benefits with no risk of getting high.

youtube channel my name is ben aka notions and this is a review of a new cbd hemp extract which has just come out or it's just new to the site where i buy my cbd hemp from it's called ice rocks and it's very high in cbd it's 74 cbd it's also the strongest cbd hemp extract i've ever smoked and on the breeded green website it says for experienced uses only so i've given up i must be an experienced user when i first moved to cannabis when i was eight years old so i guess that makes me an experienced user anyway this is what i thought looks like it's basically a block of white stuff and it comes in a container it looks like this it has a lid on it and it is very strong right not attract nice one i'm going to tell you five to me how are you doing your cbd him but hemp extracts is very harsh on the throat when i first had my first one about 10 minutes ago i was coughing after every drag of it you don't have to put that much into each one i only rolled one skin once okay it's 74 percent cbd which is very strong i do think it is pretty good though it definitely chills me out quite a lot relaxes my mind just palms me down and the dvd and that's right that i was smoking before the ice rocks it's called bruce banner and that was 27 cbd percentage so considerably weaker than the ice rocks that i've got now but it did taste a lot better this is just tastes a bit sympathetic it doesn't taste good for cannabis at all it just tastes it tastes man-made because it's dunked in some cannabis oil before being sold as ice rocks cbd hemp extract on created green dr uk it did cost me 49.99 for just four grams of this stuff due to it being 74 but you don't need to put much into each spliff so that's a lot better really i might just buy the bruce banner or ak-47 stuff next time though i much prefer being able to taste the weed excuse me it really is harsh on your throat you're not expecting it but it just makes you cough so it's not exactly a smooth smoke i wouldn't say very harsh okay don't buy this if you if you're really if you cough after every drag for normal thrift definitely don't buy it that's what i can say because it does make me cough for an awful lot all right it's just a spot jack knife one a spot that i picked sometimes but it's quite raw though doesn't it but i don't know how it happened it's just a spot that's got bigger and i've picked it and it bleeds sometimes but i'm not on any opioids anymore apart from methadone which is a good thing but i'll have to pick my method down up after 2 p.m today but i get a whole week's worth today okay i won't be able to take it till quite late but my review on this ice rocks cbd like that it's very strong and it's very harsh on the throat so take caution if you're new to smoking weeds don't get pushed off because it's just so strong it's very harsh on your fruit like our heat saying it really is maybe drag i have it that hurts right and it tastes synthetic and it's 74 cbd you won't beat your potential cbd at the moment i don't think but it's awfully strong so i'll i'll leave this video here because i think i made the point on this ice rock cbd that's right okay take it easy or have a good day seriously bye", "6-H9X4PEpnY": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey what's up everybody - boom axe beats here get up max reviews wouldn't do another medical marijuana review and now this time I'm gonna be doing one back on Africa I had one back yesterday evening actually because I was finishing up my 9 pound hammer and you can check that review out - if you haven't seen it but I went to Africa because I really wanted to try their their concentrate syringes and I went on their website and they had a strain called Durban not sure if it's Durban poison or Durban it just said Durban excuse me so uh seemed that it had ninety three point something percent THC and I was like yeah that's for me that's really so it comes in this bag right here like my whiz from Africa nice little blue bag they got and inside the blue day they have a ziplock a little bag in itself and the way that you open that is there's like a little thumbprint here on the side you just you just press it in and then you go ahead and unzip okay and I have some product facts here tells you you know like what's inside the the products obviously tetrahydrocannabinol and a pure concentrate syringe especially formulated from cannabis plants extracting for medical use and yeah it tells you like how much the active ingredients is the Delta nine and then the 900 milligrams and then you know it says has other ingredients cannabis plant extract and natural terpenes um the only thing that I could possibly say it tells you like what temperature to store as well 68 to 77 degrees is what the window you want to keep it at and as far as temperature wise so yeah the only thing complaints I have of after you is they they don't have like much info as far as other dispensaries or I've been to one other dispensary and that dispensary had um like facts ahead the strain name you know and I just I don't know this is Durbin and it just doesn't have the strain name on it once you buy it so you got to remember what you got it only has a hybrid like the dominance of it so the dominance is a hybrid and it says here 93.7% THC and 0.2% CBD it has the harvest number and it has the lot number and where it was manufactured and it says one syringe I like how they have it in a pill bottle that's cool because it's like it actually looks like medication now it's not just like some you know like some other places have they just keep your liking a pop you know anywhere you know like so you might get pulled over or something and they might think like oh what is this like you know but this is actually like it looks like medication so I like that and yeah just open it and get right into the review this is what the syringe looks like very dark very dark color and trying to get it behind the white so you can see actual actually just get it close up for you guys okay so there it is up close and uh I should give you guys a nice little visual of it and get you guys back in oh yes all right so yeah we're just gonna get right into it I don't want to say that and talk for 20 minutes but today's different gonna be a new day new day for change here's our the yolk ham and this is what I'm going to be using today and basically uh in the past I've sort of recommended this but now I kind of like full fledge go ahead and recommend this because I actually found out what the problem was what with it I wasn't tightening on the screw so here's what it looks like you open it up you got the Yochanan there and then underneath here you have like your charger you have another atomizer or a Tama I don't know I sit at atomizer I guess you have another one of those and it's basically a cart cartridge that you can fill up with a juice or whatever concentrate and babe whatever you can get in there so today I'm going to be using the coil atomizer and it's basically it's just a coil where you would drop a little dab of this on there and inhale and it heats it up for you so we're gonna go ahead and do that and just so you guys excuse me just so I guys know I took like a very very very very very very tiny taste of this just to see what it tastes like wasn't really trying to get medicated off of it just a little drip I was hanging off the end and I I just like wanted to get a taste so just so I can give you guys like a taste test or a review and I just did that actually before I turned it on so I could still taste it and it just tastes like um I don't know if you guys ever had like edibles or something like that and excuse me it has a UH like a little edible taste it tastes like cannabis really um yeah it tastes like cannabis um but just the THC though not too extra added so uh Warren achar I'm gonna try to do a close-up for you guys where you can see me loading this up so just in case if you guys wanted to get the same product or something similar you can just go ahead and do it the first step that I'm gonna show you guys is uh you don't really need to warm it up too much but if you are going to warm it up this would be the first step really a lot of people warming up with their hand they just hold it in the hand like this or there's like a pen where you can insert this in and it'll warm it up for you just hold the button but me personally I just hold it in my hand like this and I'm from you know where a place where like it snows all the time so this is what we do you just ability your breath in there that you warm the warm breath for about five seconds ten seconds tops and that's it now this comes with a a pull-off cap it's like a unscrewed cap like that and I like to take both of these off so I'm just gonna do it I'm gonna go ahead and do that I'm gonna take both of them off and I see right there it's just these two little one is a cap that holds it screws in and then the the other is the part that it screws into and that secures or fastens the cap screw in so that you can screw it on so I'm just gonna go ahead and remove that completely because and I'll show you why in a second let me just go ahead and move my gimbal okay so here it is and here's the yoke an and here is the atomizer okay the atomizer actually has three one two three yeah three parts to it I'm gonna say so here's the coil I'm trying to get it so you guys can see in there but there is a coil in there and basically what you want to do is you want to let out about this size just a little tiny bit you see that guys that's actually too much but it's a race size and that's what you're said \u00ecdo you just get the right size and you're just gonna want to put it right on the coil there smear it around a little bit on the sidewall that's what you said to do okay try to get you guys okay so yeah so that's what I said you want to do it looks like it's gonna keep coming out so I'm gonna draw back a little bit on it what you want to do is just screws back in and then from there just gonna drop this right in there and it's good to go that's all you gotta do ladies and gentlemen so let's get back into it let's get the taste tester saalu let's see what this is about let's see what the Durban is about some kind of medication feeling it can give us but here this is what in there not really sure how like how long you're supposed up how long you're supposed to hit this for um I just put like a a right sized drop in there that seemed kind of like a lot hmm it tastes good it tastes kind of like the UH I'm trying to think of what it tastes like tastes a little bit like the cartridge that I got from Africa Wow Wow excuse me guys and girls okay well wow what a difference from the cartridge to that holy cow whoa all right sorry guys I am like really medicated right now from that wasn't expecting that at all I've been using something else which I don't recommend that yoga that y'all do and it's do not use the yo can with this it is a cartridge burn as a concentrate unevenly or something it just doesn't give you the hit that I just got yeah I'm I'm good sheesh all right so um I don't know if there's anything like else left in here um or if it burned but I suppose a rice sized drop in there Oh got some smoke so I guess you can hit this more than once out to you after you dab with it did I hit that one kind of taste it a little bit like the granddaddy purp or the now I'm done hammer that hat well I apologize but I'm gonna leave all the coffin in there just so you guys know how how powerful it is hey alright so um wow I'm gonna have to take a minute I'm sorry for like the clicking and coughing and I'm doing like I probably sound like a like one of those tribes you know we're like on a YouTube video wow I just think I might have to take a minute guys like I might only took a minute like cut seriously they're like sheesh I'm gonna have to take a minute and just take a walk for a second Wow Africa the guy even said um David said like be careful when he gave this to me is that you know just be careful because this stuff is really strong so I really gotta be gotta do gotta be careful don't drive honey don't don't think about driving or no and yeah well you're about to take this because it's like I feel completely different like and I feel like I have to take a minute to relax I can just get my thoughts like straight I take a walk or something they oh no this is I wasn't expecting this I suppression or private they took a rice sighs a rice sighs Wow so yeah guys I'll definitely definitely recommend this I don't even know if I'm gonna get anything else like as far as anything to concentrate I did do that I did do the uh the granddaddy purp and nine pound hammer from a difference especially but I didn't do it from this I didn't dab it like this because I thought it was broken because I didn't have it tightened enough I didn't actually have it tighten enough so it wasn't making a connection to the heater coil or whatever it's called and uh it just was acting like it wasn't working it was basically every time I would try to go and hit it it was just doing this obviously was just doing this alright you guys could see that it's just blinking like it doesn't have anything in it you know I mean so when you put something in it though it stays on and I guess it wasn't making a connection so I actually I think her name is Vicki Nikki I forgot she loved to comment just so I could shout you out I don't want to butcher her last name Gillan or Gillian Gillan I think Illinois but Vicki she actually said they hate why don't you try this way and I went ahead and replied back to her like I did try that way but I think it's broken so thank you Vicki for helping me out with that uh for making me like a little bit motivated to go ahead and try it again because if it wasn't for you doing that I probably would not have so yeah definitely try it this way if you're gonna use if you're gonna inhale the concentrate definitely dab it or use it on a coil of some sort because I tried it with the granddaddy purp in a nine pound hammer with the cartridge and it did work confirmed it did work but it wasn't like this at all not at all like I had to take at least like five or six of them pulls like long pulls to feel like I do right now so yeah definitely do it this way um eating it I felt like it went so quickly when I ate it and it took so long to kick in so I just it's just I have a high a high tolerance for a THC so I this way is you know I mean it's like right away you feel the effects and it you know doesn't ease into it and then you know and then damn you hit you like and then you're feeling good it's just I like this so I might uh I might do I might do like some gummy bears or something I don't know we'll see but it was seventy-five bucks guys and it's 900 milligrams so it's not anyone's busy oh man there goes the dog again that's his like morning ritual Oh time to walk me so yeah anyway I'm gonna go walk him but before I do that I'm gonna close with the 900 milligrams it was seventy-five bucks but it is powerful as strong so like I can't do a comparison on the granddaddy apartment 9 pound hammer to tell you that which one was better or which one was more potent but uh because I was doing it out of the cartridge that yocan came with which wasn't the best way so from now on I'm gonna do this I might go back and get something else of the true clear or something but for now this is the Afra and I'm totally impressed with this thank you so much \u00e1free\u00e1 this is the port st. Lucie location and yeah that's it guys thank you for joining if you haven't already like comment or subscribe tell me what you guys would recommend I'm gonna try to do some other dispensaries but these are the ones that are close to my house so for now I'm gonna try their products once I try all their products on maybe go on to the next dispensary who knows but yeah thank you so much guys for your time and I hope I helped you guys out and I hope you I helped you guys learn a little bit about you know the medical marijuana program here in Florida alright guys peace have a good one",

long I'm going to be showing you guys how I make my extra strong green dragon picture this photo has one cup of liquid and 10 grams of wheat and then I reduced it to 1/3 of a cup meaning that now there is 5 tablespoons in 1/3 of a cup so every tablespoon is 2 grams of wheat you're gonna need the carbs wheat for this recipe and I'll post a link of how to do that below here's what you're gonna need alcohol that is 95% alcohol or higher some coffee filters or cheesecloth a funnel some mason jars and 10 grams of the carb to read the first step is to freeze your Dakkar bleed for at least 24 hours I have already done that and now that it's been over 24 hours I'm going to pour in 2/3 of a cup of vodka that has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours the instructions for this can still be followed even if you're not using the same amount of wheat that I am which is 10 grams all you have to do is pour enough vodka to fill just to the top of the weed now you're going to shake it aggressively for 5 minutes then you'll put it in the freezer for at least 2 hours I ended up leaving mine in the freezer for about 20 hours there's no need to leave it for long within 2 hours I did that simply because I ran at a time now I'm placing a funnel into my mason jar and I'm going to poke some holes into my coffee filter so that it flows through a little bit quicker if you don't have any coffee filters you can also use cheesecloth then place that into the funnel now you can take your weed and vodka mixture out of the freezer and shake it aggressively for another 5 minutes pour your mixture into the filter and try to avoid spilling it over the edge like I do here then wait for it to filter through this can take a while sometimes even up to a half an hour you can see how slowly it comes out of the bottom and then once almost all of the liquid has gone through I'll move the weed around to try and facilitate more of the liquid to be filtered through I put some gloves on because if your fingers are touching the weed and vodka it can absorb some of the THC and we obviously don't want that because that would be a waste now that all the vodka has gone through the filter I'm going to scoop back the weed into the jar you can see how much weed is left in the funnel because I spilled it when I poured it in so again try to avoid doing that if you can [Music] now I'm going to pour in 1/3 of a cup of vodka that again has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours and then I'm going to pour it into my jar weed that I had already filtered once now again if you're using different proportions just use enough to just cover the weed you can just pour it straight into the jar I'm just using the funnel so I can try and get some of that weed that's stuck to it the first time now once again I'm going to shake that jar aggressively for five minutes now using that same jar and same filter that I'd use the first time I am going to pour in the mixture that we had just shaken into the jar that we first used [Music] now this step is optional but I'm going to pour in a little bit of that very cold flash-frozen vodka to get the remnants out of my jar again you don't have to do this but I don't want to waste anything so every little scrap I can get I'm gonna take now once again we're going to let that filter through and it is going to take a long time just like the first round did [Music] once that's all dripped through we're going to place a clean funnel into a clean measuring cup or mason jar as well as a new clean coffee filter and we are not going to poke any holes now we're going to pour it in and we're going to wait for this to drip through this step is not necessary but I like mine very clear so I like to filter out any imperfections if you like you can do this step twice but it does take a long time so I only do it once and I find that the one time is sufficient to get it very pure and clean I'm also going to take the filter with the weed that has been filtered already and press it out as much as I can of course make sure you're wearing a rubber glove so that your skin is not absorbing at all yeah and just try and squish oh as much as you can and then that little bit of leftover that is on the parchment paper there I mean if you're just using this for yourself you could just lick it up I don't know if you don't want to waste it anything works yeah so just squeeze out as much as you possibly can it's been about a half an hour and almost everything has filtered through and we have a total of about a little bit under a cup of liquid because some of that vodka is lost in the extraction process [Music] now we need to reduce our tincture to a smaller amount and we're going to use that by using a double boiler thing which I don't have so I'm making my own version and I'm just using my instant pot so that I can do it in the living room where I have better lighting so I am wrapping some tinfoil around it so I can contain the heat as much as possible and I'm just going to put my measuring cup on to the side of it and then wrap the tinfoil kind of around it that way not too much water and heat is evaporating all you want to make sure is that your bottom of your mason jar or your measuring cup like I'm using is not touching the water so same concept as a double boiler so I both to put it in there but I just have to show off how beautiful it looks it's so clear so golden absolutely beautiful I hope you guys appreciate how wonderful it looks because a lot of my friends and family don't really feel the same way as I do so I just love being able to share this stuff with you guys online please make sure you do this any well-ventilated area so I have all windows and doors in my house opened as well as if your dreams on the stove have your hood fan on there is no smell at all so unfortunately my instant pot broke part way through I don't know what happened so I moved it to the kitchen and I made this sort of contraption thing because I could not put the measuring cup on the edge of the pot because I don't have anything deep enough where the bottom of the measuring cup wouldn't touch the water so I just put a metal strainer on top and then created some insulation with the tin foil kind of like how I did it the instant pot so while you're watching it when it's bubbling a lot like this that's a little bit too much so turn your heat down a little bit you do want a little bit of movement but not that aggressively now I reduced it down to one third of a cup and that took me about an hour and a half I believe you can reduce it more or reduce it less it just depends on how strong you want it to be now it's ready to pour into a jar to save you can use this with a dropper or you can put into your gummies or into your drinks there's so many different ways to use it hopefully you guys will check out some of my gummy videos and try it out in one of those recipes and here's the finished product which is absolutely beautiful thank you so much for watching with the measuring cup I didn't want to waste any possible tincture so I heard some iced coffee into there and now I'm drinking that so that's a good way to make sure you're not wasting anything if you guys enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe and please let me know if there's any videos you would like to see me record because I would be happy to do that thank you guys so much for watching have a great day [Music]", "gUTCmb0-le0": "[Music] [Music] [Music] hello this is chef Vita and welcome to my kitchen I am licensed to produce medical marijuana and everything I do here is perfectly legal now today we're gonna make cannabis while we're doing the revised edition why because I've learned a few things since the last time I made this video so let's get it on with it now what I'm going to do this time around is freeze the herb and freeze the the jars that I'm going to be using I'm gonna be using glass jars instead of plastic I don't want to use plastic at all in the procedure because okay so freezing we're gonna do two ounces of bud same as last time we're going to try using 500 milliliters of alcohol this time the saturation of alcohol is about 1 pound to 1/2 pounds meaning that do you know if you go any further than that you're just gonna be ballistic honor is the alcohol won't be or all the kind of annoys her so if you break it down it works out to about six point six milliliters - but which is the maximum my formula is a little under myself some Headroom so you know I should be okay and the formula for yield is you know you should get 12% so from two ounces of but I'm expecting about seven grams of hash oil now if you don't get that yield the problem is most likely you're not using okay about two ounces of high quality cannabis here and what you choose is is up to you if you're going to be using this for medication for serious chronic illnesses then I would go with a strain that's very high to CBD strains like Charlotte's Web or kind of trauma now the more CBD your strain has the less THC it will have that's because CBD is a regulator okay your other choices would be whether to go with indica or sativa now indica is more of a heavy relaxing high to it where the steel is a more energetic energetic and creative and good for stress so your choice I have a string here that is halfway between indicas yeah I really don't know what the CBD content is but most commercial strains where the Charlotte's Web or the catatonic is 4% okay so that's what we're going to do is grind up the bud in this machine because I frozen but the trichomes and when you grind this up you don't want to [Music] [Music] this is gonna make really high quality hash the best you can get now of course the quality depends on the quality for her just a couple more things before we take this outside whether you deed carboxylate or her first is again it's your trace it all depends where you're using it before if you deep carboxylate then you're gonna have a higher THC content to the finished product but also what you're going to do even at 200 degrees you know some of the terpenes are gonna vaporize so you can lose some of the kind of roads in that process so you know there are like 55% different kind of an audits in in cannabis so THC is only one of those kind of atomic so we're all going for different things here so whether you choose to the decarboxylate or not it is up to you I've chosen not to okay methodology how we're going to do this how we how we go reduce the alcohol or vaporize the alcohol now there's a few different ways the ultimate way is co2 extraction now if you're if you can justify the expense that's definitely the way to go and the newer technology is a lot better than the older technology because you can just load it up walk away and come back and there's no fuss another way you can do it which is you know co2 extraction but using dry ice so I'm going to work on that okay now the next level would be using a disco even a water just because alcohol burns at 170 you really don't need a lot of heat the advantages of using it to store is that you can recover the alcohol rather than you know or the more you know the more sophisticated distillers you can recycle that alcohol that use it for a second or third rinse so they do have their advantages if you're producing you know a fair amount of oil the most common method though I believe is to use a rice cooker and it works well and that's the message that I'm going to use okay I think we're ready to go outside now okay it's in the wintertime it's not that cold right now we had some snow a couple of days ago so it should be fun okay let's get this stuff we got that and we're gonna do containers oh wait a minute just one more thing I'd like to talk about before we do go outside let's put this back now there's a lot of debate on the net about what kind of alcohol tea is that a lot of those people are very passionate you know you know everyone thinks that they're right and you know but you know everyone you know it's I've done I've done some research on this yeah I don't drink alcohol I didn't know a lot of and in the original video I used isopropyl my gut was right because I see well I believe is the best choice because it's 99% alcohol it's pure alcohol and it's made from organic compounds and there is one percent water so it's not really a toxic substance but you know if you do drink this stuff which you're not supposed to you know the alcohol will turn into a stone which is which is toxic but it's not as toxic as the alcohol that you would buy from a liquor store so really isopropyl alcohol is a less toxic product to use than Everclear and Eclair is it's one night so yeah well we'd influenced my choice over Everclear an isopropyl would be the you know for whatever reason I'm using the oil for smoking it I'm gonna want to go with every clear because it gives you a nice honey oil but if I'm ingesting am using for medication then I don't mind the chlorophyll that comes with the the isopropyl I mean that's the big difference use everywhere you're not gonna extract the chlorophyll but you know every clear is more toxic than I suppose and it's probably going to be a lot of arguments about this but you know do the research okay now you know this is fo ethanol alcohol thing is don't use methanol methanol is very toxic you know you know yo go blind you know two ounces it's it's not good so don't use methanol it's the as far as botanical extracting those this is the most popular way to go because it's the cleanest and most effective okay and I'm sticking to that and I think okay we're ready to go out here one other point I would like to mention about alcohol is that some of the confusion about isopropyl is that some companies put very nasty stuff in here to prevent you from drinking it and that stuff is toxic so you have to be careful what you buy make sure it's a pure clean product 99% alcohol 1% water nothing else okay now that's good started we're gonna pour the herb into the jar whoops try to be eight all right pull the alcohol on I've got a fan going over here keep the air moving okay we're gonna stir this up this is going to take three or four minutes okay it's been a few minutes now and what we're gonna do is strain this we have our second jar here and what I'm going to do is put an elastic band around the wick here to act as a gasket and what we're going to use is this cake sifter it's something that your grandma would use I took out the inner in a party and it fits right on top here very nicely with the rubber gasket there we'll have a nice seal now what we do is we're gonna pour this we're going to strain it through the sifter here like so okay I've got a wooden spoon here and we'll just help it out and let it drain okay now it's getting pretty slow here what we're gonna do is rinse it with a little bit of alcohol here this will get off this bowl I'll get whatever kind of a noise or oil whatever whatever resins are left behind so we don't waste anything okay now the next step is to filter your alcohol now we get another jar I've cleaned up this jar so there is no sentiment okay now I need another rubber band [Music] I'm just squishing it against the side of this can here so I don't wreck the mesh okay what we're gonna do is discard this now not everybody does that there's a new thing called paste now what some people do will cook this down in the alcohol they won't bother filtering it they'll cook it down and it turns into a pace it's called pace so cool some people claim that it's better than hash oil but I don't know but what I'm gonna do is make paste in my next video so that's something to look forward to okay let's put this over here for now I'm just going to clean this out okay nice and clean adduce rinse it out and dry it with a towel what I'm doing here is just gonna make sure I've got all the sediment out of here okay now what we're gonna do here is put a coffee filter in here like so and set it up so it's in there kind of snug I'm going to put it on here now we're gonna pour this I'm gonna start slowly maybe we should take this rubber band off we don't want the alcohol to come in contact with any plastic or rubber okay we're going to pour slowly okay we're moving along as you can see here the liquid is pretty clear compared to how quality this is I think we're ready to pour the rest of this just put the last of it in here I should take the time to give you a few tips on safety like I mentioned you know make sure you have a fan going and make sure you do this outside it's a good idea to plug everything in before you set up you know so there's no sparks or any kind of you know things happening no smoking and it should be okay should be fairly safe okay they will salvage this later I'm gonna get going here okay the next step is to pour this alcohol into the crock-pot I mean the rice cooker and we shall turn it on now this this does not take very long at all so don't walk away from it you know stay on top of it it's gonna start boiling pretty soon it'll start boiling fairly rapidly you just got to make sure that you don't fill the rice cooker too much so it doesn't fly all over or anything okay well let that we do this down okay I'm just gonna pour the rest of the alcohol in there it's still boiling fairly rapidly here like I said it's not gonna take long [Music] there you go she's flying pretty good there okay we're getting somewhere as we get closest to the end there it will get thicker okay we're getting pretty close to the end here we don't want to take it too far we don't want to burn the oil we're gonna add some water now the reason why I would do this is because alcohol burns I mean boils at 170 degrees and water will boil at 212 so the alcohol will burn off before the water does so when it stops bubbling it means that it's done there's no alcohol okay this punch in the game before it gets too thick we're gonna pour it into a container and finish it so before this gets too thick we're gonna pour it out okay now we're back inside we're just going to put the kind of a soil on a hot plate this is just my coffeemaker here it works just as good now it's going to start bubbling that means that everything's not boiled off yet when it stops bubbling then it will be done this could take some time okay as you can see it has stopped bubbling which means that the UI was done as you can see it's like a syrupy consistency right now and when it cools down it'll become like a tar like become very tar like all right now as far as the yield goes the formula is right on this cup here weighs 28 grams 85.5 35.4 - the 28 grams to the cup that's seven point four seven and a half grams from from two ounces of Bud as you can see here the oil is getting getting a lot thicker already we have a look at it it's oil actually it's a golden color it doesn't seem to be a lot of chlorophyll of oil sweet well the reason why we've got a nice golden color here instead of a darker green color it's because I used but no sugar shake so this is this is premium premium quality and that's that's very expensive but this is this is a product that was not intended for recreational okay I think that just about wraps and the storage I would store it in a dark glass jar I think that would be the best as far as dosage information goes for chronic illnesses or just like maintenance just visit my website Derek calm and click on my medical marijuana page okay [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "-iht2-GRc2E": "you", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't forget to check me out on instagram at the NJ chef don't forget to check me out on medical edibles calm every

brand if you have any anxiety pain inflammation sleep mood you can even help with immunity just overall health give us a call we want to talk to you about it", "1ErdD2tN-oo": "hi I'm dr. Heidi about 20 years ago I got interested in things other than regular medicines to help my patients so first I got interested in vitamin D and I realized it has huge health benefits so over the years my treatment strategy is more much more comprehensive now I've realized that stress management is extremely important for taking care of our health diet is extremely important exercise is important and vitamins and minerals very important and medications if and when necessary so this is my comprehensive treatment approach now so along your lines I keep looking into any possible treatment approaches few months ago I got interested in essential oils and I've been experimenting with essential oil then let me share with you my journey with this it was about four or five months ago I ordered this equipment on ebay it came from China in a big box all these things were there and there were no instructions how to assemble them so anyone who is interested there I'm gonna share how I did it so it should be little easier for you I have to call my engineer friend to figure it out but together we'll figure it out it's not that hard actually so this is right here so this so this is the heater and this rod comes separate you have to put that in this on one end just push it in these are various clamps so first you put this clamp just assemble these clamps together put this in this is the bottom flat and put that in gonna pull the clip folder and then here is this clamp and with that you tighten it there we go alright and now now this is the other flask of water in it alright that goes on the top of it and then this disassembly on this side I did that already so I'm going to show you how I did that so here is the other clamp we put there and these two things are not in the same direction as you can see they are at right angles this clamp using this direction and this clamp is in this direction so again you know it is this clamp put it and type in is really good and then on the end of this clamp is the condenser if you become denser you put that in tighten it really good and then this condenser you need to attach this to this oil separator and then there are these rubber plants important thing about them they have two rings the top one the smaller ring should be on the top and the bottom should be the bigger ring should be at the bottom so this is the right direction of it don't do it this way wait you're moving too fast okay so this is the right direction yeah the smaller ring should be upward and this is the wrong direction okay so just shut show to us this way okay and it turns slowly this is a long way I can't use you lightly okay and then you go in there why not there it goes serious there is the other clamp like that same it here like that okay okay so now I'm going to take this off for a minute comes up be very careful this can break really these all glass alright so today I'm going to make rosemary oil so I got some of this old Mary from our backyard cut it into pieces like this and see it is ready but before that I'm going to put some water in this I honestly like having you in this room and in your kitchen okay and I'm going to add new more so I ready to move order is not just about this much water about 2/3 full and now I'm going to put this the other slash right here on top of it and this rubber clam goes right here and I'm going to film it with this rosemary okay so it filled up but we need to compact it down for just something like this from your kitchen and compact it down a bit see we have much more room here now some of the benefits of rosemary oil are is an antioxidant and it's good for your memory also good for hair growth and beautiful posture health well I have to ask is that how your hair got so good no actually I've never used it in my hair and well my the secret to my healthy here number one genetics good Daenerys my dad had good hair although I have the best here out of all of my brothers so I think it's more than genetics I think the biggest factor for my healthy here is my stress relieving good diet art and Colorama here I think here is harmful for your hair I also don't shampoo my hair every day and I put some coconut oil or jojoba oil in my hair periodically so here you have it equal to my healthy hair okay and it's almost cool here so this is also good for prostate healthy which will cost yourself yeah so the thing with detention Lawrence to essential oil is they are very concentrated all you need is the one or two drops HP so the rub rub Des Moines or okay so for hair growth what you do have a couple of essential oil drops mix them with the coconut oil or jojoba oil and rub it in your scalp for prostate health again you know two drops of this oil rosemary oil essential oils and then you can put that in godavari a little bit about a tablespoon and rub it up behind your testes and free ice for most essential oil action just for concentrated all you need is a couple of drops on all you get is very little amount you can see that at the end of this experiment anyway so here we are now this is a pretty good i think this is enough yeah and so this is the bridge connector there it goes is this clamp again Stanley this is ik this should be up the smaller circle of this is the right weight this is the wrong way so here another rubber clamps goes plastic clamp gold up here and over here there's this special fan this is a metallic clam and in this question is this screw here you just tighten it okay now this is the condenser so what's going to happen this will get really hard steam will be forming here it will be going through this rosemary and vapors will do for me and then vapor will go through this through here and then cold water will condense it back into water now for this cold water we have these two tubing's so you hook one over here the other one over here I need to have little pump so the one at the bottom okay it just water is because I took it off right so the air is going through so what's happening is that you need to connect this one the one that is connected to pump this tubing should go here at the bottom because we need to fill it up from the bottom okay and then water comes out from here back into this little tub first lady so it's that is loose okay and the chocolate is the bottom is connected and right and we're going to add some ice here and you keep being there periodically this add [Applause] and let's see make sure that this is closed here this is opened this is closed okay make sure this is closed and as you can see this thing had this old frog and in the end this is where we're going to get essential oil right here okay but you will see the distillate is a lot more than the essential oil essential oil it is very tiny amount so what happened this thing will get filled up and then this is the overflow so here we're going to put some containers for the oil flow gets in there so I usually just put some cup there so this is a block up make sure let me down here and we are all set voila now I'm gonna make this plug it plug it in okay there we go and close this is the other one for a pump the pump is like here okay and I'm going to turn it on let's see so it is initially to get it all the way up to maximum which is six all right and then we'll come back and see all right a little bit okay welcome back now this project is going on let's say for what little over two hours and as you can see a lot of steam is coming up from here going through rosemary and then the steam takes all the essential oil with it and here is the steam going through and when it comes here is the condenser so you call water and it condenses that steam back into the water as well as oil so there is that little oil you're seeing on the surface the sea wall just this little thin layer yeah well you get pretty much that is a very thin layer yes SID that's pretty much what you get so that makes you realize that why these true essential oils are so expensive and the real true essential oil should be very sensible okay getting some cheap potential life is not really pure real you can see so anyway I'm gonna let it continue another four hours or so and as you can see bring it over here so this is the distillate coming all the way and this is the overflow right here this is just the overflow okay and it is very scented yeah we can use it I use it in cooking or this and that if nicely scented scented water you could call it and right on the top this is the oil and at the end I will show you how to get this oil that's oil I get in these kind of bottoms you can you can label it and you get these bottles I got them from Amazon very thin it is I think it was a judgment bar for about ten dollars or something like this and you also need to take this water periodically I mean it's getting little warmth periodically you need to put in some I'd usually about as we have so aerofoil are you mean I eyes said oil it says you live on my head so yeah you need to keep adding some ice in the bucket so the water stays cool and you can also feel it here it is still getting warm yet that's a sign you need to put some more eyes okay this should stay cool okay okay we'll see you later okay so now I'm going to show you how to get this essential oil that will work so hard for six hours to get so first just open this here it's going down I'm slowing it down I have more control I've slowed down a lot very calm here that's tough now all the water is gone and this is it this is the oil this is the essential oil and invent let's get every drop okay all right I hope you ever I hope you enjoyed it and good luck", "rNi_qPt8-yo": "put the headphones on so i can really hear all the [ __ ] i'm talking today because today hurt bro because we speak about delta 8 t8c on cbd hip library and because we speak about really cbd in general it's actually not just delta eight some people think it's just a delta eight cbd is not an fda approved substance therefore youtube does not like us really discussing it and we are small time so they really don't have any respect for us um so this is what we are fighting at this point guys and it truly sucks [Music] mr bradley for anybody who doesn't know what i'm talking about i am talking about the fact that um cbd hemp library got banned for a week which is our which is my primary channel i host a show cbd hemp library with sergio and we do this show pretty much daily and as of recent they've decided to help us and there's nothing we can really do about it sorry i have to [Music] one second [Music] this is something that has indeed happened to us before what happens is they'll find any video any reason where we even i think this time it might have been because thc was at the back end of delta 8 and it misread it or whatever and it just flagged the video and when it flags the video like that then i'm gonna give you a warning and that happened to us like back in november then you have 90 days to not make another mistake i'm in which we had i guess thc somewhere around there i don't know exactly what the issue is but delta eight got us flagged on youtube now we can't release content on our main channel cbd hemp library and it [ __ ] sucks definitely glad to have you guys joining me here on gp's free game this is kind of a channel to which i talk about anything and everything that i am feeling or feeling like right now so this is a channel for those of you who like to kind of see my perspective or hear my perspective on a few things um because youtube is youtube is not it's not okay really what's happening because we are talking about a substance that is completely legal can be sold but it can't be marketed what is what is the true goal here so it can't be marketed it can't be mass-marketed it can't be consumed publicly but it's being decriminalized it just seems like it just seems like ploys to allow certain people to be able to get ahead in this market while certain people it doesn't seem like it is but i'm just kind of speaking theoretically here it seems like it's a market to where certain people are being boxed out of it and it's being done through laws it's being done through rules because here on cbd hemp library we promote a lot of smaller companies that otherwise would never have been heard of or it would have taken a lot more time i'm not taking all these companies credits for their marketing or anything like that but some of these smaller companies we are one of the bigger platforms that they've been um broadcasted on and youtube is not allowing us to do that and so i guess the next step is for us to make a collective so this is me personally gp reaching out to all we tubers all cannabis influencers sergio and i are actually going to be working on a collective here soon something to where we can kind of freely make content and this is for people who make videos this is people who make weed art it's people who make wheat artery on instagram and people don't like on instagram instagram might not like your content or might not like you posting about marijuana and things like that this is for the people who want to have facebook groups about marijuana but marijuana and cbd and delta 8 aren't allowed to be talked about on facebook a lot of times so we want to make a collective for the cannabis artist the cannabis influencer the cannabis whatever to be able to showcase what they're doing showcase their talents um in a environment to which we don't have to hide which we don't have to put certain keywords like on tick tock to not be like flagged or something like that it's just it's stressful and i want to create something like that for real i actually i really do [Music] this is something that we've been fighting for a long time and this is something that i don't think we should have to fight in the video earlier i made um a comparison to me going to go smoker go eat or chill at a clan rally or something like that and youtube's the clan like i'm not saying that they're the racism is to that extent but what i am saying is going to an area where somebody hates you or like youtube hates our content yet that's our biggest medium to post on and so that's what we have to do but guys i i am reaching out to any other creators out there that do anything in the cannabis media space if you'd be interested in creating some type of collective and we have a few plans please reach out to us any type of way you can and i've been doing a lot of saturday research about youtube and it's to them a long time and the importance of having a home away from social media so for any of you other um like youtubers out there any of you other cbd reviewers um delta 8 reviewers it is important to have a home away even if it's just an instagram because instagram is also people but like the more channels that you have to get your voice out there the harder it is it will be to silence you it's been a rough day guys it hasn't been but at the same time i enjoy this adversity this is the adversity of the stoner if you will this is the adversity of the intelligence donor this is the interversity of the intel of the athletics donor this is the adversity of anybody who likes marijuana who likes cannabis who likes any of um these kind of taboo things if you will but still continue to to consume and to not hurt anybody you know that we want to create a safe space for these people um actually i'm chilling when i change the vibe up a little bit we do and i guess a little plug we do have 50 milligram delta 8 thc edibles available um if you guys do want some um they're limited right now so just let us know right now i have to edit this afterwards [ __ ] it along with the smoking i should feel good either way i feel good [Music] cbd what the [ __ ] was that cbd hemp library is something that i personally put a good six to seven hours in a day it is my full-time job it is a livelihood thing for me it is a passion for me cannabis is a passion for me so this is something that i'm truly passionate about if you can't tell from the fact that we are uploading on so many channels on so many avenues trying to get this message out to people so guys i sincerely appreciate your support any any edibles bought any um cartridges bought any videos watched any dm sent any shares that you share our content those are all things that are supporting i i'm saying like the de-stigmatization of marijuana and trying to get news out to people about how it can bring people together how i can bring communities together and how it can truly heal people so please do know any support you show any subscribes any likes it is well received and it is in the pursuit to help with the education of delta a to help with the education of cbd to help with the education of thc to help with cannabis education and to allow people to get what they need get the things that help them and really get what they want there's nothing wrong with wanting marijuana people ask do you need it for a medical reason there's nothing wrong with [ __ ] wanting i need an it purifier before the the front office people kick me out of this [ __ ] i'll be right back [Music] it's not working [Music] all right now it's working [Music] man i should probably edit this more i don't know how much i'm going to edit this but i'm guessing i'm mostly just going to put it out i definitely appreciate i i want to garner the feeling of if you're chilling in the room with me i feel like too much editing gets away from that you know and i definitely don't want to waste your guys time and i definitely appreciate you hanging out with me but at the same time guys it's tough i have a lighter graveyard over here it's almost about time for this lighter to go in the graveyard i think it almost came to me dead so we left it over here pretty much dead but it's tough it's tough to keep staying motivated to make these videos every single day when you know that your work can just get erased at any moment you guys are really the only reason why i've been able to continue to make these videos why i've continued to be able to stay in front of the camera and to promote some brands and to put on for the community is because of the community like guys it's it's tough to stay motivated though when instagram's trying to block you when facebook's trying to block you when youtube's trying to block you when the state won't let you ship your product so the com the country wants to let you ship your product sorry the state doesn't want to let you ship your products and you're dealing in a lane that's federally legal it doesn't make any sense so this is why i say guys like we are trying to fight this good fight um it isn't free we are trying to do what we can with the resources that we have available to us and we definitely appreciate the support of all you guys watching the channel hopefully they don't come down on hard on gp's free game i really enjoy making these videos i enjoy this little solo element as well do i get to talk to you guys kind of let you know what's on my mind let you into my world just a little bit and have a smoke session i was gonna smoke anyway you know that's how i look at this is like i was gonna [ __ ] smoke anyway and this stuff is a favorite my favorite part of this job like the editing it's okay making websites don't like it writing stuff don't really like it doing that too much but the videos this is kind of like my favorite part of the job so this is something that i want to personally thank you guys for allowing me to do allowing me to share these with you guys allowing me to create content with you guys because there's nothing i'd really rather do [Music] okay so i thought i was lying i just dropped a whole bunch of [ __ ] on that shelf that i need to clean up anyway but here's the the lighter graveyard it's a few rows deep back here but this is where all lighters go to die if any company sends us lighters we'll use them until they make it to the lighter graveyard i'll forget that bath lady comment below a video i should make for gp's free game i need ideas when you make as much content as i do it's it helps when the when the fans give ideas as well i don't like saying fans because i know people are fans of the show but fan sound it just feels conceited when the viewers for cbd hemp library if you go for those who aren't uh familiar with chl mafia for chl mafia they're good people if you will and i would address all the asap rocky comments i am not asap rocky i get that unbelievable amounts and forever who call whoever called me his poor cousin i am poor so and i do look i guess i look like i could be his cousin so and rather a rather stupid observation if you will i'm really not too mad at it it's a good it's a good joke i sent it to my friends and i got a lot of good thorough laughs i posted on instagram got a lot of good thorough laughs so i appreciate the good laugh it's all the good fun the comments don't mean anything to me please comment helps with the algorithm a little bit the likes helped the most though so please like this video if you've made it this far i'm sorry if it looks like i'm looking off to the side it's because i'm not used to having a screen that interfaces us we're usually just looking at a phone the back of the phone so like this is what i'm used to looking at you know what i'm saying so now that i have this screen to look at i'm just like geez that's what i really look like people are lucky to see me i'm [ __ ] kidding what i am saying is i'm trying to get used to looking at the lens so please forgive me if i look like cockeyed kenny it's rather strange that cbd hemp library got locked up the day bobby schmurder became free and the day daft punk broke up like history's collided on the wrong side of history right now but i think we'll come out on the right side of history you guys aren't surprised with the collective that we have planned whoever wants to join us you guys see the type of content we make you guys see the way we're moving you guys see i'm the type of conversation we have and the kind of kind of conversation we foster we're about to take that worldwide for real and i'm excited to let other people come in and see that and see that cannabis it can be intelligent cannabis can be fun cannabis can be active cannabis can be athletic cannabis can be all those things that society continually tries to tell cannabis it can't be with a cannabis culture it can't be ur the cannabis market it can't be cannabis consumers they can't be well [ __ ] that message i'm not really one for being told what i can and can't be especially with i'm doing legal things i'm excited for this challenge i'm excited to to create this collective i'm excited to to get creative together i'm excited to get cannabis lovers together i'm excited to do something really dope and regardless of youtube regardless honestly vimeo regardless of what platform we need to use to get our voices heard i believe that sergio and i have the ability to get our voices heard and we'll get our voices heard as we as we push forward and as we keep really fighting what i think is the good fight so guys once again thank you for the support thank you for those of you subscribed thank you for those of you who like the videos thank you for those who send us your support via dms thank you for those of you who buy our products we really appreciate it we try to give you guys high quality products very fair prices we try to give you guys as much information in the videos as we can youtube really doesn't want to see us win is like we always say but we're going to keep going appreciate you guys joining me for a video glad to see that these don't go unwatched so it's been another one appreciate it guys peace [Music] you", "6tDEO4-5W7c": "so today i'd like to discuss a question that's been going around which is could south african hemp cultivation exclude cbd and what i mean by that well essentially there's just two options ham cultivation permits and licenses will exclude the processing of cbd for schedule zero products that are over the counter that go into clicks and dust game now what does that mean for industry well essentially what it means is clear u.s imported cbd isolate and distillate products that are derived of dietary supplement grade will become the norm in the country um and it's the end of the discussion because you cannot actually have highly regulated separate 22c1b licenses compete with outdoor grown hemp um and that will basically mean that hemp cultivation in the country will be in focus on hemp create fibers textiles ropes plastics and all ancillary hemp products excluding cbd to be competitive in the cbd space making use of the 22c licenses the only recourse for government is to introduce some form of local protectionism and to also apply taxation on imports of isolate distillate and cbd based products this is not globally competitive but it is potential strategy um neighboring countries like zimbabwe and malawi will probably benefit most because of a more relaxed view on hand processing option two is that hemp cultivation permits licenses will include the processing of cbd to schedule zero over the counter products what that means for industry well you can now use our fantastic sunlight you can use our good labor costs and cultivate hemp for the purposes of cbd extraction now there's going to be clear risks with that the risks are obvious it's going to be quality assurance so looking at pesticides heavy metals aflatoxin testing as well as assessing whether or not you can be running hot hemp we will need processing and testing hubs to be a key player in the quality assurance process it's going to require effort it's going to require enforcement but south africa will ultimately be able to produce its own cbd isolating distillate products that will be able to go into schedule 0 over-the-counter cbd products and promote that we have products locally that are south african produced and sourced um they will still need to go for gmp processing but good manufacturing products yellow production yeah will have to be under dietary supplement grade alignment to be competitive with the standards from the us and not pharmaceutical grade so now if you found this useful and you have contacts and fellow colleagues that are in the hemp and cannabis industry or even in the cbd wellness space i encourage you to share this because we need to lobby to make sure that any decision that's made regarding hemp and cbd's inclusion or exclusion what are the what are the ripple effects of that", "yN6AMSIxx8g": "[Music] you know we've done hot mics before without realizing they were hot mics so i don't think we offended anybody other than each other no we didn't offend anybody we never do that well each other regularly don't we lately that's awesome it's all family right it's all good it's all good hey um thanks for being here by the way and we got just so you know april said to me earlier 263. oh she did she did say that okay wow holy cow um full spectrum broad spectrum distillate and isolate all right that's what we're going to talk about today fsd bsd isolate okay that's gonna be fun yeah it's gonna be a fun show there's a lot of people who want this lots of questions on this thank you for being here uh if you get locked up for whatever reason hit the red button on the top to rejoin it doesn't take kick you out doesn't do anything that's what i love about this ask questions bring them bring them bring them there will be a replay there's lots of resources no holds barred tell us who you are introduce yourself tell us what you do where you are in the process farmer processor chemist engineer just user whatever wherever you are investor user end user isn't everybody an end user sure of something yeah i guess so um yes oh hey by the way louis sadile louis sedillo sadil sedil yeah from commerce california all right is there such a thing as commerce california yeah there is commerce oh jared said he looked it up there's commerce california he won a whole swag bag including a hat and a shirt sweet and you know how he got it he registered no he entered he chatted with our chatbot how sweet with our bot okay our bot picked him awesome okay so talk to the bot the bot is really cool i and he is on fire he talks to me like all night hey somebody wants to talk to you from turkey somebody wants to talk to you from switzerland hey somebody wants to talk to you from asia it is it is it uh dings dings all the time every it does ding all the time so thank you for your questions this is what we run and engage with not only the bot at the bottom of our extract lab.com site with a k by the way um uh on the site at the bottom we still have to name him oh yeah um well i don't know did we change the icon i think we changed the icon on that did we yeah we did so oh yeah i think you if you look at it we no longer have a little bobcat it doesn't has like a little see i engaged via real technology the way the way you guys engage as well um so i didn't see that there it doesn't give me the new little thing no all right anyway thank you for being here today lots of things so bring in the questions don't forget to check out our the live tour uh our cbd jam sessions they are filling up we're we're we're having to add resources for that actually there's a lot coming so we're getting to you as quickly as we can with those cbd jam sessions you can just go online and you know they're 15 20 minutes some go extensive or we add additional ones so you know we're here to help you succeed uh advanced extraction guide distillation guide which is another thing calculator libraries the calculator is getting you guys are burning it up they are calculators are all over the map yeah they're they're they're huge and uh a lot more mini courses on the way so really good and a little shout out to uh james who who came here today he's he's a little sleep deprived had a baby so it's uh but it's exciting yeah it's a warm glow sleep deprivation congratulations james james okay so that's cool all right let's get in because i know you have like a 72 slide presentation it's at least it only takes five minutes where's my sound effects okay no sound effects for you right okay good so i'm gonna i'm gonna let's go all right so this is really cool stuff let's do it so what i want i know you're gonna jump into the presentation right can you do just a little primer of full broad isolate sure okay so here we go the a lot of people use uh cbd in different forms uh to create their formulations okay um these include accrued crude uh they include include uh distillates typically say that five times really fast they include uh isolates and broad spectrum okay and then there's also a category that's kind of up and coming which we've been doing for a long time that's the engineered you know engineered completely engineered where you take uh you know the you break up all the components and then put them back together it would be an engineered formulation engineered formulation yeah right cool some people use winterized oils for example also for tinctures and things like that so um you know we're going to just talk about you know some of the benefits of of each of those and differences and things like that so i sense that there's tasting coming yeah we're going to make you taste of various kinds uh and then we're also going to talk about the entourage effect and my big jar of uh terpenes um i don't know where that went to what it was in the refrigerator i had nothing to do with it i promise nothing it wasn't me all right all right so we'll we'll get it i think it was april for uh stuff so but we're gonna demonstrate the entourage effect using beer okay and so it should be pretty good and we have a disco ball that's out out back yeah we okay uh so uh we're gonna we're gonna go ahead and tune this thing up here tune it up there it is we're gonna share the slides oh here here it comes here we go oh wow you're on you're on cue today i feel a little depressed today what yeah yeah just maybe just i haven't had enough coffee oh i don't i doubt that i doubt that all right here we go let's try it let's try this out all right this is a cool slide oh yeah that's kind of all of our brands there along with our united signs so those are the uh here all the brands that are under united science we got pier 99 we got clear still fractron carbonx extract lab which is our our series of um you know most most well known for a series of extractors of course and then there's me um here's the bulk products that you can get from hemp so a lot of people ask us for example you know what can i get from hemp in terms of the products okay you can you can sell flour okay and you can grind up the flour also and sell it as a blend a lot of times people will get flour if you're doing cbd flour um a lot of times it will have you know an elevated concentration of thc so people like to blend it to get uh the amount down to less than point three percent when we were in the r d lab right we used a little bit of that yeah we did our own brew we did yeah and that was good whoo that was good and then you drank it we made that with everclear so we made a rick simpson oil we really did and he drank the whole thing this was quite an afternoon uh then we got ground material okay um and the ground material is a blended flour typically and the reason you would do that is to get it so it's less than 0.3 percent um so a lot of people do that sometimes also um they add in you know like terpenes for infusion and things along those lines so that's all that is and then you have raffinate some people sell raffinate um you know for various fiber purposes a lot of times you know it's not the raffinate that you would get from say a an extraction is actually quite quite small in terms of the length of the fiber so a lot of people don't use raffinate for for those purposes and then um natural terpenes obviously that's where you get uh you know the natural terpenes that occur that you get out of the plant um if you use our process you know obviously you can get those natural terpenes out by the by the bucket load um and then you have the crude oil you have winterized oil you have distillate isolate and then what's missing on the slide because there's an old slide is the uh broad spectrum and then the engineered basically broad spectrum and formulations so that's typically the broad the bulk products that you get from hemp so you can see it's it's if you have an extraction facility um you know you can sell each and every one of those as a bulk product so a lot that's why it's so attractive to a lot of people you know they they wanna um you know the first two obviously with flowering and blended flour you don't really need to have uh you know an extraction but as soon as you want to get into raffinate or natural terpenes or cbd crude oil or any of the oils or or any of the other isolates sure you know then you need to have those things so absolutely um next slide here so i think this is a kind of a spectrum of the products that you may get from uh starting uh you know over here at the flower and going over all the way over to the right hand side which is the isolate and a lot of people like this picture because it really shows um it really shows the you know how the progression i guess here you have flower on the left hand side and then it goes to you know some ground-up flower and then on the next one slide that's a decarb flower so that's where you're you know molecularly you know decarboxylating the material and in that process is where you can also get all your terpenes and then there's your crude oil in the middle and then as you go to the right here oh yeah this would be more like a winterized crude oil that's with all the waxes taken out and then here's some uh distillate right here and you can see it's starting to crash out and it's also starting to you know crystallize and here's the actual crystals so that's the that's the basic process that you're looking at this is a picture of the plant and those little white things are called trichromes and usually they're all over the flower you can see them in high density on the flower itself you don't really see a lot of trichromes for example on the stems and on the fan leaves and so um the big deal there is uh that a lot of people want to you know use the fan leafs or use the stem or use the root balls or whatever you may find some very minor cannabinoids at an extremely low level in those uh in those parts of the plant but they're not in any high concentration so okay and you can see in these these little white uh you know they look like mushrooms almost um those are where the cbd is so a lot of people will try to you know basically put this under very cold temperatures like liquid nitrogen or co2 dry ice excuse me and actually break those off oh and some people do that um you know try to get it out rather than uh rather than extracting gotcha okay so that that would be another option so this is really the biomass composition typically these numbers they move around considerably depending on where you're getting them and depending on the concentrations of cannabinoids for example but this is just a just for illustration purposes if you look at the weight per weight percent of each of the items you got your biomass um typically you'll have water anywhere from you know five to fifteen percent and of course your your your numbers here will change as your water amount changes you have other components these are basically the phytonutrients that are in the in the uh materials and then you have the waxes and the cannabinoids and the terpenes so that's the biomass composition you know as we go through the the hemp processing side of this we start off with the receiving and then we go into quarantine we go into grinding of course the extraction the dewaxing distillation this distillation step is pretty important because that's where you really that's your feed stock for isolate that's also your feed stock for broad spectrum um and that would also be the feedstock for you know you know the other other things that you would use for formulation so here's the where you formulate and then you go into your packaging so this is kind of the processing and where you get the products out that is a picture a nice looking picture of some crude oil um you can see it almost looks sticky that's because it is um and it's also brightly yellow so this is the stuff that comes right out of the spigot really in your extractor and if you let it if you put it in a jar right away and you just close it um it'll stay yellow really yeah but if you and also you have to just put some just basically protect it from light okay put it so it's not oxygen it's getting light it's light and oxygen okay yeah right um and so but but more so light i think um but yeah so you just put it in there and uh otherwise it'll turn you know like a dark like a darker amber color obviously and uh this would be like a super critical co2 uh style of a uh oil you can also it'll be more soupy and a little bit more light uh more chirpy uh if you're doing like sub-critical runs gotcha so that that's the that's the difference there okay let me see here i'm going to go on to the next one this is a this is an example of say a collection uh that occur you can see it's kind of soupy coming out where it's almost all actually runny yeah um and it's and it's nice and bright yellow um a couple different things here uh you know typically you know if you have um like older material or material that has kind of sat around for a while a lot of times the chlorophylls get broken down in the plant and then you extract it those oils are typically more yellow really as opposed to like super fresh material typically those will extract and they're more amber color so that's that could be this here could also be a function of um you know the age of the material also um on our machine we have three different fractions we have a first fraction second fraction a third fraction typically the first fraction has a lot of the carotenoids that will will basically precipitate out in that first one so that'll be a a little bit of a darker amber than the final fraction which is a more light yellow so that's that and here's the crude composition again um this will change up depending on the amount of terpenes that are left in the uh biomass material and also depends on this here number depends on the pressure and the time so you got a bunch of different variables here so they will vary but um you know on average uh for your crude you're looking at you know 60 to 70 percent okay with uh with a certain amount of waxes in there you can decrease the waxes by going to a lower pressure and also on this one right here if you're using a co-solvent like ethanol for example some people use co-solvents they use like a food grade ethanol in the flow like a one to five percent or something like that this will be very very soupy and uh also yeah it will be about that color but it'll be very soupy so if you use that um you know co-solvent there'll also be ethanol in here so um that would be is the thing about level at three percent that you have here yeah um is that going to be the same if you remove the terpenes at d-carb right so you're removing a lot of those uh lower boiling uh terpenes and the higher boiling terpenes you know stay in there but they're still terpenes so you're getting out um but they are you know they should extract then so you're getting a portion of the terpenes out with the extraction and then you're getting the the terpenes that are mostly um you know responsible for the flavor and aroma and things like that um you're getting that out you know in that vacuum distillation gotcha okay um let me see here so then um here's here's a picture of herdy some of the uh yeah it james took these pictures that's why we love that picture good job james um and you notice how he put the light behind it so he took it in front of the window um there's a whole technique on what you know what you would do to basically um you know take a good picture of distillate um so you want the light to be shining from the back so you can see it nice nice bright yellow absolutely it really looks like you want to warm it up too it has to be warm yeah because the distillate itself is is so potent that it's going to you know typically for cbd it will it will precipitate out and you it'll be it'll be opaque so yeah you have to heat it up so you know if you want to take cbd um distill it roll up pictures like that those are some of the tricks of the trade you know make sure it's backlit make sure it's warm um you know things like that so awesome make sure you have the quick correct exposure with your camera and and things like that so you know here's the distillate composition um here you can see that's different than the crude because you're you're increasing the amount of cannabinoids in the distillate um and you're doing that by um you know removing the other part of the biomass you're removing a part of the you know plant so the you know all the phyto nutrients i guess if you will um it's removing the terpenes um you know this terpene level actually can be even less than than two percent but you know typically the terpenes that come out with the cannabinoids are are like long-chain terpenes so they're um they co-distill there's a very small amount but you really can't smell them in there but they're still in there and then you have um like other other stuff that code distills there and when i use the word stuff that's a highly technical term for what's a term i understand all that other stuff you know yeah it's the plant matter you know what is it it's thousands of compounds and i appreciate you speaking my language yeah okay there we are so yeah and then and then of course there's broad spectrum just kind of flying through these so then we can start a conversation um you know here's um let me see here i like that it looked like there was a straw in that one oh let me see oh it's a smell that's a spoon there look at how nice it's got a nice bum that's a nice color it's just beautiful nice i think that this is broad spectrum stuff and then here's a picture of isolate um so yeah typically when you make isolate you're going to have to you know grind it up if you don't grind it up you know so you want to when you when you make your isolate it's really important that you keep your particle size as small as possible that's a key aspect of isolate production and then um you know obviously you're going to want to make sure it's ground up and then you wash it so a couple different steps there but typically your isolate composition um it's very easy to get like 99 pure okay but you're losing all the other the other plant materials the plant composition you're losing terpenes terpenes are gone water's gone uh you know you maybe have some other stuff in there that you don't really know what it is um it could that other one percent could be other cannabinoids that could that co-precipitate out with the uh with the with the cbd um now i am speaking primarily to cbd here but thc also um if you're making thc isolate you can actually do that you know in your system with a cold finger with your in your extraction system the uh recoveries are not so great with that so you have to have different uh also different forms will precipitate out so typically a decarboxylated uh thc will not precipitate whereas a decarboxylated cbd will participate uh precipitate wow okay so it's kind of a there's some technical things we can go over you know those things in a later okay later program but um you know i think that uh when you're looking at isolate you're typically looking at you know cannabinoids uh that are greater than 99 it looks like a white powder it's pretty cool so okay um so that's that's that um here's a picture of a ball jar yeah with some uh just uh broad spectrum okay and here's the broad spectrum uh composition um you know with the broad spectrum typically you'll you're you'll get some terpenes in there you'll get some cannabinoids in there but your thc will be out of it okay so that's the main difference between uh like a broad spectrum and a full spectrum so really the the main difference okay so full spectrum is everything you get from all the cannabinoids you've got terpenes in there and you have thc right right yeah and typically it's considered to be less than 0.3 percent and then but broad spectrum is all of that without the thc so if it for a layman you're looking at full spectrum includes cannabinoids terpenes and thc at 0.3 percent or below right and broad spectrum is the same but without the thc right okay yeah you got it i get it i think i have oh let me pull this down oh you mean this oh there's a table oh of course of course there's horse still always thinking okay i jumped ahead teach all right all right all right well i find tables to be nice because you can you know kind of you can eat on them you can eat on them yeah you can set drinks on them it's true it's true okay i think it's time that we uh oh no let me try some of these so he wants to calm me down okay so here's uh here's a comparison okay so here you have full spectrum broad spectrum full spectrum and then full spectrum thc there's a difference between cbd and thc and then engineered okay um so with a full spectrum uh cbd you typically have less than point three percent but there's still there's still thc in there um their terpenes are limited okay but they'll they would still have terpenes in there oh trace terpenes basically and you will be able to taste them if you if you taste them um there's other plant components that are present um unlike for example you know like an iceland which have it wouldn't have a lot of those other plant components the cbd amount is really defined by the plant and the other cannabinoids are defined by the plant so if you have a cbg cbd 50 50 plant in the biomass that's kind of what you're going to be getting in your full spectrum oh yeah and the same yeah so that yeah cbg is really hot right now yeah it is well i think a lot of people are growing it and uh and so next you know this coming season everybody's gonna have a cbg product for sure well then the research is getting better because most of the research has been done on cbd and thc and you have terpenes right right and then now they're really growing now you're hearing a lot more about cbg because we're learning more about it right then we're learning more about cbda and cbd cbn right right right right cool stuff yeah um yes so that's uh that now i think uh broad spectrum is where you're really taking out that thc um there you know there's a difference between thc free and thc and non-detect and the difference there is one has no detectable thc with a detector you're using which is typically an hblc uv and you know and then the thc free is also a non-detectable thc that you can't see with the detector that's using so what's the difference [Laughter] i think a lot of people are using the word thc non-detect these days because the fda doesn't want them to use thc free because you can always because it is not necessarily free right right you can always see you know a couple whatever um what's the limit of detection and uh mass spec mass spec it's a very sensitive detector right so you're looking at it and they're saying okay well we can see 10 molecules so therefore it's not dhc free yes so that's why people want to use the word thc non-detect which is also kind of weird because you'd have to really define which detector you're using okay so i don't know so if i start tasting and sampling some of this uh will i be able to detect that with my naked eye no with your naked tongue we're going to make you we're going to make you just check it it's going to be good it's going to be good spectrum thc no spec on the thc at all you can have as much thc as you want there's also limited what is a typical in in full spectrum thc non-spec what is what would be an average or is there not an average it's just is it six percent is it nine percent is it you mean with the wealth full spectrum thc yeah oh um what would be you know 80 80 percent yeah oh wow yeah whoo that's for like marijuana you know um type of event is a lot of people yeah 80 90 even for for like a distillate again it's limited in the terpenes uh there's there's other plant components that are in there um but you know a lot of a lot of times um what the definitions have been kind of evolving um because um you know you have you know people wanting to have okay like they say okay i want a full spectrum with three percent cbg uh six percent cbn and uh uh 60 cbd and no terpenes but less than point three percent thc that that really is an engineered sounds like a custom formula that is like a custom custom program i'm a layman but that sounds custom yeah so that's why i got this other thing over here that says engineered because a lot of people want to like they want to pay full spectrum price but they're asking for engineered formula engineered stuff um how do you do that with syringes no no basically you get cbd isolate or you get cbd broad spectrum you get cbg isolate or cbg broad spectrum thc isolate or thc broad spectrum and then you put them together in the ratios that they wanted along with the terpenes pure terpenes and it's it's a it's a formulations exercise and that can actually be done no problem okay and you can do that can can people do that manually is it yeah yeah it would be done manually so you're just starting from your isolates and you're putting it together okay uh you know so that that would be the main difference and so i i think that a lot of people i mean i think that that's where the market's going um you know um because you have okay here i have a jar of matrix uh here i have a jar of uh my purified terpenes i have a jar of you know purified cbg i have a jar pure purified cbn and then i put them together and the ratios that i got that i want yeah so there's a there's also um i don't i forget the number of cannabinoids but there's quite a few of them i should know it off the top of my 120. was there 120 okay well good good that you know [Laughter] they're so gullible no no no actually i was doing some research because i i knew there would be tables all right and probably a test so i did i did see 120 now i may be wrong hey if you know let me know yeah yeah put it in on the notes so let me see oh we got a whole bunch of comments and questions i know we've been okay that's all right focused on the table so yeah i think you know i think that there's been some confusion over full spectrum cbd and engineered spectrum where a lot of customers if you are in the bulk business where they want to impose an engineered formulation and say it's full spectrum because it's a lot less money actually so just make sure that you have your definitions proper um you know and that you're quoting the right you know obviously an engineered formulation is going to be more expensive than a full full spectrum formulation so and then a broad spectrum you know you use chromatography or solvent techniques to get to a broad spectrum um and what that means is basically you're taking some of that distillate and you're removing the thc and they call that thc remediation or um you know thc removal would be another another word um but you know that's where you get the thc non-detect so that that's kind of um the deal there now when we you know we've you know a couple years ago when before cbd wasn't such a craze when we talked about full spectrum thc we typically were talking about um you know the terpenes um you know like a full spectrum on the terpenes okay and um i think that that still is a good definition but i think uh you know i think that a lot of people have tried to kind of evolve it um because you know let's say go back maybe four or five years ago where where cbd wasn't really talked about a lot um you know we typically would do formulations of thc cbd ratios that would be full spectrum and we kind of always talked about it when we were doing our formulations as okay we're actually you know having a full spectrum uh you know terpenes so that so i don't know i think that the definitions have evolved a little bit yeah and people talk about it in a different way yeah because they're pulling in a lot more of the cannabinoids not yeah that's right so anyway just be careful of it i think that um just make sure that you have if you're quoting it out for a customer if you're a bulk person um you know make sure that you quote out the right you know the right what you're doing yeah because some your customer will have a different definition of full spectrum than you do it's very likely gotcha okay and that the um yeah so i think i made my point there um pros and cons for both products okay crude distillate isolate broad spectrum okay um some of the pros for crude obviously most most like the plant smells great it smells awesome if you get a co2 the crude oil for say um you know for an ethanol will have like that you know a distinct ethanol odor to it okay um so and also it has a full spectrum of terpenes in it that means it's it's got the uh higher boiling terpenes that are also in there right um it's opaque it's not spokeable um it's uh less potent and the terpenes are degrading over time so you can actually see that occur if you just leave it sit there and do a time lapse you can see it turn like from a bright yellow to a you know darker amber gotcha yeah and then the distillate a lot of people go to distillate because it's clear it's desirable color usually it's that light yellow color people love that because it takes great pictures when it's not crystallized of course so it has to be heated up and then backlit and backlit yes limited terpenes but has definite plant taste so if you taste the terpenes it will have a plant taste and usually elevated thc levels um that's kind of the cons so you have to really go to a broad spectrum if you want to get that thc out of there or you have to have a diluent or some way to dilute it so that it's it's less than 0.3 diluent that's what they call it you can do that with mct oil or you can do that with uh like a different type of um i thought that was just another name you called me you diluent sorry isolate white powder no terpenes or fats or waxes nice for formulations if you don't uh want that plant taste so um with the isolate um you know that's where you know if you don't want a distinct terpene or didn't don't want a distinct plant taste at all use the isolate in your formulations but at least resembles the plant so it's it's kind of the most processed that you're going to get and then the broad spectrum it has that clear color as long as it's not crystallized no detectable thc so that's a pro for that but it has that definite plant taste so some people when they're making you know gummies or edibles uh of any kind if or even um or even smokable products you know that those tastes will come into the product okay so if you in your formulation you want to have a nice berry flavor that's clean and clear a lot of times you won't use like crude or distillate or broad spectrum even you'll use some isolate so that's a nice clean clear fruity taste if you want to have a hint of marijuana plant or a hint of hemp plant then you can you use a you know distillate or isolate maybe together um you know kind of formulate it together to get the taste and the flavor that you're that you're really looking for so that's a lot of fun and that's actually the that's actually the funnest part of the whole process and that is you got all your stuff there you got all your different types and you're actually testing things out you're trying them they're they're tasting good oh that didn't taste good i don't like that's too much and you're really making a formula sure so and there's an there's basically an infinite we did that in the r d lab yeah we did yes we did and it was fun um we did uh we did a what was that the extraction of with everclear we did extraction of flour with everclear and he drank the whole thing it was i was very impressed oh well yeah good we had a good afternoon after that wow i actually did i did i got a lot done well i think i got a lot done he basically like that so let's try some of these okay yeah it's gonna be good this is fun all right i'm in oh and we are going to talk about the entourage effect good we need yeah and we got an illustration because i do have a couple slides on that but we'll come back to it okay so let me let's go to some we're going to do some trials whenever we talk about the entourage effect i really want a disco ball i don't know why just okay you start off with isolate first okay um let's see here isolate yeah i can tell that's isolate yeah because yeah because that's what it says right there i sell it that's how i know here you want do you want to i can't climb some gloves yeah do i put them on my head uh no oh sorry no i used to do that to my kids okay remember that elijah yeah there look at that all right all right here let's see what we got here they've been kind of set up with a little what's awesome about this is you're going to do all the testing yeah is that what's awesome about this yes yes you are yes you are yeah don't don't cough into that here we go i'm tasting yeah you can taste that yeah yeah taste it just a little tiny bit you don't need a lot just just a little bit just a little bit yeah do i just take it sure it's a little tiny there you have any taste of it there's really not taste no there's no flavor it does not have yeah no no flavor no taste nothing not just kind of so you can see that if you want to have like a berry flavor or whatever you know this is the stuff that you bring yeah let's bring it on so you can just yeah this is highly insoluble in water though so keep that in mind it will not go into water it does not blend because it's not small enough right yeah no it's not yeah well that could that's a part of it but no it's just higher it's very hydrophobic it's it's like yeah it is not going to go into water it'll so so you put it in water if it's hydrophobic it's afraid of water if you put this into your tea this will likely stick to the walls you know you you won't be or it'll float on the top it looks like scum so um you want to have more like a water-soluble thing we don't we haven't really talked about that but we can do that later um yeah here let's just kind of put it on my piece of paper there yeah because what we're gonna do this is uh let's try this one next this is broad spectrum we're cleaning this up um you can see it's all crystallized out um we have this we make this by the leader obviously let's see here so broad spectrum distillate this is one kilo all right let's try that's a big taste oh smells great yeah yes okay oh he's getting the big spoon oh my god okay here it is okay we're gonna try this out here oh that's got flavor yeah yeah let's see here that's got flavor well let's see it's all crystallized out here yeah but you can you can taste the plant you can taste the oh yeah terpini it's it's but and it's soft the flavor is not sharp no it's it's more soft or rounder that's beautiful and you taste it on the tip of your tongue you know what's nice about i like you know what i like about bronze spectrum is that as opposed to like a distillate you know it doesn't like the distillate will stick to your tongue yeah and i mean usually you can you can taste it in the back of your mouth for a long long long time that's why we save that for last right but this is more on the front of your mouth yeah it is yeah and it and i don't there's no film no so i i really broad spectrum i kind of like that no thc yeah this stuff has a little bit of elevated obviously because it's in process so we're gonna take a little take a little bit of that i'm so excited yeah this is gonna be a great time okay here we go okay oh man stuff gets so hard okay you can see it's definitely darker see that because when it goes through that chromatography process it it basically um you know takes out more of the plant matrix so you don't you know he's laughing i don't taste it as much oh oh okay then it hit me it's in the back of the throat yeah because the other you taste at the front of your mouth but this one just went as i pull it back it was like whoo there it is yeah all the way in that really just kind of embraced the whole back of your tongue now if you if you put this uh if you smoke this stuff um you know typically you want to make sure that you you you're going to want to put some terpenes back into it and you you're not going to want a lot though i mean you're very very little it's only a hint otherwise it'll burn in your nose and things like that so you don't want that no no no i'm gonna try a little bit i don't want that oh isn't that yeah it's it goes to the back yeah yeah oh there there it is this is kind of like a development yeah sneaks up yeah that's good so there we got some isolated i don't think we're gonna try and accrued but i think that this is this is fine this is fine so that's what look uh if you ever have a chance to you know get some bulk uh you know bulk taste and just do some taste testing actually that's that's a lot of fun it is it is fun yeah and and one of the things that i'm i'm thinking is the growing population who's using cbd are boomers yeah really i mean that is i mean we're in a 5 billion dollar industry yeah and it's growing to like 23 26 billion i've heard different numbers says the boomer over the next three years and i'm a boomer okay but most of the uh i mean my father he's 85 okay and he doesn't want to get high and they're terrified of getting high any boomer who's taking cb they don't want i don't wanna i don't wanna get high i don't wanna get high and they equate that terpene smell and taste with the potential of get high yes they do yeah but and we're going to get into the entourage effect and talking about that but you know you want to open the receptors so that you get that full effect right of the all of everything yeah and that's that's what's key so even though it's non-detect at 0.3 percent thc there's enough in there to open the receptors so you get that benefit of all of the cannabinoids and terpenes yeah right right yeah right so for example if you if you're going to formulate like a gummy or something like that you don't want it to have any plant taste at all you'll certainly get the cbd in there yeah but you want to use you'll have very low you know you'll have limited bioavailability because it's going in being metabolized in your gut um but it will maintain the clear taste so a lot of people who want to just you know have flavors being the number one thing then yeah you definitely use that and that's why the biggest growth right now in cbd is the isolate that's why you're hearing you there's a big market for isolate out there because of that growing boomer population right who wants it in their product but they don't want to taste that really cool terpening but they're missing the entourage right now exactly now if you can take obviously you can take these and you can put you know terpenes in there and that you know that's called typically people call that like a dab for example or you know some people smoke that um but that gets you the entourage effect plus a pure isolate okay got it yeah all right and and that's why if you do that's just a formulation so broad and full spectrum are just you know you want that full effect as often as you can but many of the big processors putting stuff in all of the the big things are using more isolate yeah because they they don't they're they're looking for that mass thing but you in order to get good formulations right and good taste and flavor you want to use full or broad spectrum that gives you the better flavor right right right sorry right when you laugh at it i just like alexis common uh calm down mom this cbd isn't gonna get you high or stoned that's pretty good damn it all right oh sorry okay how many of you out there would like to see your mom high oh everybody behind this needs to raise their hand that's something that would be interesting i think my kids raised their hands did you bring those pre-rolls here for a reason yeah okay yeah there we go pre-roll pre-roll okay so these are interesting yeah also because what you you get the full effect right you do so you get the full effect and it's it's the plant but when it's light here's the one thing i learned from you just recently is because of the the lighting and igniting it the burning actually decarboxylates yes yeah and which i've learned the decarboxylation actually activates the thc whether it's non-detect or not right and the cbd right and without the d carb it's kind of pointless yeah the the absorption rates are quite low like minuscule yeah so so yeah worthless yeah well yeah and i think that they're just an unknown unknown effect there's no bioavailability that's what they say yeah so you need d-carb right you need an activation lab pretty much you need to do that yeah some people like for example they um they'll take the biomass and they'll decarb it and then put those into capsules the decarb so that it would you can take it into your stomach and it will absorb up really yeah cool who knew um you wanna and by the way how uh we do have a replay uh so that's coming up so you'll you'll have access to the sure um also and you know some people want a copy of your your presentation and i don't know that we have that available but we will have the replay out yeah so you guys can take a look at it let's go talk a little bit about the entourage because i want to get into into our beer tasting session oh yeah let's go what the heck are we waiting for all right uh okay so here's the pros and cons for the bulk products okay i'm gonna i'm gonna take that you just say hey randy shut up i will prob or move literally i made this five minutes before he really did i really did so so i'm gonna i'm gonna probably um i'm gonna probably you know evolve it a little bit and uh see if i can come up with something a little bit more that's power more power yeah no no i mean that is power he can evolve it look at like formulations doesn't that look like a great collage yeah oh my gosh yeah you know powerpoint did that for me automatically really yeah i just threw the pictures in there and i pushed i created a button that said yeah it gave me this isn't that great that is that's power yeah that is your power okay so what is the entourage effect thank you for uh correcting my spelling james uh here we go so here we go this is some of the beautiful ground material it smells wonderful okay and um and what we want to do thank you for not letting me taste that basically take this into well let's back up i think we should oh one of those open up one of those pre-rolls say we do a taste test on that okay okay no that would derail us we got jars of flour back you guys have seen uh this uh this picture was also taken by james because he's so great at photographer um and yes that is snow that he has that in it looks like it's on the mountain and actually he said he took it right in our parking lot he just mounted up a little snow on there it's pretty good but you can see the different colors that's that's from different strains okay um and they do taste different they have um different uh you know different terpenes that are you know dominant in there okay um so let's let's talk a little bit about some pharmaceutical dynamics pharmacodynamics pharmacodynamics pharmacodynamics pharmacodynamics farming cone dynamics you did it oh my gosh okay okay so this is this is what your body does with the cbd for example the two cbd receptors the cb1 and the cb2 um and this is very well known you guys can take a look in fact um there is a world health organization report that is actually quite nice because it summarizes all the data and the use and the adverse effects and everything is in there it's really good nice summary you can get it online i would recommend that if you want to learn more about you know you know how the cbd actually acts in your body go download that it's free and just type in wh o cbd report you'll be able to get it but there's some different things cbd does not appear to uh act directly with the cb1 receptors so it is a kind of a it's it's thought of it to be an agonist for example um neuroimaging studies in humans and animals have shown that cbd has effects which are generally opposite those of thc so um you know it has uh it has a different different set of effects okay some see some studies have shown that cbd may reduce or agonize some of the effects of thc and the mechanism is unclear a lot of people are looking for how does this actually work i'm laughing you said agonize and i i like that stop it that would be agonizing but the the word you have on the screen is antagonized and i think that that was antagonized agonize and taken i think actually we do antagonize one another in a good way in a good way absolutely yeah and i think we can agonize well that would mean we're synergistic oh wow yeah i know right is that like a cb1 and cb2 receptor okay so the cbd goes in there it's there there are some receptors it's not not interacting with those receptors okay so cb1 is more nero cb2 is more gastrointestinal and yes that's what i kind of read it still it still is has some unknown effect within that endocannabinoid system here it's been shown to modulate several non-endocannabinoid signaling why didn't i think of that yes so here they are adenosine uptake uh there's enhanced activity at this receptor okay so these are all um in the blockade of the orphan g protein coupled receptor gpr55 that's actually pretty important so if anybody has taken a dna test to show you know okay 23 and me baby yeah exactly to show hey look here's here's the ancestry that i can affect you yeah for example they're going to be looking for markers that have you know these types of proteins or these receptors in there and they're going to say okay it's it's likely that you're going to have a greater effect uh you know for this so they're looking at they're taking the mechanism of how it's working in your body they're looking at the proteins that your body is making and then the dna uh the dna will say okay here you have this uh you you're you're making this protein and it's probably going to have this effect on you so there's actually the they there's some dna tests out there i took one yeah i did yeah do you have history uh yes i can't remember what it said it said that it will make you fall asleep immediately stop it don't do that hey by the way richard just said that um there are recent research saying that the terpenes connect the cbd to cb2 oh that's cool i think that is cool that is cool thank you richard yeah that's nice um so yeah there's a lot of stuff going on there um so let me let me kind of skip down here because why am i talking to you about this i'm talking to you about this because um cbd they're trying to figure out how it interacts uh richard has pointed out that hey look we have uh look we're we're looking at it and apparently you know it's interacting with the cb2 type you know cb2 receptor but then there's all this other stuff like uh all of the different terpenes there's the flavonoids there's the other plant materials there's literally thousands of compounds that that are in there and and there's what's what's known as an entourage effect and don't forget the tetrahydrocannabinol yeah well that that too ah that is called an entourage i read that it's thc that will definitely give you an entourage effect um but yeah so all of those compounds are acting and they're the reason we call it the entourage effect is because we don't really know what it is because in order to really understand you'd have to isolate it taking it in in take it in isolation and then have a certain thing targeted uh indication that you're targeting for that you know so actually um if you have thousands of compounds you take it it looks that's why and it looks like it's doing something you don't really know what it is that's acting on it is it the cbd is it the combination of cbd plus all of the all of the other compounds it's just really hard to know sure so um that's that's the main thing so um so that's what they call the entourages effect this is basically uh scientists haven't figured it out yet so they give it a cool name and it is a cool name yes go ball baby um and alexis has a you know has a good point as well that we'll come back to on on the absorption of this with water solubility all right but before i jump there i want to talk just briefly about the fact that um when earlier there was a comment and i'm not finding it at the moment and that is that there's a um isolate that brought full and broad spectrum are better for you than isolate and it's and i don't think it's a matter of better for you it's to you have an entourage effect in both full and broad a full an entourage effect other than broad has no thc so you you're missing or non-detect right hc so you're missing that element yeah and i don't i don't know if it's really proper to even say like for example if you don't have the entourage effect that it's not helpful for you right because it because not as helpful right because there's there's a lot of research saying that the entourage effect does have good effect yeah better effect but it's an unknown because it's it's unknown and it's always changing and you don't really know what compounds are in there okay so you don't have an indication so you don't really know so it's just kind of like oh everybody's it's just different it's just different it's just different i wouldn't say it's better i'd say it's just different right okay right so finally i think it's fine we'll go with your answer okay all right all right uh let me see here so and i want to just mention okay i know you're going on but there's a lot of a lot of talk out there about water solubility which is a pipe dream there it because you said it's water phobic um yeah well okay no no so there's a couple different ways to do that okay either you you put it together with a surfactant and then you then you drink it and it will make it water-soluble right um or you can reduce the particle size to the point where it is small and it and it suspends in the water okay so those are two different ways to do that um there's there's called there's also self-emulsifying systems so um if you put it with a surfactant that's an emulsifier um and you know typically you need one or two different you know you got oil and water immersions or or um you know most of the sounds like things like that a future show yeah yeah it does we should do a whole show on that i i agree and i i guess the point is that water solubility has a lot it's a new burgeoning idea and the reason you know i think alexis made the comment that it's it's it's the best way to absorb it because it's it's the micron levels of those are so small that could be yeah they go in there yeah they could be more bioavailable there's also liposomes that's what was going through my mind of course you can take that and and supposedly you have bioavailability that's pretty high um you know we've seen a lot of enhanced bioavailability also with like a sugar sugar um you know mixture so things along those lines um interesting we'll do it so okay sorry i didn't mean to get away from it no no problem this is a pretty graph it is i have to say this is probably one of your prettiest graphs really yeah oh i didn't make it that's why okay so terpenes and cannabinoids work together synergistically to produce a therapeutic effect you can see that there's other um different uh you know different terpenes here have their own therapeutic effects like anti-inflammatory anesthesic uh analgesic sedative effect okay acid reflux here anti-anxiety limonene okay these are shown to basically produce those other effects so when you add that with the cbd that's what's called the entourage effect okay so so you're adding to the already entourage effect inside right right okay so here you go you have it i mean um main finding so these are basically a summary of all the different uh you know main terpenes that are that you would find in the plant and then along with um what the main findings are now these these right here are not clinical studies uh just to let you guys know they're they're one-off papers their combination they're just a compilation of non-controlled studies and what that means for you out there if there's opportunity to do the studies yeah absolutely go run like the wind buttercups right so like for example if um you know some people you know tr they usually they'll separate out a d-limonene or they'll separate out uh linoleum and then they'll they'll check it you know as a different uh weight every time you say linoleum i think you're drink too much little little terpenol terpene i don't know it's just a little linoleum so here's another here's another set this neural lidale [Music] like a new car smell really yeah yeah yeah it tastes it smells really good i feel like that kind of oh it doesn't taste good at all though it's not just i tried a little bit of it like oh my gosh this is really bad it doesn't taste as good no it's not smells great yeah yeah so if you want that news car smell tincture yeah i mean that's your terpene right that's your turn it'll taste like [ __ ] but it smells great yes oh got that new car smell so um you know i apologize i have my own little illustration uh for um you know the entourage effect why doesn't that surprise me okay here it is right here right here here we go okay um the deal with this is uh this is an ipa this has got lots of terpenes in it and i don't know if you have more than one pint of ipa you're kind of you kind of maybe put you to sleep you know you're like feeling a little tired definitely feeling yeah definitely um if you have like a light beer uh does not have uh you know any terpenes any hop it's got some hot flavor but very little hot flavor cool crisp clean taste like coors light for example nice can that's that's that's a giant can there so uh yeah we're gonna sample this now yeah exactly so this is this is the not this is the one without the entourage effect and you can have a lot more of this than you can the ipa you know super poppy speak for yourself no that sounds like a challenge you're gonna you're gonna definitely uh you know fall asleep so here's our uh well is that why they say there's a pork chop in every bottle yeah and then we got a can here all right well here i got i got us some taste testing so i can only find scotch glasses so sorry we're gonna have that these are really bourbon glasses there's no they're scotch bags they're bourbon cookies look look right here see that yeah i see it it's the glenn karin oh oh yeah okay these are scotch glasses i apologize hey the timer is on there yeah i hear i hear the timer yeah okay so we're gonna try this i'm gonna try this okay and then okay there you go that's what we're doing whoa all right that's a weak poor man wow it is okay so so this is this okay so we're doing here this is the ipa yeah this has a lot of terpenes in it um i don't know exactly what what the terpene content is but if you smell it you can you can smell the terpene oh yeah it smells great oh it's awesome that's not unlike our distillate taste it kind of tastes like distillate only liquid yeah well yes it does okay so now the ipa does grab the back of your definitely grab yeah just like the other okay i'll drink the rest of that later and so now it's not smoky it's clear oh that's that's uh nice and crystal clear it there's no like aftertaste it doesn't linger and just like the differences you taste this more at the front of your tongue yeah really yeah it's pretty amazing okay okay so um again you have beer which is uh like an ipa it's got lots of terpenes in there it in when i drink ipa i like a lot of it it definitely makes me sleepy does it yeah uh whereas if i drink like a light beer i it's like it has no effect at all wow so um maybe that's for you is that not for you well i'm i'm i'm i'm a bourbon guy okay but i'll drink whatever okay apparently we're gonna test this out yeah it's gonna yes that's right kyle's coming in at four okay all right so we'll try this out again kyle so uh yeah so that that's uh that's kind of the difference so they both have similar alcohol content and by the way but but there's a lot of terpenes renato agrees with knowing that these are bourbon glasses really yeah the scotch people just stole them no no renato it's the it's look it says the glenn curran that understand so it has to be scotch glasses i get it i get it i get it okay all right what are we doing i think that's it what yeah that's come on this is too fun well here here you go you want to try some more of course i do all right we have some more as well right all right too bad we don't have all the versions of our guests with us that would be fun i know well they can have some hey um okay and the that report that you were doing was the who cbd report where world health organization i think it was done by a couple professors down in uh university of kentucky so phd's yeah i think so they can work higher and deeper baby professors professors not phds oh yeah here's the phd and here's a professor professors above above yes you're a phd yeah exactly you have to you know you have to get there yeah you have to get there i i couldn't i couldn't do it okay so who can drink more ipa you definitely getting this i'll fall asleep i was i was really asking about a phd or a professor uh you know professors usually they go to bourbon or scotch i don't know they don't have enough bang for the buck uh with the beer so okay uh thank you oh you are well i'm no we don't need coffee yet alexis we're doing this is fun okay and thank you for being here thank you for all the questions and again earlier april told me 263 yeah and this is available for replay be here oh richard says ipa has hum humulin humulin okay all right oh that's it that's probably why i'm sleeping and if you drink more of it it's humor lean or at least we think it's humor sage is something promising cancer treatment sweet really rich is up on his stuff there i know dude i'm gonna have to get on the phone with you he's more professional yeah right yeah i guess so way to go dude all right and i just called a professor dude uh not not cool no that's irreverent that's irreverence yes sorry sorry dude that's what the professor's usually thank you for being here this is good remember we've got the calculators talk to our bot and we still have to name the bot i have to see what it looks like now we got to show that boring now what yeah it doesn't look like a whoa i don't know we gotta we gotta change it we gotta change it and because he's really cool actually i think he's always high but he knows his stuff he does he's very focused a focused high okay uh live tour calculators cbd jam sessions extraction guides um distillate guides mini courses are coming uh we covered everything on the list one other thing uh yeah we did this last week we did a bunch of product tours so um those should be up on our website here uh by the end of the week so if you want to take a look at you know our product tours a lot of you have been asking for that because as we're going through and talking about evaporation we've been talking about distillation we've been talking about white film falling film all of that and this is real life stuff right yeah so basically what it has is an it's a picture of our equipment and then you can hover over all the different pieces and you can see okay here's what it does and things like that so people will like it all right thank you for being here uh engage with the bot engage on our site youtube channel has a lot of resources um extractlab.com dxtraktlab.com has a lot of resources on it blog calculators get to our youtube channel like us subscribe our podcasts go there this is all on podcast yeah it is and we've got it available on video and audio uh we we did go a little long it's um a little 11 minutes over sorry about that but boy was it fun i loved it so thank you again um and give us ideas of what you want to hear about uh i like that that helps us a lot oh my gosh there's a lot of stuff coming through thank you thank you thank you for being here we're good uh great show all right man this was fun i'm drinking more all right thanks for being here see you next time hot mike you", "Xe9D0k_bXHk": "[Music] so [Music] look at me [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay i [Music] i wanna make it in my room is [Music] right [Music] in my room [Music] i wanna thank him [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] been do a [ __ ] pose oh boo gonna die really froze", "T7QdIpttixs": "[Music] welcome to another episode of the cooking with cannabis series my name is chef Cody Lindsay and today we are making tincture cannabis tincture is the oldest form of dispensing cannabis as the medicine and it's super simple all it is is alcohol 80 proof or higher with cannabis added into it the THC will dissolve off the flour into the tincture and off you go today we're gonna be using shish kebob as well as CBD God bud so any kind of alcohol you want to use right now we're gonna make that two different kinds we're going to make a clear one and then we're gonna make a dark one and we're going to use it in two separate applications that they should show you that you're gonna use in your cooking so we're gonna start here with the dark rum one cup and then we're gonna go with gin I chose gin because it's a nice fruity kind of flavor it's not too overpowering it's the same thing a cup so we're gonna use the CBD in with the dark rum because the application that we're going to use in we're not going to want it too high in THC so we're just going to add that in there 3.5 grams of cannabis into the one cup of dark rum and then we are also going to add 3.5 grams of cannabis into this one cup of gin and that's as easy as it is all you do is put the lid back on give it a stir put the lid back on give it a stir strain after 24 hours and you're done we're gonna make some beautiful vanilla extract we have our dark rum here kind of in the same way that we made the tincture is the same way we're gonna make the vanilla extract all we're gonna do is cut our vanilla beans in half dump them in close the lid about a month later you'll have the best vanilla extract you've ever tasted in your whole life and the next one we're going to create cannabis infused sugar so we already have our gin tincture ready to go we're gonna take two tablespoons of our gin tincture add it into our two cups of sugar and that's going to give us cannabis infused sugar add that in and then just mix it all around you can see it's starting to come together starting to get a little wet so you simply take that sugar add it onto a pan this is what we're gonna do is we're gonna dry it out we're gonna evaporate some of the alcohol and then we're gonna come back and have it ready now it's ready to be put in a 220 degree oven for approximately half an hour oh yeah perfectly good see the alcohol is evaporated of course the sugars gonna stick together a little bit it's been wet it's been added to some heat to your sugar dish so there you go two tinctures two additional recipes to use of those tinctures and multiple multiple ways you can use them thank you very much for joining us today if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up and subscribe and share and please visit the walnut soldier calm where you to find many recipes and our cooking with cannabis cookbook then again thanks very much [Music] you", "2mPgN8FttQE": "hi I'm drew owner of connoisseur concentrates and I'm Kendall logistics coordinator at connoisseur concentrates today we're going to be explaining our solution sample pack what comes in it and how to correctly use it connoisseur concentrates has created an all-natural terpene blend solution that can be used with any extract to turn it into a liquid to be used in any vapor pen without the need for PG VG or P eg our solution is geared to industrial manufacturers of vapor pens dispensaries and people's wishing to start their own company manufacturing vapor pens our sample pack is a great inexpensive way for you to try a few flavors and see what you like before committing to some of our larger sizes our sample packs include three different flavors of our solution with 0.6 grams in each file it also has three disposable vapor pins which match each flavor it also has a mixing vial an eyedropper to fill your pens more easily we found that you only need about a half a gram of the solution to turn any extract into a liquid for a vapor pen it depends on how hard you're starting extract is and how soft you want your ending viscosity to be depending on what type of vapor pen you're using so for a hard shatter normally use about a half a gram if you're starting out with a softer oil sometimes you can use a quarter gram and depending on how soft your oil is for co2 extracts you may only need a few drops to start you take the mixing vial that was included in your sample pack put it on your scale and tear it out then you add one gram of your extract into the mixing vial once you have your extract weighed out it's time to add your solution you may notice depending on what flavor you pick that your solution is separated which is perfectly normal it's a variation between the terpenes and the flavouring and once you mix it in with your extract it's going to stay blend it and not separate again so go ahead and shake up your bottle a little bit open it up and you're going to want to add approximately 0.3 to 0.5 grams and it's really going to depend on what type of extract that you started with again if you started with something hard like shatter go ahead and add a half a gram and if you started with something pretty runny and start out with the third of a gram you can always add more it's a little harder to add less once you've added your solution to your extract it's time to blend the two together you have a couple different options of doing this normally what we do is we just heat it up a little bit with the lighter in your sample file and it's going to mix in real nicely it takes about 30 seconds of blending and then you're all done we all know that heating your extract and darken it so there's a couple different options if you're really interested in art darkening your oil at all you can let it sit overnight or sit there and start for awhile with no heat and it's going to blend in together if you just want to get it done heat it up just a little bit and it's going to blend in real quickly although you may just get a shade darker for today's purposes I'm going to go ahead and heat it up with the lighter and let you see what it looks like when you blend it using just a normal flame what we recommend is that you heat the solution with the lighter just until it starts to boil you'll see it bubbling just a little bit it's already hot at that point you don't need to heat it any more then you take your stirrer rod and start blending the two together it's very simply it's important to note that it may not blend in the first five seconds sometimes you got to take 30 seconds to blame if you're in a rush you can heat it a little more but a little patience is a helpful here if you're trying to retain your color that heat is enough to blend most things and simply stirring it for 20 or 30 seconds is good if you notice it's not fully blended or it's not the way that you like it just add a little bit more heat to it and continue to stir and it will blend right up for you if you're making see-through vapor pens like the 5-10 styles and color is extremely important you just let it sit overnight if you let it sit with no heat it's going to dissolve and blend on its own you're not going to lose any coloring and it's going to work perfectly if you're feeling the burner included in the sample pack you're going to notice that there's a small white tube on the inside of the burner make sure that your liquid does not go in that tube that's an air return - there's a sponge on the exterior of that tube that's where you're going to want to put your liquid make sure not to overfill your burner you only want to put a half a gram you want to make sure that the liquid gets all the way absorbed into the sponge or it's going to leak out at the top remember it holds about 1/2 of a gram which is about one inch up from the bottom of your eyedropper once your sponge is fully saturated with liquid we've included some tops for your pens go ahead and put your top on and then you're ready to go each pen is rated for about 400 puffs which means that it's realistically going to hold one half gram you'll go all the way through it you may be able to fill it one more time but it's really only rated for one use but if the battery lasts go ahead and give it a try remember that our disposable pans are simply that they're just there in case you don't have your own vapor pen it's not going to replace one of the really cool vapor pens that you can buy at the store feel free to get any vapor pen you want they work well in any vapor pen but in case you don't have one and you don't really want to run out to the store and commit to that we've just included some inexpensive ones in the kit so that you have something to sample without having to run all over the place once you've had a chance to play around with our sample pack and find out if this product works for you contact us we have larger options for the solution we've also got some good options on all the disposable pens we have a good line the 510 pens any hardware you need let us know we also have some solutions for filling bottling and any size scale we can comment thank you for watching our video we hope you enjoy your sample pack please write us a review and let us know what you think and for larger applications be sure to check out our both mixing instructions see you soon",

I'm Josh Farquharson and\nwelcome to Reading Syringes. Learning how to read a syringe could be the difference\nbetween giving patients the correct dose of\nmedication and helping them or giving the patients\nwrong doses of medication and harming them. By the end of this lesson, you will identify and interpret\nthe graduation marks on various syringes, determine the amount of medication in various types of syringes. First, we will examine the parts of the syringe. The tip is where the needle\nhub attaches to the syringe. The barrel is a reservoir for holding the syringes contents. The content may include liquids or gases, but for the rest of this lesson, I will just refer to the\ncontent as medication. Flanges provide a\nsurface for the clinician to securely grasp the syringe during injection procedures. The plunger moves back and\nforth inside the barrel of the syringe. This allows the clinician\nto draw medication into the syringe and expel\nmedication out of the syringe. At the top of the plunger is a rubbery tip called the stopper. The stopper prevents medication from leaking around the plunger. You will notice that the\nstopper has a top ring and a bottom ring. The top ring acts as an indicator for measuring the medication\ncontained within the barrel of the syringe. On the barrel are bold graduation marks. Graduation marks allow for the measurement of the syringe's contents. The first graduation mark represents zero while the last graduation mark represents the syringe's capacity or the total amount the\nsyringe was designed to hold. These marks typically represent\ncubic centimeters, ccs, milliliters, mLs or units. If you see syringes that have\nccs, mLs or both, don't worry, the amounts are equivalent. One cc is the same as one mL. We will cover the graduation\nmarks on five milliliter, three milliliter, one\nmilliliter, and U-100 syringes. There are many other sizes of syringes, but once you finish this lesson, you will feel confident in\nreading syringes of any size. Now let's focus on interpreting the values of the graduation marks on the syringes. To interpret the values\nof graduation marks, we will use a three-step process. Step one, determine the increments of the visible numbers. To find the increment, observe the visible numbers and determine how much\nthey are increasing by. On this five milliliter syringe, this line represents one milliliter, this represents two milliliters and so on. Therefore, the visible\nnumbers are increasing in increments of one. Step two, count the steps\nto the next visible number. First, I want you to notice\nthat you have long lines which have the visible\nnumbers next to them and the short lines which do\nnot have any visible numbers next to them. So to determine the values\nof those shorter lines, we will count how many\nlines it takes to get from one visible number to\nthe next visible number. We will use a line of the\nfirst visible number, one, as your starting point. With your finger on the starting point, count how many steps it\ntakes for you to land on the next visible number. One step, two step, three\nsteps, four steps, and five. It takes five steps to get\nto the next visible number. Notice that we did not\ninclude the starting point as one of the steps. We only counted the lines after the starting point\nand stopped counting once we landed on the line\nof the next visible number. So the answer to step two is five. It took five steps for us to\nget to the next visible number. Step three, divide the increment\nby the number of steps. For step three, all you need to do is divide the answer from step one by the answer in step two. When the increment of one is divided by the number of\nsteps, five, it equals 0.2. Therefore, each line on the syringe represents a value of 0.2. That means this line indicates\na value of 0.2 milliliters. This is 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 1.4 and so forth. So how much does this line represent? If you stated 3.4\nmilliliters, you are correct. How about this line? If you stated 4.8, you are correct. Now let's get a little more realistic. Instead of using an arrow, let's use the top ring of the stopper as our indicator and fill\nthe syringe with medication. When observing the stopper, you will notice that there\nis a bit of a cone shape at the tip. Ignore the cone-shaped area and measure the amount of medication by focusing only on the\ntop ring of the stopper. For example, notice the\ntop ring highlighted in red is touching the two milliliter line. This indicates that this\nsyringe contains two milliliters of medication. You try the next one. How much medication is in this syringe? If you stated 0.6\nmilliliters, you are correct. One more. How much medication is in this syringe? If you stated 3.2\nmilliliters, you are correct. Great job. Now that you are comfortable with reading a five milliliter syringe, we will use this three-step process to read the next few syringes. Let's apply the steps to reading this three milliliter syringe. Step one, determine the\nincrements of the visible numbers. The visible numbers are 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and so on. That means the visible\nnumbers are increasing in increments of half or 0.5. Step two, count the steps\nto the next visible number. Our starting point is 0.5. And as you see, it takes five steps after the starting point to\nland on the next visible number. Step three, divide the increment\nby the number of steps. When the increment of 0.5 is divided by the number of steps, five, it equals 0.1 ml. Therefore, each line on the syringe represents a value of 0.1 mls. This line is 0.1. This is 0.2, 0.3 and so on. Now that we know the value\nof all the graduation marks, let's determine the amount\nof medication in the syringe. How much medication is in this syringe? If you stated 0.7\nmilliliters, you are correct. Try one more. How much medication is in this syringe? If you stated 1.9\nmilliliters, you are correct. Great job. Now we'll just apply the steps to reading a one milliliter syringe. Step one, determine the\nincrements of the visible numbers. The visible numbers are 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and so on. That means the visible\nnumbers are increasing in increments of 0.1. Step two, count the steps\nto the next visible number. Our starting point is 0.1. And as you see, it takes 10 step after the starting point to\nland on the next visible number. Step three, divide the increment\nby the number of steps. When the increment of 0.1 is divided by the number of steps, 10, it equals 0.01 milliliters. Therefore, each line on the syringe represents a\nvalue of 0.01 milliliters. So this line is 0.01. This is 0.02, 0.03 and so on. Let's jump ahead so you can get a better idea of how the marks increase\nthroughout the syringe. Here is 0.09. Here is 0.1, but to make\nthis a bit more intuitive, you can also look at\nthis line as being 0.10 because after 0.10 is 0.11, 0.12 and so on. So what is the value of this line? If you stated 0.21, you are correct. Now that you know the value of all the graduation marks, let's determine the amount\nof medication in the syringe. How much medication is in the syringe? If you stated 0.59\nmilliliters, you are correct. Try one more. How much medication is in this syringe? If you stated 0.65\nmilliliters, you are correct. Great job. And that brings us to our last\nsyringe, the U-100 syringe. The U-100 syringe is commonly\nused for insulin injections and doses of insulin\nare measured in units. Therefore, instead of saying milliliters in your final answer, for this syringe, you will state\nunits in your final answer. Now let's apply the three-step process to this 100 unit syringe. Step one, determine the\nincrements of the visible numbers. The visible numbers are 10, 20, 30, 40, and so on. That means the visible\nnumbers are increasing in increments of 10 units. Step two, count the steps\nto the next visible number. Our starting point is 10. And as you see, it takes five steps to land\non the next visible number. Step three, divide the increment\nby the number of steps. When the increment of 10\nis divided by the number of steps, five, it equals two. Therefore each line on the syringe represents a value of two units. This line is two, this is four, six, and so on. And now that you know the value of all the graduation marks, let's determine the amount\nof medication in the syringe. So how much medication is in this syringe? If you stated 38 units, you are correct. One more. How much medication is in this syringe? If you stated 74 units, you are correct. Well, we went through all of the syringes, but before I end this lesson I want to test your skills\nwith a few random syringes. So once the syringe\nappears on your screen, press pause to figure out the answer and then press play when you're\nready to view the answer. You're ready? Let's begin. How much medication is in\nthis three milliliter syringe? How much medication is in\nthis one milliliter syringe? How much medication is\nin this U-100 syringe? And how much medication is in\nthis five milliliter syringe? So did you answer all of them correctly? Great job and give yourself\na huge pat on the back for a job well done. And there you have it.

for for what we can use for that and which forms coming and for what people using and what for which illness for which damages can help you this i mean this is quite long time before 1940 or something like that they started properly in the medical way to giving the treatment but this is using already about centuries is using cannabis i mean before the there was not called cbd all or something they was using cannabis like cannabis i mean the people was using that they was feeling relaxed they was getting mean health they was getting even they was don't know how this happening but before also they sometimes they think this is the using is something is bad people which like addiction or like a drugs they were using but during in medical way they took some big benefit from cbd means from the cannabis they make the oil with without thc so which is bad which is like a drug which you addicting on that but the cbd they took out of thc so this is all and these benefits can be for i mean curing cancer or arthritis or any depression insomnia there's so many reasons you can use that anyway i'm gonna put some in pictures in the video so you can see maybe this can this can give you more understanding so maybe i can't explain and also i was have about two three weeks before one client they was using quite strong pain killing because there was arthritis so i suggested them i said uh try that and after one two weeks you're gonna feel different really after one week this guy came and he was so much happy for that using cbd oil mostly you're putting this one or two drops down on your tongue and that's all before you're sleeping or whenever this way you also getting very relaxed your your mentally mined and also your pain reducing and also helping your making defense system

"SN6lIppAY2Y": "the CBD help with nausea relief we all know people experiencing nausea perhaps are going through chemo or other health related issues that cause some nausea so I just decided to do some research and here's what I found I was just trying to find some outside articles that address this you know that were substantiated by science right so this one US National Library of Medicine and I'll kind of read a little bit of the abstract here so says considerable evidence demonstrates that manipulation of the enjoy cannabinoid system that's hard to say Rahil it's NASA and vomiting in humans and other animals the antiemetic effect so the anti nauseous effect of cannabinoids have been shown across a wide variety of animals that are capable of vomiting in response to a toxic challenge this other article I read was found on green light approved and also go over a couple points is that CBD is a non psychoactive compound right so there's no THC here and no matter how much CBD you consume you will not feel intoxicated or high CBD has been found to quell nauseous feelings and prevent vomiting it also helps to counter the psycho active effect of THC now I'm not a doctor or giving medical advice here I take CBD oil for my own health benefits but if you know someone you might want to suggest it to them and say hey take a look at this the company that I get my CBD oil from and I'm actually an associate with is CTF OH and they pretty much have the the purest CBD oil out there on the market and they do have a 60-day money-back guarantee so if it doesn't work for you

called hemp FX and FX and FX is a system we actually have three products in it right now and again you have to appreciate that there's a long long history of course with him and the research and legalization of hemp has been heralded by many ok is the most exciting period of health discoveries in recent memory known around for its benefits the cannabis plant has drawn the attention of a nutritionist medical personnel scientists and individuals seeking relief from pain anxiety and sleeplessness and other challenges there are two strains of the cannabis plants are kind of cousins a hemp originally they made rope out of it and that sort of stuff and also marijuana the two are cousins but the hemp offers more benefits from the nutritional and health standpoint hemp is a cousin you want to invite your into your health system in her daily life I designed for a can of bile okay cannabidiol or CBD oil ZZ for me to say see video and it brings therapeutic benefits because human bodies are already having a biological system capable of interacting with the cannabis chemical compounds the endo cannabinoid system rets okay our bodies actually produced their own cannabinoids as part of this ECS system Ethio system is a network of cannabinoids and cannabinoid receptors found in the brain that donal organs that help regulate the biochemistry okay inside the body the ETS assists regulation of various processes the body including relaxation appetite mood pain reception sleep certain inflammatory reactions and connective tissue relaxation cognitive function it also helps regulate homeostasis everybody knows homeostasis and repairs damage cells and shark the ETS protects the bodies and make sure they run optimally as part of the epigenetic system are the epigenetic system okay research confirm the CBD oils direct with many different receptors proteins and other chemicals in the brain these interactions create changes in the activity of the neurotransmitters hormones other cells throughout the brain and the body though these interactions through these interactions CBD oil is appeared to be able to affect many of the body's functions from sleep-wake cycles and emotion regulation inflammation pain perception and seizures okay and store seizures especially in young kids this tbo is a great thing of course we have a three three major products to start with three major products are what one is called relax is a port to restful slumber in addition the CBD oil it contains a chamomile lavender and valerian to help relax people right and then we have soothes which is our pain relief and it contains Oh aunty offices including glutathione and it contains in addition to the TBL many many herbs minerals okay and uplift okld some mood for people who are depressed or having anxiety and of course we've added our and we've done our usual thing we've combined in st. john's wort and a specialized set of terpenes ok cannabinoid enhancers ok and so these three products of course to relax is a dropper bottle these sues is kind of a pump for the cream it's very and you get a cool feeling when you apply it and then of course the uplift or now mood elevator is actually capsules and so these three products are now available through your young give you so shouldn't if you are young give you so [ __ ] you certainly look into the opportunity here because it covers a whole area of health benefits the vitamins minerals don't"}
