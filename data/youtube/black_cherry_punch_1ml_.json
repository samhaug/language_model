{"wr3fy69_iTo": "hey y'all trevor here with right of the leaf and today we're going to be diving into another strain from the violet tourist we have tried that sage and sour just a couple of weeks ago so i thought that uh with the popularity of this strain specifically we dive in because the quality of that sage and sour was quite high the black cherry punch three and a half gram bag from violet tourist is going to be one that uh we'll have to compare against our edison review that we did just a little bit earlier in this year but with that you guys let's go ahead get our intro in here because we got quite a bit more talking and quite a bit of bud to review today cheers and i'll see you when we get in here welcome back you guys and like i said in the intro we're going to be diving into the black cherry punch indica dominant strain from violet tourists we have picked up and smoked the sage and sour strain from the same lp and these are actually the same growers that put out the queen of the bud product so if you tried their california pre-rolls or their toe pads their blue topaz which is a slower cane strain it's grown by the same company as this violet tourist flower will be or the super flowers they call it but before we go into any more of that information or really dive into this review in um full force we've got to cover exactly what this review is going to be going over so you guys can either skip to the part that you want to watch or know exactly how it's going to proceed now we start out with the information that's on the packaging whether it's the bag or the container that allows you guys to know exactly when the bud was packaged if you're smoking along with me to compare to see if it's the same batch or if it is going to be one that is a little bit different different batches do allow and offer a little bit of a different overall experience and the handful of times that you guys have picked this up and you've either had the same batch or a different one and let me know down in the comments i really do appreciate it so if you're smoking along side this review please let me know how this bud scores for you with this now with the actual review we cover the information on the container then we move over to usually and hopefully the license producers website which today we aren't able to use so we've gone to our next step down the line which is going to be either the alberta cannabis website or the ontario cannabis stores website both of these shops provide the information that is most directly linked to the licensed producers so it is very likely the best information that those producers are providing for those companies because the alberta cannabis.org and the ocs or the ontario cannabis store websites they are the only legal online sales option for the province of alberta and the province of ontario it's just the way that uh these provinces have decided to do their legalization once we finish off there we move over into the actual review we got one step left before we start smoking and that is to crack open the container and take a look and smell of this bud we scored out of 10 for our looking aroma pretty self-explanatory there now the next two steps do deserve a little bit more explanation a little bit more depth but we go into that more so when we get to them first one being our vaporizer where we're baking our bud versus burning it it goes in the ceramic heater here we run it through three temperatures specific terpenes play the factor on why we choose those three temperatures but i do go over full details when we get to the vaporizer and then our bongs we have a very similar approach as a vaporizer with our bongs where we light it up with three different intensities of heat as well as just different ways of uh starting our bowls up and getting that cherry in there but we will go over the full details of that when we are on that part of the review you guys then to finish up the smoking side we go a little bit more classic with either our elements paper or a regal cigar they both get smoked through the pipe being first and then we smoke our way through the joint talk about the high and each individual point of this review gets scored out of ten eights are what we're looking for for that higher score 48 out of 60 is what we're looking for for the beautiful garbage if the bud is able to maintain eights all the way down she gets a 48. if she doesn't well we're hoping that we can make up some of the scores where the other side lacks but with that being said you guys that covers the entirety of what we're going to be getting into so now let's actually cover the information on the container before we go over into the website and get this review rocking the way we like to so violet tourist super flower black cherry punch it is going to be an indica dominant strain it's a three and a half gram dried cannabis bag thc total of 21.4 percent a cbd total of 0.06 a little bit on the higher side for the high thc mark but again nothing really potent on that cbd side here we've got a package date of the first or sorry you guys the 14th of january 2021 and a price point of 37.99 so the violet tourist has been putting out a really good quality flower from what i have experienced through the sage and sour now let's see if the black cherry punch puts out the same overall output you guys because i'm uh i'm quite excited for this but before we can crack that bag and get our beautiful urban scale intro in here let's quickly read off the information that the alberta cannabis dot org offers up to us it's brought to you by the burnt so brnt group violet tourist black cherry punch is a high potency terpene rich indica dominant flower that features visually stunning violet tones with a piercing aroma of fruit subtle floral background notes and earthy nuances the violet tourist super flower back cherry punch is a three and a half gram bag it is grown by cadre cannabis the violet tourist is just going to be your brad name let's scroll on down quickly cover the terpenes that are all and sorry the terpenes and the flavor options that the website describes so citrus hoppy and floral are your flavor profiles your terpene profiles are going to be lemonine at 24.0 percent with a citrus flavor alpha bisalbolol which is going to be floral in flavor and at fifteen point three percent and then you got carafeline which is leaning on the hoppy side of the flavor this time at twenty point two percent and the other terpenes build up the rest merisneen and linolol being the two primary ones that the website has to offer but with that you guys that is all the information that we have available on this strain you know exactly what that means it's time to get into our beautiful herb not not into our beautiful herbage well we're hoping it's beautiful garbage and it's time to get into the urban scale you guys see on the other side we're smoking on some black cherry punch [Music] welcome back you guys so let's go ahead and dive into this bag of black cherry punch from the violet tourists so first impressions are a very sweet very fruity aroma holy [ __ ] like extremely fruity and sweet flavor i am gonna want to weigh this out you guys because if you look at it we got three nugs and one i don't even count as a nug because it's just i can see where it broke off of the main piece let me switch the camera on over and let you guys take a little looksie at what we have to offer here before we put it up on the scale see you guys in a second see as we slide in here you guys can tell we've got just the two big nugs and this this piece i'm thinking it fell off right there either right there or right at the base of this one because you look we've got just two massive massive nugs we got a nice zero gram on here the first nug is going to be 2.9 the second nug will get us up to 3.39 third one will put us at 3.55 so we're just over that eighth on the weight you guys but now when it comes to overall color you can see the purple tones coming into the top of that bud got nice even pistol and crystal distribution throughout it looks really really nice the bigger bud definitely has more color than the smaller but still it has me quite excited we are definitely smoking this larger nug than over this one i'm gonna save that guy for later but let's go ahead get these girls busted up while i uh talk my way through what i'm thinking i'm gonna give the score okay guys let's go ahead put this big nug this big purple nug back in the bag it bounced back really really nicely when i give it a squeeze it has a little bit of a break and um kind of a crushing to it but that's that's gonna happen when you get these big pack nugs like this it's definitely something that uh that could happen just with the packaging and it's really the inner portions of this nug that's gonna make the determine on whether it's a really fresh smoke or not so i'm looking forward to that the aroma that i'm getting off of this butt is absolutely unreal you guys it is so potent and so rich in its overall experience and um off put and the amount of crystal on the inside of these nugs is unreal you guys i i honestly want to bust it up because i have a feeling that this bud busted up is going to earn at an extra point and that's there's certain strains that i will give the benefit of the doubt and judge it on a busted aroma because when the nugs are just this large and um this well packed the aroma is a little bit of an undersell until we bust it up and i'm finding that with my home grow as well the buds are nice and densely cured and well packed you don't get a really potent aroma but when you bust it up and those terpenes have a chance to off gas and really become aromatic it does well and this train is another one of those it's got kind of a baked good um experience to it too like almost um like a bakery with doing like a fresh buried like cherry biscuit that type of experience you guys all very enjoyable very exciting definitely a nine out of ten for the look and aroma the size of the buds the quality of the buds look great the actual aroma when it's busted up and ready to go is just as incredible and exciting as well you guys so i'm gonna go ahead and roll up our joint and uh get ready to start smoking this through our vaporizer and then eventually through our rigs thankfully to uh to the power of editing this joint roll is only going to take me a second and i'll see you guys when we are packing up and explaining our bombless cfc vaporizer cheers let's get into this hail and just like i said thankfully to the power of editing we are back and throwing things around while we dive into our boundless cfc vaporizer so what i'm going to do is i'm going to turn this on i'm going to get it started warming up on its way up to 175 degrees celsius the reason we start out at 175 degrees celsius is two primary terpenes the limonene and the maracinine lemonine like its name is going to be based off of the lemon based flavor it's going to have that really citrus acidic sharp flavor that lemons are known for the maraschini flavor is going to have a little bit more of a range to it it does have a little bit of an earthy flavor it does have a little bit of a woody touch but the primarily primary experience is going to be a green herbal experience there is a mango tone that plays as well so you do get that juicy fruity flavor but it does lean on that more acidic side similar to that lemonade so those two play very well together when you have a combination of the two you can get more of a lemongrass lemon wood citronella overall experience or just a raw rainforest herbal experience so we start out with that let's take a couple hauls talk you guys through it before we bump up to 205 and go into those details you guys cheers initial experience is really light it's got definitely that hint of a cushy tone that kind of damp earth flavor to that kush tone but there's a sharp fruity sweetness to it i can't really put a finger on what i'm tasting but it's got with that earthy cross i'm getting more of a rich berry cherry that kind of an experience you guys now when we bump up to 205 from this 175 the flavors that i'm experiencing here should get more predominant 205 is really where your creamy rich earthy flavors start to become nice and potent nice and strong you guys a little bit of the extra temperature allows a lot of the other terpenes to boil off and start to actually render more flavor and more overall effect 205 you get your creamy your chocolate your cushy your earthy sometimes your cherry your more berry flavors which personally for me lean a little bit more on that cream side that's where the 205 thrives the rich potent flavors this is usually the temperature that i start to find about you guys with the 175 being light hinting towards that kind of cherry rich earthy flavor 205 is going to be nice and tasty if it carries along that way you guys but the only way to find out is by pulling on it and finding out so let's get to it okay goes on the more wood side it does lose that kind of cushy flavor a cushy tone that i was enjoying at the beginning it does kind of hold on to that little bit of the fruity-esque flavor that sweeter flavor but it's by no means exciting or really overwhelming it's just a light kind of rich creamy buried flavor with just hints of a wood tone to it now 220 that's how we finish this vaporizer off the reason we finished off with 220 degrees is beta-carotene and the thc boiling points they both are activated and start to boil off at the 220 degree range the heaviest effect from the thc as well as the more woodied and peppered experience that the beta carefully has to offer let's get to it and see what we have here i'm expecting woody flavor i don't know what uh what it's gonna do but let's find out folks definitely wooded it's got a little bit a little bit of a pepper bite which honestly caught me off guard but it still holds that kind of rich sweet or sweeter flavor i would say a rich flavor but i would say a rich sweeter flavor and all in all it was enjoyable you guys it was enjoyable enough for me to really be able to sit down and and find the flavors through each of the levels that actually were nice but let's go ahead dump that out so we can move on the line move on down the line to our next chunk of uh reviewable content and that is going to be our bongs what we're going to do is we're going to run it through three different temperatures first and foremost hepwick this is the lowest ignition source temperature that allows the bong to really melt and boil and burn up that bud and get all the terpenes and as much of a potent flavor as we can experience through the rigs hemp wick first way we experience it most milked and slowest way to uh to smoke it i find for getting that bowl to snap secondly most common way straight up clipper lighter bic any uh any just lighter from your pocket that's how we take our second rip and typically is our most common and that's why i like using the beaker and then finally we got our tower cyclone rig that gets hit with the jet lighter that really does cherry up and pop up the the flavor in these strains but it's not the most common way and it's definitely not the uh the smoothest way to smoke some of these strange eats each way have a different um overall experience and flavor to uh to have so that's why we like uh diving into it this way so we really give this bud as much of an opportunity and a chance to present itself as flavorful and uh enjoyable as possible you guys but with that being said i flapped my gums long enough let's get to smoking this bud cheers and i'll see you on the other side [Music] so [Music] [Music] okay guys so i realized that i forgot to score the vaporizer before we moved on so let's go ahead and do that a 6 out of 10 is what i ended up scoring the vaporizer overall for its experience and its flavor it had just enough flavor there to really spike my interest but it was just kind of all right all in all and overall in in uplifting flavor but and uh it just it didn't carry enough to really have me excited it piqued my interest but that's about it now moving into our bongs we're going to give it a 7 out of a 10 for the flavor and the overall experience for the bongs the the flavor in and of itself is building right now but it's kind of reached where it would cap and it's just holding and it's just it's building up more the transition of the flavor from the sweeter creamy flavor which is that berry cherry kind of an experience that that i'm finding like any any strains that say well berry experience creamy creamy with the fruit flavoring like that's that's how it comes across to me the cherry falls right in with there with the with that berry flavor now overall it did have a nice sweet rich flavor through each of the bongs but the key selling point for me is whether it's gonna have that nice strong earthy almost cushy tone to it that pushes through on that end this side that like that undertone that really kind of tops up this flower and really puts it over the edge it had that on that very last hoot and it had it for a very light very short amount of time but if i could have experienced that through all three rigs we'd be giving it an eight or higher but the fact that i just got it with the jet lighter is a little bit disappointing i'm curious to see if a big big big bowl packed into our uh nice glass beaker bog and with the clipper lighter that'll make any difference because that does like to uh accumulate quite a bit of heat and almost simulate what the jet lighters like when it comes to the end because that that very base the bowl gets quite hot when you like the heat circulate in there and build up and burn it's way down but with that being said you guys we're gonna move and transition on into the regal i have i have some interesting thoughts on this i i really don't know where it's gonna go with the flavor if it takes that sour flavor and kind of runs with it and goes on the more creamed sour almost like a creamed creamed diesel experience would be almost the best way to to describe how i hope it goes um or it takes that wood side and puts it into a nice sweet earthy wood combo either those would be ones that i'd be quite happy and quite impressed with but we're not going to know until we light it up and start smoking it so why the hell we're still talking i do not know let's get to smoking cheers i will give it a 7 out of 10 for the taste from a pipe you guys honestly it took more of a creamed wood flavor like a sweetened wood flavor and it's almost using that sour side to just make it more like a blackberry like more that type of overall output for flavor and it's it's enjoyable you guys it's quite nice and it was relatively smooth through the pipe and it stayed smooth now that i'm sitting here all in all it's an enjoyable experience 7 out of 10 because it did complement the flavor that was there before and just accelerate upon it and improve upon it you guys so not much else to say about that bud but not bad not bad at all now let's go through get our case from a joint the first couple dry halls through here see what we have to expect before we light up this uh little joint and start smoking and scoring cheers nice rich cherry flavor just incredibly fruity you guys incredibly fruity let's uh spark it up and see if it smokes the same welcome back you guys so for the taste from our joint i'm going to end up giving it a 9 out of 10. honestly the overall experience and how smooth the smoke was is absolutely incredible one hundred percent in the most enjoyable way i've smoked a strain it really does have a nice strong potent cherry flavor that just sits there and builds and builds as you smoke your way through it it's the joint that you guys saw i got about three holes in and i just sat back and just kind of closed my eyes or let my eyes hang low and just kind of [ __ ] chilled out for a bit really really enjoyable strain nine out of ten for the taste for joint it just didn't it doesn't have enough potency or real flavor to get me excited to give it a 10 but it has everything else the smooth the a nice strong flavor but not strong in the ways that i would like it smooth easy smoking just nice butt for rolling up into a joint and smoking just not perfect when we come to the high god damn if we didn't get the same thing just about perfect has a nice strong easy body high that hits right away and then just kind of leaves you and then comes back again like it it hit the body hot hits right away really intensely and then you get the wave that floods from your body like it slams your body and then it waves up into your head and then it kind of finds that that equilibrium right that balance between the two then it holds there so i've got a really nice body ease and relaxation my backs not tight anymore i've got the nice relaxing neck muscles like everything that's sore from doing a lot of the moving around and rearranging that we did isn't quite as sore anymore and it's feeling a lot better and more enjoyable to sit here and smoke through the strain now the mental effects it's a heavy like a very heavy mental drift you guys it's taking a lot of effort for me to stay on focus and stay like zoned right in and it's really one of those strains where it'll be good before you wrap your day up like i'm i'm probably gonna need a shower and a cup of coffee to kind of reset myself um after smoking this you guys all in all very incredible strain nice and potent definitely one of my top tier indica strains that i've that i've found myself um the bubba the super skunk i would put right along this level um the mac one's kind of a tier above this but it ain't far you guys raider kush tier above this white heartbreak more on this level um close the the quadra this level like some really really high level strange you guys um would be on this level a good a really good gorilla glue stuff like that the moby dick crumble not moby dick crumble uh white rhino crumble from verse originals the moby dick crumble from from rolling chirps like some of my favorite continuous continual smokers are uh are right along this level of high and i think this black cherry punch is gonna be become one of those it's not one i think i'll be pulling out during the streams often but i think it'll be a good one to kind of wrap the day up but um with that you guys i think it's a good time to wrap this video up with the last two nines for the score with the high getting a 9 out of 10 as well 47 out of 60. one point shy guys that beautiful garbage we almost made it again almost made it again um but we uh we're just a little shine and that's okay i'm okay with us having some buds that are punching right around that that 48 marker but not quite getting there then at least this gives you the people who are waiting for that beautiful herb it just gives you something to give a shot right because personally anything 42 plus if it's got a component that you really are looking forward to trying like the ogen strains those were all 40 plus scoring strains they didn't score 48 but they were still really high recommendation strains are ones i always go to and recommend if people are looking for a specific type of flavor or a specific effect and that's the thing is 40s plus in my opinion 42 to 43 if you want to be a little bit on that pickier edge you're going into a really nice and enjoyable experience when you get that 46 47 48 plus you're getting into some some top quality top quality flower right you guys so i'm looking forward to seeing how the next batch of bud does because we've got some 15 grams of strawberry cough we're gonna be reviewing it's at a nice and uh low thc point though this time so i'm curious to see how bonafide did with it and uh we've got a green apple 510 vape cart that we're having to do on thursday but with that you guys let's wrap this one up it's

leaf and today we're going to be diving into the black cherry punch three and a half gram container from edison i'm really excited to try this strain out i've heard it's one of the tastiest ones that edison has put out so with that we are definitely looking forward to high scoring the bongs a high score in the vape and hopefully we get a nice strong push to get our regal cigar here a higher score than the six and sevens that we've been get racing we have been getting recently oh obviously the tongue is starting to stutter i think it's time that we get into this review so we can start smoking because that's typically the best way i help get the communication nice and clear i'll see you guys on the other side of this intro when we dive into the black cherry punch from edison cheers welcome back you guys and for those of you who are new to the channel welcome to checking out one of your first reviews from readyleaf the way we do it here is it is going to be a lot longer of a review than you may be accustomed to but we get into a lot of detail and that's a part of the reason why the length is what it is now i'll give you a quick overview of what to expect over the next roughly half hour of this strain review first and foremost we cover the information that we have on the three and a half gram container or whichever size we are smoking that day before we move on into hopefully the license producers website if not we typically use the ontario cannabis store or the alberta cannabis stores online website before finally falling into either leaf me or a lift and co base for our strain information that we uh like to cover and get an idea of what we're gonna dive into and what sort of flavors and aromas and experiences we're gonna have when we spoke the strain shortly after we cover that information then we get into the urban scale and that's the actual rated portion of this review we started out with a look and aroma which hopefully is self-explanatory for you guys we take our look we smell our bud and we score it out of 10. finally after that we move on and start smoking our vaporizer gets ran through first three temperatures we're looking for different terpenes i go into detail with that when we get to that part of the review to follow up and match the idea of the vaporizer we have our bonds those we do three different ignition sources so it provides a little bit of a different experience every bong and each bong is a different size and shape so that as well allows the bud to really develop and hit in a different experience with each individual bong rip following that like i said the regal cigar for our taste from a pipe and then elements has been my favorite paper to use with anything on the market so far and we're we're gonna continue to use the elements paper for our taste from a joint and then before we give our order overall which will be based out of 60 our sixth component is going to be the high you can't smoke without discussing the high because that's really what people are looking for when they're diving into this outside of the the enjoyment of the flavor when you're actually diving in and smoking that strain now with you guys being educated and up-to-date on exactly what we're diving into let's start rattling off this information so that uh we can uh really enjoy the potential flavor that the strain has and the smoke sesh we're about to get into edison cannabis cos black cherry punch this three and a half came in with a thc total of 20 percent it is an indica dominant strain it has a cbd total of less than 0.07 the package date is going to be the 12th of december 2020 and the price range is 23.99 for my shop it may be a little bit higher maybe a little bit less but overall for uh under 10 a gram that is a damn good price this is one of three new strains that edison has released they had their slur cane their ice cream cake and the black cherry punch as a three i have had the slurry cane before we're diving into the ice cream cake this friday and uh the black cherry punch is the only strain that we didn't have lined up to uh review so i thought this would be the best way to bring in these three new strains now we have edison cannabis co pulled up on our laptop here i'm going to quickly cover the information they provide for us before we get into our meat potatoes portion of the review black cherry punch our new black cherry punch indica is a potent pick with 20 plus percent thc sweet and floral undertones balance its fruity flavor and aroma its crown shaped flowers are medium in size with emerald green and purple buds that are crystally rich with trichomes this strain is grown in a micro climate conditions that are inspired by the mountainous environments indica thrives in and like every plant in edison black cherry punch is packaged with our dual boost humidity pack for preserved freshness so the strain is going to be a black cherry pie crossed with a purple punch which both of those i can imagine being really ripe sweet tasting strains the flavors are going to be cherry sweet and floral so it'll be comparable to that lolo mont as the uh the hash plant strain that they have here and your top terpenes are going to be lemonine beta-carothylene linolol meristenine and beta-pinene so that keeps us on that sweet floral side with a little bit of spice and a little bit of um of pine with that kind of almost minty experience of that pinyin and it carefully coming in at the end of the terpenes but with that you guys we've got all the information we need to dive into the strain we get to get in give it the look and aroma score before we wrap up our joint and uh actually get to start smoking i'm looking forward to it i hope you guys are as well let's get the fun part of this review in and started chia gel [Music] so pull off the the cap will take out this humidity pack and uh honestly you guys the buds look not too bad so here get it up on the rolling tray that i have from robinson will pull you off and we'll give you a little look so here you go this is going to be the buds that we have in this three and a half as you can see there are some smaller ones the larger of the three and a half are going to be right here decent crystal you do end up with a alright orange pistol shooting throughout the buds do have a nice bounce back when you give them a squeeze overall i'm quite impressed with how these buds turned out you do end up having a little bit more color leaning into some of these buds here let's uh you know what we're going to pull out the white tray give you guys a little bit of a look in comparison to this one here welcome back you guys so i have been hearing what you guys have been saying you want a little bit better view of the nugs let me know what you think of uh us continuing to do like that where it's just a continuation of our review and uh we keep it rolling that way because i do think that's going to be the uh easiest way to keep this just its natural flow without having to come back and re-record stuff so honestly the light color of these the uh overall aroma that i'm getting off it isn't overwhelming isn't really that exciting uh a seven out of ten because the buds are really fresh and they look really nice for the color and the crystal coating the aroma just doesn't have anything to excite me right now you guys and that's exactly why i can't break into those eights nines or tens saying that let's put the humidity pack back into this container bust up this bud and get into our urban scale with the smokable portion of the review and our vape i'll see you guys over there cheers hey guys so let's get into the vaporizer i have it on i've got it cranked up and getting ready to dive into the 175 degrees celsius that we start off our vapor views like i said in the introduction we go through three different temperatures 175 is our first limonene and maracinine are two terpenes we're aiming for with that temperature so that's going to be your lemon your more citronella lemongrass that type of flavor because with the meristening that tends to be a little bit more the greener or potentially mango style flavor you could get a really green blend of experience with that citrusy flavor of the lemonade or more that maracinine mango acidic base flavor you guys honestly i enjoy the strain when it does blend off like that and this 175 typically is the more citrus side of it afterwards 205 degrees is where we move towards that's going to give us our richer more creamy experience flavors our chocolates our cheeses our cushes our earths and uh you do tend to get a hint of the wood and pepper but that primarily gets displayed at 220 degrees with the thc boiling off as well because the beta carefully terpene likes to pre most present at 220 degrees celsius you guys and with that we are boiling all of our terpenes our flavor makers and our thc and cbd off because we are baking our bud not burning it this is a ceramic oven that's baking not burning our bud at 175 degrees celsius let's dive in and see how the meristening and limonene terpenes show off at this time cheers nice light flavor it would stay on the humid side i would say and is kind of a sweet um floral flavor but nothing really exciting nothing really getting me excited or really looking forward to turning up the temperature and diving into it it's just i could take it i could leave it but uh we're gonna go ahead and take 205 for a rip and see if we will uh have the same experience with that you guys cheers okay so we do go a little bit richer i am getting a lot more of a pine flavor a little bit of a richer heartier sweet flavor more berry-esque i wouldn't necessarily say cherry but more sweet berry flavor enjoyable it's got its points it's it's enjoyable you guys now at 220 let's see what's presenting here honestly i'm not expecting much i'm expecting a wood flavor with a touch pepper and a little bit of kind of a leafy green aftertaste and that the taste from the vape's gonna end up with a six out of ten because it's not remarkable see if my prediction is right i was bang on the money folks except for a little bit more pepper than i was originally expecting primarily woody does have that kind of creamed sweet to it but more than natural sweet where it means more that berry-esque flavor it's all right you guys it's a six because it's without a little bit of a plus um but nothing nothing i'd scream home about nothing i'd lose my mind about it's just nothing too exciting six out of ten's nice and accurate now with that being said you guys we're gonna move on into our bongs we've got our uh envy straight pipe here and our hemp wick that's how we run our first drink our clipper lighter by itself is how we run our second rig and the third one gets a there you are straight up jet lighter near the end because all three have a different cherry all three have a different production of flavors and all three have a different experience that it puts off with the bud sometimes you end up getting a harsher smoke with hepwick where other times the uh the jet lighter just leaves you hacking it's hard to tell until you actually smoke it and that's what we're diving into now you guys straight pipe beaker cyclone that's the order the lighters are hempwick clipper and jet you know what we're getting into i'll tell you the score when we're done all three cheers and let's smoke this [Music] [Music] so okay guys i'm gonna give the taste from a bong a seven out of ten the biggest reasons why it's gonna get a seven out of a ten and not anything higher is because the flavor was a major lack for me i didn't find much of an experience the bong it was really light it had a kind of hint worthy flavor until the very last rip the jet lighter was beneficial to uh to this strain and i think maybe transitioning from the bowl that i'm using right now in this bong to our deeper instagram bowl the one that i typically snap this one's a third of a gram to a half a gram i typically end up packing in here so the flavor that i get is a lot stronger of a representation than i typically find in here good example of that lemon garlic koji we reviewed last week with a six out of ten for the taste from a bong if i had smoked a bowl out of this probably would have bumped it up to a seven potentially an eight because it had a really nice potent almost more spiced ginger flavor but still really enjoyable to sit down and enjoy really enjoyable to sit down and enjoy well i [ __ ] hope it was enjoyable to sit down and enjoy this bud at least get you baked we'll talk about that at the end of the review guys but seven had a ton for the bong seven out of ten for the bong primarily because it was a smooth experience the overall flavor wasn't strong until we got to the jetliner you guys when we got there it was more of an aftertaste like i'm getting more of kind of a stone fruit like berry cherry like that richer creamier fruity flavor with a more of a crumble kind of that less crispy pie more soft doughy spice that's the experience i'm having right now and it's not a bad one it's what i'm enjoying actually a fair bit with that we've got the regal cigar well the regal slam packed up let's go ahead and spark our way through the pipe and see how this bud presents itself in here cheers you guys and let's dive into this 6 out of 10 is what i'm going to end up giving the taste from a pipe it honestly increased a nice little sweet balanced flavor off of that sour wood but it didn't really push its way through you guys it didn't present itself as a unique experience and if it can't i can't break the 6 out of 10 for the pipe it's enjoyable it has a nice smooth draw definitely is a sweet to the sour that the pipe tends to give off but if it's not a really strong or potent flavor you guys it's not gonna earn itself anything higher than sixes or sevens consistently now with that being said i've got my clipper lighter we're gonna dry haul through our joint here see what flavors we can come to expect to uh taste through here before we actually light it up and start on smoking cheers you guys i'm getting kind of that artificial cherry flavor similar to what you'd get through a kool-aid like those squirt added to water kind of experience where it's not really that strong super sweet but more of the flavor towards the hint towards and almost like those um watermelon rock candies on a stick the cross between those two is really the flavor i'm getting but let's uh spark up the joint and see how it tastes you guys cheers okay guys taste from a joint it's gonna end up getting an 8 out of a ten this last third is starting to break down a little bit we're starting to get a little bit more of that spice we're starting to get a little bit more of that carefully kick in it's still a nice smooth experience it's got a nice even smoke to it it's just the peppers taking a little bit more control than i would honestly appreciate and i would i'd really like it if it balanced out and got a little bit sweeter more of that cherry experience that we got right at the beginning because it tasted like cherry pie filling for the first half this joint and then you started to get that little bit of spice in there which was really crust experience and now it's just going more peppered which it's not a horrible experience it's just not my favorite and i can't score it higher than the aid because it that that pepper experience is taking away some of the enjoyment of smoking it and then a 9 or 10 won't have that now switching over to the high i will end up giving this a nine considering i don't know how it's going to last if it's one of those strains that'll as soon as i'm done the review i sit down and i transfer the audio over and i'm burnt out or i'm feeling it wear off i usually regret giving it a nine um but this one i can still feel building it's like it's still building from the bongs which is a big benefit if i kind of peek at the peak with the high at the bongs i'm disappointed you guys now with that being said i definitely did not peek at the bongs i'm smoking the droid i can feel it still kind of creeping along i can feel that high coming in a little bit slower than uh than some of the others hit and it's nice it's nice to know that i've still got a little bit more to go after i'm done recording this and that relatively clear head but strong um emotional ease so like it's emotionally relaxing so i'm not stressed about [ __ ] i'm not but i'm still able to focus i'm still able to think through it whatever i want to is huge but it just gives you that ability to take that it's taking that deep breath for you continuously is the best way to describe it um and then the body ease and relaxation is really nice it does make my eyelids a little bit heavier but not necessarily tired just squinty and there's there's some strains that do that and there's other ones that aren't quite as bad but this one's definitely a squinter kind of a strain so with the not in and the eight for the final two scores a 43 out of 60 is how this one ends up which isn't bad five points out of the beautiful herbage it's it's reasonable for it to be where it's at first for edison honestly that's really nice high score it's definitely something i would recommend for the price point as well um and honestly you guys it's it's not a bad strain it's not a bad strain whatsoever i just i wish it had a little bit more flavor to the bong and i'm thinking switching over into the bigger bowl is going to make a difference the joint was really nice i wish that flavor consisted all the way through to the end but the end wasn't horrible it just wasn't my favorite and that's the best way that i can describe it you guys and uh with that i think we're gonna wrap this one up today i hope you guys enjoyed i hope you're looking forward to tomorrow's live stream um and uh we'll be back with some more content y'all uh for the time being if you guys made it this far and haven't

addicting I brought it with me everywhere I went Seema Herman never expected that what she thought was a harmless habit vaping would end up nearly killing her I took two days for my lungs to fail and I almost died the 18 year old going viral with this photo from her hospital best a tube still pumping oxygen to her failing lungs in her hands a call-to-action asked for like a pen and paper because that was the only way I could communicate and I wrote I want to start a no vaping campaign that was the first thing I did when I opened my eyes Seema's story is just the latest in a landslide of incidents linked to vaping sparking what many officials are calling a national health crisis what we've seen in the course of the past let's say month is an increased number of people coming in with respiratory problems as a result of vaping so far the Centers for Disease Control report more than 450 possible cases in 33 states of lung illness associated with vaping and six deaths have been confirmed in California Illinois Indiana Minnesota Oregon and now Kansas last Friday the CDC issued a stark warning if you are vaping no matter how old you are you should consider stopping like I didn't think of myself as a smoker the vaping just makes it seem like it's nothing like you're doing nothing wrong Seema was in high school when she started vaping nicotine I was 16 the first time 15 and even the first time I bought it at the smoke shop I went in and I was like can I get a pack of jewel pods and they were like how old are you and I said 22 and they were just like okay it ended up becoming my oxygen I couldn't live without it I needed it all the time every day but because all of my friends were doing it all the time and no one else had symptoms that I had I couldn't like I wouldn't even have imagined that maybe this is killing me sima was an active healthy teen she'd been dancing for years even making dance team her freshman year of college but as her vaping habit increased adding in cannabis her ability to dance disappeared she was vaping a cartridge a day that's like smoking the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes in one day her parents had no idea their daughter had become hopelessly addicted this healthy dancer dancing 12 hours a week stopped dancing because of it stop living because of it stop going to school in college because of it Sima says she was feeling sick all the time over a year I lost like 50 pounds without trying 50 pounds yeah by this summer Seema had stopped going to her college classes she says her health issues were getting worse but no doctor could nail down what was wrong did you not tell the doctors that you've ached I actually did I made sure that every hospital every ER every doctor's office I went to I told them that I smoked but you never thought I can't breathe I feel like I'm gonna die maybe it's because I'm vaping every 10 to 15 minutes no doctor ever said like maybe you should stop vaping it all came to a head on August 15th when Seamas dad rushed her to the ER I said go fast don't let me close my eyes don't let me fall asleep or I won't wake up now why did you say that because I knew I was dying you felt death on you yeah it was terrifying the worst part was I couldn't I couldn't let it like my parents watch it happen to me but hospital staff couldn't figure out why Seema couldn't breathe two days later doctors had to put her on a ventilator I was begging them found her faster event her faster she's going to die it was terrifying it was in that agonizing moment that Seamas cousin revealed her secret addiction she said you know she smokes every day what what are you talking about you said she smokes every day she smokes that beep I said you tell the doctors right now you go tell the doctors right now and I ransacked her room and I found all the vapes it looked like gum wrappers they look like little candy wrappers they look like little cute a mascara wands this progression is so fast dr. Catherine Melamed is a pulmonologist at UCLA Medical Center she worked on Seema's case this was Seema's chest x-ray when she came into our Hospital these hazy white areas here at the base at the bottom of her lungs just show that she could have a pneumonia but what you can then see is if we choose an x-ray from just less than 48 hours later now her lungs all of this white haziness here is inflammation from just day 1 to day 3 is remarkable dr. melamed is on the front lines of what health officials fear is an emerging crisis the National Youth tobacco survey found a 78 percent jump in East cigarette usage among high school students alone but any research on the impacts of vaping lags far behind part of vaping is heating oil and then inhaling that oil and that's not something the lung is used to inhaling and so with that comes an inflammatory reaction that then produces phlegm and sputum and gives the lungs sort of that wet cough when property that sounds terrible and dangerous yes last month 17 year-old Tristan zou fell described how he spent 18 days in the hospital fighting for his life after vaping I woke up just throwing up everywhere how it was just pounding on my chest going 100 miles an hour Tristan lost 15 pounds and said he had to relearn to walk and just yesterday a Texas teen had to be rushed to the hospital after vaping at school passed out and you and I wake up like he was not waking up in Wisconsin today a man was arrested for making thousands of illegal THC vaping cartridges the state of New York is taking an aggressive approach in an attempt to find answers and crack down on black-market products you shouldn't be vaping products that clearly you don't know what you're you're smoking or vaping many vaping products are popular with young adults and teenagers but no company has taken more heat than Jul the industry leader the company says it's designed to get adult smokers off cigarettes but just this week the FDA sent a warning letter to Jewell accusing it of illegally marketing its nicotine bait products as safer than traditional cigarettes without proof Jewell responded we share these concerns about youth vaping it adds it shut down its Facebook and Instagram accounts and recently began deploying new technology to verify IDs this yeah.but Seema's mom blames the whole industry for trying to hook kids early the fact that they market this crap to children and they turned into pink pretty purple packaging candy pisses me off there's a lot we don't know about the both short-term and long-term consequences of vaping and so I would just say don't and the week since Seema has worked to rehab her lungs she still feels that pull to pick up the vape now I don't necessarily crave the nicotine I don't necessarily crave the weed it's just craving like the act of smoking so that's been my hardest thing of like staying away from it but she hopes that going public with her story can keep her and countless others like her alive what would you tell somebody who's under 18 who's thinking about vaping and says I'm just gonna try it one time to see what it's like I would show them my pictures and say I tried it once too and then I tried it another time and then another time it's just remembering that you don't need it like it's gonna kill you for nightline I'm Adrienne banker in Los Angeles hi everyone George Stephanopoulos

i don't know crate trade genetics maybe i did the germination wrong i'm talking to a friend some seeds like to go directly into the dirt we'll redo them let's see and then we got the other auto purple if crates don't come through we will be popping a couple more over here we got some clone like i see it before it's a little dry in there purple some water in there but yeah that's pretty much it we're about two or three minutes in this is your boy gmo and uh like i said i'm gonna show you what i do is basically what i do is uh take a half a gallon of water and i put um about two meals and maybe one meal of the seaweed extract and uh according to this cup right here as you can see everything is dry with an exception of that autoflower over there is not that dry but everybody will be getting about 20 meals 20 to 40 meals and i i use this syringe right here and then i just put it in there pull it up i said about 40 meals per plant each twice a day i'm talking to see them standing on their own and i can uh put some some real water into the soil to where it ain't [ __ ] with their roots [Music] and that's pretty much it basically the circle oh yeah you see none of that damn my bad do it again yeah so y'all see exactly it's for that and then i take it and then [Music] just like that and if you guys are wondering i'm going in a coco core mixed with a uh dang i just dropped the seed husk in there i'm going with coco core and coco core and uh fox farm 50 uh two to three meaning i'm doing two gallons to one gallon of two gallons of cocoa to one gallon of fox farm floor [Music] it is a black sheer red punch uh oh make a mess so [Music] want to hit these empty spots back here where it should be seeds that hopefully that'll help because the soil is not moist we want to keep it moist we had tap roots and we put them in that we did [Music] i'm not going to give her any water because she is still yet moist and according to my man chef anna with the pot you do not want to do nothing for 10 days other than mist for this over here i showed you guys before i just pretty much lift up this stone and what happens is i lift it up right yeah i check this i know i got something going on cause it's not coming out [Music] it's just taking forever and i really personally think it's got a lot to do with um it has a lot to do i think a lot of us have to do when you're not seeing any roots this [ __ ] is the fact that it's just not really warm as you can see my temps are 77 [Music] so i gotta figure out a way to get it warm in here and get my humidity up and i just spray that off there and i'll just put this top back on it click it in and put it up against the wall but yeah that's it youtube i made a seven minute long video about watering these plants it ain't nothing but uh four days old from popping thanks again", "bBAXF-wbeDc": "[Music] hey everyone it's clint from canadian cannabis culture back with another review uh today we're looking at cherry punch by black market so this one here is sitting at 22 percent thc uh cherry punch is an indica dominant hybrid which is bred by crossing cherry ak-47 and purple punch cherry punch is said to have a musky berry aroma with an earthy flavor and a soft and sweet berry finish black market hand trims and hang dries their plants and it says on their website that their buds are meticulously cured black market is cultivated in bc and alberta i believe uh indoors small batch and they're sisters with uh cannabis company tenzo and if you're looking to invest in them they're both under the parent company gtech holdings which i'll have on the screen okay so let's get a look at it here shrink wrap these jars are actually super cool basically just for the lid you just kind of twist it to the side and then it pops right off super easy got a really nice smell right off the bat definitely get you guys a good look at that okay now that we've learned a little bit about cherry punch by black market uh the last thing i got to do is test it out for the rating so i'll go do that and i'll be right back [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right everyone after testing out the cherry punch by black market really impressed by this one i think it's the best uh that i've got from black market so far not that any of them have been bad but uh this was definitely my favorite had a really good taste uh definitely like a bit earthy uh but definitely had like that buried finish so i really enjoyed the taste the effects on it were really good not like super overwhelming but definitely does the job well um super smooth um the only knocks on it i guess would be the ash was uh was good uh it wasn't super dark or anything but it wasn't like super super light either uh and the burn on it was just good um it wasn't like uh trying to go out or anything like that but it didn't burn like super well but it didn't burn bad either so overall really good and i forgot to mention the uh the package date on this one as well which was uh august 17th uh 2020 so i'm going to rate this one in 8.9 out of 10. until next time guys", "sKcyBi2-hEk": "we're recording now hi today's review is going to be ASMR I'm just kidding this is the loudest [ __ ] review we're gonna do whoo marijuana reviewing that's what we be doing so today's weed is some of the loudest weed you can get in the legal market right now today we're looking at black market cherry punch this is coming in at where is it now I can't remember this is coming in that twenty eight point eight nine percent THC here it is right here twenty eight point eight nine percent THC that is the strongest cannabis in the legal market to date if I'm wrong correct me but I've never seen anything over 26 so getting twenty eight point eight nine practically 29 that's good to see I'm excited for this one yeah my friends at spirit leaf West Kelowna let me know that this black market cherry punch just rolled in and said you got to come and get it we heard it strong as [ __ ] I'm gonna see what it's all about cherry punch is a hybrid they took ak-47 and crossed it with purple punch to give this a nice well-balanced hybrid super pump let's just get into a purple punch has a very purpley color that's what I should be expecting here something purple you know let's just [ __ ] see let's look at the package a real quick cuz they all want to know what pack state is May 16th and we're are June like I don't know a 3 June 8th so we are three weeks old not you bad that's some of the freshest [ __ ] on the market right now three weeks old so I got this stuff as the best I could get it in its best form that it's possible to come in here this little jar 52:19 for 1/8 of cherry punch glass container big fan glass container I'm also wearing my nice shirt today I put the nice shirt on for some premium craft dope-smoking straight up let's get in here got the handy-dandy scale crack that [ __ ] open that is pungent pungent is all I can say right off the start it's kind of ripping through my nostrils if you will all right okay there you have it it's three point five three point four seven that's where we're settling at that's bang on you know a couple hundreds off you can't judge anybody on that that is a three point five eighths good we're there all right here it is so super caked it's Trico me it's got a very good keyer sponginess to it that is right for smoking beautiful weed though beautiful look on that marijuana the other purple punch I've had in the past has been much more purple but that's different phenotypes that's how it is all right there's the eight focus that's looking pretty good that's looking pretty good I'm gonna take this top nug right here I'm gonna put that in the grinder with this other piece right there oh here we go twenty eight point eight nine percent THC that [ __ ] excites me that was a little rhyme it's very pungent usually when dealing with a higher THC strange we're also getting more terpene profiles out of that which makes those strains more pungent little more like smash in the face don't be a little bit's and smoke meek I'm strong that's what it's saying Rolie Polie Olie here we go I'm [ __ ] hungry to you right now whoa smoke super earthy right now I don't have too much to say about this coming into it right now there's not a whole lot of ripping flavor it is just [ __ ] heavy and that cough that I got right now that's a good cloth that's what I want I'm smoking some dank weed but as far as taste goes it's not fruity it's not florally it smokes like an earthy but robustness to it it's very pungent when it gets in your mouth it's saying hey man I'm [ __ ] here and i'm not air-eye thick ass smoke that's gonna bug up your brain today I'm definitely gonna smoke the entire thing I'm definitely gonna smoke the rest of the eight so for 52:19 in the legal market for twenty almost twenty nine percent THC you gotta go and check it out this is that dank dank stop this is the stuff that you show up to a friend's house with and be like yo I got some heavy ass weed and they're like yeah right you got some heavy ass weed that legal market don't produce no heavy ass weed and you're like well now they do because black market just came out with some dank ass heavy we flavor profiles coming out now getting a little further in get nose oils building up and making that whole flavor smokey nice but man it's just so heavy no I like my tongue is tired all right let's do this oh oh man black market cherry punch strongest weed out there twenty eight point eight nine percent THC made weight three point five graph also glass container I like that well I like that I could reuse this upon opening there is a floor Lee knows there was a purpley punch knows that's for the smoke it is heavy it is dank earthy finish it all the way through the ash is beautiful look at the ass there it is again white freakin ass that's what you want a smooth clean smoke of cherry punch something that's been in the black market for quite some time we all know about it we all smoked it but to be able to get this in the legal market nobody has anything else like it nobody else has anything as strong as it right now so definitely highly recommended for $52 you know that's what it is and that's a pretty fair price for some [ __ ] that you can't get anywhere in this legal market we're still gonna work on the price but it's 52 bucks this weed is getting into the eight point ones big fan of this weed I'm gonna smoke the rest of it I'm gonna put myself to sleep eight point one [ __ ] yeah black market did it again [Applause] [Music] I'm your neighbourhood Weed Man but you like that [ __ ] stroking up your neighborhood Weed Man right", "SBiNwQibNzQ": "we're outside of dispenser here in

see you in the next video you", "g9zPW-OWRTY": "hey what's up everybody we are getting ready to harvest all of our plants really really excited to pull all these down I did let them go quite a bit longer than I normally would have let plants go and that is because we pollinated some of them and they got pollinated a little bit later than I probably should have pollinated them which means I had to let them go a little bit longer actually an extra like 15 maybe 20 days ich habe outfit an extra 15 days I'd say then I wanted them to go so like two extra weeks but that's so the seeds could ripen up so I just want to show you what we got going on in here talk a little bit about what we're gonna do and then I'll do a kind of a recap video once we get to the actual dry trimming but let's go ahead and dive in to these plants so you can see they're kind of falling over they got kind of big this is the lemon Royale from swamp boys we got these from seeds here now calm I think I still have some on there this is a GMO TK skunk crossed with lemon tree so this particular plant is stinky didn't get huge but I mean it got huge but the nubs didn't get super huge they're kind of smaller like little I don't know this little grenade but it's almost these things stink this is I don't know it smells it smells almost like garlic mushrooms and onions sort of it's very very strange so this one got pretty big basically when we go to dry turn these are what we're going to do before we turn these we're just going to come in here and I'm just going to be popping off all these leaves so that's what I'm going to be doing tonight you can see that you know everything leaves on it so I will be putting them all or taking all these families off cleaning those up later so it's gonna take a while for this plant here then over here we have the life star from bog now this life star this is a Scentsy star crossed with bogs lifesaver and this particular plant did get pretty chunky you can see we got some pretty chunky buds in here it's been flushing a little bit long so some of the leaves are starting to die off but not the buds so we're good to go here nice and frosty this one smells it smells like a sensi star with a little of candy so really digging that one pretty excited for for that smoke that's a nice sativa even though this actual plant looks kind of indica right another one we got over here this is another bog right star same kind of thing a little bit more you know compact even see this particular plant was actually you can actually see on the leaves we got a little bit of thrips on this one and this particular plant actually took most of the thrips for all these other plants which was really crazy and thrips just do a little bit of leaf damage nothing terrible but when we got him it was just a little bit close to harvest I wasn't able to spray him all right I could have sprayed him but I didn't want to spray anything because we're gonna be smoking all this and who cares I'm gonna be trimming off all the trips anyway so it's not a big deal this one's nice and frosty is you can kind of see in here smells like this particular one does smell like an earthy candy in this particular room by the way I kind of wanted to mention cuz everybody's asking we're using the California light works solar system 1100 and you got two electric sky es 300 you can check those out at school of hard knocks comm /ik electric sky and then also we got the smart V controller right here this is our atmospheric controller controlling everything in the room we got a full video on how that works but you can actually use our coupon code s Soh and ten to support a discount at smart B controllers comm so I just wanted to point that out shout out smart be for shooting this thing over this thing has been awesome for this grow as well as these lights have been great too alright cool so this right here this plant is nuts this is a black cherry cheesecake this is one of the three fee knows we had this is the smallest one it definitely turned very purple and I mean you just see this the leaves are almost black on this thing and the nugs are just absolutely stunning everything looks great on this plant there's some green underneath it's just a crazy crazy-looking plant this is one of the plants that we actually had a male up so we made some crosses with this and I'll talk about those in a second but this plant smells like almost like a high C or a Hawaiian Punch it is crazy so this one you can see not the biggest this was not the winning Phaedo but female for us but just these buds under here I mean you can see they're straight up pink which is very cool pinkish purple it's these plants were just insane so this wasn't the one that I'm gonna be keeping I'm torn between the two that we'll see in a minute here but as you can see this plant didn't leave any staking and it held itself up just fine until I just knocked it over but this is one of really looking forward to the harvesting and smoking this is another lemon Royale pretty much the same as the other lemon Royale this one was just a little bit bigger and got some hues of purple in it this one doesn't have quite the funky smell it's got a little more lemony fruitiness to it but you can see just looking amazing here all these lobes sorry about that all these leaves are definitely gonna be coming out tonight when I'm when I'm getting all this trimmed up right so we got that we push that off to the side over here what we have right here this is probably the biggest plant in our garden and these are all these are all a little bit dry so they do look a little bit droopy no problem because I'm gonna be chopping them all today so whatever ice didn't water and oh they all that would dry out a little bit this is the cheddar sparkles from the mad farmers they personally gave me these beans after we didn't interview with them you can definitely check that interview out but these are just huge these things are massive I mean here's my fist it's it's almost as wide as my fist here these things are extremely dense and these buds are nice and purple everything here smells like a sour sour candy it's got like a little bit of candy coming through because this is a lavender crossed with Clementine and yeah you can smell a little bit of lavender it's got a lighter smell to it this is must be a very medicinal plant really really looking for or to this this plant was just beast as you can see so let's go ahead and get that thing out of the way but yeah I mean these are just massive this is another lifestyle you've got right here some got a life star right here this one did sorry this one did get pretty big as well very similar to the other ones as far as the actually this one smells probably the best out of all the life stars definitely got a little bit of thrips on this one the life stars seem to have attracted the Fripp's which is strange right all of them kind of did it's just something genetic about it which honestly kind of saved the other plants which is nice very excited about this one in particular just chunky chunky nugs as well so let's give these black cherry cheesecakes now these things are the these are like the star things in my garden right now super super stoked on these and basically what you see I've been flushing this one for quite a while amazing amazing colors and I always kind of get some of these dead leaves off because like I said have been flushing them so you can really see these this one has actually been pollinated with our watermelon skittles males so we took this particular plant I will let you know where to get those seeds shortly as well as be announcing the the seed naming or the straight naming competition but you can see right here this this is the one that was very very purple um this thing smells nuts it smells like and you actually see some of these seeds in here like right in here you can see some seeds popping out of here these buds are just filled with seeds they're gonna have a lot of these seeds water mouth skittles crossed with this black cherry cheesecake is gonna be phenomenal we've got an awesome name for it will be the long outs and that pretty soon here but I mean this is just a beautiful plant and it smells just like like Hawaiian Punch so this was you can see the difference in the plants like the other one over there there's shown a little earlier is more purple this one's a lot taller and this has just like crazy yellow orange pink craziness um I mean like this particular branch right here you need to see the different colors on it I mean all the leaves the leaves just look amazing on this it's like like fall it's crazy I have never grown a plant like this so I'm very very excited for this to come down and to see exactly how this smokes but this thing like I said we cross this with watermelon skittles or we hit we hit this plant with our watermelon skittles mail and I'm very excited to grow those seeds out as well here's another one and you can see this one didn't eat any staking at all like literally holds itself up super strong plant solid rock solid buds all the way down frosty frosty frosty here was the other one of the black cherry cheesecakes right here inside of there we go so black cherry cheesecake here this woman had thick thick nuts you can see kind of the difference between them this actually didn't get enough light down here so whatever ignore that but I was kind of dwarfed but you can see these are nice and thick a little bit more leafy but if we remove some of these leaps in here some of these families you can really start to see how frosty this one is and I mean look look at that in there it's nuts looking amazing this particular phenotype or expression smells phenomenal honestly I'm blown away that the smell I like the color of this one a little bit more but this one has a little bit more pungent fruity smell so we also hit this one with our black air start with our round watermelon skittles male and you can see it this soon some chunky notes honestly I think the other one is gonna be a little bit bigger of a yield err so uh you know I'll be running both those seeds and the water dog skills mail that we hit him with which is a very frosty watermelon skills mail and we also hit them with a couple other things as well but the wireless feels the one most excited about the long enough skill with black cherry cheesecake crosses but you see these things are just looking amazing super purple just down to the core purple buds I don't think there's any green on these buds at all when I break them apart I mean we even look in here that it's like straight-up pink on the inside which is crazy and it smells amazing so we got that then we have one of my personal favorites and this one went a little too long to beat these seeds were taking a little longer to develop which is no big deal there but this particular one it's just like June they're dropping trichomes right now this particular plant is our Las Vegas lemon skunk and the hoops thank you oh jeez sorry this is our Las Vegas lemon skunk and that usually this finishes in about 40 days we almost let it go double what it normally goes cuz we're letting those seeds grow in here this thing is insanely frosty and and like just gleaming it's like it smells just like lemon candy so we actually hit the Las Vegas lemon skunk with our black cherry cheesecake mail and with our watermelon skills mail so we're gonna have some of those seats coming through as well and then we have our watermelon skittles right here there's two different we know this these are both massive I mean this put out just some giant nubs this smells very funky I don't even know how to describe it they say water Don Terps I don't necessarily get watermelon I get some some muted melons almost like some rotting cantaloupe almost it's very sweet extremely frosty and I just got some hair on it but whatever but we're gonna basically we hit our this watermelon skittles with the black cherry cheesecake mail that we had and you can start to see this is kind of turning a little bit purple as well down in here getting a little bit purples but steak very very green and same thing when there's watermelon steals over here this one's turned in a little bit more purple they smell very very similar and honestly the only difference is this particular one here on my left now am i right it's quite a bit bigger or not even quite a bit bigger they just put out a little bit bigger knobs on the top little you know like like this full size as opposed to half this full size I don't know they all turned out amazing though so yeah that's about it for this so all I'm gonna do tonight is I'm gonna come in here I'm just going to be pulling all these families off it's gonna take me a little while but no big deal to be chopping all these families off then we're gonna have all these plants hang them upside down to dry and I'm going to be harvesting the seeds and we selectively pollinated them so I'll be harvesting the seeds and also harvesting the buds as well so keep poster keno stay tuned whatever you want to say there stay tuned I'll let me know where you can get these seeds we've got a lot of people asking about them so I'll definitely let you know where we can get those and besides that actually here's one thing I want to show you all check this out this is crazy this is one of the kind of a random thing I just saw right in here and this has a seed in it we actually were able to pollinate a chunk or a little calyx on a leaf and get a seed format so that's crazy this is that a lemon or I out here so we all see if the lemon stuff with a little bit of lemon or oil to kind of do some crossing with that but yeah that's about it for this I'm gonna go ahead and start trimming it'll probably be here for hours and hours and hours because it always takes forever and yeah that's it for this one we do have more seed to harvest series coming out very soon we're going to be moving all the seedlings back into this room and be sure to stay tuned for that so that's it for me thanks for watching and thanks for everybody who participated in the name match strain game or whatever we're gonna call it I'll make a video on what the winner was and the winner will be getting the free seed packs and will be announcing where the seeds are gonna be for sale all that good stuff very shortly here as well so thanks for watching bye for now", "whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven light goal boy and we will do another review yeah man that's all i got to say about it this joint is pissing me off much love y'all seven likes do it do it all right go to twitch.tv link will be in

Hot Chili Peppers um so today we're smoking on cherry punch this stuff is I'm pretty sure indica hybrid and I really like this drink this is from move and the dispensary move their weed is all done by a company called altmed and we actually have we actually had a really cool experience at the dispensary because we're gonna collaborate with a real budtender on our channel um I didn't get his name he gave me his YouTube channel his SoundCloud and his phone number so prophecy lane you know just a little flash you can't have his phone number but there's other info in there so it's real prophecy lane go subscribe on YouTube he's a real budtender he talked me into the strains that we got today and we're gonna be reviewing one hurt video so we've got four videos coming we have three flower videos and a concentrate video and that one is gonna be really exciting so let's get some of this out guys you love move so I referred my friend name and it was his first time and he got buy one get one up to a quarter so he got a half ounce and we what happens on it so I got a quarter for free or I got a quarter for $25 and then a free eight so that's pretty cool um I'm gonna show you guys a packaging here just because it's got like the ingredients I added oh there it is a strange hairy punch and there's the ingredients that were in the soil so the guy who was making the labels was probably stoned cuz look it's all cut off like right there barely reading okay nice this is what the flower is looking like and it's really stinky like right off the bat and I'd smoked a little bit already so there should be more nugs there but yeah this stuff is pretty alright look in let's tell you guys how it tastes how it smokes you know how I feel from it Sherlock pipe here this is actually from Ernie November shout out to Rapid City smoke shop this thing was like thirty bucks if you're one of my best friends you've probably smoked out of this before yeah I've had it for a while but um let's get some cherry punch in the grinder here hope you guys liked the video so far you know keep liking and subscribe and share with your friends and like I said we're gonna get a real budtender on the channel here um just go check out move anyways you might meet him he's got the best sales skills that I've ever seen before you know my dad's pretty good car salesman but I think this guy's a good salesman um yeah he ups old me like the most platinum stuff they had and it was okay so that brand drip that we reviewed before that was $40 a gram and the quality of the concentrate that I got this time was equal I'm serious equal if not better and it was $24 a gram because Sundays they have 25% alcohol concentrates so that was a good deal I think I'm gonna be getting some more wax from there for sure but let's get this out the grinder let's see how ki fee these nugs are so my Keith grind all right Keith catcher is empty and I had a coin in there and we're tossing the coin around a little bit and yeah there's nothing in there so this bud isn't to Kiki I mean I it looks really ki fee but I'm sure I could have broken up a little bit okay we gotta change this mom there we go some Creedence Clearwater Revival [Music] shout-out to you guys you know I thought this was kind of a silly thing to do smoke weed on YouTube tell you guys about it but I actually got more subscribers and actually thought I would like out there we'll keep it coming keep it coming [Music] it's a good taste right off the bat my face just got warm just like all rush just went down my legs and it just feel really good right now this is a this is a good strain oh man I only took one hit off that and I have like the chills like my whole body just feels good we're gonna be like oh man I barely open so there's no percentage on here have you ever smoked this spring bum there's no percentage on here put the bud tender that I meant told me that all the weeds there is top shelf when they get it everything they don't get bottom shelf wheat they don't buy that um so when they buy a batch of Bud it sits at the very top shelf and then as a week goes by it'll go down a shelf you know as a little bit gets old and then as more gets old it goes down and then every time they buy a new bud they move everything down in tears so they have their top shelves there's like the fresh best buds you know whatever in a week those get cycled down and then they have more fresh buds so if you go by the bottom to your bud there it was top shelf to eat so saves you a dollar like you can get a $90 ounce of red velvet cake and this weed smells like red velvet cake not gonna lie but stay tuned guys um we're gonna have a few more videos today so yeah stay tuned", "3BWIFVoWhzU": "[Music] hey everyone it's clint from canadian cannabis culture back with another review uh super excited about this one today you're looking at one by flower corp so i've actually only tried their pink kush which is something they really really focused on uh the initial beginning of their company but they do a really good job on it it's probably my favorite pink kush on the lp market so i'm so super stoked to try uh another offering by them so this one is called uh bc black cherry it's sitting at uh 24.7 thc uh new glass jars by the way well done by flower and they got rid of the box as well so all around really really nice packaging vc black cherry is an indica dominant hybrid bred by crossing uh black cherry pie and purple punch buttons are said to be dark green and purple with bright orange pistols or hairs the aroma is supposed to be pungent and reminiscent of freshly baked goods so that's pretty exciting i've heard a couple of strains recently that kind of uh say that's what the aroma is supposed to smell like and the only one that's really come through has been the apple toffee by simply bear so i kind of hope this one holds up to uh those standards as well the flavor profile is said to be uh sweet woody woody base uh apple berries and ground pepper so we'll see uh dominant terpenes are farnacin uh limonene and karyophiline flower hand trims and hang dries to plants uh they have a cultivation campus which is located in kelowna bc uh in the okanagan valley they use indoor purpose-built facilities and they also have a greenhouse on their campus flower has a subsidiary named halogen which cultivates in australia and portugal i believe flowers headquarters are in ontario their head offices and whatnot if you're looking to uh invest in flour they're under the name flower corp uh which i'll have on the screen okay so let's get a look at it here like i said really nice jars uh this one was packaged january 8th so super fresh that came off super easy i love the glass jars for that the close pops off so nice yeah right away uh super super pungent definitely has like the berry smell yeah we'll definitely get you guys a really good look at that uh there's no two-way humidity pack um so not too concerned about it because it's so fresh but maybe in the future a flower should look into uh maybe getting some volvetas in there okay guys now that we've learned a little bit more about flower and their bc black cherry last thing you got to do is test it out for the rating so i'll go do that and i'll be right back [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right everyone after testing out the bc black cherry by flower uh super impressed by this one very flavorful for sure uh definitely pick it up again not a lot to knock on this one either uh the burn on it was uh really really good uh the ash on it was was was really good uh well uh the taste on it was was really flavorful it was kind of like kind of like a light berry flavor maybe a little peppery as well very nice though very similar to other like kind of cherry bursts and cherry bomb strains but this one was probably my favorite as far as like kind of cherry strains that i've tried the effects on it were nice and strong i found them to be a little bit of a creeper uh 10 10 10 minutes or so after uh kind of indulging kind of really really hits you in a good way uh sitting at uh 24 it was really really smooth so overall really really well done flower um highly recommended uh but i'm gonna rate this one at 9.2 out of 10. until next time guys", "_4lVc9btH3g": "what's going on everyone my name is josh alson's weed funnies in today's video we're gonna go ahead and review and smoke down on a nice eighth of some cherry punch flower over there from truly florida we're going to talk about

uh hemp wrap over here nice and sparked up as well as uh get some music going there we are got the music going cheers everyone hope you got your blunts your bongs your joints vape pens pipes whatever you gotta do to get feeling nice and right nice and medicated this morning believe it's a sunday morning cheers everyone very tasty flower this morning let me get my notes standing up for me so we can go ahead and talk about this strain there we are off the rip very very tasty so i just got a nice uh [Music] say uh like sweet gassy flavor to it go ahead put it down for one second so i can show you guys the nugs here oh [ __ ] there we go had it on tight some very very dense no buds there's one right there we got a few left so there's only about uh about five or six in here i think there was uh four big ones and two small a couple more and these are very very dense well-trimmed nugs uh they did very good on the trim job on this flower i will give truly that we got the last one in here there you are now it doesn't look like much but no i mean they're decent sized nugs there's probably about two grams between the three of these nuts they're that dense go ahead and uh get this closed up and we'll keep talking about this strain and keep puffing on the hip wrap very very tasty flour cherry punch is a satima sativa dominant hybrid it is a 43 strain for the eighth over there from truly florida the lineage on this strain is cherry ak-47 crossed with purple punch and those two strains come together to make cherry punch the white structure like you guys saw are very very dense nugs um they're like a light green color to them um very frosty uh with i would say red and purple hairs like it's definitely got some uh some oranges and purples in there whenever you grind up the bud and as you guys saw they're very very dense very frosty looking uh buds the trichomes come off on your fingers as you're uh as you're touching them no matter if you're breaking them up or not you know just me uh you know bring them out showing you guys i'm sure trichomes are coming off my fingers i can tell very very frosty almost white looking [Music] flower thc in this batch is coming in at 20.9 thc so almost 21 it's total of 734 milligrams in the entire eighth there's no cbd listed uh at least on the information on the jar i don't know if there is any in this batch truly didn't care enough to put it on there if there is but i am uh definitely feeling this flower already i'll tell you what i was saying earlier the taste on it is i would say sweet gassy but it's definitely got a little bit more in there like a peppery or a piney flavor on the end and that definitely translates through with the smell the smell on it is uh very sweet berries and then it's got that gas in there at the end and that gas comes from the gassy smell comes from uh the ak-47 and uh the sweet berry flavor almost comes from the purple punch so i would say both strains translate very well as for the feelings as for the the high it gives you [Music] i'd say it's a very euphoric um starting out very frontal head high i would say you definitely get that head head buzz that uh sativas are known for but it soon settles out mellows in to the rest of your body that's why uh it's a sativa dominant hybrid i would definitely say there is some indica uh indica effects in there not just straight sativa but i would say it's uh majority sativa you definitely get that head buzz and that uh very uppity euphoric happy high but it you still get that you know full body effects it's not just hearing uh cerebral definitely feeling it between my shoulder blades as well as you know in my legs you know it's definitely settling out very very creative high [Music] [Applause] i would recommend this flower to uh start your day or um you know if you got something that you need to do very creative wise whether it be uh you know you're not creative with something you need to focus i would say you know whether it be work or if you want to you know listen to a podcast or something something that doesn't need a lot of uh what's it called something you could focus on but that also doesn't need a lot of i would say attention but at the same time you know if you're working obviously you need attention but no this this strain is definitely good for that i would say this is definitely a nice euphoric uh creative focused high like i said i this isn't going to put you out in your ass or make you sleep or anything you're not going to want to watch a movie or anything on this flower it's not going to do that to you i'm definitely going to record this edit this get this video up very soon this uh flower very productive uh strain that's that's what i can say [Music] i thought it was gonna be a cherry pie in purple punch cross but it is cherry ak-47 if he was cherry pie he'd be more of an indica dominant hybrid but it is uh in fact sativa leaning after i uh researched into it [Applause] well very enjoyable indeed i went over there to uh true leave 64 their 64th location uh over there in puna gordon florida nice location uh it's one of the newer ones i've uh been to a few now i think i've been to about 10 locations in the state now uh true leaves and uh all very nice including this one nice uh helpful staff wasn't very busy at all i think there was a two or three of the people in there i went uh yesterday and there was a nice 25 or 25 discount 25 off discount statewide so if you went to true live yesterday you could have took advantage of that it was only yesterday uh what was it yesterday was saturday the 13th or 14th whatever day day before i put up this video whatever [Applause] [Music] it's very very nice enjoyable flower [Music] though definitely something to burn in the morning i would not suggest uh doing this in the uh the evening or you know especially at night it's not gonna help you with that and uh leafly said it helps patients with stress depression and pain i'd agree with that like i said it's a nice euphoric happy uplifted high so that'd be the straining depression stress and depression that it helps with and then the pain i do feel the tension between my shoulders being uh you know diminished definitely uh starting to loosen up a bit there so i could see the pain part as well [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] just a little hemp wrap here almost done i'm definitely enjoying these i should gonna pick up a few more if you haven't tried these guys you should uh cyclone hemp wraps they're not uh not sponsor anything just a nice little brand i like but no main focus is cherry punch over there from true leaf definitely recommend go ahead and get a few more puffs get out of here hope you guys have a great rest of your day smoke one for me smoke with your mama it's the weed funny signing off i recommend the uh cherry punch flower i i get it again like i said it's a nice uh daytime morning high very uh uplifted and euphoric have a great day everyone need a couple more rips cheers cheers guys have a great day", "1Hg8nJz6dVA": "[Music] oh what's up everyone welcome to another cannabis critique today we are talking about dr punch uh this one grown by a revolution we had a little bit of a run of revolution at my dispensary but this will be the end of my uh trifecta of revolution reviews uh this one is a cross of doc's og and purple punch and it came in at 28 thc and i wanted to get into this i get a lot of comments on thc percentage uh the percentage is going to change bats to batch guys so my badge could be more than your batch it could be less than your batch i'm just telling you the percentage of the batch that i received so just keep that in mind i always get comments like my batch was more than this my max was less than this well yeah every batch is a little bit different but for the most part they're gonna be at about the same thc percentage uh per strain but let's get into the breakdown on the doctor punch uh the look on this one was pretty impressive as most revolution flower is it had a great cure job uh it was a good density light green in color good denseness nice softness to the nugs a good good amount of trichome coverage this one really sparkled when you got it out in the sunlight i wasn't very impressive when you just look at it with the naked eye but like if you got it in a sunbeam or something it was really really sparkly had a lot of trichome coverage i gave it a look at 9.5 out of 10. it was very good the smell on this one was kind of disappointing i thought i'd get like some grape vibes from it because purple punch is one of the parents but i got like hardly any smell off of this one at all it was like a little bit earthy and citrusy but a very faint smell unfortunately which is kind of the norm for illinois flower i gave it an 8 out of 10 on the smell the break up here was good not too much to tell you there uh the nugs were nice and soft so they were you were able to break them up by hand and it broke up nicely in your grinder as well yielded a good amount of keef i gave the breakup a nine out of ten [Music] the taste on this one i say is mostly lemony i got a really really lemony occasional uh toke from this one uh and then on the the exhale was a lot of sweetness but every once in a while like i'd hit this stuff and i'd just be like overwhelmed with lemony flavor so that's mostly what i got from it lemon citrus type of vibe and then like a sweetness on the back end again there's not too much of that purple punch grapey type of earthy type of flavor going on with this one which is kind of disappointing but i gave the taste a 9 out of 10. i think the lemon really really came through for me the high here was very much on the indica side of things this one is labeled a hybrid but i'd say it's basically just a pure indica it's very relaxing uh makes you very kind of lazy type of buzz it was a very heavy head high kind of made me feel like like i got punched or something maybe that's why it's called dr punch but like it really kind of wipes you out uh towards the end of the day you really feel this one so i would not recommend uh medicating with this one uh during the day it's definitely an end of the day type of strength and i i love indicas but i don't know this one wasn't my favorite high so i gave the high an 8.5 out of 10. overall i'd say this is a it's a good indica leaning hybrid ideal for the end of the day might help you with pain relief or of course going to bed i gave it an 8.8 out of 10 overall and if you

getting a big scoop of it I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there [ __ ] it this video is for mature audience if you're not a mature audience this video is not for you what's up everybody Cubans here and today we are going to get into some rather expensive concentrates I picked up a gram of some hash rosin today that was priced at $75 and it is one of the most expensive grams of concentrate I have ever purchased so let's take a close look at what we got I've had a gram of Summit connoisseurs genetic and concentrates Tiger's milk and this stuff looks like a nice little slab of peanut butter I'm pretty excited pretty excited abot both so you can get a look at the packaging here this is that Tiger's milk and it's testing at about seventy nine percent THC and then it does have a little bit of CBD a in there but you know what I am so excited for this let's just take it down where are my clothes at let's get a nice nice little scoop here out of the email all fresh and clean and I'm gonna see how it does does [Music] um yeah that was really good I'm gonna actually throw that on a courts now I'm gonna throw that around on a few nails and see if we like it but just to compare I picked up some cheap dabs this cost 75 a gram for some hash rasen 75 bucks for this it's pretty expensive most most of my concentrates I usually find deals and get a lot of good looking stuff like this this is some live batter I got for about 15 bucks a gram one-fifth of the price now sometimes I find live sugars live diamonds of batters around that 15 to 20 dollar price if I'm getting it on a deal it's not the everyday price so begin the deal you can get this stuff cheap so it's really interesting to pay five times as much for a single gram of concentrate I can't I can't believe I did it it's still interesting to me that this costs five times as much as this other gram of some delicious looking stuff but some hash rods and it's hard to come by especially here in Colorado Springs it's not super common to find rosin hash rosin so I guess you got to pay that top dollar because it's so rare but let's get some more dabs of this cone I'm not done with this yet let's see what I'm gonna do some cold starts when you know that this is $75 and you get in a big school but I'm thinking to myself and that's like eight bucks right there okay [Music] it's throwing out a couple bucks in that [ __ ] it [ __ ] it and get a little bit more I need about three-fitty oh we got it okay okay just pricey tab right here damn it all right let's get a nice cold start here and see if it's super delicious on the court oh damn well damn okay okay that's good stuff so I just stabbed it a couple of times here and it's pretty good stuff but is it is it worth it is it worth paying five times as much as I do for some good live banner is it worth is it worth paying five times as much to get some solvent once that's basically the major difference is the fact that it's solvent list most concentrates are made with a solvent it's the easier method it's the most common method but with rosin they use heat and pressure to make it so they just basically squish the THC or they squish the extract out of the nugs or out of hash most of the time they'll make a hash and then they'll press the hash and that's what this is this is a this is hash rosin so it's a little bit more expensive and my understanding is the yield is a little bit lower it's it's a process to make the hash and then when you press the hash you wouldn't get the same type of yield as if you were doing like a butane or propane extraction so I think part of the process is it's a little bit harder to get high-quality product and you're typically going to get less with whatever amount of plant material you go into the process with so I think that affects the price it is pretty rare out here in Colorado Springs not a lot of people are pressing - I can find it in a few places some places have rosin and half chosen but it's not as common as BHO and pho and there's so many dispensaries that grow their own bud and they do their own in-house extractions so something like this I can I can pretty much get really cheap any day of the week if I'm looking around so for me to pay five times as much for this it's a little little far-fetched I honestly I'd rather have five grams of this and haven't done but yet and it's just I like volume I like to do a lot of dub so I'm gonna go back and forth on these we're gonna compare I just want to shave this I got this the same day I kick it costs literally one-fifth the price I'm just gonna see if it's if it's it if it's 20% it's good like it doesn't make oh god I just paid so much money but anyway anyway anyway yeah that's that's solid for the price that's sell it for $15 grand look um I I think it's good I think that that the rosin is good I'm gonna dab the rod let me have a bucket that was that was the I don't even know of the other strain is [Music] [Music] I mean it's definitely better [Music] the Robins better smoother and tastes a little better you can't really compare the highs because I'm better than both back for it but it's all about the taste for me and it is smoother is it pay five times the price smoother [Music] I don't think so because it's not it's not five times as good yeah I don't even know how you would get five times as give it something like this this isn't the best this isn't the best cheap batter that I've got but for something to be five times as good as this would be pretty impressive so this is not five times as good probably not worth five times the price if I see it on deals I may get it but I don't think it's worth anything that's worth three times the price two times the price even thirty forty five bucks I get why it costs so much it's a it's a little bit less common not as many people are making it and you get lower yields with it I get why it it costs more but it's not currently it's not at the price point where it's super worth it for me to only buy rosin maybe if I had a press and I could get amazing yields myself but I don't grow and I don't have any interest in growing so it's like I don't have to buy all my nugs anyway to smash it so kind of interesting I like finding deals so maybe I'll get excited about finding a deal in the future but yeah this isn't actually the most expensive gram of concentrate I've ever purchased a few years ago I remember purchasing a I purchased several grams actually a full melt bubble hash that I got remember the dispensary but I got some full melt bubble I think it was about eighty eight bucks a gram I think I remember paying just under ninety a gram it was really really good stuff it was like some of the craziest stuff I ever spent I I gotta go back and look for some pictures of it cuz it was a few years ago those full mount bubble hash grams I got were like pretty good but after I got a mouse this isn't worth eighty eight bucks a gram what the [ __ ] did I just do so I kind of feel that way here what the [ __ ] that I just do but we made a video that's what the [ __ ] we just did so let's do a few more dabs of this [ __ ] might as well I've only taken out several dollars off of it I don't see if we can take several more I'm interested in the cold start here so let's do that [Music] here's a few dollars [Music] yeah this is good stuff still I wish I could afford you dabs well this was actually pretty fun and I'm pretty blessed after all those naps and I'm glad I finally got to try this rosin up and see it in a bunch of dispensaries even if I did pay money for it but if you liked this video be sure to subscribe for more content in the future and check out my other social media I'll have links in the description below and for my live streams tune in to twitch at twitch.tv slash Cubans if you tune in at night I'm probably live right now getting high dabbing some much cheaper than than $75 a gram rosin unless you tuned in very shortly after this is made that I might have some of this left but uh come hang out and we'll see you next time [Music] I would say perfect balance but I'm going [Music] [Music] [Music]", "U0NyIxSNOlo": "okay hello everybody got a couple of different strains and some weed to show you the first one being a hold 35 grams of some white fire OG got my team in to pack in there to weight control to keep it fresh see it's really good stuff so that's that a complete completely full jar there and I got this one which is called cherry punch it's very good as you see it's absolutely lambaste it with trichomes and purple so among the best strain I've ever had here this stuff is super super potent it's upwards a thirty five percent THC here's a bud down here I'll show you looks great that's pretty much it just wanted to show you these two different screens got about a quarter in here and this here's about an ounce and a half it's packed to the

everybody frosty McNasty here hope all is well if not I hope you get well and stay well and the thing one thing is I really do hope that I really do hope all is well and if not I hope you get well and stay well I've been saying that for some years now man because I really do believe it and I really want everybody to be good good spirits good mental health good physical health to some clients out there I know I know I know I know and I'm working on the issue and to those to those that don't know what I'm talking about my issue is with these rooms I've been running different strains and I've been doing mostly testing strains and at times that I should be flowering out for bigger yields to take care of more people but I've been testing a lot of strains and now I have narrowed it down I got rid of about seven strains out of my entire operation to to really narrow it down to what I want to do and what I want to use for future crosses and everything like that this room is a 10 by 10 room and I'm using about I'm using about I would say about 5 by nine about five by nine feet of canopy I got about 10 18 18 plants in there and a five by nine I'm using 2000 watts of just regular HPS bulbs I had metal halides in there for a minute somebody said are you doing it too late and some are trying to tell me something we're not showing [ __ ] like this and then it's like they still want to say something but you really can't say anything you know it's none you can say this wrong imma show you a lot of things in here I'm off try to focus more on my line on my citrus splits because it's my [ __ ] and I'm not trying to pump you up or anything how did this whole ruin the most beautiful plant to me in here is the black cherry punch but that has a lot to do with the size of the bud as you can see and the color of the color purple and green I mean it was more beautiful on a plant than that nothing it's not more beautiful internet having purple and green on your [ __ ] plan that's why people always try to use strains and everyone a half color because it's a bag of peel that sells a lot more it does better and when you see your strains okay maybe I'm the only person let me come to go through this okay so say say you look at its strength all these strains are like it's so close in genetic makeup is ridiculous because there's been so many crosses and bad crosses that a lot of things resemble each other so when you find something that doesn't resemble anything you can use you sometimes most likely have a winner you know so with something like this right here this is black cherry punch but well something that looks like this put in a bag you're not gonna have any complaints as long as it tastes good and gets you hard it doesn't have to be the strongest it doesn't have to be the most flavorful but you could look at this plant you can look at it and already taste the fruit flavor in your mouth you know it's gonna have that fruit flavor in your mouth right so that's what color does to me when I see color I think of like a fruity tasteful flan and I just want to know like do you guys feel the same way about that like when you see a I gotta say you see like a green green plant you know it's like a Kim dog oh gee some kind of gas you know me some sour or some kind of gas I'm kind of it's gonna had a door it's gonna have that weird fruit taste like not a bad not bad as weird but like a different kind of fruit really bad at coming up with sayings for that type of [ __ ] you know like the Strawberry Shortcake ray you see it's green but you also see it door can you see it turning purple so we know it's a fruit the fruit in it is strawberry so but all the strawberries they're gonna turn a little color this VIN emoji I don't know what the [ __ ] let me look that up real quick because this vin emoji right here has the color but it smells nothing like fruit it smells like straight gas it smells like that Oh Dida that she's looking for [Music] okay so the vin emoji this is a beautiful plan may have come from home on both seeds it's the indica dominant cross between poison OG and rare dankness number one so has an aroma of skunk pine lemon diesel but it still has the purple and that fruit is whoop dilemma so all purple like to me i really think that all purple implants is gonna have that fruit taste that smack your lips you know that point you know I'm saying and this right here coming up is these citrus splits man you said your split starting to get a little color and I was coming from that sherbert line that's coming from that daddy at a sour bananas sherbert you know you got the banana and the sherry got a look you got flavors in there gonna be a [ __ ] to trim so I'm not really looking towards this Fino as a keeper I really like I really hope it's not a keeper because I don't want to be trimming that type of [ __ ] I know that sounds crazy as hell but I can only be honest with myself I hate trim it I do not like sitting there playing with the weed and chopping it all up because when I see like like these three okay you know this is one plant these ones is one of the ones that I think is going to be a keeper just because of the frost production the smell the aroma the hardiness like he got hard and this is his final week probably like the final ten days I probably let it go one more week so not this Sunday but next Sunday for a whole total of 70 days I'm pretty sure that's gonna be 70 days you just got 56 that's yeah that's gonna be a total of 70 days I'm gonna try to take this whole room 270 days because I think that's what it's gonna meet no snot sees or anything right there don't worry about that that's the little hair it's like a little bundle of hairs really close to each other a little bundle of orange hairs like a little group meeting saying like damn [ __ ] done now how you feeling I'm hot too and we should stick together you know I'm saying but look at look at her this is this is citrus bliss this is what you're getting if you got your packs man if you got those tester packs I gave out you bought some from the website which I do encourage everybody to do the support goes a long way for the channel and keeps me motivated and sharing things and look at it so this is like some of the citrus blitz had a little purple in there also and you know we can only wait and see what's going to happen I'm actually going to stand out for these to be tested at the end of the harvest I think look at it see which one's really catch my eye and I really like and then send those are fast testers so probably will have about eight out of ten or seven out of the ten strange fee knows that I'm running for testers [Music] yes oh the citrus bliss is really like it's really amazing oh I'm honestly happy about it I didn't get a chance to run into a lot of splits yet just because I've been doing so much other [ __ ] and I ranch a lot other to death past few years I've been a lot of 45 so I kind of know what structuring what I'm looking at but this was something totally new to me so that's why I'm more infatuated with the citrus bliss and once you smell it you'll understand exactly what I mean that smell is like it's something that if you had a whole bag of you'll just keep inhaling like you you want to rub that [ __ ] over you for Cologne and it's a beautiful smelling plan look at her it's glassy man I stopped in perfect health and what I'm saying about the some guy said I had Powder Mill doing 1 minute and 32 seconds saw the last video order video before last I'm not sure and I told him that that was my cell phone light flashed I was my cell phone flash you know cuz the flash was on the cell my cell phone pinpoints it on certain areas so he just caught a little glimpse and he caught a glimpse of some frost I was running along the side of it and he's like that's p.m. and I'm like you know just calm down brother you know I mean out of all this good good good sexiness in his room you try to pick a single point in time and tell me that I got p.m. when it's my video in my room and I know that is nothing going on in my room that was really that was really shocking to hear I didn't like that man like that at all so I told him about it so he text me back and said yeah it's right there is frost on the Sun its p.m. on a Sun I look at these leaves right here look at all these trichomes on the side of that [ __ ] leaf man that's not what p.m. grows deme okay that's not what p.m. grows p.m. grows in the middle of the main stem like the middle of the main vein on the leaf that's what p.m. grows that it congregates they're not on the sides you see something on the side of that leaf that's [ __ ] frost man stop Hayden alright stop Hayden ask a question don't just say it's there and argue me about it this is mine it's mine this is my platform this is my channel no it's my [ __ ] I don't like that you they respect my [ __ ] but just don't get on here I'm serious about it I'm really serious about my crash this is what I think of day in and day out this is what I fascinate over this is what I obsess over I'm really serious about my [ __ ] nothing you but you see that girl hat right there she had a wig on that [ __ ] was flaring out like Donald Trump hit it man citrus places a frosty [ __ ] but the most beautiful planet here I would have to say is two of my citrus bliss phenols and the black cherry punch no matter which one in house did a great job with this I can't be biased about it they just want they just masters that they [ __ ] I love running the genetics hard as [ __ ] hard as [ __ ] man these buds are super dense and they still ready to go and I'm ready to go too so until later peace", "fvpoKgghoX0": "hello everyone welcome back to rose of green i hope everyone is doing well uh in today's video we're gonna go over a few things i'm gonna show you guys the final weight from uh the main lining and uh how we did in that tent with the in-house genetics black cherry punch uh this here what you're looking at is relentless genetics rotten rosie uh like i've told everyone before i've grown out the rossi before actually i still have a plant of the rossi kicking around but uh anyway i'm using that for something special but uh the rosie produced really well and these girls are stacking up just how i wanted to uh we will get into that in a second though first off i just wanted to start off by saying thank you to my new subscribers uh all of my new subscribers thank you for joining all my old subscribers uh thanks a lot i really appreciate all you guys sticking it through with me and i would like to say uh thank you to a couple new members who hit that join button beside the subscribe and uh i want to thank uh trey landing mike david and trixie five thank you all for becoming members um now we will get on with this video you know what before we get into this tent here i'm just gonna bring you right to the weigh-in uh because a lot of you guys were expecting the weigh-in from uh the in-house so uh here we go let's get at it okay so i thought i would share a little bit of this with you guys i'm just doing some trimming here this is uh the black cherry punch and uh it's really nice and frosty it's got some really nice purples in there see if you can see some purples there we go it's a really really nice drain it's nice and frosty as you can see i'm very very happy with this it's very very nice and dense very nice colors and she gets you pretty she gets you feeling pretty pretty good so anyway i will just show you what i am doing here all i'm doing is i'm trimming these up see they're covered in frost so what i do is i just sit here and trim away so start off with getting rid of some of those leaves take a bite off yes i do have trimmer auto trimmers but if the buds not real real leafy if it's got a good calyx to leaf ratio i will typically just use scissors because it does not take long at all sometimes i will wet trim sometimes i will dry trim it just depends um i prefer to wet trim it's a lot easier for me for some reason a lot of people like dry trimming they find it easier it's just whatever's good for different folks i guess and uh that is basically done for myself so there we go i'll bring that up and show you and uh that's about it so when i'm done trimming this up when i'm done trimming this up what i'll do is i will uh i'll do away and let you guys know the weights just so you guys get a final of the black cherry punch um i'll show you again just how nice these buds are just beautiful very nice stuff i'm very impressed with it but anyway let me get on with this and i'll uh get you guys the weights here okay here we are so we're going to do the weigh-in this is a different pheno from this one but they're both really really dang there was actually uh two different phenotypes but uh yeah these things are extremely extremely dank and dense stuff but uh anyway let's get on with the way off here what i'm going to do is i'm going to put this on here and then this bag here weighs as much as one of those bags so i'll put that on there i'm going to tear it and then i'll take off this bag 8.69 so 100 and 70 we'll see 170 small bag okay and now let's get on with this big bag this has got to be at least a pound oh close close close so four 429 so that's not uh um so 599 grams total so we're way over a pound there we did not bad 599 grams that wasn't even growing for yield that was just uh just doing some main lining but worked out pretty well anyway hope you guys enjoyed the weigh-in again really nice awesome dent stuff very impressive very frosty but uh that's the weigh-in for these so i was uh i was pretty surprised with the outcome there i did not think i was gonna get that much it came out to like 1.4 pounds or something close to that 1.35 or 1.4 um which isn't real real bad i wasn't shooting for yield a lot of you guys who followed the whole uh grow knew that i was not going for yield it was more like just a main lining for colas to grow some nice big colas and get all of the weight up top on top of the plants instead of scattered all throughout so uh it just shows you can pull off 1.4 pounds fairly easy without any crazy training or anything uh just a basic main line so um anyway what else we're going to do here is i'm going to show you guys what's going on in here uh then i'm going to show you guys the autos that i did the transplanting and the new seeds that i popped as well but uh first off i want to say something too i know a few of you guys do not like the light reviews that i do on the channel i do do light reviews that does not mean that i recommend those lights guys what you see me grow with is what i recommend so like these sand light i definitely recommend those uh they're just a little more expensive and uh the mars hydro fc 6500 or the fc series altogether is good and then uh that sp 3000 and the sp 6500 those are all good lights they got the meanwhile drivers the new uh they got the new chips from uh samsung the lm 301bs um they are identical chips to 301h don't be fooled by other uh there's other light companies out there who are gonna tell you the 301 h is better it is not is the identical chip there is nothing different with it whatsoever the only difference with it is is that it has a h on the end instead of a b and the h stands for horticulture i promise you uh people are going to try to argue me saying that it's it's better if you look at the website it's got better efficiencies and all that no it does not i contacted samsung myself and they told me straight up uh they are identical nothing different just geared towards horticulture that's why there's an age there anyway i just thought i would explain that a bit uh samsung chips are running the game right now but i'm telling you right now ozram are up there with some of the best uh lots of people don't use them because they're a little bit more expensive of a chip but uh these sand light here these have the high power oz rams in them and they're uh they're awesome but uh anyway i just thought i would get on about those light reviews um i mostly do the reviews just so when people uh are looking for lights they could google that light and then my video pops up so that i get a review of it so they could see what they're buying so i just basically do the reviews to help out like that uh some of them i will recommend if they're real well but other than that they're just light reviews so uh don't come down on me too hard for doing those reviews i just like to mix it up a little bit it gives me a little bit of content and it helps you guys as well of knowing about that light so anyway um uh let me just let me see here what was i gonna tell you guys oh yeah okay so here we are we're on the second week of flower here with these girls and i just want to show you something what you would be looking for so if this was a male you would be coming down here and you would be looking carefully at like say a place uh let me see if i can get my zoom to work uh say like a place like that right in here you would be looking for a balls you would see balls and that would tell you that it's a male if there's no balls you're good to go so anyway these are the second we could flower these are feminized seeds so obviously they're all going to be them i still check them over to make sure that a male doesn't get in there or that we don't end up with a herm but uh yeah so anyway a lot of you guys have been asking me about these here these are matrix okay these are matrix and underneath those those are matrix pads they're by floraflex uh these rings here are three inch frames they fit this matrix uh this is a whole matrix system except for that header down there that manifold there is off of uh amazon i forget the name of it i think it might be by rain bird or something i really truly can't remember i told you guys last time but for all those asking what these are they're the matrix and you can find them in my link below at indoor growing canada use my code rose of green for 20 or if you're in the united states go to indoorgrowing.com so in canada it's indoor growing canada.com and in the states it's indoorgrowing.com so that's where you get these for everybody who asks because i bet you a hundred or not a hundred but i bet at least 25 of you guys ask me about them what i use them for is to stop my soil from drying out the top layer so that all my uh beneficial life will live and continue to live and speaking of beneficial microbes that was another question that i got a lot of and this here is what i use i like tribus bloom by impello bioscience uh this stuff is awesome this is my second bottle of this i've been using it for a while now i will not go back i see extremely more growth a lot more healthy plants going on with them and so on but there are also other ones that you get like step little soil has em1 essential microbes and you just use those one to two milliliters per thousand milliliters so per liter and then we will move on to there is microwheel mass microwheel mass is all right this is the sample i got from them i've actually got a couple samples i used them for a while until i found out tribus when i really seen the difference and then there is recharge recharge is by scotty real and uh i don't know if you know the dude grows or whatever anyways you go to recharge canada.ca and just read up about it or go to uh growers recharge or something like that uh in the united states anyway just google recharge guys and you'll find out all about it this is a dry uh a dry stuff that you work with it's full of kelp and microbes and whatnot people ask me how long this stays good for and it will stay good as long as you want just don't let it get any moisture into it so anyways those are the four basic microbes uh that i use but i really like the tribus uh travis does not sponsor me in any way uh they do not give me any free stuff but i will continue to use this stuff because i actually do see results so anyway let's get in here i'm going to show you guys just what's going on so we'll do an overview shot in here and as you can see everything's looking real real healthy no deficiencies whatsoever everything's got that proper green color to it and i guess i'm gonna have to lift this up uh when your pulse meter is down below the canopy it will actually warn you and tell you that uh tell you that your lighting is low um unfortunately it grew out so even here you can see it's getting taller uh that back plant as i knew it was going to be a lot more of a stretchier plant but uh all in all this tent is full once again and you could just see how well these girls are stacking there's a bit of a gap there but i got a feeling that's gonna fill in good uh this pinot here is stacking a little the same pretty much and then this one in the back is a little stretchier which i don't like too too much but it looks like it's gonna do all right and then this girl here stacking about the same uh the phenos are different uh there's a couple different phenos actually this one and this one are almost basically the same then that one there's the stretchier one in the back a little different structure to it as well as uh that one there in the back is kind of just doing its own little thing as well so uh it's more closer to these two phenos than that one but we will see more about that once we get into bloom but anyway let's move on here i'm done showing you guys everything make sure you keep a really nice clean environment guys that will stop you from getting bugs and uh also i forgot one more thing people were asking me about what do i do if i get like uh gnats or uh thrips or spider mites or something guys i'm telling you uh beneficial microbes are awesome her beneficial uh mites are awesome uh don't buy them off amazon they'll be dead by the time they get to you go on the internet find somebody who sells um uh predator mites sorry that's what they are um fine predator mites they'll hook you up with which ones you need for what bugs you have and your issue will be gone within days so i had uh uh what do you call those things uh uh fruit flies and or actually not sorry yeah so i had nuts and i tried the sticky things i tried my safer spray and i just couldn't get them because they were deep down into my roots so what i did is i decided to try predator mites for my first time i put them in all of my tents and they were all gone within three days i reapplied just to be safe about three days later i saved some of them and uh i haven't seen any since and that was uh six weeks ago now so we went six weeks with nothing showing up looks like they're all dead and that is what i will be using from here on out i was never a big fan of them um i i was just never a fan of adding bugs to my grow room but really they're not a big deal they all die off anyways within like 30 days so anyway sorry for babbling there let's move on now we are going to move on into the autoflower tent and i will show you how those girls are doing from the transplant okay so here we are in here with the autoflowers uh you can see this thing is just a giving her that is my uh dehumidifier uh it's a pretty good one it holds uh i think a gallon it is or a little more yeah it holds like six liters lasts a couple days and uh it just produces very well so anyway you can see these autoflowers back here i'm actually just gonna turn this off for a second you can see these autoflowers back here what i'm gonna do is i'm going to top this one right away there we go it's topped and let's see if this one's ready uh yeah we can top it so you just bend it and it snaps i'll spread those leaves apart a bit and these ones i'm not topping it they are uh they're having a little bit of a rough time i'm not gonna lie i did injure them when i transplanted them uh so they will bounce back obviously but that was my own fault i just wasn't careful enough when i did it i'm usually a lot more careful and i really rushed these out because i was trying to upload my video uh for the channel but anyway they will bounce back they're not too too bad they're just looking a little sad and uh these girls here are now topped so we're gonna go with these ones see how they're doing these are the northern cheese haze and these are the sour stomper and the northern cheese haze even came up before the sour stomper and they were much more healthier and growing quicker than these but anyway we'll get it all fixed up i got a favor for you guys to ask um youtube is now shadow banning me again uh they took

change to a jumbo us half doll so this is a very simple handling basically you're going to hide the jumbo us half dollar in your hand covering it and you're going to keep it at your side with this hand all you're going to do is you're going to release pressure with your thumb as a drops keeping cover of you bringing this hand up so the exposed view is you have to set your side the jumbo us

can give that up for examination thanks you", "AuodEj6oziI": "what's up guys thanks for stopping by and checking out another one reviews today i went out and picked up some more platinum vapes these are some new strands that were recently released i can tell by the lab testing date they haven't been out very long and i'm constantly on these websites and constantly looking so whenever new strands pop up i try to run and grab them for you guys and tess and i know platinum vape seems to be one of my most viewed products that i review on here so i haven't been straying away too much from them plus every time i get on every time i go to the dispenser to grab more there seems to be new strands out so i was saying this in the beginning i wish platinum vape would putting the strands out more frequently and it seems like they're doing so so that's pretty cool because like i said platinum vape has always been my go-to um company whenever i want to get you know this lit i also um like select delete a lot too but platinum vape is always my favorite really because it tastes good they i feel like they make a good product and it's not so expensive and there's usually often deals that are random platinum vape which make it more um enticing to buy as well so that being said i'm going to take a look today we have a hybrid which is cherry pie it's lab test date was a 6 or 3 16 of 21 and then guava cake and its lab test date was three eight of 21. i've already went ahead and pre-loaded the uh cherry pie just being that i don't have the table set up here and actually to be honest with you guys i've been i've been saying i'm gonna get the tail back out and go back to my old setup and do all that but i kind of like the way this is set up i kind of weigh the like the way the camera is in front of me how can um you guys can see everything it just seems like a better setup without that big table and the way i have my microphone right here i like the way that so i like the feel of it kind of feels a little more intimate a little more one-on-one with you guys why'd i do a double blink that was creepy but anyways cherry pie first this laptop it does come in at 82.81 right off the bat really good tasting cartridge really smooth kind of piney and sweet a nice herbal taste to it this is a well-balanced cartridge really tastes nice i've noticed excuse me got them little rookie lungs but uh i've noticed with a lot of these new strands that platinum vapes put out i've only not liked one and it was the sativa that was i think the apple fritter i did see the chocolate tie they had out today on um the sativa i know there's a couple of sativas there's actually a few other indicas too so maybe later on in the week i can grab some more of those i do have two other ones to test too i think it's larry og and i'm not sure uh larry og and hindu kush they're in hindu kush i picked up as well so check out that review probably tomorrow i'll do that one for you guys but right off the rip this one here like i said it's really sweet the cherry pie it's well balanced it's herbal tasting got a nice aroma that comes off at you this is a really good cartridge i'll give this one four stars it it's got a nice smoothness to it and it's not too harsh i could see myself probably picking this up more than once maybe once or twice it's a cartridge that you can enjoy smoking readily regularly regularly jesus cry me yeah this is a cartridge you could pick up multiple times and you'd be happy with it so get a chance to check out cherry pie let me know in the comments what you think if you have checked it out like i said i know i do know it's fairly new it hasn't been out terribly long so if you had a chance to check it out or if you haven't grab it come back and let me know see if you think you agree with me or if you don't i appreciate you on that so the cherry pie for me two thumbs up i'll give it a four stars and i didn't get to flick you guys off sorry yes wipe my nose off with that being said i will switch up and we'll get this guava kick loaded the indica that's the only thing without having a table you know it makes it a little bit harder to to load this stuff up and everything but i mean it's not like i'm loading a magazine to a gun or something you know i mean it's a one part you push it and screw it so i think i can figure it out and do not make it too difficult why did i just drop that box hold on guys sorry about that so this uh guava cake is 83.34 and it is an indica this one right here it's a little more it's a little harsher especially after having trying that cherry pie this guava cake is a little harsher it's a little more more peppery piney tasting it's definitely not bad it's not bad but with all the other strands that come out well as of late you don't being able to try them and stuff you're going to have ones that aren't that don't knock you off your feet you know what i mean some that are just you know borderline and that are basic and they're good cartridges but they're just you know what i mean they're okay they're not nothing that's tremendous or dependence or that makes me want to say hey guys you got to go out and check this cartridge out right now go out and grab it that cherry pie i would say guys when you're going out you're going to buy a cartridge maybe just get one or you're getting four or however many getting include cherry pie in your new one because that is a great cartridge i will say that with this one i'm going to say if you haven't tried it and you've tried all the other ones and you want to try guava cake try it and see what you think but personally i would say that with all the new strands that have come out there are some that are a lot better than this one it is really overbearing peppery um it does have that herbal taste piney taste to it which would make it pretty you know well balanced if the peppery if it wasn't so peppery and i have noticed i have noticed lately platinum vape that you get a little peppery with your indicus your indicators are a little peppery they're a little strong peppery lately not all of them not all of them i will say but some of them have been really overbearingly peppery not to where they make it it terrible but you just expect a little more balance of sweetness to the pepper you don't want that you know that stick strong peppery piney taste to overpower every cartridge and i feel like the indicas with pot with platinum vape there there's been a few out of these new strands maybe the last not the the second to last from these ones or really but i mean it doesn't make it none of them terrible like i said i don't think there's any of the new strands that i would actually be too bummed out to have gotten all of them have been good it's just some of them are really good some are just mediocre some are just regular like i said even the regular like you know peppery ones that i say are over dominantly peppery are not really the balance that you're looking for or that i'm looking for when in a cartridge still outweigh like you know prestos or them high lifes or uh even the red buds i'm sorry a lot of people um messaged me and did tell me some things about red bugs that they enjoyed or you know told me some strands to check out that they did like and that they did prefer that i probably would like and not that i didn't take your advice or i wasn't willing to take your advice i was just really put off by the first couple ones that i had so put off that i didn't really want to try any other ones so i kind of stick with my go-to cartridges personally that i want to smoke on a regular basis would be like platinum vape mkx selectively i don't mind stizzy i do like stizzy a little overpriced you know when you're talking about this lit um so my go-to ones like i said platinum vape select elite mkx would be another one but i prefer these two you know select elite and platinum vape over those two anyways so out of all even out of the worst like the elite strand that they put out it's still better than presto's top strand you know and i think presto's top string is like their tahoe g but like i said even the guava cake i'm going to give it a three and that three without the presto's 10. so that's kind of the spectrum i'm saying is you wouldn't be disappointed if you got this cartridge you wouldn't go home and and try and be like damn it i don't want to smoke this i want to go get a different one you'd be happy with it or you would you know you make it surprise you until it was gone and maybe not buy it again maybe you would like it buy it again but you wouldn't be necessarily disappointed with it it just wouldn't it's just to me it's not knocking my socks off i prefer some of the other ones over this i probably would pick you know like say uh the d trick there was a bubble detroit bubba that was a good one better than this one you know they're gob stoppers a lot of them are better than heaven are better than squava cake but it's still a stern cartridge still a good cartridge don't get me wrong and somehow well that's weird now there goes i've been using this new breeze battery that i picked up not because i like it not because the only thing is it's what's convenient about it is it charges by apple and i have an iphone so therefore i can charge it with my i don't have to get out of usb a separate charger so all my other ones are up there i just been being lazy and haven't been getting on my usb charger and charging i switched internet uh modems i got like this g or g seven or something this new modem and i used to use all my plug my usb plugs i'd plug them in the back of my modem and that's what i would charge my batteries with because my modem was right here so i could just switch on and off you know while recording or they'd be charged while i was recording i could pull them off and now that i got this new one it doesn't have that charge thing in it the usb charge so i have to put out a separate charger and all that so i've just been using my iphone charger really it's just out of laziness i don't prefer it it's not any better it's not any really any worse i have actually batteries that perform probably better than this one does like my uh uh you you can't your can uh union that one works a lot better than this one you can see it's got so many different settings on it pre-heats and stuff this one doesn't have a preheat it's really basic but it gets the job done like i said out of laziness it works for me so cherry pie four stars this guava cake only three like i said it's really peppery not too balanced with that peppery it's really overbearing but let me know in the comments what you think if you tried it i appreciate you guys i love you if you haven't subscribed think about subscribing i'll put something down here to remind you and i'll be back as soon as i can with some more reviews for", "8uVUzWJgDu0": "good morning everyone I'm Chris pyre for the Johns Hopkins center for I'm delighted to welcome you to the first event of the fall for the 2018 2019 academic year this is a bit of a hybrid event today where we're gonna start with this symposium on HIV and syphilis we are gonna have I think a wonderful bridging speaker in the middle of the day at the lunch there are very few people who could do an implementation science keynote and a syphilis and HIV keynote but Patrick Sullivan is one of them so we're delighted to have him and I did see him he's here he's in the building putting in a grant today but will be with us shortly and and we're really I think also particularly delighted as we kick off the syphilis symposium that our partners from the Baltimore City Health Department and the assistant commissioner for clinical services Deena Greenbaum is here and it's gonna is gonna kick us off with framing the issues so that I think is is the future of the CFR we want to be as integrated and helpful and useful to the city and the state and the communities we serve as we possibly can be so uh so we're really delighted about that I just want to say briefly the impetus for this syphilis and HIV symposium because I think that will help start off the day and this really came out of an HP TN protocol that I've served as protocol chair for HP TN o 7-8 which was an attempt to use deep chain respondent driven sampling to recruit men in four US cities gay bisexual and other men have sex with men of all races and ethnicities and identify men living with HIV and not virally suppressed and recruit them into a case management intervention that might improve rates of viral suppression in this group and this is an unusual study for the HP TN because the the prevention trials Network generally has HIV incidents as their endpoint this was the only study in the network that was focused entirely on men living with HIV and trying to drive down viral suppression so it's kind of the other side of the equation from primary prevention really secondary prevention approach in the end we we screened close to 1,400 men 1,300 men and changed so it was a very large sample and the cities where we did this work were Boston Baltimore Atlanta Georgia and Birmingham Alabama the good news is that we did find a substantial proportion of men living with HIV who were virally suppressed so that's great it was about 80% viral suppression and that is somewhat what you'd expect because these are all University centers the bad news is that the HIV prevalence overall in this population was 70% which is kind of breathtaking in the respondent driven sampling men and then asking them to recruit their peers the prevalence was 50% and then that one of the things that was so striking to us was that among this very large almost 900 men that we identified living with HIV about 22% had reactive syphilis serology to both the nonspecific and the Treponema specific tests so that is really an extraordinary burden and when we dug into that a little bit more it turned out that 91% of the men with syphilis were HIV co-infected so this is a syphilis outbreak that is very much happening in the context of HIV infection and a substantial proportion of those people both had active syphilis and were not virally suppressed so that is really an enormous challenge both for those men's health but also for of course onward transmission of both pathogens so that was something of a a wake-up call for us I will say that of the four cities for once Baltimore did not have the highest prevalence it was rather surprisingly and disturbingly Atlanta where among the men living with HIV 31% had syphilis which is really quite an extraordinary amount and-and-and when we talked to the staff there they were not surprised they all kind of said yeah yeah yeah we've you know that this is about what we see in our clinic that about you know this very high proportion of men who have sex with men have syphilis infections so it really is an epidemic and then many of you will have seen and I know the STI experts in the room where many of you were at the the recent CDC conference again for the fourth year in a row STI rates increased in the United States syphilis is not the most common but a rate of increase it had the fastest so in the last five years there's been a 76 percent increase in syphilis diagnoses and that is really I think just breathtaking and again with those CDC data we don't have gender and sexual orientation on everybody but for whom that the data are available 70 percent of those infections are in men who have sex with men which is after all sometimes gay men like myself we think that there are a lot of us in this country but actually we're a small proportion of the population and to have that large a burden of infection in such a small subgroup really tells you this is a concentrated epidemic of syphilis in men who have sex with men and particularly in men have sex with men we're living with HIV so that is really our challenge and I think that that is why the CFR felt that we really ought to kick off this new year trying to address this public health problem we are delighted to have with us to start this day Adina Greenbaum who as I mentioned is the assistant commissioner for clinical services for the Baltimore City Health Department and someone who's well known to us and has had a good part of her career in training at Hopkins we're delighted that the city is so engaged and taking this seriously and Adina out further adieu if you're gonna set the stage for us and talk about Baltimore the city we all love so please join me in welcoming Adina green bow [Applause] thank you hello good morning I'm going to provide a brief and fairly simple and I think straightforward overview of the epidemiology of syphilis in Baltimore and then talk a little bit about a current syphilis outbreak that we're seeing in the city that's not among MSM that's among a different population but I couldn't talk about the current situation of syphilis in baltimore without mentioning the current outbreak that we're seeing so first i'm gonna try to cover three main areas first the health department's general role in syphilis what we do day to day in syphilis then a brief overview of baltimore syphilis epidemiology and then recent syphilis activity that we've seen in the city so I've been asked this question several times some by members members of CFR just what is the health department's structure when it comes to both syphilis and HIV and who does what so I just wanted to take a few minutes to over to go over that so we have the health commissioner who's dr. Alina when and then I'm one of the assistant health commissioner's underneath her and oversee both clinical services which are the clinics that the Health Department has that provide direct services to the people of Baltimore and the boxes that are highlighted in yellow are those that have some direct activity having to do with syphilis in the Health Department so we have our STD and prep clinic our HIV and Hep C clinic a dental and TB clinic and our clinical lab as well as our mobile clinic and then as of November I'm also overseeing the HIV and STD prevention activities in the Health Department so that includes all of our EPI and surveillance for HIV and STDs in the city our HIV and STD prevention programs which include our HIV testing programs and coordinating HIV testing among partners in the city our newly formed prep and new equals you programming and our newly formed Hep C program our HIV and STD field operations which include our D is or our partner services team which I'll talk a little bit more about our linkage to care team for HIV and Hep C services and our outreach team which does HIV and STD testing throughout the city and then our newly formed social innovations and community engagement program so will talks a little bit about some of these groups like I said that are in yellow that work on syphilis in the city so what are the syphilis prevention and control activities in the city so first there's syphilis testing so we have an outreach team and other partners who do syphilis testing we have several mobile vans that go out and do testing throughout the city or we attend health fairs or events that the mayor asks us to attend or Community fairs or when the community calls and says hey can the Health Department come and do testing I'm at my event those are the folks who go out and then we do have our lab which runs all the syphilis test for all of the Health Department activities and there's some other groups throughout the city utilize our lab as well and then the Health Department is notified of all positive syphilis serologies in the city no matter where those or are ordered from no matter what lab those tests are are are conducted in and then I just wanted to mention how there's several more than these three but several references in Komar which is the code of Maryland regulations which are the regulations that the Health Department uses to do our work that reference syphilis so the ones that I've listed here have to do mostly with reporting health providers are and labs are obligated to report syphilis cases to the city and how it's the city's obligation to follow up on those cases and ensure people are in treatment and then there's other sets of regulations surrounding things for example like partner services so then once we get our labs once we get all these labs into the Health Department um every single one of those labs is sorted and gone through and we use this syphilis reactor grid which lists the different types of lab results you can have on top and then the ages going down this side to decide what is done what is done and based on the level of risk based on the probability that this is an infectious case versus a non infectious case of syphilis that determines what the Health Department does so in some cases nothing is done at all with those labs it's clear that this is a non infectious case of syphilis in that case is considered closed in some cases a little bit more work is needed so that's um some administrative work is done within the Health Department to evaluate is this probably an infectious case of syphilis that requires further investigation or not and then in many cases we can't determine that within the walls of the health department so we need to send people out and find out more information about the case to make sure that that person has been adequately adequately treated so in those cases one of so all three of these things occur so first we call the provider and we find out more information about treatment the reason for the patient's visit any symptoms they might have had in any additional locating information for the patient we call the patient to make sure they're aware of the result confirm that they were treated provide a further education about syphilis get information about their symptoms to help with staging of their disease get information about partners sexual partners that they have discuss a risk reduction plan with that patient make sure that they received HIV testing and other risk reduction counseling such as prep and and ask about access to condoms and ask if they would like condoms and then we call their partners and we use a language along the lines of somebody who have had sexual contact with in the past has had a positive test and and inform them that that they should get tested for STDs or syphilis or or HIV depending on the situation and help and help them get tested and if we can't reach them we leave referral cards such as this saying an important matter regarding your health has come to our attention please come to the clinic please contact the health department so that's just a brief overview of what of what the Health Department does every day every day for syphilis so now I'll just present some some basic cephalic syphilis epidemiology how many of you have studied this much longer than I have and and and and no nuances of this much more than I have so feel free to so feel free to add your comments so first it shows the numbers and rates of syphilis cases in Baltimore City from 2000 to 2017 you can see in the blue bars the number of cases which has fluctuated a little bit throughout the years and the rates which have also which have also fluctuated and then the dark bar at the bottom are the US rate so you can see the increase in the u.s. rates that we've had over the last few years that does not reflect the most recent data that was just released by the CDC but we know that the trend shown here is continuing and in general even though that the the the syphilis rates in the city don't necessarily show that same general increase what I take away from this is that the rates are just so much higher than the national rates that that's really the main the main takeaway from this so in general we see around 200 cases of this is primary and secondary syphilis around give or take 200 cases of primary and secondary syphilis in the city per year and then this just shows the number if you add on the early latent cases how many do we see for the years that we have data available in the darker blue bars and around half the cases that we see in general or primary and secondary syphilis and then around half the cases are early latent or early latent cases so if you're looking at everything all cases all together on average between 350 and 400 cases of syphilis each year so this shows the rates of primary secondary and early latent syphilis comparing those in Baltimore City again to those in the United States so the blue bars are the are for Baltimore and the green bars are the rates for the United States and you can see fairly similar trends for a primary secondary and early latent in Baltimore and again that the rates are so much higher than the average rates across the United States so then there's congenital syphilis congenital syphilis is quite a large problem in Maryland in in Baltimore so Maryland currently ranks fifth in the nation as having the highest rates of congenital syphilis nationwide and a large part of that burden is in Baltimore so although the numbers themselves are not necessarily high we typically see around 10 to 12 cases of congenital syphilis a year in Baltimore each one of those cases is a sentinel event and and the rates are again much higher than what we're seeing across the rest of the country then if you look at the numbers of cases by sex you can see a shift in the late 1990s and early 2000s from it being at least from where we have data fairly equal to really a predominance among men and that has continued over the last 15 years and then if you look at the number in cases of primary and secondary syphilis by age here I'm only showing the data for 2017 but we do not in general see a large shift in this over time we see a majority of cases in the younger population especially in the 15 to 30 35 year age groups and then if you look at look at the data by age and by sex the age groups are along the x-axis and the number of cases along the y-axis you can see the distribution is slightly slightly different so the blue bars are men and the red bars are for women and that bump that we see in the in the younger age groups tend to be more in men you see a little bit of that in women but in general the age distribution for women tends to be a little bit more even throughout the throughout the age groups and then looking by race so here we're set up a little bit differently with the groups of race across the x-axis and the years are the different colors starting in 2012 with the blue and ending in 2017 with the purple and a majority of cases of primary and secondary cases in the city are in african-americans but we are seeing a little bit of shift in that over time so we are seeing increasing proportion of cases in Caucasians and then to look a little bit by reported risk and also by gender to look at the number and percent of cases that are in MSM this graph shows for 2013 through 2017 the number of cases in the % of cases in women in the dark purple at the bottom and then the next lightest purple up top in non MSM male men and then the lightest purple up top in men who identify MSM is a risk category so MSM is a the majority the majority of cases we see in Baltimore are among MSM and that has remained fairly consistent over time and then although not exactly not looking at HIV co-infection in exactly the same way we discussed earlier but looking at the number of a number and percent of syphilis cases which are co-infected with HIV in general and this what this graph is only among men so this is only among men at least half a little over half of syphilis cases are co-infected with HIV which are the yellow portion of the bars so in general looking at the 2017 demographics which are fairly consistent over time although we are seeing some shifts 50 percent of cases are among people who are under 30 years old 73 percent are african-american 80 percent of men and among men half are HIV infected so now to shift a little bit to the current syphilis outbreak that we're seeing in the city I guess the second syphilis outbreak I would call the first to Phyllis outbreak just general syphilis that we see in the city but the second syphilis outbreak so just to provide a little bit of perspective in 1997 to 1998 were the highest rates of syphilis that we had seen in Baltimore at that time there were 400 around 456 cases that's of primary and secondary cases I believe per year so around double what we see now and 28 cases of congenital syphilis at that time the syphilis elimination plan working group was established as a collaboration between the Health Department academic institutions and various other partners and implemented several interventions to to address this and by 2002 the rates of syphilis in Baltimore had decreased to the lowest they had been in recent history however in 2004 there was an increase 133 percent increase in cases when 70 cases were identified in the second order of the year and around that time also was really when this shift to the scene the burden in MSM was identified as well and I'll show some documentation of that in a moment and then since from 2008 to 2017 we have seen about 160 to 250 cases of primary and secondary syphilis annually with a rate between 22 and 37 point 5 per so it's remained fairly consistent since 2008 this is back in 2003 a provider letter sent out by the health commissioner at the time dr. bailenson noting that in 2001 there were seven cases of early syphilis among men with same-sex contact in 2002 there were 44 cases so to me this really showed that the beginning of the of of seeing the amount of syphilis and MSM that we're seeing now and it of course as has just continued to increase since then so things were going along just fine at the Health Department and then in April ADIS where a partner services supervisor was reviewing cases and said huh I'm seeing a lot more cases in white women in in Western Baltimore than I'm used to seeing and this has been when we took a look back it looked like that that increase had been going on since January and when we when we took a look there were 14 new cases of syphilis among white women in January through April and many of those reported transactional sex and IV drug use and this was a high number for us we felt like this was this was unusual so we started some additional outreach in testing and had what hour had our first syphilis blitz event so our syphilis blitz events are our outbreak response events so this is going above and beyond our routine syphilis syphilis work and we felt like to reach the community that was affected we really had to go out during times of the day that we were not normally out and really we wanted to go out between midnight and 8 a.m. because we felt like that's when these women were out that's when we were able to get them we had tried getting accessing this group of women in the past during other hours and just had not been successful so our first time we went out from midnight to 4:00 a.m. and out of 29 women are 29 people who are tested that night most of whom were women we had eight positive test results for a prevalence of 28% and that got our attention and we were quite nervous first we were impressed with the number of people that we got on our outreach van and tested at four o'clock in the morning that was high traffic that was high traffic for us second we were we were very nervous about this high high prevalence we saw and not just the prevalence itself but the population that we were seeing in and we were seeing it among commercial sex workers who we knew were having a lot of partners and were concerned about this what this meant about spread in the community and we were also concerned that this was in women of childbearing age and knowing what we already knew about the level of congenital syphilis in the city we're concerned about what what this meant for congenital syphilis so we developed a case definition and that the case definition is currently any person who's diagnosed with syphilis in Baltimore City who reports transactional sex and/or injection drug use or their partners from January 1st through the present and what we're really noticing in this outbreak is not so much an increase in the total numbers of syphilis that we're seeing in the city although due to how syphilis is investigated and how we count cases it's really too soon to tell how many cases we have starting in January we're not going to know that for another few months but really seeing quite a shift in demographics and that shift including women and especially white women of childbearing age from so from May through August sixth so sorry so from January through August sex we have seen sixty six cases meeting this case definition of people who are tested in Baltimore so I'll go into a little bit more detail about those 66 cases and and who they are so these are the positive syphilis cases who report commercial sex work or injection drug use and their partners from January through the beginning of August 44 or 66 percent of them are women and 22 or about a third of them are men in terms of their age distribution it is not the same between the women and the men so in general the men tend to be a little bit older and we're seeing a little bit younger women and women across all ages in terms of racial breakdown eighty percent of the women are black that meet this case definition and 68 percent of the men who meet the case definition or white in terms of what stage syphilis eventually the cases are determined to have so among the women nine percent primary SiC syphilis 11 percent secondary syphilis and 39% early latent among the men 27 percent primary nine percent secondary and 41 percent early latent but still with a fair number who have not yet been staged in terms of identified risk factors for whom for those whom we have data so for women 7% report commercial sex work 24% report injection drug use only and 56% report both commercial sex work and injection drug use so for us this is very much an outbreak very much linked with what we're seeing with drug use in the city as well in terms of HIV diagnosis we have seen I think one of these numbers is off I believe we've seen three cases total of syphilis I sorry three cases total of HIV in this population one of which is a new case two were previously known to have HIV and among those who are who are we are able to confirm at least one dose of one dose of penicillin so 67% of women and in 86% of men were able to confirm they've received at least one dose of penicillin however there are about a third that were unable to and around 20% that were unable to locate and unable to confirm that they've been treated and then in terms of pregnancy status we've had five women who've been pregnant at the time of the test and three who eventually have gone on to deliver a baby who meets the case definition of congenital syphilis given what the case definitions of congenital syphilis currently are we're still evaluating the number of partners that the total sixty-six cases have but it's a high number of partners so on average the women are reporting five to ten partners a day those might not all be unique partners it's looking like about half our unique partners and half are the same partner but we're still we're still looking through that and the men reporting one to five partners a week so this is indicates to us that these 66 cases aren't telling us the whole story that there are a lot of other people there are a lot of partners out there that we don't yet know about names that we don't have people that we don't know if they've been tested and certainly don't know if they've been treated in terms of locations where the case is being tested and diagnosed so about half of them are being tested by some activities that the Health Department runs whether it's the claim the clinics that we have our other programs and 20% of those are through our syphilis blitz outreach activities and about a third are in hospitals and EDS 9% from drug treatment centers and 3% from other physician offices this looks at the number of primary and secondary cases by quarter in Baltimore City for 2010 to 2018 so this shows the first two quarters at the very end of 2018 the number of cases by men and women and is beginning to show a little bit four quarter one how we might be seeing a little bit increase in the number of cases in women but again the cases from even from quarter one are just finishing where not all of them have been closed and then this shows a little bit more on the distribution of primary and secondary syphilis by age and race I'm comparing 2017 to 2018 so the gray bars show the averages for for sex and race for 2017 and then the pink shows how that's changed in 2018 so you can see at the bottom in women less than 1% in 2017 of primary and secondary cases we're in white women and so far this year we have a 6% and then this is similar to the graph I showed before of looking at looking at gender and MSM is a risk factor however it only looks at the first two quarters of each year from 2013 to 2018 and again is still very preliminary data from 2018 but is showing perhaps increase in the bottom black line a percent of women making up art cases so in terms of what we're doing what what we have our syphilis blitz event so we are out in the city over 90 M shifts are either from 12 a.m. to 4 a.m. or 4 a.m. to 8 a.m. currently we're doing that twice a week and what we're doing during those two during those blitz events is different than anything that we've done before at least at least recently so we not only have our testing or our outreach team there conducting the tests but we also have treatment on-site so we have providers on-site who have protocols of who to treat then in there whether it's somebody with a positive test that we know needs to be treated or somebody who's presumptively positive who should be treated and we also have partner services on-site to conduct those partner services interviews right then and there and we choose our locations based on a number of factors some quantitative some qualitative based on testing rates reported partner meeting places so when we do those partner interviews we ask people where are you meeting your partners and then conversations with staff and community members about where we should we are we should be in the city and I can't speak highly enough about the teams who are out there in the middle of the night there's a photo of our van the lights out in the middle of the night they're out on street corners talking to people and then our clinical van health care on this spot which has our providers providing treatment and then providing some care on the van in terms of the test results that we've seen from these syphilis blitz events so we've tested 348 people for syphilis and about the same number for HIV about half of those for chlamydia and gonorrhea you can see the number of positive test results that we we have for each one of those tests and then the percent positive that we're seeing on blitz events and the percent positive that we saw last year during traditional outreach events and what I would say about these that although the percentages are fairly similar if you look at the average percent positive for syphilis and and we what we average what we normally see during outreach events it looks similar but the range that we're seeing at different sites is just very dramatic so we can see anywhere from 0% up to I took out some outliers where the sample size was very small but up to 30 40 percent in some cases which remains surprising and concerning these are some maps showing both our syphilis blitz events throughout the city and our traditional outreach sites and the number of new syphilis cases that we've identified at those sites and then also showing the positivity rate with the red being the higher positivity rate at those locations so our continuing activities we have weekly outbreak activities we continue our blitz events twice weekly we're refining our data collection because of course we're finding things that we wish we would have asked or we're not collecting the data in the right way to analyze or we really need additional variable so continuing to refine that our reaching to various partners partnering with various healthcare providers and hospitals especially those that are located in these areas of high rates and with a strong focus on congenital syphilis and just wanted to thank the very large team that's involved in all of this work [Applause] yeah it's definitely definitely a concern so we've taken on some additional temp staff to help and summer is really rough for us because the normal outreach schedule in the summer is so jam-packed with field fairs throughout the city and things like that so we are approaching that point but we're hoping that with September coming and the regular we can back off our regular schedule a little bit we're hoping to avoid that but it is but it is a concern I mean the way we do this is we pay people overtime so we need to identify funds for pain over time which is which is challenging and it definitely but yes it is definitely definitely a concern so right now it's conventional blood draw tests that are that are done we are exploring doing rapid antibody tests and have developed a protocol with that and have worked with the PTC here and state to do that and I believe the tests have just arrived so we're going to start highly be Matt to see how it works so pregnancy tests are based on important things like bathroom availability so you know it just depends on so so sometimes sometimes that's available [Applause] so we didn't ask the gentleman who asked the question about testing and assays so you're not a plant that was a spontaneous question but happily it's a beautiful lead-in to our very own Charlotte Gaydos who of course I think is known to probably everyone in the audience and who really is one of the experts in this challenging area of STI Diagnostics point of care Diagnostics innovations and we thought that it was particularly important to have this early on in the session because of course we have so many young investigators who were part of the CFR we'd like to include STI measures in their HIV research grants and it's a Charlotte you've been a mentor to all of us welcome we're delighted to have you [Applause] good morning everyone and thank you so much dr. Greenbaum for setting the stage I'd like to thank all the organizers for inviting me to speak with you all this morning so let's see so here are my disclosures I work with a lot of diagnostic companies these are my objectives we're going to talk about tests syphilis HIV I want to start with a case presentation this is a 27 year old man with blurry vision oral and nasal mucosal lesions and a skin rash who in the audience would have thought immediately of syphilis and or the okay so whatever but probably not a lot of clinicians some might have thought well this is some funny fungus or some mycobacteria what turned out this was an HIV super positive man who was Co infected with syphilis so it is known that they do have a higher rate of atypical forms he did not manifest with the classical symptoms of the maculopapular rash so thank you for bringing to our attention dr. Greenbaum syphilis is still a major health challenge some of us including Ann here published some articles earlier in std about variations in types of ocular syphilis I think it's well accepted that we have a syphilis HIV CIN Demick and I want to call your attention to New York City's having the same problem we are this showed that out of 2800 men with syphilis over 11,000 person-years 15% acquired HIV the incidence was higher among MSM males with secondary compared with primary and males who were diagnosed with another STD so not only syphilis and HIV go hand in hand but also other sti's I think everyone in this audience knows we have to have to test so syphilis trap animal and non trip animal we do have biological false-positives they can even the trap animal tests can be falsely reactive both tests are imperfect and there's no perfect test so we do the best we can the ordinarily we used the TPP I and the FDA for our trip animal tests years ago but in the 80s we started seeing recombinant syphilis antigens and so there appeared on the market a whole bunch of EIA cia's MFIs and they have become commercially available laboratories love them clinicians hate them because the our PR is very labor intensive as is the FTA these tests you can put a hundred on and run them all at once so this eventually led to the CDC saying let's use a reverse algorithm and instead of doing the RP our first let's do the trap animal tests first so here's names of all of the different ones that are on the market and they're all pretty good as far as a trip animal test I want to talk a little bit later on about the point-of-care tests that can rapidly present a diagnosis in 10 or 20 minutes advantages disadvantages again they both have a donated the Trump animo tests may be detect old untreated syphilis so it has to be confirmed we really have less experience nationwide this is not so much to anymore but people are becoming more familiar with how the reverse algorithm works and they may be sent less sensitive this is from Enron Paulo so you can ask her if this is really true anyway our traditional algorithm was that we did the RP our first and then if it's positive we confirmed it with another trap animal test then CDC decided that we should do the reverse sequence not everyone in the world has adopted this many people are still doing them today and that's to do the multiplex really fast EW a test first or a point-of-care tests which can be done in the field and then do the are PR to confirm it and do the quantitative are PR to follow the titers if you get down and your TPPA doesn't confirm it means that you could have passed or it could be still present and it just hasn't converted yet so if the person really thinks that the syphilis is likely then they should repeat the are PR in a few weeks but exciting there's now an automated our PR syphilis testing machine on the market which is FDA cleared it's available I found this a couple of years ago but now at last week at the CDC conference there was a group who had evaluated this compared to the our PR and there were a couple of disagreements but it looked really good and its results so this might be an answer so you get digital results they of the person that reported it said they changed their staffing level from four people to one so anyway stay tuned this is an article with valuated six of those automated Treponema antibody tests basically they all were pretty good the first column is sensitivity then specificity and then compared to the FTA absorbed test the last column pretty much a hundred percent so they're all pretty good and they say the laboratory ins a lot of time and effort however there's only one point of care test that's FDA cleared in the United States the nice thing is that this is also CLIA waived basically it takes ten minutes can be done at room temperature you either get a negative with one control or you get an invalid if you get no lines or if you get a test line that you don't get the pencil so you have to look for the control and I want to point out one that we have looked at it's not FDA cleared yet but it's been evaluated on nauseam the company used to be standard Diagnostics they were bought by Lear and now they're bought by Abbott so I think we'll see more for this test it takes 15 minutes Klausner and his group have evaluated the some of these rapid tests for syphilis they're not all what they're cracked up to be with the point-of-care sadly so this is an analysis of 33 studies the sensitivity range from 75 to 83 for whole blood in 75 to 92 for serum specificity was pretty good I just want to remind all the clinicians that you get a positive test so clinicians are interested in the positive predictive value of a test not the sensitivity which we in the laboratory are interested in but you can see here that if you have a low prevalence population and you get a positive test your positive predictive value is like 20% if you're in a high prevalence like Baltimore and you get a positive test your positive predictive value can can be a bit higher so just a little nuance to when you get positive tests so we've reviewed some of these point-of-care Diagnostics a couple of years ago and basically they're they're not perfect but sometimes it's better than nothing if you don't have any tests so this Abbott determined can range anywhere from 59 to 100 pitting on the publication and then here's the trinity health check which is they we found that to have a the best probably of all the sensitivity so I guess that's good that that's that they get cleared so what we would love is can we have a point-of-care test that combines the Treponema and the non trap animo well stay tuned cambio has been working on one with CDC for years and it's been evaluated in publications it's not FDA cleared yet the trepan email test is really good the our PR it'll pick up the higher titers but not the the lower so here's an evaluation by Castro at all that compared this little point of care and they call it confirm and treat tests and confirm screen and confirm 98% sensitivity and good specificity compelled to our PR they compared it to tpha and they compared it to FDA so we're hopeful the the best evaluation i've seen in the literature of this dual Treponema on launch ependymal test was in CID a couple years ago from Australia and the sensitive they pulled hundreds of cear\u00e1 out of their freezers and they knew if they were primary secondary whatever and so their sensitivity for the Treponema one was 89 specificity was 99 their sensitivity of this chembio test for non trap animal compared to the reference our PR was 94 specificity wasn't as great as one would have liked but here's a bar graph showing in the dark lines their t2 which is their non trip animal test result on the little point-of-care test and the white bar showed the actual our PR that they compared it to this was 527 patients so not bad I was very pleased to see this and I hope they proceed with this test I'm gonna skip this basically they got 84 the big study with over a thousand people they got 89% sensitivity and 94% sensitivity for the second line so there's a whole bunch of new tests on the market this is from an article in Lancet Infectious Diseases last year and you can see that there are a whole bunch of new ones on the market em chip and this bio litical one and they multiply that I want to call attention to this one the DPP peace if Allah says and it's a combo test but we'll talk about that so that leads me into can we have a point-of-care test that tests our syphilis and HIV yes we can so this is one the one that Kim bio we just finished the clinical trials a few months ago it's at the FDA I spoke to Tommy Polito last week and he said there there dialoguing back and forth so we may in the next couple months see that it will be FDA cleared but so he couldn't give me any information on the whole but we have a sneak peak we participated in the trial here we enrolled 300 patients in the Baltimore City Health Department and we looked at fingerstick and whole blood in plasma and out of those we had this is the HIV data really good 100% data for picking up the HIV cases and specificity was good this is the syphilis data picked up all with the finger stick blood and the nice thing about this test is it has a reader so you don't have to worry about whether or not the reader is reading in the dark in the van or whether they may be colorblind or I see a paint faint pink line or a dark pink line that's a lot of problems with a lot of point of care test so this one has a little reader and they actually delayed the trials by six months to continue developing this reader and you just said it right on the thing and the the reader tells you the the answer so Jeff and our lab presented this at the clinical biology symposium and so we were we were pleased that they allowed us to present this this early early data though we also had evaluated the SD bio line which is a now a leer which is now abbott and so i think we may see clearance of this coming this again uses all sample types and it's room temperature so here's just a valuation was interesting across the top is what the answer was compared to the RP r and to the TPPA so pretty good sensitivity and specificity and what was really interesting and I don't want to dwell on this too much but when he was looking at the data he said what if we did the RP our first and did the old algorithm we would end up confirming by TPA and we had 13 positives out of 381 samples but what if we did the reverse algorithm and this was quite a dilemma if you did the TPPA first and then confirmed with the RP r we ended up with 22 positives so this really is concerning I don't know really I think we need to look more research on this so this is on that duo test by the one by a leer we had really good agreement for HIV there weren't many that were were positive this was the serum bank that we had in our freezers but basically we finally after doing an adjudication of two discrepant suis came out with a sensitivity for the HIV sensitive in specificity of 100% there are others on the market this is a Canadian group I think it's not quite as good as in either the ones that I've spoken to according to my friend Yeti who looks at all these point-of-care tests at CDC so but what was interesting to me was people are always saying well how do we know if it's early or repeat syphilis so this paper looked at the different immune response with il-10 was different but they looked at 9,000 and with initial syphilis and 55 of repeaters and they found that the baseline baseline if they were at an initial syphilis they were more likely to be symptomatic and higher levels of interleukin 10 which I thought was quite interesting and then the baseline our median RP our titers were higher and then repeaters were less likely than those with initial infections to sirrah revert to a negative and to be sirrah fast so it's always a case where you can't just look at the data from the tests you have to evaluate the patient so anyway point-of-care tests are getting better we need more research the automated are very acceptable for screening with the tr\u00eapa Nimal and you still have to look at the clinician of the patient's clinical and treatment history so HIV we have a lot of tests that are clear the newest one that I want to talk about is the leer one here and I owe a lot of these slides to my friend Michelle Owen at CDC but this is the one that we are using for our mail-in syphilis test takes 20 minutes you can store it at room temperature long shelf life it's a CLIA waived for whole blood and the nice thing about it is that not only detects the antibody it detects the p24 antigen so the genius has been put out there to replace the multi spot because if you do a trip any more tests than you need to confirm it with another essay and or another you need to confirm it with a second HIV essay and so this kind of looks like a Western blot but we don't have much data on it yet but as people at CDC seem to think a lot of it these are some of the big robots that I mentioned you can see why people would want to do many at a time on the machine than to do one test so but all of the fourth generations now do p24 and also the antibody and distinguish between one and two however I saw an article last week and said that CDC is going to do away with the word generation they're not you're not going to be 4th or 3rd or 2nd they're done with that so this is the the bio Plex which they seem to like a lot here the alehrer company has gone even a little further and so they're doing a quantitative point-of-care test and you get your results in 50 minutes and they have a little cartridge that they put it in and then they put it in this little machine and they can store the data it's very lightweight they can be done with a battery so looking forward to see if they ever get clearance for viral load now the whole logic Panther system we're using this in Tom Quinn's HIV lab right now that you can use this for the viral load they say don't use it for blood bank and don't use it for diagnosing HIV but if you want the viral load this is a nice s a Cepheid has come out with an HIV viral load also and they can use batteries and you can do one at a time or four at a time or eighty at a time but this little plastic sa machine which is probably maybe you only cost a thousand dollars instead of 60,000 that is coming they're working on that for sti's in an HIV so in fact one of their administrators told me once that they think that next to your Keurig in your kitchen eventually you could just test yourself every money for what you want to test for another interesting one that's a point-of-care 400s TI's and for a viral load for PCR is the Leon Irish and Leon stands for lab and a tube it's a little too almost looks like a toothbrush and you put the thing in you put it in the Machine and lo and behold you you get your answer in either 30 or 60 minutes depending on what your what your testing so the algorithm it continues CDC is going to come out sometime soon with the new algorithm I think they're going to recommend this genius to be the second test that could quickly confirm the first test so stay tuned so I think this is I kind of what they're thinking about that you have your first test here which could be something like the bio Plex and then they would confirm with the genius and then then you can have all different combinations of HIV 1 & 2 and if a second doesn't confirm the first test then you might want to end up doing a viral load to see an acute so it's better to use some point-of-care tests than no test because you then can try to figure out once you have a positive test but both the clinician and the patient need to be aware of the limitations and we all know that oral fluids gonna miss some but what we don't have is any way to diagnose these people here in the Eclipse period maybe some day so again old official recommendations by CDC we're getting better their tests are involving and they will be sending out a new algorithm I don't know when when we get more more data but again message for the tester and for the patient no test is perfect CDC has lots of guidelines about that you can look at as does the aphl and so all diagnostic tests we want to do a sensitive initial test and then confirm by highly specific tests so you can use this with combinations to point a care to laboratory and in combination anyway but I want to just end with two little comments about self testing this is a study that looked at 200 patients to see if they could do their self tests and they also then mocked up tests and to see if they could identify them and they did pretty pretty well 97 94 percent when it was mocked up with a contrived I'm gonna skip this and four time but basically it was using self self testing here to showing that there were some differences between tests but just end with we have I want the kit here for STD in Baltimore but we now have a study which is consent given on the line for doing an at-home or Shore HIV test and we introduced this a while back someone can if they live in the Greater Baltimore area can request a kit we send it home for free we looked at to see who what type of person was ordering and using the test and what could be a predictor of usage so this is what it looks like on the thing you can say yes I'm interested no thank you I only want the I want the kit STD kit instructions are in the kit and online basically we lost a lot of people who said they were interested because the IRB made us talk to them and then we sent them a kit but they had to go back online signed the consent and then they had to collect and do the tests and we don't know if they all reported or they just did the tests and thought all negative I'm done with this but we did have some that went back on and completed the tests so unearth 1,400 people access the website for whatever reason 23 said yeah I'm interested we were able to speak to 72 percent of them and 90 percent of these did go back on and got a kit we only ended up so far with about 160 people none have been positive one person reported a week positive we have you have to say my test looks like this and then the next thing is to interpret the tests they reported it looked like a week positive but they interpreted it as negative so but we we have an arrangement which is why we're in the metropolitan area you know eventually get into God but the ones who ordered at the test and did it and reported were female African American they had a score we have a score on the website from one zero to ten they had a higher score so they were at higher risk they were mostly 25 to 29 they were not Hispanic and what was interesting to me was that more people had used the website before so they were familiar with with the website and how it worked basically they said the test was easy on their questionnaire they trusted the result very much they'd recommend it to a friend they used it again and they preferred self testing obviously they did it so some bias there anyway some limitation basically but our our aim was an acceptability thing to see if people would do it and they will I'm gonna just end with yo Shang che and the emergency department says 50 percent of the people in our IDI who are offered an HIV testing everyone's offered an HIV test it's opt-out 50 percent say no thank you and we call these people decliners so we did a randomization study to randomize a hundred people to say well you don't want to HIV test today but now would you like to take one of these kits home and do it yourself or they were randomized to say you're in the control group here's a piece of paper showing where you can get an HIV test for free in the community bottom line is giving the kit to take home increased testing 88% with an odds ratio of 9.4 they were female about 40 years for mostly white 43% had not tested in the last year 19% had never tested and 40% they said they didn't perceive them selves that been at risk so this is published and STI in in June but it seemed to I mean the whole privacy confidentiality thing I think seems to work so I'm going to end with thanking all the people in my lab who really do all the work so thanks do we have a maybe one short question for Charlotte or okay admirable clarity so our next speaker is Jackie Jennings who's an associate professor of pediatrics runs the Center for child and community health research I get that right and who's done as many know also of course has a joint appointment in the Bloomberg School and has done a great deal of work on social networks on geospatial epidemiology and mapping and has done a lot of work in the syphilis and HIV space so Jackie over to you to bring to light some of these difficult issues but certainly that we're looking to make inroads in and then I also want to start with my acknowledgments because I couldn't do the work I'd do without a whole slew of incredibly talented people and partnerships across the city so this is this is certainly a village and it takes a village so I'm gonna talk today a little bit about I'll just touch on subpoenas a beautiful job of covering that the DB ology I'll touch on a couple of those just to get us started then I'm going to interweave a little bit of network work that's going on in other places but also weave that in with what some of the work we've been doing here locally in Baltimore City and then talk about some of the promises of intervention some of the again the work that's already going on and and and really with an eye towards we've been working for a long time in collaboration with the Baltimore City Health Department and trying to move evidence really into real program to move it and make it work and evaluate whether it's working and and with the interest of sort of making a difference today so hopefully I'll be able to accomplish all that what I won't talk about today is some of the really interesting work in phylogenetics that's coming out and locally this seems to be moving on it but that locally there's some work for example that arrow fields is doing with a CFR supplement that's starting and with cake Dabrowski oliver land decker and joel Wertheim and we're starting to see some very interesting results out of that Matthew Hamill who's in the audience it was recently funded to do a syphilis phylogenetic study along with Anna and Khalil and also Kate and so we should start to see some interesting work on that and of course there's other Eric volts across the pond is doing some lovely phylogenetic work issues with gonorrhea but I won't talk about all that exciting work today so as you've heard today already and as we heard last week at this TV prevention conference SDI's in general are on the rise there were nearly 2.3 million cases of chlamydia gonorrhea and syphilis in the u.s. in 2017 and syphilis specifically increased by 76% and the highest rates we've seen both across the nation but also locally are among black gay bisexual and other men who have sex with men in Baltimore Maryland again as you saw dr. Greenberg been present we have one of the most severe syphilis epidemics you know our rates are just sort of frameshift higher than other places across the nation and among and particularly among MSM with a co-occurring HIV epidemic in 2015 76% of primary and secondary syphilis cases were among MSM these were also individuals co-infected with HIV and that's some lovely work that Cristina published in in STDs in 2018 so this echos us one of the slides that dr. Greenbaum showed and it shows primary and secondary syphilis in Baltimore City from 2013 to 2016 green shows women and these of course are only with individuals who had known risk factors identified so women are in green men who report having sex with women in blue and men who report having sex with men in red you can see across the board men who have sex with men have higher numbers of cases and in 2017 there were a total of 135 cases and thank you to assist our from the Maryland Department of Health for this slide this information so there is an urgent need this underscores the racial disparities a number of new syphilis infections demonstrate that our current prevention strategies are not effective and we have a lot of work still to do the fact that we have congenital syphilis cases as Gail mentioned last week and many of us wholeheartedly agree it really representing congenital syphilis case represents a failure of our collective system and just a travesty so it underscores the urgent need to prioritize syphilis and HIV control strategies and particularly among MSM at high risk for transmission and acquisition so let's talk a little bit about strategy strategies are most effective if implemented at the right time in the right place or space and we'll talk a little bit more about placed space which has been a focus of our groups work for a long time and with the most important populations and Network interventions and specifically sex partner meeting venues and social meeting venues may be important locales specifically to access MSM and implement control strategies work so Charlotte showed some work out of New York by Preeti and her group we've also done some work here in Baltimore looking similarly and this was focused really on the intervention of prep this is this work was done by Carla Tilton who's in the audience and so this we looked we found that one in ten STI diagnoses among MSM so this was a retrospective cohort of surveillance data including about a thousand five hundred and forty-two individuals and we found that one in ten STI diagnosis among MSM and one in 50s diagnosis among non MSM were followed by an HIV diagnosis within two years so again just a travesty and what we were looking to do is identify you know biomarkers to identify eligible individuals for prep and then among MSM a syphilis or gonorrhea diagnosis I can't underscore the importance of gonorrhea as well you know we're gonna talk a lot about syphilis but we need to also talk about gonorrhea it was associated with a four or fivefold increase respectively in HIV incidence and among non MSM with gonorrhea a repeat versus one diagnosis with syphilis or gonorrhea was associated with an almost 3.5 times higher incidence so this is work from so John Schneider just at the STD prevention conference as a part of our network methods symposium presented this work and also the next slide work this comes from his work and a partnership with Fujimoto and what they were doing this is a study of 365 young black MSM ages 16 to 29 years of age in Chicago and in Houston and and this is from 2014 to 2016 at what you see here depicted on the left is Houston and a network diagram of sexual confidence right Chicago you see the links there specific ties and those have specific qualities those aren't so important about what I'm gonna talk about today but this is a lovely article you can look it up but what they found which was interesting was that syphilis only an HIV co-infection were driven by network phenomena not individual level attributes and behaviors and this is probably not a surprise I see lots of nodding heads not a surprise to our group but syphilis only cases were associated with a higher number of social venues attended and syphilis and HIV co-infected cases were associated with having a network members who were Co infected or HIV infected within one social network this is also work that this group has been doing this is specifically in the UConnect study in Chicago also among young black MSM 2015 to 2016 a group of 618 and here this is really in their approaches really interesting so they they were looking to investigate how links to local places shape access so they were thinking about interventions and how these local places shape access to information and exposure to health seeking behavior and this was a longitudinal study with respondent driven sampling and their results showed that young black MSM positions within Chicago's venue network and so let me orient you a little bit to this because it took me a little while to orient myself so they're the the nodes here are individuals so and the green so there there are three clusters depicted here the green is what they call a gay enclave cluster community cluster the yellow is what they call a bridge community cluster and the black then is what they call a black community cluster and then they also collected information on social venues I have just shown here where clubs there were three club bars one two and three but then there are other venues there were bath houses other other venues also collected and the results showed that young black MSM positions within the venue network shaped the types of health-related services they access net of demographic structural and community covariance so men with affiliations that were linked to the city's gay enclave were most likely to know about prep while men with affiliations that were predominantly in the black community demonstrate demonstrated improved HIV treatment outcomes and they concluded you know that that outreach engaging MSM beyond the venues and in enclaves was necessary so I thought this was really a really interesting intersection with venues and community clusters and really speaks to some of the work that we've been doing locally so so let's talk a little bit about social and sex partner meeting venues an effective strategy for accessing areas I would argue areas of the transmission network that are important and critical for disrupting transmission is to focus outreach efforts on social and sex partner meeting venues and these are places venues social or sex sex partner meeting are places where individuals congregate they may be in informal or formal you see on the left some logos from some of those sites may be familiar to you jacked Grindr Adam for Adam but then they're there and those are online sites there's also Grand Central here in Baltimore City a club bar and the idea is that these these places may attract individuals with transmissible infections so that venues themselves sort of and the networks within them may have a force of infectivity to channel some some earlier terms that have been used in the field and they may also create opportunities for interconnectedness so we know the structure of networks is really important but that interconnectedness that then perpetuates incident infection and what I'm going to also argue is that it's not just the sexual networks within but actually the connectedness between venues themselves as well and so these venues and the clusters of venues may be important places for control activities and we started some of this work way back with a civil elimination program that and and the plan that that Adina talked about back in the early in the late 1990s when we had large heterosexual syphilis epidemic and at that time we added to the partner services interview locally questions about so the importance of contact tracing right where what sex partners did you have in the last three months but also where did you meet sex partners in the last three months knowing that we could not always identify the full sexual network but that places may actually represent really important and and so it's no surprise to all of us this is just a little note that numbers of social media users are you know growing rapidly and the expectation is globally there'll be three billion users in the world the u.s. of course has has a high high numbers of social media users so this represents an important new venue to better understand in 2016 eighty-one percent of the US population had a social media profile in multiple studies have shown use of social media by groups like MSM to be very very high so one means to identify potentially epidemiologically significant men uses to utilize a variation on sexual network analyses traditional sexual network analyses in general it's a tool used to by important individuals and connections with individuals in that network and these analyses again as many experts in the room have know and have have conducted can identify key individuals or central individuals that are essential to the transmission of STI s and HIV compared to traditional sexual networks however the sexual network analysis of venues which is often called sexual affiliation network analysis can reveal important venues I'm sorry I don't know why these slides are moving by themselves can reveal important venues that are that are essential to those to transmission and the importantly the it's an indirect source of data on sexual networks it doesn't require tracing each direct contact of an individual it may reveal places where important clusters of certain sexual canet works are occurring and it may be less resource-intensive to obtain and there may be fewer biases so asking somebody about where they met sex partners is different than asking about the last last sex partners in the last three months and we know from the field that often we get I don't know who my sex partner was or it was anonymous or I don't know the full name and it's then it's very difficult to contact the individual so a little concrete explanation so sexual networks we build often from from the left a type of question who did you have sex with in the last three months and the index is in red and the two blue individuals are the sex partners and in a contrast a venue network we build from a question like where did you meet your sex partners in the past three months the two red individuals are both telling us that they met at Grand Central and that's the green venue so locally we've done some work in this area with venue affiliation networks of syphilis and or newly HIV diagnosed MSM during a local MSM syphilis epidemic and our objectives were to describe and quantify the network structure and connectivity of the venues to examine the overlap and syphilis and HIV transmission that so we were doing discovery in particular to better understand was this the same transmission networks with HIV or were we seeing different groups transmitting syphilis was really an overlap and could we quantify that overlap of transmission networks and then at a sub analysis to explore temporal changes in the venue network structure because we know network structures are super important from 2012 to 2016 the the data that we employed were public health surveillance data from five hundred and forty-four MSM diagnosed with syphilis and or HIV and reporting a sex partner meeting venue from 2012 to 2017 and we generated venue affiliation network graphs and whole network structure using UCI net these are the characteristics of the MSM and they were 37 percent were less than 25 years of age 62 percent reported black or african-american 69 percent had greater than or equal to one partner in the past 12 months three percent reported injection drug use five percent commercial sex work and then 66 percent were infected initially with syphilis only 27 percent with HIV only and seven percent with a co infection so then what we did was we generated affiliation networks of newly of these individuals and so what you see the red circles are individuals that were infected with syphilis only the blue circles are individuals infected with HIV only the black are those infected with both syphilis and HIV and then there are venues depicted in the squares in gray so so in other words this venue for example has all three both syphilis is only infection HIV only infection and Co infection and already you can sort of see emerging it's a highly central ventilation scheme so this represented again 544 individuals reporting on hundred and forty six unique sex partner meeting places our next step was then to to just include individuals reporting more than one sex partner meeting place and this represented fifty five unique venues and this is the affiliation network of those individuals and here 16% were syphilis only seven percent were HIV only and 76 percent we're both Co infected with syphilis and HIV and you can see that very clearly visually about the co infection then you can also see these individuals that are just syphilis infected for example and these unique sex partner meeting venues these fifty five forty seven percent were internet based sites twenty percent were bars or clubs 15 percent were street parks or neighborhoods and then there were a smattering of others so then we did some network centrality metrics to better understand the positions of these venues and what emerged was a tile e connect tightly connected cluster of five meeting venues which represented 59 or almost 60 percent of all the reports and these five places four of them were online and one of them was a physical space again were highly connected to one another and they had the highest degree centrality which means they connected the most number of venues and the highest betweenness centrality so in other words the shortest path between venues not directly connected so really very small number starts emerging of of potential access points and then what we did was we compared the network's in 2012 to 2016 and what we found so what you see on top is the 2012 network and then the 2016 network and comparing these two networks the density of the network in priest over this time period by almost 24% the compactness of the network increased by 16% and the percent of venues in the main network component nominated by a co infected MSM increased by 17% and you can even visually see that change in the in the color from from the top to the bottom so in conclusion of that work it suggests that venue affiliation graphs of syphilis and or infected MSM suggest an incredibly high overlap and transmission networks that there are five highly central venues that emerged and that these venues may represent an optimal set for tailored interventions I mean really 60% of reports were identifying these venues as highly central so let's talk a little bit about network interventions this discovery work and of course inform network interventions and this comes from Tom Valente science article in 2012 and talks about first defining a network intervention any change in a program that uses Network data to define groups select change agents affect network structure or assist behavior change implementation and again there are some experts in the room David as one as just one who is you know done these kind of network interventions and then there are four general types change agents to identify key individuals who are opinion leaders key players or positional bridges there's another kind of segmentation key subgroups and they're key leaders induction where you recruit sub networks by word of math mouth and many of us are familiar respondent driven sampling snowball sampling and then a fourth which I think we use less and in public health but I think may represent an interesting scenario we've been thinking about it in terms of bridging venues so what if we took out a bridging venue if we could do that but this is so the alteration is you know in bioterrorism this comes up a lot right how can you take out a cell from a bioterrorist network and disrupt that whole network right so maybe we need to maybe think a little more like but anyway be careful there so just like to highlight I'm not going to talk deeply about this because we can look forward to lovely results arrow fields is doing some work network intervention called safe spaces and places study he's funded by a CDC Mauri project and this is using venue based targeting to access young black MSM to provide prep and he has been working again with our Center and in partnership with the Baltimore City Health Department to identify high-risk sex partner meeting venues connected by ongoing HIV transmission network so he's using this data that we presented to then go use a mobile van and see if we can recruit individuals online to come in for testing and a sneak peek unfortunately he's finding very high case numbers of cases and prevalence but it's an exciting new potential promising potential for an intervention and really a new way to access individuals who may be doing a lot of spending a lot of time online and then I look like this this I stumbled on in literature I was as I was preparing this talk and and particularly because I'm often thinking about how to bring evidence into practice and I also happened to teach the outbreak investigation team so I love epi curves sorry outbreak investigation course with dr. Taha but this was an interesting analysis or work that was done Public Health work that was done with an outbreak of syphilis in Ottawa Ontario this happened from January 2009 to 2010 there were 72 cases of syphilis at the time and what they did in the course of their regular Public Health work was do a little bit of an intervention and enhanced intervention and the intervention was that they so they did their their standard contact tracing asking about sexual partners but then with recent infected individuals they did an enhanced social network questionnaire where they also elicited social network contacts and venues and they were able to do those interviews among 17 or 89% of the of the 19 recent and so let me just show you some of some of what the yields from some of this so this represents just the sexual contact named and here a hundred and fifty fit only a hundred and fifty-five cases and contacts were linked by sexual by nominating sexual partners there were a total of 55 components ranging one from one to nineteen so often we look at the largest component which in this case was 19 individuals as being an important indicator of of networks and of the 19 infectious syphilis cases co-infected with HIV 63 percent were in small components of one or two cases or contacts here's where then they added in the enhanced social network interview and the sex partner meeting places sorry the social and sex partner meeting places so the 17 enhanced surveillance respondents reported 42 social venues and the new information helped to link 18 cases and 40 contacts representing almost 40% of the outbreak population and connecting many of the single what had previously been single individuals and dyads and now the network consisted of 45 components instead of the 55 right so we had a diminishing because there were more connections now and the largest component went from 19 to 95 so extraordinary change by this what I would call a relatively small very low-tech intervention and the most frequently reported venue this one over here was a bath house and it was named by six or 35 percent of respondents and this was followed by an internet site a popular gay internet site which was the second most frequently reported so really some interesting work here's the the two large components so this is where it started in the first the 19 and then you know just expanded incredibly so kind of some interesting practitioner work so you know all contagions are complex nothing spreads in a simple manner and Tom Valente recently sort of asked us all as we study both diffusion and contagion let's commit to understanding which Network mechanisms are at work and attempt to assess infectiousness and susceptibility so some final thoughts infectious diseases and non-infectious work through networks social digital sexual and molecular networks are fundamental to transmission are likely more important than individual characteristics and driving onward syphilis and HIV transmission networks and I think we really haven't harnessed the full power of social and sexual venues to better conduct our interventions network analyses and interventions for HIV and syphilis are intuitive and they make sense an implementation that utilizes network interventions is key and then John Schneider will will remind us and I think some of there's a lot of work in merging that that we should be thinking and Anton Paulo and in fact did some work early on in this including both social and sex partners when you ask individuals about their context and this may help us to get ahead of the epidemic decreased stigma and increased coverage so then just a shameless plug for a new syphilis study with many colleagues in the room this is the you shine study understanding sexual health in networks we're in the field right now this is a three year funded project from the CDC and we're looking to better understand transmission of HIV and syphilis in the field this is in partnership with the Baltimore City Health Department and we're very excited to be doing the work so shameless plug thank you very much [Applause] well thanks so much yeah Chuck is there any is there any difference in terms of ability to complete no network analysis in persons that are you know purely using digital means to just do social networking nodes I'm gonna this more reticence on the part of the people or more desire to be anonymous and it would be if it was someplace like Grand Central where people might be anonymous so let me be less likely to it want to identify partners I'm sorry ah yeah yeah so I think we're always challenged with individuals nominating partners and I think there's lots of biases about why somebody may or may not and which partners are they willing to nominate or not and I think that crosses hold it for all Mo's and also I think actually bringing in the power and and actually as an access point of a social or sexual meeting venue changes that a lot where I make very quickly say oh yeah sure I went to wit and wisdom last night with but I might not tell you I went with you know and I went to and I went to but I bet I might not tell you who I went with or what I did last question Charlotte and I should say oh no no um so I don't yes oh so there's a natural experiment going on like the paradox and all these oh yes eagle they're all closed so the question is are you capturing that and where they moving and then this there's two parts and then if I say like I meet my partner on Grindr do you ask me then where we actually met so she's a current student here in the EPI Department I share the advising with David chalant on oh and we are working with NIDA on the Bayview campus to conduct an ecological momentary assessment study to better understand what we've been talking for a while is what is that journey from online to a physical place and to maybe having sex with somebody what is that journey what do we still need to understand about that journey and we're nesting that within the you shine study but we look and look forward to that as well there's a lot of questions that remain about that and partly again we always think about it as an eye towards interventions so if people are still going to physical places then it's okay to keep doing testing at physical places that the city health department is but if not if they're going then to other places that are less accessible the online interventions are so important so I think we have a lot to learn still about it yes well so that's Geo social networking apps again Aero feel to super interested and I think this is a fascinating piece and it also brings to light still the importance of geography so many people are using Geo social networking apps in place and they're in fact in a bar and they're saying who can I meet in this bar and it's an easy way to meet somebody locally or they're saying within a one-mile radius so there's still a geography and many of you know I've been in the geography world for a while so I think that's an exciting intersection as well and it makes gay bars a lot more boring because everybody's on their school so so we we've come to the break time we're going to shorten the break by two minutes so we can start back at quarter to and please do come back and join us because we're gonna have Khalil Ghanim we're greatly looking forward to speaking so eight minutes break in there scoffing and stuff in the back so please help yourself you", "nJXRpThRYZY": "it's up YouTube it's ain't be put another block Chantal bring you another CC pack you know what I'm saying this is black cherry pie the flavors of black cherry pie is earthy lavender and plum you know you know what plum is but man you guys got to look at this color it's oranges hairs super frosty it's good for the stress anxiety nausea insomnia lack of appetite pain and for the ladies cramps the effect is very aforex happy relaxed creative uplifting you know this is just the things I feel when I play Zen you know you guys gotta check it out and it's facts its facts the parents are black berry cush and cherry pie those are the parents of the black cherry pie you feel me you guys got this look at those oh now I'm gonna give you guys money shots comment like subscribe give this video a thumbs up because this this is probably one of the most purple bud you ever seen in your life alright give it to you guys raw there we go don't confuse yourself this is black cherry pie peace out you guys", "8sX_dL0r-pY": "what's going on there but each a boy endo gross here hope everybody's having a wonderful wonderful day today's video is going to be on the slur Akane IX growing string review from in health genetics we have some right here as we can tell beautiful beautiful beautiful so yeah if you use the channel make sure to subscribe if you want to help support the channel a little bit more I'll leave a link to my patreon down below all sorts of cool exclusive content we're gonna do giveaways once we got more people on there all sorts of fun stuff but yeah we'll get right into it so this is the slur came from in-house genetics this is actually the i-x grown indoors under my hash propter with the pro hub beautiful flower a couple things in house genetics has some amazing stuff i will give them that but another side note and this is where i'm going to get into this this strain i'm gonna classify as a moderate to advanced growers only simply because it does not seem like they tested it i got there's either five or six pack it was like a hundred and thirty or hundred and forty dollars when i got it i believe and only one yes only one out of the whole entire pack was good everything else per meet in there super crazy unstable so moderate to advanced growers only you need to be really keeping a vigilant eye on this you need to check and make sure you're not getting harmed but if you put in the work some amazing product will come out at the end it's got this specific female had like a really really good yield too so very happy was that actually tell it's got some really nice chunky notes for an indoor grow a beautiful beautiful color I will give it that very frosty as well so I'll give it that as well very enjoyable to smoke I really like it as my daytime smoke so this is the slur k9x which is their slur Akane the slur came it's like one of the only things that I've seen it's really unstable from them so maybe go check out the slur cane which is their slur akane youdo see you might have to be no hunch a little bit but that's part of the fun so that's what this one is love to smoke it's got a really like key key in the face pungent almost a garlicky taste smell to it so really enjoy that everybody really really seems to like it sorry I dropped my nose yeah everybody really seems to like it I really enjoy it you can see the whole grow my beginner grill guide series is where we did this so just wanted to do a quick little thing real fast with this we can go through and do a lot of my strands that I grow like this so yeah moderate to advanced in house genetics start testing your strains if something goes out and you know stop selling it these packs are still for sale really okay and so don't do that in-house test your strains you already have enough money and enough gear that you can pull one thing off the shelf if it's not crazy stable or at least give people heads up that you're going to be spending a bunch of money and you're not gonna be getting what you want so yeah how does the whole pack only one was good everything else hurried probably worst pack I've ever drawn in my life in terms of that so I guess good job in house genetics on that you have successfully produced the most unstable pack that I've ever been able to get my hands on so cool but I do love the smoke I do love the strain at the end of the day was not worth the money but I did take the one stable cut that I had and I'm putting it to my violetta try to help stabilize a little bit and bring a little extra funk to it so definitely stay tuned for that I will hopefully be growing that within the next couple months but yeah I hope you all have a great day I hope you really enjoyed the video take it easy do something good for somebody today", "cLkz91jHoTY": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with tokentim 420. this is a florida medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 and medical marijuana patients all right like to say hi to everybody out there what's up what's going on happy thanksgiving it's 12 30. um because it's thanksgiving day it's thursday so you guys know what to do if you haven't subscribed smash the subscribe button leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know how you're feeling today throw me a comment down there i have some time to [ __ ] this week so i should be able to get back to some comments all right today we got a review this has been two weeks in the waiting a cherry punch from true leaving there's a nat or something flying around [ __ ] ignore him 20 thc actually 20.9 so almost 21. take a little lucasy big buds in there on the smell i would have to go get everybody out of the pool a little berry on the smell kind of a musky berry aroma to it let's break a little bit of this up and roll one up we'll talk about a little bit more now if you look this this is another one of those that you look up online it just confuses the hell out of you i actually seen two different leafly posts one said it was sativa one said it was a hybrid so it is one that's all over like i said you can look i found ones that said it was a sativa one said it was a sativa lenin hybrid one said it was a balanced hybrid one said it was an indica leon hybrid so literally just like i said all over the damn place with the descriptions on this one um now from what i can tell everybody was pretty much unanimous when they said what the parents was except for one um and they didn't really know there was like a some kind of skunk strain and maybe a dutch hawaiian but everybody else says it's a cherry ak-47 mixed with purple punch so that's where you're getting a little bit of the barrier aroma from is from the uh cherry ak-47 two papers stuck together there that means it wants me to roll two up all right let's put this up real quick and we'll talk about the taste flavors and effects would it actually was it a sativa indica what the hell was it pretty much guess it's 12 30 at night so it's not going to be a sativa i found it to be kind of an indica leaning hybrid to hybrid or to antica so maybe a semi-strong indica um but it kind of depends you know i smoked some of it the one day and i just kind of got couch locked um didn't really make me sleepy uh but it was earlier today too and i did it later at night one night and it made me a little bit more sleepy or so burning off some of the extra paper didn't quite pack it good up on the end got a little fatty there you guys can see it good focused up all right let's hit it a few times so hope everybody's having a good thanksgiving or going to have a good thanksgiving um hopefully everybody's spending it with somebody they like sourceless somebody that cooks good one of the two i get a little little little slight berry taste on there but not i mean you really gotta search for that berry taste in there i get more of that musky earthy taste maybe a tiny bit of skunk in there too not a lot um good flavor i was gonna get another one of these today actually i still got two good nugs left but um truly was actually an hour late today and i didn't feel like waiting i didn't put an order in so i just said screw it uh they will have some more black friday sales after thanksgiving when they open back up uh somebody asked that in the comments most of the dispensaries will have a black friday sale um some will be better than others of course uh liberty had one the other day was four dollars and twenty cents off flour but it wasn't a real good one uh truly today had 25 off move had buy two get one free on the crumbles and uh disposable vapes so you just kind of have to look online and see who's got the best for what you're looking for basically some of them will be flowers some will be something different so well like i said this one hit me more of the indica indica leading hybrid um pretty much you know couch lock a nice one for after dinner um you know seven o'clock in the evening time when you're ready to wind down and sit down and watch a movie this one's definitely it the flavor is not bad on there like i said i didn't get none of the berry taste um a little disappointed on that i mean like i said it's a tiny bit of berry um but you it smells more berry than you taste so it kind of threw you off there you kind of smelled it and you kind of but then when you taste it you really don't get a lot of berry at all it's mainly more of that musky earthy and like i said just a little skunky behind there excuse me uh but good bud not their most expensive strain anyways it was only the it's a 43 dollar one uh they do have the you know the 53 and the 58 stuff too so not quite that pricey um i will try to pump out a few videos tomorrow i've got like five boxes over here i've been unboxed yet so we might do some unboxings tomorrow maybe review maybe something fun maybe something hard hitting love to see which kind of mood i'm in i do have a couple hard hitting ones sorry i had to take a drink break but i figured why the old lady is cooking if i'm not spending too much time with the kids and have a few minutes i can run out and shoot a video so those of you who don't have nothing to do can watch my silly ass all day or listen to my silly ass there really isn't a lot to watch i mean i can stick my hand over here and wait for you [Music] i am trying to get another giveaway going um i have a real good idea for one just you know it's close to christmas i got five kids i'm trying not to spend a lot of money on giveaways at the moment but i do got a real good idea for one um just a matter if i can afford to get the stuff for it but i do have plenty other stuff that i can give away trust me there is no shortages of pipes on this channel um so i will try to give away some stuff i'm trying to clean the garage up um so like i said i do have a lot of stuff for giveaways just set back for that so if i probably shoot a bunch of them out real quick here to get some space out here in the garage um so make sure you guys subscribe and you're ready for those like i said the one's gonna be not a great giveaway but a funny little kind of a i mean it'd be good for some people but not everybody will get into it i'm sure that's with everything um but it was a funny little take on a giveaway idea i had i like to try to do different stuff you know like we had the pipe pick last time a lot of people like that we're going to do another one of those for sure but like i said i thought this one was a fun little one a little uh play on words and stuff like that i just have to see if i can afford it uh what else we got going on now um i have no clue it is 12 30 at night probably closer to one o'clock now it took me a minute to clear off the table some and yes this is a cleared off that's what the table looks cleared off it's not a lot of dirt on the table all the little specks are just little weedy crumbs the blackhead just pops out real bad i did sweep off the outer area out there where the camera picked up but i didn't do much more so uh i don't know what else to say guys um like i said it's late at night taking a minute to get back into this i had a two-week break um just been super busy trying to get stuff ready for the christmas the holidays thanksgiving uh we're doing everything here alone my family's up north this year so we're doing everything at home not going to anybody else's house to you know burden them with that so you know a lot of house cleaning clearing out the refrigerator to make room for all the goodies we're going to have tomorrow um so yeah just been super busy lately trying to slow down a little bit but it's not seeming to work very well um i did take the next four days off work though so like i should be able to shoot out a few videos get some more work done around the house um i'm thankful that work's still very very busy but at the same time i'd like to slow down a bit all right like i said i think that's going to be it that's the cherry punch review guys like i said it's a pretty decent strain i would definitely get it again even at the forty three dollars and you know my cheap butt doesn't like to go over thirty dollars on the strings a lot of times um the tastes are good on like i said it was a little disappointed i was hoping for a little more berry taste um but that's just you know like i said i read the re looked it up and it said it had a berry flavor when you open the jar you can smell the berries um it just doesn't come through a lot on the taste uh maybe that was my batch maybe it's just uh there's like i said you do get a little bit of it and maybe it's just not the berry i'm used to maybe it's more of that cherry that's what the dry um just kind of blends in with that dry musky taste a little bit maybe that's why i was kind of hoping to get another eighth of that and sample it a little bit more but yeah decent i would definitely get it again not mad at it in any way um eyes are starting to get heavy already and i'm not even about halfway through that so definitely probably say leaning a lot more towards the indica side so that's gonna be it guys like i said i'm gonna finish this join up upload the video answer any comments that come in pretty quick before i pass out uh hopefully i pass out soon big day tomorrow um so let me know what you guys plans are any special different thanksgiving traditions that you guys do that you don't think anybody else does i'd be interested in hearing those too um so again guys happy thanksgiving make sure you subscribe thumbs up thumbs down whatever you want to do and throw me a comment down there tell me how you're doing what you're doing what you're eating how much you're gonna eat till next time guys keep on toking my friends peace out", "6r43fWwzKvI": "good afternoon I hope you enjoyed your lunch we are back to the Pierce foundation webinar and before we resume with our presentations miss me label hi ma would like to say a few words the head of the division for external studies merely please Thank You professor saranga a I'm glad to open actually the last session of the today's webinar the first webinar of the Paris foundation and I would like to thank the Paris foundation for everything they allowed us to do in this adventure the Paris foundation understood that the knowledge transfer and education is a force and I think this is one of the main reasons they invested in this program and we thank them very much for this they believed in us and they believed in our way and this is the result of what has been done in this last few days by their generosity they enabled us to build up this whole program which is very new to the Hebrew University and this is our first trial hoping for many more to come and by expanding activities they allow us to open up to new programs and to other challenges and this is why we thank them greatly from the bottom of our heart good luck to you all please proceed so we proceed with our afternoon session and the first presentation for this session will be met by Miriam Silva Ruiz Miriam is from Mexico she graduated from the chopping go autonomous university in in Mexico and she was later on a research associate at UC Davis in California and then agronomist with the aubergine in Israel and now a student in our program Miriam please hi good afternoon my name is medium and I'm from Mexico the person that guide me through this research exercises dr. Reid calvano a no research intends to explain that salinity induces changes in tomato fruit texture first of all we have to realize that tomato is a cash crop for the State of Israel and all around the world and therefore the trades that are involved in improving this crop or trades that are going to be related mainly to increasing the yield on to improve the pest resistant or to better drug resistant or to just increase the shelf life but this trace work really nice for the breeders in the grower since the early 90s because yeah indeed every year the production was increasing and also the Bailey production was increasing but in the last couple of years we can see that the production more or less became stabled in the literature points out that this is mainly due to the fact that the trace that I mention it before they reach their final potential there for the growers they cannot if they cannot increase the yield anymore so they have to look for trays that can increase the value of their production trades are going to be mainly related to nutritional facts of the crop to the flavor to the appearance overall traits related to tomato fruit quality so we have to understand the quality is any attribute that will determine the cept ability of the consumer if it rejects or if it doesn't like the product attributes of just like how does the fruit look in the Shelf in the market or how does it feel in your hands when we touch it but the most important of all how does it feel in your mouth how do we perceive the flavor how do we perceive the formation and disintegration of the fruit in your mouth and the attribute of quality that measures this character istics its texture texture itself has different components like softening or hardiness and also has factors that affect tester texture the factors that affect enter the mouse is for example quality of irrigation water and it was observed but not measured by Lunardi in 2004 that if we grow tomatoes under such stress the pure will become thicker and they're also issues regarding tomato fruit extra research the main issue is that all the studies are focused in the improvement the salinity induces in quality and learn really few studies that talk about how the salinity induces undesirable changes on quality and when we're measuring texture as I said before we can measure it protective tests in the studies and measure texture to objective test they don't correlate it with sensory analysis for example organoleptic surveys so the literature say that the best study will be the one that can put the three components together to do objective test to the sensory analysis but even more now wonder does microstructure evaluation of the cells in the fruit therefore your typical of or research is to characterize the overall indicators of food quality but to follow the changes of morphology in structure of the cells in the fruit and see if if it affects its fruit texture and all of it under the hypothesis that salinity induces undesirable changes in fruit and fruit skin and it affects its quality with the bio materials and methods in three phases in the first phase we didn't destroy our samples in the second one we did in the third phase has to do with them the microscopic analysis the first phase intended to get results related to the whole fruit characteristics into the peeled so what we did for this was that we set up the experiment indramat negative israel and then we had five different cherry tomato cultivars we grew them on the siemens at one point five on the water 4.0 we had a tour of a hunger experimental plots in each plot was properly labeled when the tomatoes had a markable stage we harvest them off from the whole plot the whole blood work was harvest in the black bin like this and then from the vin we took only five clusters we collect them in this sample in this sample was the one that we actually use for all of our measurements I'm going to explain the first measurement that we did was average fruit way we took 25 tomatoes we divided our way into 25 the second measurement that we did was we took 4 tomatoes and we punch eat it with this penetra meter what it tells us this machine here is the the force required to penetrate the tomato peeled it brings us the lecture back in Newtons now second thing that we the third thing that we do is that we generated or own scale we generated two skills because even at a multiple stage there was a cultivar that had green strikes so we had to separate the red cultivars from the spread cultivar a three-meter nice ripe fruit and I want a less ripe fruit which took five tomatoes for more sample in regression individually then we wanted to see how much does the peeled wait so what we did is we took this puncture it had a fixed area of one centimeter square we punch five tomatoes we put the tomato to board the peel to boil for around 30 seconds and 90 80 degrees and this was to get rid of any extra petticoat that we could be having in the inner peel and then we tried at 60 degrees Celsius for two days and we took that dry pure way so we had results that were like related to wade into collar and to force required for peel rupture and dry pure weight the results were as follow for this first phase all the statistics were done under the consideration that it was a factorial design which was on unity levels five cultivars in there were three effects the cultivar affect the salinity effect in the interaction effect there were no significant differences in the interaction effect therefore the first part of the graph is in the in the April harvest the second part of the graph indicates may harvest and the grouping that you seek here with the letters it's 2k buts grouping the different cultivars that are deflated by different color in the line part here it's the salinity effect in each cultivar so we can say that in terms of the weight all for all the cultivars their weight when they were grown under salinity it was reduced and the cultivar there was the most susceptible as compared to its from 12 1.51 scoot about 1 335 in the crew t well that was the less acceptable was good about this you are 522 but this doesn't mean that were the cultivars that helped higher or less weight the higher weight was din coot over 2200 work as compared to all the other cultivars and cultivate this year 522 had the less weight in the color we have some noise here because of the striped cultivar and I believe this is the reason why we had a statistical differences for the salinity but nevertheless the cultivar there was the more susceptible in terms of ripeness under salinity was pulled over to 206 and the cultivar that was less acceptable was called over 220 for in the penetra meter the results were totally the opposite for all the cultivars the force required for cuticle rupture increased under such stress conditions and we can see that the cultivar that was the most acceptable was suitable for 688 and the cultivar there was a less susceptible was to divert this year 52 to the cultivate they had a higher assistant to the penetration of its field was cultivar to 206 and the cultivator had the less resistance was the same cultivar there was the less susceptible cultivars ECR 522 this makes sense with a bright peeled weight in the dry pure weight although the weights of the peels increased again under salinity stress and the cultivar there was the less susceptible was cultivar 1335 in the coat over there was more susceptible makes sense with also with the with a penetrata readings was pulled over for 68 for 600 80 in the cultivar that had the heaviest peeled was the striped cultivar to 206 in the cultivar the healthy the less try pure weight was good about this year 522 then in the second phase when we started the strain or sample we wanted to get characteristics that will give us an idea that used in the taste for this what we did is we did first of all percent solids we blend it all up to all of our tomatoes we wait it in fresh and then and dry and then otherwise of the blended material we filter it and then we collected an essay tube we took took an illiquid of it and we put it into a refractometer we did the same for the ph meter we took the sample from here we calibrate the ph meter and we took the reading their effect ometer it's telling us 12 volt soluble solids for the organoleptic survey we gather 31 volunteers for the first harvest 24 volunteers for the second harvest and we asked them to grade the tomatoes according to pour faire or good for three components for skin thickness for sweetness and for general flavor we ended up with 10 samples per volunteer because we had five cultivars in we had both salinity levels of 1.5 in 4.0 this is humans okay the result that we acquire work four percent so let's pH GCC and Jurgen elliptic surveys or asphalt for all the cultivars when they are grown under salinity the present soul is increased and the cultivated tends to be more susceptible for the percent solids to increase is cultivar 1335 in the cultivar that is less acceptable scoot over 220 for now but nevertheless the cultivar that has the highest percent solids again it's a stripe cultivar to 206 in the cultivar that has the less percent solid is cultivate 1335 and the pH in the TCC we didn't see any effect not in the interaction and not on the lin et effect inner under cultivar effect neither for the April harvest and the TCC and either for the Maine harvest under and the pH but we put the results as you can see that the values were in the average of 4.2 for the pH in six for the TCC for the organ elective survey while we saw is from the consumers point of view the cultivar for which it matters the most if you provide in salinity or not salinity is going to recruit about 1 335 in the coat over the meadows are less where you grow is going to be cultivated DCR 522 in terms of skin thickness the cultivar the hell the lower skin thickness was cooked over 220 for include over to 206 and the cultivar that even though I didn't matter where you grow it naturally already had a tougher skin was cultivar DCR 522 in terms of sweetness we saw that the cutter but that doesn't matter where you grow is kute about 1 335 and the cultivator it's the more susceptible is cultivar to 204 and in the indogene or flavor what we saw is that the cultivar that it's more susceptible is going to be cultivar 2204 in the cultivator is going to be less than set to for its general flavor it's going to be good about 1 335 but overall the cultivar that the consumers prefer the most was cool to wear this your 522 even though it had the higher value of skin thickness so we took our or tomatoes and wanted to analyze them in the microscope to see the structure of the cells in the composition and we did two methodologies light microscopy in diamond microwave spectroscopy the first we wanted to see composition and morphology of the cells so what we wanted to aim for with light microscopy is that we would take a section of the tomato cube and we were able to have cuticle and we will have a soup epidermal layer here which is composed by smaller cells and the cells in the pedagogue and I have to make it really clear that the peeled is going to be confirmed by two components by the cuticle and by the soup epidermal layers here and then the pericarp is something else what we did is that we took a tomato cube around 0.5 centimeters cube and we put it into a solution a / % butter from para form how the I shall aid in PVC buffer PVCs phosphate-buffered sign and we vacuum for 30 minutes so the solution booked into the cells and then we shake it for an hour and then we put it 44 degrees Celsius for 24 hours in the refrigerator we came the day after we wash off the PFA we put a solution at fifty percent pick for 22 hours we wash it off we put us a solution at one hundred percent pick for 24 hours and then we put it in the fridge so that they will become solid once a pig the pig became solid with our tomatoes cube cube inside it becomes something like this when we take it off of the vessels so with this instrument here it's a micro tube we cut sections of 10 micrometers and sections of 30 micrometers the sections of 10 micrometers we're staining with methylene blue all the sections for the same time of 10 minutes we wash it off and recover a slices that's the sections of 30 micrometers we took them to dremel microspectroscopy and we didn't stain them we just watch the pick off and then we close our slices so while we did get with light microscopy we did get our sample with cuticle with soup epidermal layer and with petticoat but we also wanted to kill more touches that were allowed us to evaluate differences between cultivar this is one cultivar another cultivar in the third coat over the cultivars the way valuator wentworth 1335 this year 5 22 in 4 6 8 8 8 46 year-old 08 and we wanted to see salinity effect and non salinity in effect so once we have our montages with we fixed an area and then with mhj we measure the cuticle area only meaning the green part here and the results that we got with light microscopy was as follows okay so methylene blue stain screen for lipids we can see your cuticles we have an external cuticle layer then we had an internal cuticle layer we had the soup epidermal layer here composed by smaller cells the straight underneath the cuticle we had an epidermal cell here and we had or petty carp and lipids screen meaning the cuticle and cellulose in stains for blue higher concentration of settlers was stained darker blue in terms of the area when we measure with image G what we thought there were not differences the differences were really were really insignificant as compared to the sign treatments but let's remember that the peel is not just composed by the green part of the cuticle it's also composed by the soup epidermal layers and in the soup epidemic of layers we saw tremendous differences for example if we go the cultivars under non cell stress conditions we will only have two layers of soup epidemic oh here's one it here's the second one and they will go to salinity will have 1 2 3 up to four layers and this was repeated in all the cultivars this was for this year 522 we can see like this of one in two super dynamic layers and here we have one two three maybe four super polemical layers under salt and non-self stress condition it also repeated for the other cultivar you have 12 layers here when you have here 1 2 3 super polemical layers and then the pity corp stars so then we took our samples to ramon microspectroscopy and we wanted to see the different composition based on the raman shift peak the remand microspectroscopy is a technique that what it does is like we not inject we sent a laser energy to our sample and any component in nature has these molecules that have once when the bonds observe the energy they will be excited and they will go to a virtual energy stage and then they will return but not all the molecules which not all that energy returns only 1% of it won't and determine what it does it averages this one percent and it reflects pics for different components in nature at a certain time and shift value so what the results that we got is that here was our example we aim or laser as our effort to explain this part here this was or settings for the raman we had it to practice the see what were the best setting or ramen reaching for the components and we were evaluated was 1200 the time of exposure that the laser is open under sample were 0.2 seconds it was 10 times the laser was reflected in our samples at only ten percent of the total potential energy that the laser can emit so in the cuticle we had two major peaks and then we go to determine ramen data database and we saw that this two peaks are representing cutie then we went to the soup epidermal layer and we see that we got packed in here and cellulose here and then we went to that from here we went to the pericarp and in the pericarp we saw only settlers no more pectin and then we average them all without making the differences between 1.0 in 1.5 in 4.0 because we didn't see any difference in intensity here so we saw differences in composition in between the layers but not in between the treatments for our discussion so we ended up with objective tests with sensory analysis and with micro structural analysis in the objective test we had smaller fruits grown under we grow the Kosovars under salinity stress but with higher percent solids and we can explain this like as follows our differences were around twenty-five percent the literature says that we shouldn't be getting these differences only we will be working with disease humans around eight and we were working with four but it also says that the asylum intake it's around it reduces in twenty five percent and the phloem fluxes into the fruit reduces in ninety ninety percent nine percent daily the fruit transpiration will increase around thirty percent and all of this will bring us less weight of thirty percent pure organ which is more close to what we were we had and then if we're reducing the from under such stress conditions we are reducing the fruit size and then if we're reducing the fruit size we're going to increase the sugar concentration and we're going to increase also the self concentrations therefore we are going to end up with smaller foods but with higher percent solids which was what the situation that we had at the end then why did we had higher values of dry pure grade and why was it was it tougher to penetrate the pill under such stress conditions their studies that but only on seeds and tomato seeds that understall stress conditions the test of the seeds accumulates cutie and trichome density and if the cells accumulate cutin they're going to become bigger stronger and heavier so the force required to penetrate them will also be higher in the microscopic microscopy observations other we did see the cute thing we saw the the pectin and we saw the cellulose we think I'll come back this to this that the main problem was this part here that we hit three different points and we didn't we didn't actually like measure a gradient in the ramen is capable of doing it it can measure the whole thing and give us and even give us a map but because of a matter of time we didn't do this so therefore we didn't we were we didn't get any differences in terms of composition ok in the morphology that we saw with light microscopy is that we didn't see any diff in the cuticle area but again the peel is not is a cuticle is also the soup epidermal layer in the soup epidemic a layer I presented really few pictures before so I wanted to repeat it here the top pictures are non salt stress conditions and the bottom pictures are salt stress conditions and you can see that the intensity of the cellulose here it's thinner than the intensity here there are less layers all the time under non cell stress conditions and we have more layers here with sauce so we do believe that there is the differences in instead and not just in cellulose concentration underneath back of the cuticle but the toughness is faced here okay so just to put it all together we decided to start with which ones were the cultivars that the consumers like the more okay so they like mark 1335 in this year 522 the problem is that these cultivars are the ones are most effective or more susceptible for the for the pure thickness and even this year it's the thicker the one that has a thicker pure from the consumers point of view and this was reflected in the line microscopy because they have up to 4 into 5 sub epidermal layers when they are grown under such stress conditions and we will suggest that these two cultivars will be the ones that will be further study to improve their salinity and susceptibility our conclusion would be that all the changes that in induciton tomato from fruit texture under such stress were originally from thickening the peeled but not in the composition and as conclusion we will accept our hypothesis that high salinity conditions to induce undesirable changes in fruit and improve skin texture affecting its quality and thank you and thank you all the persons from my lab because they were really patient with me yeah I was ready to teach hi was a beautiful presentation just because I'm thinking about now is their eyes presentation because he showed that there are some genes that can have like first a can have a good oh okay can have a good trait and then the same can have a bad trait so that your conclusion like was consistent with all your results like all the ones that are exposed to this salinity and they had an undesirable chain desirable and the conclude the thing you concluded that salinity stress yes it causes undesirable changes mm-hmm will the character the same in resistant and susceptible varieties are all worth it for all for all of what we saw that for all the varieties I just find out that was the one more susceptible and less acceptable but for other priorities we had undesirable changes in all of them in all the effects were secure it means the trend will be same even it is susceptible or resistant it doesn't matter well we don't we we don't have a background that we can say okay we think this cultivars are resistant we just wanted to evaluate and we don't we didn't know if they were actually resisting or not resistant I would like to know if you observe the day yield of the tomatoes in a greenhouse now what the yield of the tomato in the greenhouse hey yo day yield um no we didn't observe the yield day in the mat- date they do have records of the whole yield plot in that computer i show you in the beginning right in the beginning but we just took five clusters pure sample they they have records of the whole thing oh it's too bad here you see we had the whole plot like let's say from peer to peer and we collected all the mark google clusters anyway and we put it into this beans and we did record the yield of the plot but we didn't for four studies we didn't use the whole yield but we only use the the average weight of 25 tomatoes from five clusters of the plot okay my question is like I wanted to know how the yard looks like in the high salinity conditions that's what I wanted to find out but since he said he didn't do it yeah well the literature says that if you're working with a TCC means you're going to start to have thirty percent decrease in yield I have hot that the tomato under salinity stress has more sweeter taste than the tomato under normal water condition do you know the reason why is it and if you did you notice the difference in tss content between the yeah we're here with your organ elliptic test we saw was sweeter and I saw with the percent solids we saw it was sweet that percent solid is the percent soul is in the total votes TCC total soluble solids it's an indicator it's actually indicated of sugars so it it increases because we have less water in that in the fruit so you have more concentration of the sugar and you have more concentration also of the whole percent solids one question if I get right or not if we grow tomato on the normal irrigation and under the Saline then the peel thickness will be higher in this salon innovation can we generalize it for the other tomato varieties also can we generalize this I I didn't find this study that will relate to the peeled for the remarkable tomato for the big tomato but it's only it's only seen in seeds that it does invest in the city but not not on the pill not exactly on the fielders because all the studies are based on the and the good things that Sally T does for quality but not under under several changes ok other questions um do you look on the low key to the structure of the little might be some people is preferred in the text here to look on the structure of the locals and locals to TLC locals is the internal part of the surgery you know which images stayin for for the cell wall with a chemical that we use methylene blue it only stays for four cell wall composition in this case cellulose and for the lipid composition for that cuticle composition that was lipids with immediately staying for so this text skiing you consider it as as but like a bad trait rather than because some people is may appreciate to have a thick skin which can which can for example yeah for shelf life even when they are growing in high water content they can be cracked with a short span of time so it will have there might be good like you said probably to have a taker cuticle 44 process it tomatoes for pick tomatoes but for sure tomatoes that's not a tray that you would like to have and you can see it in the organoleptic survey results they that consumes don't like to have a technical kill you use for teasing day Simon per meter of stress right yes what is I mean what was your best to use that one that's what the research that's what the research hadn't said 1.5 in 4.0 and I get that through the time they were they were think that the because these values for the water that with 4.0 you will be accumulating I mean it this wonder you get the concentration the concentration of sanity interrogation without there in the making yes that's a concentration of the salt they were irrigating with 4.0 normal derogation water had this one no I don't have I don't know the belly of the normal irrigation water in the in the station I don't know maybe are you been using different rates of sanity concentration I mean maybe yeah it can be possible to have it would be good to evaluate different salinity levels rather than just 1.5 in for poison until the nickel the microphone moves to the other corner of the room let me ask you something as I understand with the ramen you just identified qualitatively what is the major compound in each in each layer right yes but we could also done it to put to quantify so it can be quantified yeah however in your conclusion you said that the that the composition did not change only the number of layers changed now I said yeah the composition in the layers under layers from 1.0 and Rocco impact didn't change in each specific layer only in between layers that we had for example cutin that we didn't have in the pericarp in we had pectin that we didn't have in there in the cuticle only the one in the path between the Father the 1.5 and the four with the different salinity levels you say that there was no let's a qualitative different in in the in the major compound but yet was there a difference in the amount of pectin deposited or any compound there we saw there were not differences between 1.5 and 4.0 let's say for cellulose and then there were no differences in okay for the cuticle and 1.5 in 4.0 there were no differences for the q10 concentration and then for the soup epidemic a layer for 1.5 in 4.0 we didn't see any differences in concentration for cellulose imperfective and then for pericarp we didn't see any difference in concentration in service for 1.5 and 4.0 what do you mean by concentration I don't want to color concentration because it's not a commission of concentration but it's a measure of intensity all right but you did show some difference in intensity at least in the cuticle know it's different components for each one of them let me put you see this one here the blue one represents the the cuticle and it only has QT and then we have the second one that it's the super Federico layer the red one and it has affected it in half cellulose and in the pericarp only has cellulose what we saw we did have the spectrum where they had different spectral for example for Cutie for cuticle for children for 1.5 and we had a different spectrum for for the for the same component in the cuticle but we didn't see any difference in intensity for example here we have two maybe you're confused because we will see two pics here but they're both representing bonds in the molecule routine but still work what are the differences between the treatments I mean in this respect you say that you saw the same pics however mm-hmm pic represent you the pic represents the quantity or only the quality it identifies what what compound is there if you decide that the pics are similar like let's say is I given graph it let's say for example the right of the green they say that the red will be 1.5 and that the green will be 4.0 and then you have this different securities Delta here in intensity if you decide that the peak length is the same you are sure that that peak is representing to cellulose therefore you can compare the Delta in terms of intensity for cellulose so we can say okay so whatever you find out in this respect in comparison between the 1 and 1.5 we just saw that yesterday that's what we were discussing yesterday that in 1.5 we have a lot of fluorescence in the sample so we're not sure that we're mentioning it's the same set bones for cellulose so that's what we didn't wanted to make the assumption that there were differences between 1.5 and 4.0 okay so you are you still don't have you're not sure about it yeah I don't want to make any assumption because we're not sure but we will see okay yeah sunny detail about how they a very sorry Telugu you used affected a nutritional level s a vitamin C that is if you are looking at those components the vitamin C did you also look at how they the various salinity level affected the nutritional components of that we did we didn't measure any nutritional facts like level of antioxidants or stuff like that but I will assume that it will increase the concentration of any for example vitamin c 0 and any other component will increase the concentration because it has less water on the fruit believe we have a few minutes for our last question during there is any okay if not we will thank me remember", "9q6vvMDzCtA": "hello everyone welcome back to rose of green i hope everybody had a great holiday season and everybody has a great new year's tonight uh new year's eve tonight and i just wanted to say thanks to a couple new members um michael allen and andy c uh thanks for becoming members of the channel guys i really appreciate it it helps out with everything um today's video i'm going to show you guys what happened with the film plants uh the results to the filming along with uh show you guys the autos but uh we're going to start in here first so you can see down here i got some uh floraflex line and the floor flex three inch rings uh this is because i did plan on going away for christmas but then we got hit with another coved lockdown so i did not end up going away but what i will do is i will show you i got this floraflex line here at indoor growing canada i have the link in the description you guys could use that and you could save if you use that link and if you do not save put in the code rows of green and then you will save with that by using the link so first off i just wanted to show you guys the lines i have run here so it's floor flex line and this is on sale right now actually at indoor growing canada it's a good like rubber flexible line it's not that cheap hard hard plastic that stays all coiled up like that it actually stretches out all nicely and everything else i'll just show you what i did so this is an orbit thing off of amazon i actually prefer them over the floraflex ones because the four flex ones are hard to dial in sometimes if you don't have your lines the exact same length all the way around and uh so i like the orbit one because you could adjust them there's little screws on the top where you can adjust them so anyway i'll show you what i did here i ran it over here down the side over here don't mind the mess and then i ran it into my 25 gallon tank i got a bubbler in there you can see it in there and then the pump is down in there and it's set up on a timer so let's get back into the main flower room here okay so here we are these are the in-house genetics black cherry punch and these girls are just beautiful i'll bring you in now let me show you how nice these girls are show you here we've got a lot of different phenos i thought this one here and that one back there we're going to be the same and this one here and this one we're going to be the same uh they are kind of same these this one and that one back there are the same but these two here they seem to be two totally different uh but this one's just carrying the purple but i'll show you what i mean but uh anyway first let's move in i'll show you guys the frost on these girls just beautiful frost just really nice gear that comes from in-house genetics bring it back here and show you this one another beautiful one and then i'll show you the big difference here with this girl here you can see she's like purple and she's foxtailing again for frost she's uh real nice beautiful in fact and then this one up front i'm like i'm really impressed with this fc 6500 by mars hydro uh it's really growing some nice big nugs uh really nice dense ones as well it's a good um here just how big these are and we still got a couple weeks to go so they're still swelling up and we're just getting started these ones here with the size of golf balls hopefully lower size of eggs by the time we're done but uh yeah all nice and clean down below like i said i planned on having this watering system for when i went away but uh we got another lock down with covid so i have used it just to try it out but uh i'm gonna pull it out pull it out of here probably but uh anyway that's it for these black cherry punch let's move on and i will show you guys the rotten rosie the ones that we filmed and the outcome of that okay so here we are these are the uh rotten rosie and these are femmes and these are the ones that i thinned last time and i'll just get on to show you guys uh how the film worked out so it's where i i thinned it down here so now you can see we got the two tops coming in we got uh these two here and then these two that i'm holding on to and then these ones down here have caught up so it's gonna be actually like six main tops that we have going on here so that they did work we did get the four on all of them all four will be uh shooting out but i have a different problem um as you guys know i'm growing these in the regular version as well actually they're rosy they're not rotten rosy they're just rosy and uh they're in the regular version and i grew out about 40 of them because i'm doing some breeding and so i grew those out and then i crossed them with a different male and then once i got those i picked out the best one uh the best female out of that and then i crossed it with a different strain of male and then i took the um two offsprings from that and then i crossed it again to make it an f2 so i will be growing those here shortly because i'm gonna do uh 110 of those uh f2 seeds that i created and uh we're going to do 10 of them on this channel and i'm going to show you guys how i go about making them seeds again because some of you guys have been asking me to show you everything from the start to the finish so i'll show you guys uh what i use to make the fem seeds and how i do it and go about it as well so one of my issues uh that i'm getting on with with this is why i'm mentioning that is because these stretched a hell of a lot more than just a regular rossi and uh i'm not sure if that has something to do with uh the lights because this is it actually is a little bit more of a red spectrum in these that i'm using at my friend's facility uh but these are the sand lights so it might be why they're stretching a little more or it might just be that this uh feminized line is a lot more stretchier um they do have good structure though as you can see this one here is one of my favorites so uh but i'm really not into all the lengthiness they're a little too long and i don't want to just bend them over so what i'm going to do is i'm going to top these again yes i'm going to lose about a week worth of uh growth because i just filmed them so i'd have more tops but the stretch is just too much so uh what i'm going to do is i'm going to top them i'll probably top it about here and then i'm going to top these again next week or at a later date so then i'll get my four main tops that way these are just too lengthy to do what i wanted to do they're all that one in the back there is already at the height that i would have sent it to the flower at so what we're going to do is we're just going to have a different set of plans and this happens while you're growing uh people sometimes you just have to make a change of plans in order to get what you want out of that plant so that's what we're doing here uh these are not gonna go to waste um i actually have a friend in town here who wants clones of these so that's what i'm gonna do so i'm gonna call this one uh rotten rossi one the one in the back there two and then three and then four so all i'm gonna do is i'm gonna come in here and i'm gonna top it right here and we're gonna make beautiful clones with these so you want to leave a bit of a nub when i come in here you want to leave a bit of a nub just to uh give it some space to grow give those branches a place to uh set this will rot away but it will help set these branches up so there's no failure so it don't split and all that other stuff so all i'm gonna do here is i'm gonna take it and i'm gonna snap it just like that i'm gonna take that and i'm just gonna set it in the water here for now down here and i numbered all of those cups down there as well just so i don't mix them up so that we can we can compare our grows in the end so now here we go here we've got these branches and uh what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna remove these big fan leaves here that will help give more uh light down to here and it will stop from feeding these so much so they won't get as uh they won't keep climbing is uh higher than the others so we'll get a nice even canopy by doing it this way so there's one down i'm gonna go into the back here i'm gonna cut this one the same place leave a little nub uh the reason why you put these in the water right away is so that uh so that you don't suck air up and do uh up into it you want it uh you want it all nice and full of water so let's move on here now to number three we'll do that in the same spot leaving a bit of a nub again well take that i'll bring it down we'll put it in the number three cup and then number four this is the reason why i'm doing this right here is because of this one this is uh one big plant so so anyway i got them all set up down here now and we're gonna take them out and i'm gonna show you guys how i clone these real quickly we'll just do one of them and then i'll get on to show you guys uh the autoflowers after that but uh we'll bring these out to uh area where we have more room to play okay so here we are we're gonna start with number one here so first things first i bring it down here and i'm just removing these leaves here because we don't need them this is gonna be a power clone because it's gonna have the six tops so it's actually gonna be a pretty uh cool clone to grow out but uh i have oh never mind i thought i lost my uh put that back in there for a second i thought i lost my razor blades but here they are right here just use these and uh i use razor blades just because it's easier to control so i take it like that and then i will just i'll shave it down about a half inch on the end and that is just to break the outside so that your roots will grow out of that easier whoops you got to be careful not to snap it like i just did so we'll start again being a little more gentle just like that and i will actually put a split in mine that and then i use stem root number two this is for like uh it's kind of for like a woodier woody type strain but like mediocre and then i just put it in there i packed down around it so there we go there's the first clone you don't need to snip all the ends off but you can i will usually do that in my hand but that just helps promote the root growth it makes uh the roots grow instead of the tips grow and uh it also helps get oxygen into the plant because it can't take it up through its roots because it doesn't have any so now that we got number one out of the way we will get on to number two which is right here and over here again you want to just take off the bottom fan leaves you can actually grab your clone like this and give it a snip like that and then all your ends are cut easily take your razor blade do some shaving we're splitting it then dip it into stem root number two knock some of it off stick it in there and pack down around it and then what i will do is i will just give these a bit more water just to make sure that they're watered in correctly and then i will put them underneath a dome which i'll show once i finish these other two off so dipping right into this with my clones that's not good practice to have because you can spread diseases that way but i'm not too worried about it i have quite a few of these so i'm good to go um usually you want everything to be sterilized and you switch in between your clones and whatnot but uh i'm not too worried about it like i said so that's why i dipped out a container this time but if you want to be extra careful not to spread diseases and guys just put some of this into a different little container to dip your clones in and then throw it out at the end of the day um anyway we'll move on to show you how i have these set up now okay so we're back in here and again i'm not real sure why these things stretched all that much i've been using a monosolixic acid uh it's actually called power si it's just a silica it's a different type of silica it actually brings your ph down for once uh instead of raising it up to like 11 it brings it down to around like six which is perfect or around six five but uh anyway let's get on to the clones what i did now is i put them into a dome here i put the dome on the floor it's off the floor just a little bit and then i missed the heck out of the plants and i missed the heck out of the top here and i keep it really nice and humid in there and about seven days we will have roots from those girls and then uh once i'll give them probably two weeks here then i'll give them to my buddy who wants them so anyway these girls here they're now gonna grow pretty good all the uh shorter branches here will be able to come up the ones on the bottom will be able to come up as well i'm just gonna tuck these leaves here so that we're getting late to everything now we're getting light and they're all looking pretty good i think this one here is going to be a pretty good one so i'm excited to see this one but uh yeah we're just gonna have to take a different angle on training these girls anyway let's get on with the autos and i'll show you guys how those girls are blowing up okay so i just wanted to come back in here i know you guys just finished the part of this but i just wanted to show you how i added in these floraflex things and that's to help stop the soil from drying out i also got underneath it the pads those pads down below they stop the top layer from drying out as well so they work really good for organic soil which is uh the reason why i have them right now but right now this is a couple days since i did the topping and you can see the structure is a lot better with these girls they're not feeling it too much here right now i was just bending them down and messing around i broke back branch i broke the branch back there so i had to taper up but now they're starting to grow pretty good a lot more bushy so it seems like we're getting them under control so i will get back and i will show you guys the autos there now okay so here we are with the autos and these girls are doing just awesome um this one here that's uh moby dick by dynafilm this one here is another moby deck by dynafilm and this one here is a lemon pie auto by fast buds but i will just show you how big this girl here is just how big she's doing as well she's got real big cola's on her and they're just huge and she's nice and dense we're starting to get a little bit of fade in there now with her right on time and these ones over here i'll show you the frost is starting to pack on her and they're a little bit more skinny of buds but they're still nice big colas and then this fast buds i've had to come in here and uh thin her out a bit as she had a lot of leaf just to get some light down into there but all in all they're looking very nice and uh yeah so

this is know your buds a close-up look at cultivars you should try or try again joining dean is our educator chris [Music] ianson oh it is great to be chatting with my good friend chris ianson of plant life cannabis once again after we had to unfortunately uh postpone last week it's it's hard to uh to record a podcast when you're lying in bed for five days chris so that's why we had to skip it but while i was uh recovering in bed you and the gear the gang at plant life uh have been very busy especially with some new stores yeah that's right dino i'm actually down in calgary right now i'm here to help support uh we're opening a new store in southeast calgary uh in the mahogany uh area uh it's a big beautiful store uh opening on january 27th uh pretty exciting i'm pretty pretty pumped to kind of see uh i guess this would be my first uh plant life store opening um got a great staff already great manager there um super excited to see where it goes indeed the the plant life stores uh popping up all over the place and that is good to hear and i'm sure more expansion on the way uh in some other spots and and i'm really excited to be able to take a look at this cultivar that we're doing today black cherry punch an indica dominant hybrid and uh i i i'm excited because i like uh the uh the lp that it comes from it's a figure so let's talk a little bit about figure and especially who the parent company is uh with this uh this cannabis company that in my opinion seems to be on a rising track yeah no doubt dean uh so the parent company is uh pixis international uh and they're a global agricultural company with uh over over 145 years experience of delivering value added products and services to businesses and customers so very dialed in on the agricultural side of things um figure is their their cannabis uh region uh part of the company there and it's uh figures a handcrafted homegrown cannabis company um they grow cannabis with the the character of of fifth generation homegrown farmers and the integrity of a fully verifiable source uh to market tracking system so it's pretty much it's a combination of a farm wisdom crossed with modern scientific rigor uh it's very cool to see um and i'm a big fan of seeing the kind of the the farming industry get into cannabis i think that's it just feels right uh finger was founded in uh in 2017 uh by then president and ceo edwin jarrell uh in charlottetown prince edward island um so they're out of pei and uh it started out as a small family venture and uh and that turned into the big cannabis beast that it is today um presently the company is run by their current ceo harvey carroll and uh harvey comes from a background of 25 years of experience in the the food and alcohol industry and he works out of their head office in toronto wow so uh some pretty solid growth uh to use uh the the term of uh the industry um this is a company that you know as you've mentioned kind of started small and now is you know really taking off so tell us a little bit about you know the history of their growth and and kind of where they're working out of now yeah for sure dean so yeah this company uh figures start out with four employees uh now they have upwards of close to 200 employees some seasonal employees depending on on harvest and stuff but i mean four to two hundred that's that's some serious serious growth um the facility in prince edward island is called canada's island garden and it's uh it's over three hundred thousand square feet uh it's six football fields pretty much just picture picture them right next to each other so a whole lot of growing space there um they use led lighting which keeps the energy costs down and it's good for the environment they use rainwater which is recycled a computerized system to monitor the data and they also use natural air ventilation too we grow in hydroponically too which is uh a real nice way to soillessly grow your cannabis um they also have a smaller uh facility in simcoe ontario it's about 20 000 square feet and it's named uh the gold leaf farm and um recently the the company they they added an option uh to to for expansion of upwards of seven hundred thousand square feet uh because they acquired the 20 acres of land adjacent to this facility so um right now that's kind of their small facility for right now uh with the you know [ __ ] if they need to expand uh they've got the room to do it pretty cool uh that's that's awesome i love those stories of uh somebody starting small you know not that if you have the resources to start big that's a there's anything wrong with that as long as you can maintain that and unfortunately we've seen a lot of companies that haven't been able to do that and these guys are going the other way starting small doing it right and building properly and they also have uh i guess a unique labeling system with their cultivars don't they yeah dean they do so when figure first came to market uh they were uh a number system so you would come in the number seven the number fourteen the number eight uh and they kind of represented different cultivars uh it wasn't on the packaging you kind of had to like look into a little bit um i think that they kind of they heard from from people saying you know what we want to know what we're smoking we want to know what the cultivars are uh and they pivoted they switched and uh they switched over to the the curated collection of the go series um and so there's you know five different i guess uh vibes on on how you want to feel uh and it's it's uh easy there's a chill there's steady which is what the black cherry punch is under that's under the go steady uh there's also play and there's elevate those are a couple of sativa dominant ones um let me just say it's kind of nice to see the different vibes uh but still see the cultivar there as well i feel like they kind of got that one right a lot of a lot of lps are you know going with just a vibe only uh i like they've got a vibe and there's a i guess a family of cultivars within that vibe i could not agree more i mean it's like they saw what some people were doing and they were doing a pretty good job and they perfected it because they have the vibe but then the actual cultivar that maybe you're familiar with and you're like oh yeah i know about that but maybe i didn't know about this one so you're right i think they're i think they're as charlie sheen once said winning on uh this one uh quite a bit uh with with that system uh so so bravo to that uh with their their different vibes and their different collections and also bravo to them for the figure fund tell us about that yeah this is really cool uh so every month figure they take nominations um uh for a bypoc uh owned business uh bypass the black or indigenous with people of color um so by pac-owned businesses once they've selected a business uh to support uh they will purchase products or services from from that company and and actually have the company distribute it to the community around them so uh very cool initiative uh i think it's a lot of good in inter promotion too i feel like um the companies involved are gonna uh you know benefit from that in in the the time to come uh and they do a new business every month too um so it's super super cool to see uh i'm a big fan of you know cannabis companies we know they make money um but it's nice to see them you know giving back or supporting the communities i uh i think that's awesome too um and you know as we were kind of looking at the uh the website you can just see um there's a lot of good information on it they're doing a lot of really good things so so bravo to these guys for sure but when it comes to the website and you can check it out at www.figr.com they have something very cool um i'm not gonna say they're the the only ones or it's like the the the first ever uh with with products but i've i haven't seen this uh with cannabis products so tell us a little bit about how you can actually track uh you know i'm i'm holding this in my hand i can track exactly uh the the right almost every detail about this batch chris yeah buddy it's crazy so it's it's called the scentsy uh track and trace system and it's something that uh you know figure offers to to make them stick out a little bit compared to the other lp's uh each figure product comes with a lot number it's right on the front of the jar and on their website uh there's a spot right on the home page where you can actually put that lot number in there it is uh and you can you can choose on the right there if you've got a numbered product or a go product and it'll actually uh bring up a whole lot of info on that specific batch of the canvas that you got in your hands um you can see how it was grown uh where it was grown uh they even have a coa so certificates of an analysis are on there uh and it's got a full breakdown of of the terpene uh profile in it uh as well as uh you know pesticides tests and um just like a full full deal of info this is like one of my favorite websites that i've kind of come across in the canvas industry for for information i think they they just nailed it yeah this is the best website i've seen uh hands down i i think that for information uh we were looking at some of the colors uh everything uh you know i've i've talked ad nauseam about uh you know cannabis companies trying to stand out in a world where you're not allowed to do any promotion or advertising really colors are a big thing in doing that and they they nail that but you can't just have all sizzle and no steak and they have the information so bravo to these guys check out the website and they even have an app where you can scan uh your lot number and stuff so uh to me it's the best website for a combination of uh the information but it also is visually very appealing and we haven't always seen that we've seen sometimes how websites have one but not the other and and this is very eye-catching as is the cannabis uh that we're going to get to right now so the history of black cherry punch uh lay down the lineage on us for sure dean so it's across a black cherry pie crossed with purple punch uh so two two real delicious delicious cultivars they're crossed in to make a super delicious skin uh very tasty yeah uh within the black cherry pie we've got black cherry soda crossed with a uh 501st og uh and then the the purple punch is a larry og crossed with the granddaddy perps um so a couple of ogs in there and then a couple of real kind of uh flavorful fruity cultivars so it's a really good mix so the the 501st og and the larry og are are those two um you know coming from the same family tree sort of thing that have just been you know something else added to take them in a different direction um yeah i mean og kush is is is in both uh for sure um but i mean it's it's the both kind of have very uh different kind of uh processes on on how they got to the laryogy and the the five hole first all right well i i know this is one of your favorites because of the gdp in this and i know you love uh gdp if everybody if anybody's ever looking to get chris uh any kind of cannabis gifts just come to me because i know some of the favorites and i know gdp is one of yours it oh my god it is it's uh that's one where um when a lot of people come in and they they ask me a question in store you know what's i want to relax i want to feel good i want to have just a nice chill evening like um they're not too educated they don't know to to too much i always try and let's start with the gdp it's not too intense uh just a super amazing cultivar uh created by one of my cannabis heroes ken estes the medicine man um so just just legendary stuff there uh but uh yeah i was just gonna say about like uh uh the the gdp is amazing but uh the the black cherry punch that we have was was initially bred by um the elite cannabis breeders in-house genetics and they're out of the usa uh and they've got uh 63 unique cultivars that i came across on the seed finder website there wow really cool names uh that i i've never heard of before uh afghanimal uh blue nana uh cherry gorilla uh daddy map um and there was there's even one called customer service a cultivar it's called customer service uh it's it's a girl scout cookies crossed with an allen wrench well hey you can't you you could fix anything with an allen ranch so uh that uh that works out and uh i love that i love afghanimal i i think i might have to i think i might have to get like name my next cannabis accessory and afghanimal or something like that i think that is absolutely uh awesome uh okay so this is 23.4 percent and we'll tell you where that kind of fits on on our level but what's in a name do you think chris so with the with the black cherry punch it's a genetics name uh we've got the the black cherry pie so the black cherry and we've got the purple punch so you got the punch um i think two with the the black cherry uh is is is a flavor name with the sweetness of it um but that's that's pretty much kind of just the basic genetics and flavor name dean alrighty now we get to the look and start with the packaging a standard tub but at least it's not white i think that you know stands out if you're you know in a store and you're looking for something to display that's going to catch people's eyes a little bit more it was sealed there was no humidity pack so i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna grate if you have a humidity pack you get bonus points uh if you don't uh it's unfortunate you should but i will say despite there not being a humidity pack this was in great shape uh it was in phenomenal shape the only thing i worry about is you know i have purchased not this company but uh different types of cannabis that have been uh a year and a half old and i'm not saying the humidity pack is going to make it great but it could help having said that this stuff is in phenomenal shape chris yeah big time man um i got some stuff last week and the week before i'm a big fan of the uh um what i've seen uh really really nice uh well-tripped nugs um some smaller size which i am totally good with uh no leaves at all just real dense nugs uh color wise we've got you know the darker green buds for sure with some purple flecks in the bud and and some some real nice bright orange pistols um kind of my my favorite thing about the look though is the the dusting of trichomes i think it's it's quite frosty uh looks super nice um yeah i was very impressed when i when i first cracked my my first jar of the figure black cherry yeah it uh it's in great shape uh you know feel wise like when you touch it it's spongy and sometimes i get a little bit leery when i see small buds and no humidity back because they can be dry and this one sponge perfect it was it's sponge worthy to quote seinfeld it was absolutely awesome and um in the trim job as you mentioned the trim job is just you know some of the best like you know you're going to take some stems out as you're going but there was like no leafs it was just uh it was you're one of the best trim jobs that i've seen in quite a long time so bravo to them um this is a terrific shaped cannabis uh this is what this is what when you pay the money for your cannabis and get home you are totally satisfied i don't i don't know how anybody could say anything negative about uh this uh this batch of cannabis in my opinion mm-hmm well sad dean i i completely agree with you uh yeah like i said i've been a big big fan i've gotten quite a few jobs already and the pre-rolls two are nice as well they come in a real slick um kind of tin packaging awesome i'm looking forward to that all right let's talk about the terpene profile with uh black cherry punch yeah for sure so we got limonene that's our dominant terpene and that's going to be kind of a citrus fruity uh aroma and flavor uh kerryoffalene is number two and that's uh black pepper and spice and then we got linalool as number three and that's kind of a floral lavender uh flavor and aroma there so um cool thing about the chirps for i guess this this particular uh um know your buds is uh like we we know specifically on the batch that that that you had there uh these are the dominant uh terpenes yeah yeah you can look up uh as we did uh from from the batch and uh i'm just gonna list them off uh so as we mentioned limonene is point three six uh percent caryophyllene point two two linoleum 1.8 and then mercene is the the fourth one at 1.3 so it's amazing it gives you lists like this is total transparency and this is what the consumer wants right um especially people that are very new to cannabis and maybe don't know anything that it was other than it was illegal and maybe shady and uh well this pulls back the curtain right this shows you everything that this is certified to be and is and this is what's going to bring other people in and speaking of new people give us a run through of what a terpene is for maybe some of the new listeners and viewers we've picked up in 2021 yeah for sure dean so terpenes are they're aromatic oils they secrete from the cannabis glands and they make your cannabis uh smell or taste a certain way so when you got bud like uh you know lemon skunk or something super citrusy uh limonene is gonna be um probably one of the more dominant terpenes in there um with terpenes there's you know the smell and the taste and the flavor uh there can also be some some effects that you can kind of uh receive from from terpenes now everyone is different everyone our bodies all react differently to cannabis as we all have different biologies but um there are some generalizations where you know some i guess limonene for example is is known to be a bit uplifting whereas mercy could be a bit more sedative a bit more heavy bit more into the couch um but again those are generalizations i mean uh terpenes and cannabis affect everyone differently uh but with the terpenes is comes into the into play the entourage effecting and that's thc cbd and your terpenes all combined together to give you the desired effect of the cannabis yeah and we're finding out more and more and they even have the the uh the cannabinoids listed on uh those coas on the website so uh great information from you and great information from figure as well so what did you smell when you uh cracked open your batch the first time so for me initially earthy and spicy uh right off the hop uh for sure uh and then and then i definitely got like a kind of a sweet almost candy-like uh smell i'm kind of trying to realize it if maybe the name is kind of giving me a bit of that placebo effect like thinking of the um coke bottles like those black cherry cola bottles uh but i i definitely got earthy spicy and sweet for sure um yeah i uh the first thing i thought of when i opened it and i kind of think i'm a little bit uh the same with you kind of maybe um influenced by the name a little bit but i smell black forest cake and sort of the cherries that that go in that right away i will tell you though after the grind and i think that's also something that's important for people smell your cannabis before you grind it up and smell it after because you know things get molecules get released and things like that but i got a real real strong floral uh smell that wasn't as prevalent before that was really really there after the grind so i think that's also another you know we talk about putting your cannabis under a light and looking at it a little bit uh smelling it before and after the grind i think can uh can bring out some different flavor smells as well too yeah i uh that's become i guess a part of my my ritual now dean uh it wasn't before uh now when i when i you know prepare a joint uh i will smell my grinder uh because you do get some some extra extra notes in there once once it is ground up so highly recommend everyone check that out do it on your own uh you will notice the difference all right what about the taste test what do you get from this so taste test for me uh it was definitely earthy on woodsy um and on the exhale it's kind of like a citrus fruity sweetness uh coming out again made me think of those coke bottles delightful it tastes delightful in my opinion dean i think uh i i definitely got the uh the earthy and the uh the sweetness on the exhale uh i'm just waiting for the old uh supernova volcano hybrid to uh fire up and uh i will get another taste at it but uh certainly uh the earthy taste was very prominent um and and i was expecting more of the floral taste and it's it's there but it's more kind of like that fruity sweetness uh that you talk about what about your experience i know you've had a lot of experience lately because you've been a big fan of this but you know what's the what and and as we should point out as you did everybody is different but what was your experience like right so in my experience as super relaxing very soothing on the body um the initial heist is more so on the body to start and then i i kind of there's a steady head buzz throughout um makes me smile a lot i i get i got in a really good mood when i smoke the blackberry punch i find it to be very balanced uh with the head and the body maybe a slight edge to the body but there is some real nice head effects to it um yeah like like i said i've been i've been a big big fan of it uh i feel like i sold a lot of it too people come in asking for something tasty um here's what i like the safety um and it's super smooth to smoke too that was worth i guess bringing up uh super smooth right to the filter uh i appreciate that a lot well i could tell you uh i haven't been uh doing a lot of uh smoking why i've been doing any smoking and uh vaping uh since i you know came down uh with pneumonia last week and this is like you know one of the first days that i've tried this and and you're right and i'm taking very very small because i'm not fully recovered but very uh very very smooth especially in the the vape form so i could totally concur with that and as mentioned everybody is a little bit different but we do like to make sort of some general recommendations of who what and when this might be good for based on our experiences with it so who what and when what do you got so who it's good for intermediate smokers uh don't jump into the black cherry punch if you're new to cannabis uh just the thc levels are a bit on the high side anything 20 plus you don't just want to dive right into uh when it's good for for me it's an all day cultivar i i like it all day uh i think it's best in the evening time uh but i definitely have started some some days off with uh with the black cherry punch and uh you know found myself still motivated i still got stuff done uh maybe a little bit slower than normal but uh you know with a big smile on my face so that was great uh what it's good for is chilling out getting your relax on it's really nice for that uh it's great for right after work uh even right after dinner i i definitely was a big fan of it then um kind of right when you get in you know take your shoes off put your keys on the counter you know jack it off what am i gonna smoke i think the black cherry punch is a really good option for that it just puts you in a right right mood and i think it's great too for for uh watching sports uh i i watched some nhl games uh with it it was awesome um yeah for sure well if you can watch the oilers and still enjoy it because of black cherry punch then there's at least a bonus because there's not there haven't been a lot to enjoy with the oilers uh this year so there's a bonus to that and you know what i think you made a really good point that we should bring up is that you know this is an indica dominant hybrid but it's still something that you can use during the day i think you know there's a there's a bit of a push on and we changed the this segment from what's that strain to know your buds because we're going with cultivar over strain there's a lot of people that want to get rid of sativa indica hybrid i i still think we can have those words as long as we educate people that not every indica is going to make you fall asleep and not every sativa is going to make you talk uh you know as fast as possible or whatever so there's definitely some in-betweens and and it's great to know that this is an indica dominant hybrid that is good during the day yeah yeah totally dean it was uh like start the day off with his independent hybrid you're good i i didn't take any naps i didn't turn into a zombie i had some really good days awesome all right really good days ahead for uh people in the plant life family you guys are excited about it and the consumer will be as well yeah dino we're launching a new membership program soon and it's actually going to be called the plantlife family uh where uh our our guests that come come to the plant life stores uh we're gonna be able to uh you're gonna have an app on your phone that uh and there'll be kind of like a point system there and it's uh just real exciting uh kind of pumped to get it launched here uh i've got to see a little beta version of it and uh it looks very cool i'm excited to like use it once it's up and running and i guess another thing too with our plant life family is uh all of our instagrams uh for all of our stores all the instagram accounts have been kind of set up they're all uh running um and i've been i've had texts from friends been asking me you know if i've had anything to do with um you know the new instagram presence uh that we're that we're seeing from plant life lately and it's it's it's just uh all stores of uh they've all got their their accounts up now and they're posting on the regular so uh if you've got a plant life store that you go to on the regular and frequent uh check out their instagram uh page and uh you know you can see the daily deals and even on delivery days we're kind of letting people know about the new fun stuff that's coming in so uh all kinds of fun stuff happening with plant life dean that is awesome anyway any time you can connect more with the consumer and give them more information all the better thank you so much chris best of luck with the store openings we'll talk next week", "AnNLrGDgxkA": "hey guys i'm roy i'm hanging out here with my friend brandon from in-house genetics and we're going to take a look around to some of the in-house stuff that we're running out here we constantly get questions how do they perform outdoors how are they doing greenhouse boggy boon right now just with their quality hit our standard and in many cases superseded we have about 150 black cherry punch and then about 300 slurry cane so the black cherry punch in my mind has this amazing smell that a customer can smell as soon as they pop the lid off of the jar it's definitely going to hit them hard and the slurry cane has this i mean ridiculous bag appeal there's a couple that boggy boon right now is hunting and i'll let him explain that we popped some seeds of dual og and we popped some seeds of turple and we ran them and we did our final hunt and they looked so good it was impossible to choose a final winner off of our first round so what we did we're going to re-run those a second time and then we're going to do a final final hunt from those final three with some of our retail partners so if you watch us on instagram facebook or anything like that either in-house or boggy boon you'll be able to see the progress of those and when they're coming to market because they're starting right now you", "XvUwLgjFTik": "okay good afternoon I hope you enjoyed your lunch we are back to the Pierce foundation webinar and before we resume with our presentations miss me label hi ma would like to say a few words the head of the division for external studies Meera please Thank You professor saranga a I'm glad to open actually the last session of the today's webinar the first webinar of the Paris foundation and I would like to thank the Paris foundation for everything they allowed us to do in this adventure the Paris foundation understood that knowledge transfer and education is a force and I think this is one of the main reasons they invested in this program and we thank them very much for this they believed in us and they believed in our way and this is the result of what has been done in this last few days by their generosity they enabled us to build up this whole program which is very new to the Hebrew University and this is our first trial hoping for many more to come and by expanding activities they allow us to open up to new programs and to other challenges and this is why we thank them greatly from the bottom of our heart good luck to you all please proceed so we proceed with our afternoon session and the first presentation for this session will be met by Miriam Silva Ruiz Miriam is from Mexico she graduated from the chopping go autonomous university in in Mexico and she was later on a research associate at UC Davis in California and then agronomist with the aubergine in Israel and now a student in our program Miriam please hi good afternoon my name is medium and I'm from Mexico the person that guide me through this research exercises dr. Rieff Calvano and our research intense to explain that salinity induces changes in tomato fruit texture first of all we have to realize that tomato is a cash crop for the State of Israel and all around the world and therefore the trades that are involved in improving this crop our trays that are going to be related mainly to increasing the yield on to improve the pest resistant or to better drug resistant or to just increase the shelf life but this trace work really nice for the breeders in the grower since the early 90s because yeah indeed every year the production was increasing and also the belly production was increasing but in the last couple of years we can see that the production more or less became stable in the literature points out that this is mainly due to the fact that the trace that I mention it before they reach their final potential there for the growers they can if they cannot increase the yield anymore so they have to look for trays that can increase the value of their production trades that are going to be mainly related to nutritional facts of the crop to the flavor to the appearance overall traits related to tomato fruit quality so we have to understand the quality is any attribute that will determine the susceptibility of the consumer if it rejects or if it doesn't like the product attributes of just like how does the fruit look in the Shelf in the market or how does it feel in your hands when we touch it but the most important of all how does it feel in your mouth how do we perceive the flavor how do we perceive the formation and disintegration of the fruit in your mouth and the attribute of quality that measures these characteristics its texture texture itself has different components like softening or hardiness and also has factors that affect tester texture the factors that affect enter the mouse is for example quality of irrigation water and it was observed but not measured by Leonardi in 2004 that if we grow tomatoes under such stress the Pew will become thicker and there are also issues regarding tomato fruit texture research the main issue is that all the studies are focused in the improvement the salinity induces in quality and learn really few studies that talk about how the salinity induces undesirable changes on quality and when we're measuring texture as I said before we can measure it through objective test in the studies and measured texture to objective test they don't correlate it with sensory analysis for example organoleptic surveys so the literature says that the best study will be the one that can put the three components together to objective test to the sensory analysis but even more now wonder does microstructure evaluation of the cells in the fruit therefore the elliptical or research is to characterize the overall indicators of fruit quality but to follow the changes of morphology in structure of the cells in the fruit and see it if it affects its fruit texture and all of it under the hypothesis that salinity induces undesirable changes in fruit and fruit skin and it affects its quality with the bio materials and methods and three phases in the first phase we didn't destroy our samples in the second one we did in the third phase has to do with them the microscopic analysis the first phase intended to get results related to the whole fruit characteristics into the peeled so what we did for this was that we set up the experiment in Ramat negative israel and then we had five different cherry tomato cultivars we grew them on this is humans at one point five on the water 4.0 we had a tour of hungry experimental plots in each plot was properly labeled when the tomatoes had a markable stage we harvest them off from the whole plot the whole plot was harvest in the black bin like this and then from the VIN we took only five clusters we collect them in this sample and this simple was the one that we actually use for all of our measurements I'm going to explain the first measurement that we did was average fruit way we took 25 tomatoes we divided our way into 25 the second measurement that we did was we took 4 tomatoes and we punch eat it with this parameter what it tells us this machine here is the the force required to penetrate the tomato peeled it brings us the lecture back in Newtons now second I think that with the third thing that we do is that we generated or own scale we generated two skills because even as a mark of a stage there was a cultivar I had green strikes so we had to separate the red cultivars from the spread cultivar a three-meter nice ripe fruit and a 1 a less ripe fruit which took 52 meters from our sample in regression individually then we wanted to see how much does the peeled wait so what we did is we took this puncture it had a fixed area one centimeter square we punch five tomatoes we put the tomato to work the peel to boil for around 30 seconds and 98 degrees and this was to get rid of any extra petticoat that we could be having in the inner peel and then we try it at 60 degrees Celsius for two days and we took the dry pure way so we had results that were like related to wade into collar and to force required for peel rupture and dry pure weight the results were as follow for this first phase all the statistics were done under the consideration that it was a factorial design with to salinity levels five cultivars in there were three effects the cultivar affect the salinity effect in the interaction effect there were no significant differences in the interaction effect therefore the first part of the graph is in decay in the April harvest the second part of the graph indicates may harvest and the group in the UC q with the letters it's 2k but it's grouping the different cultivars that are deflated by different color in the line part here it's the salinity effect in each cultivar so we can say that in terms of the weight all for all the cultivars their weight when they were grown under salinity it was reduced and the cultivar that was the most susceptible as compared to its from 12 1.5 was good about 1 335 in the cootie well that was the less acceptable what's good about this you are five to two but this doesn't mean that were the cultivars they held a higher or less weight the higher weight was in suitable to 20 of work as compared to all the other cultivars and cultural DC or 522 had the less weight in the color we had some noise here because of the spread cultivar and I believe this is the reason why we had a statistical differences for the salinity but nevertheless the cultivar that was the more susceptible in terms of ripeness under salinity was pulled over to 206 and the cultivar that was less acceptable was called over to 204 in the penetra meter the results were totally the opposite for all the cultivars the force required for cuticle rupture increased under such stress conditions and we can see that the cultivar that was the most acceptable suitable for 688 and the coot over there was a less susceptible was to divert this year 52 to the cultivate they had the higher resistant to the penetration of it spilled was cultivar to 206 and the cultivator had the less resistance was the same culture that was the less acceptable cultivar DC or five to two this makes sense with a dried peeled wait in the dry pure wait although the waves of the peels increased again under salinity stress and the cultivar that was the less susceptible was cultivar 1335 in the coat over that was more susceptible makes sense with also whether we penetra meter readings was pulled over for 68 for 600 a in the cooter well that had the heaviest peeled was the striped cultivar to 206 in the cultivar the healthy the less dry pure weight was cultivated this year 522 then in the second phase when we started the strain or sample we wanted to kick Herrick teristics that will give us an idea of the to stand the taste for this what we did is we did first of all percent solids we blend it off to all of our tomatoes we wait it in fresh and then and dry and then all the rest of the blended material we flipped filter it and then we collected an essay tube we took took an illiquid of it and we put it into a refractometer we did the same for the ph meter we took the sample from here we calibrate the ph meter and we took the reading their effect ometer it's telling us 12 volt soluble solids for the organoleptic survey we gather 31 volunteers for the first harvest 24 volunteers for the second harvest and we asked them to grade the tomatoes according to pour faire or good for three components for skin thickness for sweetness and for general flavor we ended up with 10 samples per volunteer because we had five cultivars in we had both salinity levels of 1.5 in 4.0 this is humans okay the results that we acquire work four percent so let's pH GCC and Jurgen elliptic surveys or asphalt for all the cultivars when they are grown under salinity the percent solids increased and the Kota water tends to be more susceptible for the percent solids to increase is cultivar 1335 and the cultivar that is less acceptable scoot over 220 for nap but nevertheless the cultivar that has the highest percent solid again it's a stripe cultivar 22 all six in the cultivar that has the less percent solid is cultivate 1335 and the pH in the TCC we didn't see any effect not in the interaction and not on the salinity effect inner and the cultivar effect neither for the April harvest and the TCC and either for the Maine harvest and LA and the pH but we put the results as you can see that the values were in the average of 4.2 for the pH in 64 the TCC for the organ elective survey while we saw is from the consumers point of view the cultivar for which it matters the most if Ukraine and shalini two are not salinity is going to recruit about 1 335 in the cut over the matters are less where you grow is going to be cool to vote DCR 522 in terms of skin thickness the cut about the health a lower skin thickness was cooked over 220 for include over to 206 and the cultivar that even though it didn't matter where you grow it naturally already had a tougher skin was cultivar DC or 522 in terms of sweetness we saw that the cutter but that doesn't matter where you grow as cultivar 1335 and the cultivator it's the more susceptible is cultivar 2204 and in the indogene or flavor what we saw is that the cultivar that it's more susceptible is going to be cultivar 2204 in the cultivator is going to be less than set to its general flavor it's going to be good about 1 335 but overall the cultivar that the consumers prefer the most was cool to wear this year 522 even though it had the higher value of skin thickness so we took or or tomatoes and we wanted to analyze them in the microscope to see the structure of the cells in the composition then we did two methodologies light microscopy in diamond microwave spectroscopy the first we wanted to see composition and morphology of the cells so what we wanted to aim for with light microscopy is that we will take a section of the tomato cube and we were able to have cuticle and we will have a soup epidermal layer here which is composed by smaller cells in the cells in the petticoat and I have to make it really clear that the peeled is going to be confirmed by two components by the cuticle and by the soup epidemic layers here and then the pericarp is something else what we did is that we took a tomato coupe around 0.5 centimeters cube and we put it into a solution for a percent butter from butter from how they I shall aid in PVC buffer PVCs phosphate-buffered sign and we vacuum for 30 minutes so the solution booked into the cells and then we shake it for an hour and then we put it 44 degrees Celsius for 24 hours in the refrigerator we came the day after we wash off the PFA we put a solution a 50-percent pick for 22 hours we wash it off we put us a solution at one hundred percent paid for 24 hours and then we put it in the fridge so that pig will become solid once the pig the pig became solid with our tomatoes cube cube inside it becomes something like this when we take it off of the vessels so with this instrument here it's a micro tone we cut sections of 10 micrometers and sections of 30 micrometers the sections of 10 micrometers we're stayin in with methylene blue all the sections for the same time of 10 minutes we wash it off and we cover the slices that's the sections of 30 micrometers we took them to dremel microwave spectroscopy and we didn't stain them we just watch the pick off and then we close our slices so while we did get with light microscopy we did hit our sample with cuticle with soup epidermal layer and with petticoat but we also wanted to kill one touches that were allowed us to evaluate differences between cultivars this is one cultivar another cultivar in the third cultivar the cultivars the way valuator went worth 1335 DCR 522 in four six eight eight eight four six zero zero eight and we wanted to see solidity effect and non salinity in effect so once we have our mom touches with we fixed an area and then with imagej we measure the cuticle area only meaning the green park here and the results that we can with light microscopy was as follows okay so methylene blue stain screen for lipids we can see your cuticle we have an external cuticle layer then we had an internal cuticle layer we had the soup epidermal layer here composed by smaller cells straight underneath the cuticle we had an epidemic of cell here and we had our petty carp and lipids screen meaning the cuticle and cellulose in stains for blue higher concentration of settlers was stained darker blue in terms of the area when we measure with image G what we thought there were not differences the differences were really we're really insignificant as compared to the sign treatments but let's remember that the peel is not just composed by the green part of the cuticle it's also composed by the soup epidermal layers and in the soup epidermal layers we saw tremendous differences for example if we go the cultivars under non cell stress conditions we will only have two layers of soup epidemic oh here's one accuse the second one and if we go to salinity will have 1 2 3 up to four layers and this was repeated in all the cultivars this was for this year 522 we can see like their sub 1 and 2 super epidemic layers and here we have one two three maybe four super polemical layers under salt in non such stress condition it also repeated for the other cultivar you have 12 layers here when you have here 1 2 3 super polemical layers and then the pity carp stars so then we took our samples to ramon microspectroscopy and we wanted to see the different composition based on the ramen shift peak the ramen microspectroscopy is a technique that what it does is like we not inject we sent a laser energy to our sample in any component in nature has these molecules that have bonds when the bonds observe the energy they will be excited and they will go to a virtual energy stage then they will return but not all the molecules which not all that energy returns only 1% of it won't and determine what it does it averages this one percent and it reflects speaks for different components in nature at a certain time and shift value so what the results that we got is that here was our example we aim or laser as I forgot to explain this part here this was or settings for the raman we had it to practice the see what were the best setting or ramen reaching for the components that we were evaluated was 1200 that time of exposure that the laser is open under sample worse 0.2 seconds it was 10 times the laser was reflected in our samples at only ten percent of the total potential energy that the laser can emit so in the cuticle we had two major peaks and then we go to determine ramen data database and we saw that these two peaks are representing cutie then we went to the soup epidermal layer and we see that we got packed in here and cellulose here and then we went to that from here we went to the pericarp and in the pericarp we saw only settle those no more pectin and then it we average them all without making the differences between 1.0 in 1.5 in 4.0 because we didn't see any difference in intensity here so we saw differences in composition in between the layers but not in between the treatments for our discussion so we ended up with objective test with sensory analysis and with micro structural analysis in the objective test we had smaller fruits grown under we grow the consumers under salinity stress but with higher percent solids and we can explain this like as follows or differences were around twenty-five percent the literature says that we shouldn't be getting these differences only we will be working with disease humans around eight and we were working with four but it also says that the asylum intake it's or round it reduces in twenty five percent and the phloem fluxes into the fruit reduces in ninety ninety percent nine percent daily the fruit transpiration will increase around thirty percent and all of this will bring us less weight of thirty percent pure organ which is more close to what we were we had and then if we are reducing the phloem under such stress conditions we are reducing the fruit size and then if we're reducing the fruit size we're going to increase the sugar concentration and we're going to increase also the salt concentrations therefore we are going to end up with smaller foods but with higher percent solids which was what the situation that we had at the end then why did we had higher values of dry pure grade and why was it was it tougher to penetrate the pill under such stress conditions there are studies that but only on seeds and tomato seeds that under such stress conditions the test of the seeds accumulates shooting and trichome density and if the cells accumulate cutin they're going to become bigger stronger and heavier so the force required to penetrate them will also be higher in the microscopic microscopic observations other we did see the cute thing we saw the the pectin and we saw the cellulose we think I'll come back this to this that the main problem was this part here that we hit three different points and we didn't we didn't actually like measure a gradient in the ramen is capable of doing it it can measure the whole thing and give us and even give us a map but because of matter of time we didn't do this so therefore we didn't we were we didn't get any differences in terms of composition okay in the morphology that we saw with light microscopy is that we didn't see any differences in the cuticle area but again the pills notice the cuticle is also the soup epidermal layer in the super pa'dar michael layer i presented really few pictures before so i wanted to repeat them here the top pictures are non salt stress conditions and the bottom pictures are salt stress conditions and you can see that the intensity of the cellulose here it's thinner than the intensity here there are less layers all the time under nonsense stress conditions and we have more layers here with sauce so we do believe that there is a differences in inside and not just in cellulose concentration underneath back of the cuticle but the toughness is based here okay so just to put it all together we decided to start with which ones were the cultivars that the consumers like them work okay so they like more 1335 in this year 522 the problem is that these cultivars are the ones are most effective or more susceptible for the for the pure thickness and even this year it's the thicker the one that has a thicker pure from the consumers point of view and this was reflected in the light microscopy because they have up to 4 into 5 soup epidermal layers when they are grown under such stress conditions and we will suggest that these two cultivars will be the ones that will be further study to improve their salinity and susceptibility our conclusion would be that all the changes that in induciton tomato from fruit texture under such stress were originated from thickening the peeled but not in the composition and as conclusion we will accept our hypothesis that high salinity conditions do induce undesirable changes in fruit and improve skin texture affecting its quality and thank you and thank you all the persons from my lab because they were really patient with me yeah I was ready to teach hi was a beautiful presentation just because I'm thinking about now with their eyes presentation because he showed that there are some genes that can have like first can have a good oh okay can have a good trait and then the same can have a bad trait so that your conclusion like was consistent with all your results like all the ones that are exposed to this salinity and they had an undesirable Chinese Arab and the conclude the thing you concluded that salinity stress yes it causes undesirable changes mm-hmm will the character the same in resistant and susceptible varieties or what it for all for all of what we saw that for all the varieties I just find out that was the one more susceptible and less acceptable but for other priorities we had undesirable changes in all of them in all the effects were significant means the trend will be same even it is susceptible or resistant it doesn't matter well we don't we we don't have a background that we can say okay we think this cultivars are resistant we just wanted to evaluate and we don't we didn't know if they were actually resisting or not resistant I would like to know if you observe the day load of the tomatoes in a greenhouse know what the yield of the tomato in the greenhouse thank you deild ah no we didn't observe the yield day in the mat- date they do have records of the whole year plot in that computer i show you in the beginning right in the beginning but we just took five clusters pure sample they they have records of the whole thing oh it's too bad here you see we had the whole plot like let's say from here to here and we collected all the marketable clusters anyway and we put it into this beans and we did record the yield of the plot but we didn't for four studies we didn't use the whole yield but we only used the average weight of 25 tomatoes from five clusters of the plot okay my question is like I wanted to know how the Yad it looks like in the high salinity conditions that's what I wanted to find out but since he said he didn't do it well the literature says that if you're working with a tsetse means you're going to start to have thirty percent decrease in yield I have hot that the tomatillo under cilenti stress has more sweeter taste than the tomato under normal water condition do you know the reason why is it and if you did you notice the difference in tss content between the yeah we're here with your analytic tests we saw was sweeter and also with the percent solids we saw it was sweet the percent solid is the percent soul is in the total votes TCC total soluble solids it's an indicator it's actually indicated of sugars so it it increases because you have less water in that in the fruit so you have more concentration of the sugar and you have more concentration also of the whole percent solids one question if I get right or not if we grow tomato on the normal litigation and under the saline then the peel thickness will be higher in this salon innovation can we generalize it for the other tomato varieties also can we generalize this I I didn't find in these studies that were relate to the field for the remarkable tomato for the big tomato but it's only it's only seen in seeds that it does in verse in the seed but not not on the pill not cycling on the fielders because all the studies are based on the and the good things that suddenly d does for quality but not under under the oil changes okay other questions emd look on the local to the structure of the little might be some people is preferred in the texture to look on the structure of the locals and locals to TLC locals is the internal part of the surgery you know which is stained for for the cell wall with a chemical that we use methylene blue it only stays for four cell wall composition in this case cellulose and for the lipid composition for that cuticle composition that was live as we didn't stay informed so this text skiing you consider it as as but like a bad trait rather than because some people is may appreciate to have a thick skin which can which can for example yeah for shelf life even when they are growing in high water content they can be cracked with a short span of time so it will have that might be good like you said probably to have a thicker cuticle 44 process it tomatoes for pick tomatoes but for sure tomatoes that's not a tray that you would like to have and you can see it in their gonna let take survey results they def consumes don't like to have a I take a pill you use for teasing day Simon parameters stress right yeah what is I mean what was your best to use that one that's what the research that's what the research hadn't said 1.5 in 4.0 and I guess it through the time they were they were think that the because these bellies for the water that with 4.0 you will be accumulating the salt and the soiled afterwards okay I mean this wonder you get the concentration the concentration of sanity in derogation whether they're in the nature go yet that's the concentration of the salt they were irrigating with 4.0 derogation what about this one no I don't have I don't know the value of that the normal irrigation water in the in the station I don't know maybe had you been using different rates of sanity concentration I mean maybe yeah it can be possible to have it would be good to evaluate different salinity levels rather dangerous 1.5 in 4.0 until the nickel the microphone moves to the other corner of the room let me ask you something as I understand with the ramen you just identified qualitatively what is the major compound in each in each layer right yes but we could also done it to quantify so it can be quantified yeah however in your conclusion you said that the that the composition did not change only the number of layers changed no I said he had a composition in the layers under layers from 1.0 in rockland 5 didn't change in each specific layer only in between layers that we had for example cutin that we didn't have in the pericarp and we had packed in that we didn't have in the in the cuticle only one in the path between the Father the 1.5 and the for the different salinity levels you say that there was no let's a qualitative different in in the in the major compound but yet was there a difference in the amount of pectin deposited or any other compound there we saw there were not differences between 1.5 and 4.0 let's say for cellulose and then there were no differences in ok for the cuticle and 1.5 in 4.0 there were no differences for the cuticle concentration understand and then for the soup epidermal layer for 1.5 in 4.0 we didn't see any differences in concentration for cellulose imperfective and then for pericarp we didn't see any difference in concentration in settlers for 1.5 and 4.0 what do you mean by concentration I don't want to color concentration because it's not a commission of concentration but it's a measure of intensity all right but you did show some difference in intensity at least in the cuticle know it's different components for each one of them let me put you see this one here the blue one represents the the cuticle and it only has q-tip and then we have the second one that it's the super political layer the red one and it has affected it in half cellulose and in the pericarp only has cellulose what we saw we did have the spectrum where they had different spectral for example for Cutie for cuticle for Tooting for 1.5 and we had a different spectrum for for the for the same component in the cuticle but we didn't see any difference in intensity for example here we have two maybe you're confused because we see two pics here but they're both representing bonds in the molecule routine but still work what are the differences between the treatments I mean in this respect you say that you saw the same pigs however mm-hmm pick represent you the pic represents the quantity or only the quality it identifies what what compound is there if you decide that the pics are similar like let's say is I didn't graphic let's say for example the right of the green let's say that the red will be 1.5 and that the green will be 4.0 and then you have these different securities desta here in intensity if you decide that the peak length is the same you are sure that that peak is representing to cellulose therefore you can compare the Delta in terms of intensity for cellulose so we can say okay so let me find out in this respect in comparison be window one and the 1.5 region saw that yesterday okay that's what we were discussing yesterday that in the 1.5 we have a lot of fluorescence in the sample so we're not sure that we're making is the same sac bonds for cellulose so that's what we didn't wanted to make assumption that there were differences between 1.5 and 4.0 okay so you are you still don't have you're not sure about it yeah I don't want to make any assumption because we're not sure but we will see okay the Sun a little about how the a very solitary who you used affected the nutritional level let's say vitamin C that is if you are looking at those components the vitamin C did you also look at how they the various sanity level affected the nutritional components of that we did we didn't measure any nutritional facts like level of antioxidants or stuff like that but I will assume that it will increase the concentration of any for example vitamin c you and any other component will increase the concentration because it has less water on the fruit believe we have a few minutes for our last question during there is any okay if not we will thank me for the sake of those that may be watching us on the web we will wait three to four minutes until we will start with the next presentation okay eliska rifka rifka cobalt office please some way up or she who leads a mature adult la Nova low etot much more medium alright so we shall move on to the next presentation that will be presented by a pact Wesa Bordeaux from Ghana epic we see has completed his first degree BSC in agricultural technology at the University for developmental development studies in Ghana and he's currently a MSC student in our international program here at the Hebrew University where is that here it is and parkway see will present us his seminar on the influence of hot water rinsing and brushing on tomatoes internal and external quality please thank you very much my name is Park we see bottle as props around I introduced and the title of my presentation is the influence of hot water rinsing impression on tomatoes internal and external quality this experiment was done at the department of possible science in the agricultural research organization and a vocalist center under the supervision of professor Elizabeth Lake unfortunately he is not here so he has sent someone to sit in for him a person of Chaco and the order of presentation is as follows I'm going to look at the introduction the objectives materials and methods results and discussion and conclusion now as part of the introduction most harvester commodities need to be free of disease insects synthetic chemicals and clean before they are packaged and exported now thus accessibility of fresh harvested commit produce to post harbors disease increases during prolonged storage and this disease may be as a result of physiological and pathological deterioration and as it stands now there is no post-harvest fungus that have been registered for the control of decay Kosan agent in tomatoes now even though there are other land chemical technologies which are also used to control decay Kosan agent and also prolong the shelf life of tomatoes some technologies like i said earlier have been developed and some of which include irrigation the use of materials that are generally regarded as safe grass for shot we have hyper hyperbaric treatment or modified atmosphere packaging now all these treatments are non-chemical and they have also proven to be a very good method or technology to control decay in tomatoes however his treatment happens to be one of the promising means for post harvest control of decay as has been discussed by koi and lure in nineteen nineteen eighty nine nineteen ninety-eight sorry now he treatment like i said earlier on may be applied not only to fruit but also to vegetables using hot water dip vapor heat hot dry air and then hot water rinsing impression of which my research was all about now some of the benefits of using this technology is that is very easy to use and the treatment time of washing the fruit is very short and aside that also is less reliable monitoring of fruit and the water temperature as well as very effective and efficient in killing of skin bone Nikki Kosan agent which are mostly found on the skin or the peel of the fruits now laureate online tonight is the optimal temperature to treat food before storage at 12 and the recommended storage temperature of toronto since 12 can't maintain the quality parameters by reducing decay incidence chilling injury now to support this claim research has been done over the years by falak eater 93 2001 and 2002 and in this research tomatoes were supposed to a temperature of ted eight degrees sessions for three days and in another experiment also this technology was also used where the tomatoes were washed at a temperature of 52 for 15 seconds proud to storage but after storage didn't notice that that was decay decay involvement was inhibited without affecting the fruit quality and other parameters and apart from eliminating certain physiological disorders which I've mentioned alone like decay and children injury the heat treatment also maintains and improve the antioxidant defenses I must also say that the 212 have a lot of antioxidants in it like vitamin C carotenoids to mention but a few but paramount among them is a vitamin C and in an experiment which was done by coil it out two thousand and says when he treatment was used for mushroom Roach shiitake mushroom let induce a do this and at that 100 degrees and 10 20 for 15 and 30 minutes using ultra clearly for storage they did realize or they observed that the antioxidant activity was maintained and improved so in this experiment we also wanted to find out that at what temperature that if we wash the fruit and at what maturity stage that if we harvest the fruit before storing and at which storage temperature can maintain this internal this qualities that we are talking of as well as inhibiting decay and chilling injury so the objective of this study was to determine the influence of hot water insulin brushing on tomato solanum lycopersicum which is also called boom is going to milk the external and internal parameters of vitamin C and the total and absolute activity which is what we are most interested in because the two types of the activity a window has been done in tomatoes but not with this technology so this is the first time that this technology has been used to determine the total and obstinate activity in tomatoes after prolonged storage and marketing simulation now to achieve this objective we help this methodology now the tomato fruit was harvested at two stages as you can see matured green and pink so whenever you see pink is just a revision of my short name PK without effects and the fruit were harvested every three weeks for three to four months and this experiment was repeated three times from commercial nine hitter plastic house in the central region of Israel now what we were looking at is that wanted to look at how these dead heat treatments like I said in my introduction is able to influence a week article and a tray the external the internal qualities and the nutritional level for the external we're looking at the weight loss firmness and color as well as decay incidents and then the internal quality were looking at that titratable acidity that steer for short and then the TSS which the total soluble solids and then the nutritional compound may need vitamin C and antioxidant activity along the growing season now before the heat treatment the fruit was sorted out according to uniform color and size for the pink and then for the matured grades much obvious because the Green is green you can easily see so the green was sorted out according to its size and then the fruit calyx were all removed now the temperature that we use for our treatment was rewarded fruit at 51 and at 55 for 15 seconds whilst the 22 sep our control 22 is the temperature for Muslim for tap water so one time to see if we use tap water in relation to the heat treatment watch every day the effect that after the heat treatment the fruits were then stored at two separate temperatures that is for both pink and white shirt green at five degrees centigrade and at 12 degrees centigrade for three weeks plus three days of shelf life and the emphasis of this was a simulation of sea transport to Europe and marketing so in total we had 12 treatment and each treatment consisted of 25 fruit now this is just a schematic diagram of the machine and as you can see the first column you see as the conveyor the fruit are kept here they are conveyed into the watch the washing chamber the first chamber is for the control and the third chamber is for the treatment the heat treatment that we want to look at now when this one is an operation this one is shut down so that it doesn't have effects on the treatment and in the heat treatment section you can see at the bottom here we have the hot water container so this pump recycles the hot water and the worst though the fruit are washed as they move along this conveyor now this where black round things you see other brushes they are very soft so as the the the fruits move along they are brushed gently and it will have any effects on the fruit then the other conveyed to the dryer and they dried approximately at 22 degrees so shows for some few minutes three seconds and then we are separated or sorted out according to the storage temperature that we want so this picture here you see it is a clip which of the machine as you can see that is me and doing my own thing that is the washing chamber this one is for the control and this one is for the heat to iterate and as you can see the fruit are moving gently and this work the water drops on it it's reigns's it is brushing it and that's how the name of the machine is it rains and it is what it is brushing so that is the name of the idea behind this technology and then this is the dryer and so from here it goes the dryer and then it dries it now after the heat treatment we like i said earlier have to take all the parameters now the parameters has to be taking such a way that we had to destroy the fruit at a point in time so we had a destructive and in a non destructive and the non-destructive basically has to do the sternal qualities so we look at the weight loss like I said any other feminist the color and then the decay and for weight loss firmness color we used nine fruits represented the nine replications and then for the decay we took into consideration all the 25 fruits now the weight loss was measured using the satirist electronic scale and that is it over here and it was completed at the percentage witness from the initial weight and then the firmness was measured using the durometer and as a durometer and the durometer has no fiscal unit their values were a betrayal numbers so they hired the value they hire the famous and the smaller the validate the lower the firmness of the fruits and then the color was Maria using the minolta Kumar meter higher values means higher inhibit of color and lower values means the mission is very small we look at this one week I discussed the results beta and then the decay we considered fruit as decade when we saw a mycelium that is after we've taken them from storage and for the decayed a replication was based on the number of experiments but for each treatment we covered a percentage decay out of 25 fruits ok so we have the internal policies or internal politics we have nine replicates from the external and then for TSS we had nine replications the TA also we have nine replications the TSS was measured the digital multimeters we can see and then the Tia was measured using the automatic hydrometer and the TA was expressed as a percentage of citric acid now for the nutritional compound that is for vitamin C and the antioxidant activity we had that assess treatment now that assists treatment was used for the vitamin C so that tells this treatment represented at statuses replicate and the vitamin C in this case which is an antioxidant in tomatoes was expressed as the ascorbic acid content in the fruit using the ascorbic acid kid test from hanna instruments and then the antioxidant activity was determined using DP ph solution actually it is a freshly prepared diluted dppe solution and with this method we had 180 replications and each replications were put in this as well I'll call the cavity so they were put in this scarlet 180 of them and prepared for the spectrometer the ultra 2001 spectrophotometer sorry and based on that we have a data sheet which was generated and we use this formula to calculate the percentage of inhibition to determine the antioxidant activity as was described by a bellaca etl 2010 now my analysis was performed according to factorial design using the jump 8 and significance was done at 0.05 percent significance and i use muslim microsoft excel to draw my graphs by the data the tables presented in this presentation was presented using the f valves i use the evidence to present alright so now let's look at the results now the first result is the decay incidence and as we can see in the decay incidence the heat treatment at 51 and at 55 inhibited chilling injury at five because that's injury and at 12 we noticed that there wasn't any decay in both pink and my short green but when we come to 12 you notice that the pink fruit decayed some of them decayed and there is in we can see from this picture here that at five this is the the pink and this is the matured green fruit and at five visitor control there was decay in the pink and then decay also started developing in the matured green then also if we look at 12s Ebola situation happened this is the pink and then this is the matured green and then at 55 we also had a similar situation and this decay was actually due to the heat damage because this temperature was very high so we believe that because of the high temperature it might have resulted in two I mean the decay at this temperature so in general we can say that these two hits treatment at 51 and not 55 significantly inhibited decay incidents but it was more pronounced as you can see in 50 1055 for both maturity stage of the fruit and the reason why we find the inhibition for the decay was that in a resolute was done in grapefruits they notice that the pathogenesis related protein which are found on the skin of the fruit the thermal or the heat treatment induced this proteins so they were able to sell as a defense organ defense for the fruit to fight these pathogens all right now the next slide is the weight loss and for the weight loss we never had any interaction between the heat treatment the maturity stage and storage temperature but we noticed that there was interaction between the maturity stage and the temperature and as you can see at five when the food was taught at five you notice that the matured green lost weight even though there were no significant and then at twelve will notice that except in their control but at twelve we notice that they the matured being lost weight more than the cake whereas in the other one is the other way around so we can see from this data that this to his treatment even though there wasn't any significant difference between the heat treatment on the maturity stage and after storage we believe that this heat treatment were able to reduce the weight loss as you can see at five at five and then at twelve you can see but in the control at five dollars too much weight loss over here and then for the firmness we didn't have any interaction between the heat treatment the story temperature and the maturity stage sorry between the heat treatment and a story temperature battle was signal effect of the maturity stage and as you can see at five the story temperature had a significant effect sorry had similar effect and at five most of the fruit considered a the food to a much firmer at five both in pink and then in the matured green and then the pink fruit sorry the matured green was much firmer than the pink fruit lettuce after storage in all the temperatures and it will look carefully when we did a student teachers way we notice even though there's no significant difference of the heat treatment we notice that these two treatment somehow was able to maintain the feminist of the food that is at 51 and then at 55 but the recommender story temperature like I presented in my introduction as 12 and as you can see in 12 the pink the pin you can see here was the same but in 51 and 55 it was much higher and we think that this heat treatment was able to maintain the firmness and then for the color we also noticed that for the color the heat treatment the maturity stage and the story temperature had significant effect on McCulloh there wasn't any interaction and if you look at the chart here you'll notice that at five there was significant inhibition of color especially in the matured green whereas for the pink they ripe it normally and if you look at at 12 both pink and then the matured green at this story temperature they ripened normally but the inhibition of color was more pronounced in the mercial being especially at this temperature at five the researchers so we can say that these two heat treatment that is 51 and 55 significantly inhibited the color and then it was much pronounced at 51 absorb at 55 done at 51 in day in the color now when we look at the tss the total soluble solid where did I also have any three-way interactions but we noticed that the maturity stage of fruit the pink had a high TSS the ping had a very high TSS as you can see after storage at 512 and the interaction was that at 12 at five degrees you can see that even with this heat treatment the tss was very high and pink as well as in the heat treatment and then r12 also the tss was a little bit low and each of the treatment now if we come to the control we will realize that they the tss was very very high and the reason being that at this stage most of the fruit ripened and the tears has mostly increases according to the ripening process us as be shown by the color development and if we look at the vitamin C also the vitamin C the heat treatment didn't have any significant effect on the vitamin C and the maturity stage had significant effect on the vitamin C by the story temperature we didn t see any significant effect so you can see in the graph that this treatment this heat treatment when improved the vitamin C at five and it was also vitamin C was also improved at five for the the control so we can see here that the pink food were much having a higher vitamin C as compared to the matured agree now for the antioxidant activity we also notice that the heat treatment the maturity stage of the fruit and the storage temperature also had effect on the antioxidant activity but most importantly we notice that most of the heat treated food even though there was any significant difference but most of the heat treated fruit had a higher and outland activity especially at this storage temperature which of course was not different from in the control at 12 but in the decay we noticed that there was decay in the control at 12 and there was some decay also at five so if we are considering what type of treatment you want to use I mean which treatment is better or something like this then we will consider this to his treatment sense here the wallet any form of decay or any chilling injury so in the act of the activity this heat treatment was able to maintain or improve the antioxidant activity alright so this is just the table of what I have presented in most of the graphs and in the weight loss we didn't see any significant effect of the heat treatment we didn't see any effect of the maturity stage we didn't see any single bit of the story temperature by that was interaction between the maturity stage and the temperature and when we come to the firmness the heat treatment do they have any significant effect but the maturity stage and the storage temperature had significant effect on the feminists and when we come to the color these three main effect had significant effect on the color and we saw some interaction as i showed in the graph not the maturity stage and the temperature there was significant interaction and for the decay we also saw as a significant effect of the heat treatment on decay we also saw significant effect of the maturity stage on the decay and if we look at the TSS the TA vitamin C and then the antioxidant activity also is the heat treatment hard effects the maturity stage also had a significant effect and we'll also had an interaction as significant interaction between the heat treatment and the storage temperature but we didn't find any significant effect of the heat treatment the maturity stage on ta and there wasn't any interaction for the the TA and why we come to the vitamin C also the heat treat when they have any significant effect but the maturity stage has signifer on vitamin C whereas in the anti other activity heat maturity stage and the storage temperature heart if it and there wasn't any interaction whatsoever so in my conclusion a combined and optimal hot water is an impression at this temperature of tomato especially at the thing stage and after storage plus three days of shelf life at this temperature maintain the keeping quality started the TSS vitamin C and then the antioxidant activity now in literature we notice that the TSS the color had some quads correlation in the sense that as a fruit ripened the total soluble solids also increases but if the fruit that ripens so much it also have some effect also on the total soluble solid and the vitamin C and the antioxidant activity we notice some kind of correlation even though I didn't put it but it wasn't when something that was so much interested in about the correlation but we noticed that as the vitamin C increase because the vitamin C initial is an antioxidant so when the vitamin C was increased especially the heat treatment at this we also noticed that the antioxidant activity also increased and especially at this temperature or that temperature we also noticed this his treatment maintain the firmness of the fruit even though the majority was much firmer after storage at this and this heat treatment also maintained a ripening process of the fruit as well as for the mature green and most of the fruit work the pink ed marshall-green d rapid normally at this storage temperature as was shown by the color developments in the graphs that mean the day the graphs that I should also we believe that this its treatment significantly inhibit decay incidence after storage at 12 and then was able to reduce chilling injury now the reduction in chilling injury is that with chili injury research has shown that in the pills of the fruits there is a protein that's the heat shock protein and the thermal stress induces this protein and that makes it become sort of able to resist or Google to become resistant to Chile injury especially at very low temperatures so we think that this technology should also be explored on a broader range of fresh harvested commodities for minimally processed product since it reduces the risk of health problems due to the fact that the Twitter fluid are devoid of chemicals because as you can see in this treatment with reuse any chemicals we only used the water to wash the food so we think that it should be explode not all in tomatoes but in other commodities and then finally we also think that the enhancements of the fruit tolerance to low temperature by reducing chilling injury or by a handsome fruit resistance to decay cause an agent who allowed prolonged storage at temperatures which are lower than currently use and this will increase the possibility of some commodities to be exported by less sea transport rather than by a transport thank you we are ready to take questions thank you for your presentation that that was then nice one my question is do I want to know the importance of the removal of the colors because somewhere in the materials and methods it was mentioned that the colors of the fruit was removed before the treatment okay and I afraid somewhere or less than that the colors they prolong the shelf life of the optic fruits but in this treatment it's also remove the ones you know if there is a special reason for that okay and I'll explain it using this a machine the colors was removed because when the fruit are being rude on the rushes over here we don't want a situation whereby it will get stuck in the brushes or better still because it's as sharp the colors is pointed so if the row on the brushes there is a tendency that the colors can even destroy the skin of the other fruits so to avoid that that is why we remove the fruit calyces for this treatment hey it's in your first graph for real results it shows that at 55 cells you said that temperature was high enough to give a injury for the pink when but not to the mature green yes and they have an idea riser yeah well I I think that at this temperature and the pink of course was soon as susceptible to the heat damage that caused the decay and the matured green of course we didn't see any decay and literature has shown that in the skin of the fruit or the peel there's this part of the nurses related protein like I tennis which one induced by thermal stress okay can help to prevent any pathogen attack so I well we think that this was more expressed that this Jane which was responsible for producing this protein was more expressed in the matured green than in in the pink and so the heat treat treatment will of course more expression of dungeon in the appeal to be able to induce the decay in the mature green done in the in the pink okay do you have any explanation or can you speculate on how this hot water treatment enhances a chilling resistance or tolerance in the fruit okay and for chili injury some researchers have been done previously end at 51 and at 52 it's it it's able to inhibit chilling injury but above below sorry below when you watch your foot as 22 we notice here that the Taoist a son became which is due to the injury and the reason why we didn't have any injury at five children you at five is that there's a protein that's a heat shock protein in the fruit which when expressed as a result of the thermal treatment is able to inhibit the injury especially at this temperature so we believe that the camel condition or the heat treatment probably would have induced this Jane which is responsible for inhibiting chillin you to be expressed more at he treated fruit a Zulu to inhibit the children injury thank you now why is important to include 51 and 55 I don't know I don't know Stan why maybe either of these two temperature may be enough to taste this experiment you have a long gap between maybe you consider 22sec control and you have 51 and 55 I think in most of your data there was more or less there was no significant difference between the two right so I don't know why you include 55 and 51 okay and with previous research that has been done and from literature when footwear washed about 55 of about 55 we saw decay but in some food some varieties of tomatoes there was a habitual of injury and in some variety there wasn't any ambition of injury and we chose 55 and 51 as our heat treatment because 52 53 has been done so we also wanted to see that at this temperature is it also possible to inhibit the decay incidents as well as heritage chilling injury so that is why we chose so the idea re-watch this route at 51 and not 55 that's when we washed it but in my materials and methods I mentioned that falak it also did a similar experiment but it wasn't at 51 it was at 52 so 51 plus or minus two will not have any would be able to inhibit decay and chilling injury but something about 50 50 50 50 of course can inhibit chilling injury but decay it can cause decay due to hit damage and the reason why we use 22 is that of course most of us will go to the supermarket to buy fruits or the tomatoes we watch them with tap water and we assume that approximately the tap water is around two to the researcher so by using this study temperature you want to see if you wash your fruit with tap water and then you put it in your fridge for some time what is going to happen after a very long storage so their rationale behind the 22 is we want to hedge it at using tap water if you want to store your that's fine 22 is fine but 51 and 55 is not convincing to use as a separate treatment but Gary is convincing because if you look at of course in the other parameters we noticed that there were no significant differences and all that but in the decay and I have shown in the excuse me here of course we wasn't any significant difference in weight loss that wasn't the heat treatment but if we look at the color there was one method a student t-test we noticed that there was significant difference between the heat treatment between the heat treatment one color and then he/she was much higher at 55 then I 51 and one thing we should know is that color also play very important role in the ripening because as fruits ripen the change color so the color is an indication to tell us whether the fruit is ripening and what is deteriorating very fast so if we able to inhibit color at a certain temperature range me that we can prolong the shelf life of the fruits and the heat treatment was able to do that for us especially do it matured green dining day in the pic ok thank you I don't know if I'm understanding right the de Graaff by you're saying that for 22 degree for 22 degrees after you start storch them at 512 the fruits lost more weight at five yes why would the fruit and I think it is it over listen other than why were they lose more weight under lower temperatures it's supposed to be that they were in lose weight at lower temperatures okay and with let me start with the heat treatment at 51 and at 55 you know I 55 when when you wash the fruit at this temperature you see if we didn't do that but if we are ticket and microscopic image of the peel of the fruit you see some layer of wax around the peel so this works at this temperature was able to seal the visible openings on the pill so that would have accounted for some reduction in this heat treatment but of course here there wasn't any crystallization of the works around the peel other factors who also contribute to weight loss not only the wax like the frequent opening of the because we did it in a storage room where people were also keeping the fruit in order to opening and closing of the storage room can also change the atmospheric condition I mean temperature relative humidity and all that so doc would have also been a reason but here we're looking at how this heat treatment was able to do the trick and we notice that this recrystallization of some walks around the peel which sealed the visible opening so room to reduce the firmness and it was the same thing in the weight loss weight loss and they reminisce other questions guys okay if so let us thing and again as yesterday due to the mistake in the timetable we shall have a longer coffee break and then we shall convene back for the last presentation of this webinar by our bow by our guest lecture appears alumni guest lecturer okay so we shall convene at the 335", "oPcQs0-r2_k": "[Music] what I've got here this is a butt of something called cherry punch and it's from the care company and we've been looking to try new things from the Cure company and I found this at the cannabis cafe down on La Brea and it was I was down there with some friends and I picked out three flowers and this is one of the three this flower has 20% THC and as I went through those menus I really picked this because I want to try more flowers from a cure company cure company did marathon OG and that's a top ten flower in LA Nipsey Hussle wouldn't be proud if he was around that flower is all that just fantastic but today this is about cherry punch from the Cure company and you can see that it comes in this jar and it says cherry punch hybrid and care company exclusive and also it comes a nice gift box if you wanted to give it to someone that has all the information on it says all the THC amount and this flower has 20% THC but we know it's not all about the THC sometimes a 20% flower can just knock you on your socks and run some of those have 22% in there just to kill her but today it's about a cherry punch and you can see I've got it set to 3:30 I've got a bunch of vape in the straw so let's check out cherry punch by cure company so this is one sweet flower if you like sweet this is almost so sweet anyone would like this it's not over sweet for me you know a lot of the flavor flowers have an orange it's too orange this one I would say it's sweet like a cherry it's really sweet and this flower strong too and it's got a nice clear head and it's a cruiser and I like this flower and I'm giving this flower and 865 it didn't quite make the 9 but I'm recommending cherry punch if you want to try the Cure company cherry punches a winner this is the doctor if you want to see vapour cup you can see it on paper cup calm I'm telling you if you get this item you will just be so satisfied everyone that gets it spills like that they're like it's a game changer and it is this is game-changing technology it's like going from alcohol to a glass of wine it's smooth and silky and delicious if you like the videos please subscribe party on my friends [Music]", "P714TKVmQ9I": "what's good mystic genetics no one left behind DMV in the building we're here doing well we have our little v12 twisty glass pipes here that we're selling on no one left behind DMV you can get these for 10 bucks and all the proceeds go to our charity program where we're helping homeless people out our younger generation and that our older people got some other stuff over there too and as we get the products in we'll be running a test don't we'll let you know how they're working but today we're about to actually get down on some of this black cherry punch x jelly breath from in-house genetics and then we got our cali connection i limp punch with it which is gorilla glue four times purple punch got some faraway shots let's go ahead and get a close-up on them we got I don't know about a gram and a half or two about to smoke that [ __ ] up in this paper let's go alright so what we're looking at right here is that black cherry punch x jelly breath BX from in-house genetics I'm not in love with the bud structure but she has a very sweet smell very pungent and she tastes just like she smells I mean I definitely recommend you getting this or in-house genetics period very good [ __ ] right here I give this I don't know I mean based on looks alone I would give it I don't know maybe a 6 or 7 but this is not even dialed in and this is not even like the pheno that you would absolutely keep this is just something that you would grow and it's good enough for whatever you need it for pretty much you know I mean now take a look at some of that and you can see in this jr. got rode up here you know you got some purple in going on you know it's nice then we have that Island punch from Cali connection and this one also not in love with this fee no but she is frosty dense I didn't you know show you what miss one also very dense like there's not much you see me pushing in there that's all there is to that it's not going past that you know what I mean saying much pretty much the same deal here not a beautiful budge structure but also has a sweet smell not as gassy as that platinum garlic by in-house genetics that one there is definitely like you know gassy but this still is nonetheless but like I said definitely a sweeter smell I recommend getting them getting this strain island punch from Cali connection as well most important thing as a gardener is making sure you have good genetics because if you have that a [ __ ] I mean just it doesn't matter how good of a grower you are you know it's not going to come out as ideally as if you are you know had some bomb as genetics poppin what I'm throwing on is J right here is some guava and caught it [ __ ] frontally for

times jelly breath actually was a freebie so I don't know what the price of it would be but I know that um it was a freebie I got a 10 pack free with my purchase of the Platinum garlic from in the

] out of Tony Stark's mansion then he sits out front sits on a stone with his helmet and his sword off just chillin looking at the building what Thor Captain America and Iron Man they're [ __ ] standing there all three of them shoulder to shoulder I'm just talkin like yo y'all see Thanos right there and they're all like idiot man I see that [ __ ] what we gonna do he's like man we gotta take him out and then Thor's just like as long as we're all in agreeance yo man Thor get the raid enlightening the eyes [ __ ] lightning just comes down from the sky into his hand [ __ ] millionnaire and Stormbreaker just come [ __ ] storming out of nowhere slams is to his hands and you know store I mean Thor is strong as [ __ ] right so [ __ ] Stormbreaker hits his hand you just hear the metal like boom and his [ __ ] arm flexes backing on our because it hits him so hard and then mil here comes another boom and he's just like his [ __ ] beard braids itself into some like old Viking [ __ ] like oh my god that [ __ ] was hard it was like Thor is back you know what I mean cuz you seen him during the movie and he's all crushed like his ego was crushed and he feels guilty and [ __ ] so just to see him you know feel powerful again and he was just down you know what I mean like everybody loves that moment in the superhero movie when you just know like this [ __ ] is going down like and they don't give a [ __ ] like they don't even know if they're gonna win but it's just like I've got to go all the way anyway back to this I was just talking about the movie for you know a couple minutes kind of let the effect of the trees a little bit very relaxing hi gonna be honest this is not an overbearing powerful hi I've had this [ __ ] caught up keep covering the day like I'm outside but uh I've had this [ __ ] called Holy Grail from DNA genetics that [ __ ] is strong like if you looking for something strong it's made with the og eighteen and kosher cush I mean a J or two of that and that putting you to sleep like that's not something you smoke throughout the day you know what I mean this I could smoke throughout the day if I want to be relaxed but like if I'm at work and I need to be like up I mean I I wouldn't do it you know what I mean I would get something a little bit lighter but for relaxing yeah like my stomach was kind of hurting I'm on like this little weird diet where I eat like I do II between two and three times a day but I'm not eating a lot of food I'm kind of more conscious about my health as I'm sitting here smoking and tobacco laced J but yeah as I'm getting older you know what I mean want to take care of my body I'm trying to be around you know what I mean trying to have kids and grandkids and all that [ __ ] but this is uh definitely a chill a chill kind of high check out in house genetics and Kelly connection I am actually not like officially I'm not any type of like company I'm just a home grower who does it as a hobby right now and I'm basically just trying to perfect my skills in it and get more knowledgeable but I did try to work in the industry a few months ago I was in a car accident at the end of 2018 and I wanted to switch industries because of where I lived at so I figured you know there's dispensaries around places that grow I might as well try to get a job I applied but what prevented me was my record I have a previous cannabis charge that doesn't allow me to work in the industry so you know in the meantime I'm just kind of doing me and I picked up selling you know products and doing little gardening side jobs and landscaping stuff to keep me afloat in the meantime little odds and ends you know those side jobs and hustles so I brings me to these v-12 you know I got one for my girlfriend I actually have already smoked them and I do like them but I wanted to do a live review popping one open for the first time actually didn't go ham on it so I didn't review it fully but pretty good stuff so yeah brings me back to the genetics I'm not officially anybody I don't sell cannabis or cannabis products I don't exchange do trades none of that I'm just perfecting my craft but I do recommend these guys right here Cali connection DNA genetics and in-house genetics and I just you know one day I hope to get into the industry whether I have to move somewhere else that makes that more plausible or if I can do it you know in a DC and when Marilyn comes to Maryland area that'd be awesome you know but yeah so if you're trying to grow learn [ __ ] do this [ __ ] and don't forget to use my growth services that I provide for twenty five dollars a month you know trust me twenty five dollars a month over the course that even if you're saying that it takes you four months that's only a hundred dollars so trust me when I say when you're growing you know three four or more ounces than what you normally would grow you can see we're paying seventy five dollars pays off you get that back several fold so yeah smoke review plant I mean black cherry breath times jelly breath whatever said it wrong recommended you guys have a great day", "A3ZFodq2bIY": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand new video today I got yet again another select wax cartridge I got you guys man you guys been doing these like wax cartridges I went for the hybrid I went for the cherry pie and so a little bit about this it's a hybrid I believe it's more than a sativa science I'm pretty sure because sometimes when it's yellow it's kind of like a sativa hybrid you know so it is cherry pie and I've tried this only like once or twice just because I throw this and I I bought this and all we're having at me and some of the guys were having a sesh so we just kind of threw this some rode oh and man like this man I only have it just a little bit enough just to kind of show you guys look at that all right right there so like always everybody we got to select you guys see that right there we like it that I just like that 83% zero six eighty three point zero six percent THC and it's some cherry pie you guys know was good I'm completely sober right now so we're gonna see how many hits it takes for us to get lit so cherry pie everybody again welcome to another podcast I hope you guys are enjoying these also everybody makes you guys drop a like the comment subscribe 18 another educational purposes like always everybody make sure you guys once again actually let's take let's take the first shrimp so on there's if we got a brand new pen this pen is actually a little bit different the red is actually the lowest setting the blue is like the medium and the green is like the highest so I'm just like wait what cheers everybody see if I could get like a taste okay so it does kind of become like a bit like a little cherry like a little cherry aftertaste like a little punch like a little cherry punch hmm see the cool thing that I like about select cartridges and regarding cartridges is they don't really be adding a lot of flavor sometimes when they be adding flavor that shit's kind of like a bad chemical you know I mean I'm pretty sure it's a pretty bad chemical you know if they were to add some flavor on it might be not too harmful but I mean if you guys are damn [ __ ] you guys are heinous [ __ ] all day you know it's just definitely bad for you but these happens man these are coming these be coming and going like crazy so look at that we got the little select logo um I think there is a couple pink ones bro like that strip tap fake select I feel like nowadays man they could probably make anything bro literally anything for example like again you guys know this I already tried on fake brass not though I seen fake King pens I've seen what other fake it's mainly brass knuckle I've seen a couple fake heavy hitters and it's just like damn people are thinking like man I'm getting the jug but in reality you guys are just can that custom that home that custom made oil could be a little bit cheap who knows some plugs can potentially make some good fire stuff so who knows but let's take another first hit select does not disappoint I mean out of all of them out of all of them I feel like select is top 3 I gotta admit top 3 when it comes to like actually getting lit again select does have like a little meaning like a point 3 cartridge which is like an ax it's in high 90 percent THC and oh my god roll you take a rip of that 1 or 2 a deer man but it's not around like 40 50 bucks just for that little piece of like super concentrated THC it's crazy but a cheers OH I think now I feel like I can probably tell the difference from a lot of wax cartridges like this definitely has select I'll written all over like all of them have like different tastes if it's crazy the raw garden one you can tell right away like bro if I were to close my and I woulda hit a wrong garden and if I were to know if I were to hit a rock garden I'd be able to tell it's like you know chewing out a piece of leaf you know piece of tree piece of bush and that's the leg type I got that it's so weird I'm not I'm horrible at explaining especially explaining a taste but it has like this let me see if let me see if I can explain to you guys definitely I think select cartridge is a lot better than a Moxie but the Moxie does have a really great flavor but again you know that's what a lot of people say you know when it has a good it has like a good candy type flavor and yeah it's definitely not good for you you know because they'd be adding stuff for the flavors because in reality it's like okay if they were to press a certain tree huh you know what there's just so much to it man I there's so much learning to this to this industry you know like I just I just keep thinking about it like it doesn't make sense because sometimes when you don't taste something I'm just like okay cool it's legitly the concentration you know it's literally the oil from the flower you know it's nothing else added to it which makes it just taste like like literally just one single taste which is kind of dough same with raw garden that's what I figured you know Rob garden it always has like the same flavor that same strong flavor with like maybe a little hint of something and you can tell but it depends on the flower like the natural flower you know but sometimes we have like for example I'm not saying heavy hitters brass knuckles and all that stuff sucks or anything like that I'm still gonna cop some here and there but I'm saying like the flavor is too artificial like it's not artificial but it definitely for me I feel like they could potentially add some something to it just so I could get that flavor you know but I could be wrong you know I could be wrong that's just my thought but again everybody I'm not saying to not buy those brands you know because in reality they are you know proved as long as you guys are like like legitly getting them from like the club or the you know the dispensary and stuff you guys aren't really getting them from your local drug dealer cuz your local drug dealer listen to this you guys I talk about this in all pretty much all my wax cartridge videos because sometimes you know these guys they could probably make the wax you know the oil pretty good and you know what hey you got yourself a good cartridge homemade wax you know but at least it's like nothing crazy you know but then there's also other cartridges you know for example like in my experience what I had is like you know I poked out in a couple times and they just turned brown and I'm just like yo this does not look normal yeah it was like a thirty dollar brass knuckle you know like it was definitely fake it was not it was not the real brass knuckles of faith it was a fake brass knuckle but that's one way you guys could see and sometimes let's chop the other sensitivities 1 2 3 I think it's just good 3 oh wait a minute green as the middle one look at that that green is definitely the better wood yeah green is definitely the middle one tastes a lot more made-up fatter cloud and I do see a couple people sometimes like there was this um I had a friend that they came to visit me during my lunch yeah my old job right and they were like eh like you smug and I was just like well I mean sometimes you know not all crazy she's like they're like oh I got a I got a wax pen right I'm not gonna call them out or anything but like yeah I got a wax Maran I was like yeah that's good so they took it out right and I looked at it don't like have a halfway smoke and I was like what is this it was like some off-brand you know wax cartridge right and I was like I like bro you're selling your smug on some fake ass [ __ ] didn't it was just like so black the oil will you see this right here the oil it's like halfway through maybe like they smoked it like right here no no maybe like right there like literally get halfway and I guess what they said was that it just started turning black and I was like dude you know that's like when that's when it's fake and I was like what kind of car is it was like some designer brand not a designer brand I come it was some type of brand where I'm just like - right off the bed I'm just like yeah man you got to turn me little your local drug dealer huh you know my head I'm like why you know 1 2 3 all right let's try it off in the in the max um setting well I have your cloud the taste it's not too gay Don the highest win oh not too good this pen is to spit it's $50 pen don't get me wrong it's a nice pen but definitely not for Lake we tried a couple well we tried a couple um we tried a couple of these select cartridges already I liked select so it was literally like the first one to go to like this is the one that I wouldn't always like gay you know it's really good brand you know but right now the brand that I've kind of uh have been buying lately there's a lot of regarding rocker and is really nice rock garden is a good one but don't get me wrong rock garden and select are way different and they're both good so you know you could either go this router this round or you know cop one of each but definitely switch off you know mine I'm definitely gonna cop another Moxie cart I really like the flavor I mean it's some light resident in a wax cartridge you know and it's it's only $25 1/2 gram this one was about $35 1/2 gram I believe or 25 no no no I think this was 20 bucks I think $20 a minute there look at the thing dude half gram was like 25 I believe 25 um so it's not that bad whatsoever you know I like it it's a hybrid it doesn't have me all slump or like super awake I mean I like that super awake feeling you know the sativa that way I could be very productive but right now it's almost gonna be 9 p.m. so might as well you know just hit some in because and stuff like they're you know such it's pretty good oh one thing that a lot of people do not know and then my dumb ass just remembered especially here right here let's check this out so the directions or suggested serving a suggested serving which is one serving is three seconds so this is one serving I think I went a little overboard at three four seconds but three to four seconds is one serving and there is a hundred and twenty five servings so it's so let's see so let's start off it says right here look one three second draw and close cartridge contains 125 servings so what one three second draw is a so three times 125 so if we were to drag this it would take 375 seconds and if we were to do that and be around six or seven minutes so wait a minute so six or seven minutes of you pump that makes sense because if you're just gonna go sir like four minutes you'll smoke the whole thing hmm six eight minutes of hitting and that's why I love having baby hits - oh okay now that - that was just like a little fact that I just like read from the back a lot of people don't really know but yeah usually it's like a three to four second scene and I'm different once I'm pretty sure it's for all of them it's for the 510 thread the the pens or whatever but um um so three to four three to four seconds is one hit yeah but you have around 125 settings so if you were to take at least one serving a day that's literally a 125 1/2 gram of this but that means you have to be like super lightweight you never had any type of th in your blood whatsoever you know oh and another thing too that I'm just spacing out at this point what at this point pretty much what you want to do is I guess one of my boys put me on actually shot up oil yeah shout out chicken but pretty much when you hate when you have a pen you want to hit it right you hit it and then you have to wait I think maybe like 30 second I believe I freaking forgot but he said 30 seconds or more you have to you want to wait like 30 seconds in between that way it kind of cools down you know because if it's too hot the coils it might not burn right you know you might not get the best like the full potential of the hit you know so you want to make sure that you wait at least 30 seconds let it kind of cool down is that way so you can get like the best you know now I'm gonna try to tell everybody that because he told me that I'm just like dude I see people just rip this [ __ ] blow it out rip this [ __ ] blow it out rip this [ __ ] blow it out past I see a little person rip it blow it out and I'm just like damn maybe that's all the wax is being over burnt and it's not even like I mean at the same time it's it's gonna get burned you know it's gonna file but if you want to have like a perfect hit that's when you have to wait at least like over 30 seconds that's what he told me you know and in my head I'm just like yeah it makes kind of sense but let me know in the comments down below what do you guys think crazy stuff man but I just said bad but man but if you say man isn't but right out it just sounds like Pampa that's crazy so there we have it everybody we have some elite select cherry pie hybrid wax

] bunch of stoners my name is you went to fight one five guys and I wanted to bring this strain review to you all for a very long time now because as you all know the purple punch is a very well known strain a lot of people talking about it a lot of people getting medicated on it at this moment at the moment so absolutely excited that we've got some here today and that were able to bring you a nice strain review on the channel of this beautiful beautiful medicine so if at any point in time you do enjoy this video guys make sure you smash that like button and if you only do the channel make sure you subscribe and hit that notification bell so you can stay posted when we drop more videos or go live so as you all know we've got our piece nice and clean ready to rock and roll we've got some purple punch chopped up here all prepared ready to go also so we're going to take one one rip here to start off the strain review before we get into some close-ups and then as you all know as we do some close-up shots of the notes I basically like to you know just say little background on the purple punch what we do know about it what we like about it and all that good stuff so as you see we are working with the Cheech and Chong beaker today we've got a nice bowl packed clean as usual you know how we roll so hope you all packed and ready to [ __ ] smoke let us know what you're smoking on down in the comments and let's start this off with a [ __ ] nice call Cheers Wow whoo I always start these things off with a [ __ ] bang all right let's get into some close-ups let's break open some notes and let's look at some undisturbed trichomes all right so I basically want to kick off this strain review by mentioning that this is probably one of the most visually attractive strains that I have picked up in a good while as you can see here from some of the close-ups very very bright orange hairs huge white trichomes absolutely amazing stuff here so as you know we're gonna get some close-ups break open some nugs show some undisturbed trichomes and get into a bit of the background and what we know so as we know the purple punch is a very well known strain going around the community at the moment a lot of people trying it a lot of people smoking it now for all of you guys that haven't tried it yet obviously the strain reviews for you so the purple punch comes with a range of complex aromas the closest thing that I can compare it to from smell and taste is blue Powerade absolutely amazing never smelt or tasted anything like this and it's actually kind of crazy to say that this bud can taste and smell like Blue Parrot so very very cool just want to get into some of the effects here so the effects will include relaxation euphoric happy sleepy and up lifting effects and as you all know this is an indica strains so if you are an indica lover definitely recommend it give it a shot let me know down in the comments if you have tried this before and let's get into some smoking people Cheers so hope you enjoyed them close-ups of the purple punch absolutely amazing flower and super effective and when I first picked up this strain no obviously we did the smell and the taste test and could not put my finger on what it smelt and taste like and then somebody pointed out that it smelt like Blue Parrot or like Gatorade or you know like the powdered drinks drink you get the paved mix you put it in a cup and then you mix it with water like an energy sports drink that's what I could familiarize this stream with I have a bit of a mind blank there so very tasty like berries it's it's like a very nice taste of berries so we're gonna take some more berries to the face hope you all enjoyed this strain review guys like I said make sure you smash that like button if you haven't done so already it is much they appreciated I'm gonna take this second rib to the face first ones already catching up with me so this is probably going to put me to [ __ ] bed very quickly let's do this Cheers oh [ __ ] so if you have not already tried the purple punch from your local delivery service or dispensary I highly recommend it another awesome strain review from the ASA I hope you all enjoyed everybody and you know the [ __ ] drill if you can't cope don't mope here is hope smoke dope I will catch you on the next one you [ __ ] bunch of stoners he said everybody much love [Music] [Music]", "MvFj26yIVx8": "Oh what's up y'all this your boy Shelton was another episode another fire episode of waking baking yes sir in y'all today we got another surprise for y'all this is cold blackberry soda never had it before blackberry soda let me get it out here you go this is blackberry soda I've never even heard of blackberry sold a little known had a chance to taste it so we don't give it a rip this morning so yes sir let's get into the BlackBerry soda doesn't really have much of a much of a smell I don't know smells like the woods to me really like outdoors like the leaves or some [ __ ] but anyway let's go ahead bust him open aha there we go now has a gassy smell to it oh I'm getting ahead of myself blackberry soda black cherry soda I'm sorry guys you guys not I'll do any editing so but here's what you get it black cherry soda is named after his fruity soda like taste and unusually dark purple color this trend has spawned other favorites like black dahulu and Ace of Spades it has balanced mind and body effects and it's a potent medicine that hits without heavy sedation making it popular among patients treating severe symptoms throughout the day anyway I don't have any symptoms but I want to get a baked let's go y'all let's get into this black cherry soda I keep forgetting the name of it like it's not natural to say black cherry soda or something here we go oh no bad lighter good lighter okay they caught me off guard let me prepare thyself for such endeavors okay y'all I had to take a little short one and get my breathing straight cuz that hit me a little too hard and I know the expansion rate and this isn't that strong so it can't be oh by the way this is dispensary grade two although I don't have the containers that he came in this is dispensary grade this comes straight from the dispensary in Seattle Washington so thanks to the dispensaries in Seattle Washington I'm not naming any names because nobody's sponsoring me but thank you guys now we get down to the real flavors of it it seems like I can't hold the smoke long enough to get a good good taste on it I don't think that I'm coming down with a call because I don't get sick but it does feel like there's something happening here you know like congestion type that's making me call anyway we're gonna tighten up you guys see the merch wake-and-bake ain't yes I'm a youtuber I'm just playing with y'all uh-oh I must be getting high I take a little pause again now if you ever want to get accurate taste leave out your nose while smacking a miss somehow that activates your taste buds and you get a low accurate taste this tastes the kind of gassy like like diesel like like fuel I know you guys have tasted that before this is really actually quite tasty I don't know if I would recommend it because this is supposed to be the highest level of cannabis dispensary grade hi I'm buzzed but dispensary grace you know having that lamb and you guys know if you get wheat from Seattle Washington it's pretty much coming from California I'm not saying that they're not growing their own weed and Seattle Washington but mostly comes from California why would you why would you grow a lesser weed when the best weed is right next door to you well couple doors down with you no no don't want to take your thumb and say I really appreciate you guys subscribing to my channel gosh

much for listening to my cause and in helping my cause appreciate you guys so much I really do now let's get back in it that is don't take that back then it's kind of tasty y'all see that I did that without coffin wait a minute so this is a a good flavor of cannabis smells really nice smells gassy I see the darkness on it as I said before it's real tiny you see it's almost beating my fingernail but yeah it's pretty good so let's go ahead and jump back in this I try to get greedy oh my god you know they always say if you choke in a coffin that means you're too greedy they take the too much smoke more smoking less can handle and I must admit that time I really was trying to be greedy I'm trying to get it all in there [Music] you guys see behind me that it's still dark it is 5:30 in the a.m. and you guys you know what this is the beginning of January 2020 this is January 4th 2020 and it's I guarantee at least 75 degrees out here right now it's really hot you guys see me sit right here and short-sleeve it's really hot I mean I'm actually sweating but it feels nice and this is the reason why I moved here for this in the winter my winters here are like 80 degrees yesterday was 82 degrees anyway let's get back here now I'm really starting to feel it I feel it right here so this is this is more of a head high because I you know when people say that it's a head high or it's a body high you really do feel that it fits a head or a body because this is definitely a head hard it's nice though it's really nice this is the kind of high that makes you want to go play some games I'm about to go in here and get on some modern warfare and get out it's tasty I guess I guess it took me to get to it almost the end of the bone this is the first time that I've almost completely finished a bowl with he does usually I can't even finish the ball or I don't finish it because the wheat is so good this is good but it's good on a different level you ever have weed that was so good that you couldn't stop smoking are you high as gas would you still smoking it yeah that's what did I can see this type [ __ ] being up hey you guys for the next couple days I got some really some new we all cannabis is coming in in you guys need to stick around for that one man check out my new or weeds coming new trees coming anyway I wish you guys the most awesome day you guys know that I like

it a legendary day I hope you guys have a legendary day you already know I'm gonna say stay bait", "GlfKlBf6QCQ": "what up and welcome to another edition of canon media where we are bringing to you honest and unbiased canvas strain reviews so today we are going to be reviewing reconcush by a dna now this is my very first time trying and reviewing any of the dna genetics as well as my first time trying reconcush so if you are like me and have never tried reconcush let's go ahead and talk about it this is an indica dominant hybrid strain it is an 80 percent indica to a 20 sativa that is a cross between l a confidential and candidential so that is a brand new strain for me i've heard of la confidential before and on the uh dna genetics website it says it's a perfect blend of two parts la and one part cantaloupe so um i'm really excited to try this stuff out this stuff is testing out at a total thc of 22.42 and total thc a so i'm guessing that's the total cannabinoids of 26.6 percent now that is really should be some very potent stuff this stuff was harvested on the 16th of november it was packaged on the 10th of december today is christmas day uh december the 25th so we are only two weeks outside of packaging so i was expecting this stuff to be really really fresh and fragrant and all of that good stuff so before we get into this review i want to go ahead bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out then we're going to go ahead and take a look at it together okay so what did you think of the recon kush let me know in the comments below um now the one thing i'll say is i was kind of bummed out that when i open this jar there's no seal just this inner seal and i have got to be honest there's basically no terps in this jar and this is like so funny it says this on the jar there it says award-winning genetics except no imitations puff tough our terps don't lie our terps don't lie where are the terps what what terps are lying because there are no terps here and i gotta tell you guys that i did grind up a nug of this and no more terps came out like there's literally like no terps in this at all i mean i had a subtle bit of sweetness um you know after i ground it up but boy even that was uh reserved and pulled back now this one nug that was in this jar one of the nugs was it's really nice snug it's just a very very nice nug it was packed very nice i mean it's very dense there's trichomes on the outside and the inside i mean and this is a nice size bud it really really is unfortunately the rest of the uh the eighth you guys see there it's just these small little popcorn buds that was what it consisted of and that's really unfortunate um and you know i do think this stuff was machine trimmed which is going to affect the rating for me it just based on the bottom of these nugs it just it looks like it was run through an auto trimmer and that really messed with the integrity of the bud and this stuff isn't cheap i mean i got this as a freebie as a first time patient um but it says 40 on the bottom of this jar i mean that is not cheap medicine and to open up a jar that it's really just popcorn nugs and then there's one nice bud like they should all be like this one nice bud um but boy i'm just wondering where are the terps in this because honest to god i mean for me um i'm really lacking the terps in this now before i got started and opened this jar for the first time i went ahead and threw dna genetics on the penny pinchers test i mean this is a jar for 40 bucks it better be right with three and a half grams in there so let's go ahead get to the penny pinchers test and see if we can catch dna genetics penny pinching from there sac so let's go ahead and get to the penny pitcher's test now okay so the time has come for the penny pinchers test let's see if this recon kush by dna genetics weighs 3.5 grams like it's listed here on the package so let's go ahead we'll get the scale turned on i'm going to go ahead and put a dollar bill on the scale to make sure that this weighs exactly one gram and that we're all ready and calibrated here perfect let's go ahead and get our cup put on the scale and let's get that tared out now okay you guys see this package has not been open i'm gonna go ahead and open it up now and let's get the bud dumped in here and see oh my gosh hold on a second three 3.42 grams that is a hard fail on the penny pinchers test by dna genetics shame on you dna genetics what a travesty 3.42 like you weren't even close almost 0.1 off dna genetics that is honestly unacceptable i can tell you this i purchased this from seoul um flower in the scottsdale air park i'm certainly going to be calling them uh immediately following this interview to let them know about this uh penny pinch from you dna genetics and honestly that is just so sad it's so sad that um you know you you aren't even close here on this penny pinchers test but regardless i'm excited to try this stuff even though i know that it's basically just a bonafide copper state farm flower you know this was definitely the nug that i saw in here was one of the nicest looking nugs i have seen so yeah that is definitely um you know a good step in the right direction it was covered in trichomes and i like that now today i'm going to be enjoying some of this recon cush out of my air riser extreme q desktop vaporizer i've got this set to 375 degrees fahrenheit this is the bowl that's sitting right on top of the heating element there now i want to smell this and see like a nice subtle sweetness with a little bit of creaminess and definitely that pine that evergreen cushy pine is coming out um now that that bowl has kind of been warming up so i'm happy to see that some of the smell is getting released by that vaporizer warming up the botanicals now i'm going to take my whip the end with the screen in it that one's going to go sit right on top of the bowl that's sitting on top of the vaporizer the other end is another male end that is going into my scientific inhalations triple filtered bubbler i have got some distilled water brand new distilled water in the second chamber brand new organic cotton filter in the third chamber that'll filter out any potential remaining impurities that did not get purged and flushed in the final stages of growing the first chamber there is where carbon would typically sit and prevent ash from reaching the water but since i am vaping today that's not going to be an issue for me so if you guys are ready i'm certainly ready let's try out some of this recon kush by dna genetics and see what it's all about okay so first rip did not really produce any vapor i'm gonna dive in for the second rip i'll probably do three on screen with you guys so we get at least two that have some visible vapor okay very light thin vapor pretty smooth it was kind of that subtly sweet with a little bit of like a fresh cotton linen almost like a little bit soapy but it's very subdued and very subtle let's dive in for that third rip which will hopefully be the second rip that has visible vapor to see how this flavor develops okay so i can actually feel that coming on at the very end of the rip really thin thin vapor just some subtle sweetness i'm getting a bit of earthiness a little bit of creaminess there a tiny tiny bit of pine a little bit of musk but it's very very subtle i mean like as soon as it hit my tongue now it's gone i was kind of like trying to remember all the flavors that i was getting um i'm really curious to see what happens now throughout the rest of this bowl to see how the flavors develop here while i'm puffing this so while i'm finishing out this bowl i want to bring this stuff up on the screen because yeah i'm getting some creaminess so i want to see how that develops while i am finishing the bowl i want to bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out under the magnification of a 25 times macro lens you can get a little bit of a better up close and personal view of this recon kush so here it comes now okay so you are looking at the recon cush by dna genetics and wow this stuff has that classic christmas tree bud structure it's that light lime green coloration thin orange hair scattered throughout those are very resemblant of those hairs that you typically see on og kush phenotypes um this stuff in particular was trimmed right up to the bud no excess leaf material on this butt at all in all honesty i mean it's trimmed so tight that it almost looks indicative of an auto trim job um i will say though that there are a really good amount of trichomes on this butt and you know being that this is dna genetics which um you know is being grown at the copper state farms facility this is definitely a lot better bud than we are used to seeing comparatively speaking to you know the regular copper state farms bud so definitely a good uh representation of this o.g cush phenotype okay so what did you think of the recon kush by dna genetics let me know in the comments below honestly i gotta tell you that under that macro lens this stuff really is not bad looking at all it's it's pretty darn good looking herb for the most part i think where it gets me um was just that uh that auto trim machine you know not being hand trimmed that just really crushes it um but there are definitely some good redeeming qualities about this bud and there's definitely areas where it needs some work and i want to talk about those with you guys so i want to start by talking about the looks bag or jar appeal of this stuff but before i get into this i want to go ahead and give you guys my rundown how i do all of these strain reviews is out of 10. so on a scale from zero being the worst 10 to the absolute best i break this stuff down to four different categories the look smell taste and potency or how effective this medicine is i'll sign up to 2.5 points each in each of those respective categories we'll tally up the total at the end and then i'll give you guys my final rundown and thoughts on the recon cushier by dna genetics now i will tell you anything seven or above is going to get my thumbs up dank stamp of approval anything seven or below will not and if it does get seven or above i will tell you if i'd go back and pick this strain up again so um let's start again by talking about the looks or bag or jar appeal of this stuff so i'm gonna bring it up on the screen one last time for you guys to look at then we'll go ahead and get into my final thoughts okay so you've seen it multiple times i don't think i really need to harp on the looks too terribly much here i think the thing with this stuff is for me where it loses is that i think the actual size of the trichomes themselves could be a tiny bit bigger it is really really covered in try calms i'm not gonna lie about that but the auto trim the trim on this stuff it just looks this is like the quintessential look of bud that's been run through an auto trim machine the other thing is is the fact that the majority of the jar consisted of these popcorn buds you know the the pic the butt that i had in the picture was the nicest looking nug and that's the one that i broke off the uh buds from um to smoke today and i i really i'm telling you i bet you if this stuff wasn't run through an auto trimmer it would be a perfect 2.5 out of 2.5 but because the inside of the bud is riddled with trichomes i mean there are trichomes all over the inside of this bud but it's a 2.0 out of 2.5 for me from the looks now the smell there's just no smell here and even after i ground it up there was just a subtle bit of sweetness a little bit of like spicy there's definitely a tiny bit of the pine from like a kush but that's really it and it's so hard i'm like going searching for those flavors even um maybe a tiny bit nutty um but the smell is just not there and it's not like it smells bad or anything like that but it really needs a lot of work in the smell department it's going to be a 1.0 out of 2.5 for me in the smell uh let's get to the taste now you know this bug did not have a really a lot of terpenes in it it just didn't but it was smooth so the actual process of puffing it was was smooth and it was sweet and there was a little bit of creaminess there and kind of that nuttiness that i was explaining before a tiny tiny bit of pine um in the flavor department but it was soon as you had some taste it was just gone and it didn't like die prematurely like it went to flower uh you know burnt flour too prematurely or anything like that so the flavor did hold it was there but like there's just not a whole hell of a lot of flavor so it's only going to be a 1.5 out of 2.5 in the taste and honestly i think that's being generous i really do think this is between a 1 and a 1.5 in the uh taste department now in the potency right after i finished puffing this i was like it's an absolutely a 1.5 1.5 1.5 however as i was started back in to do the review and just before i cut uh to show you guys this bud one last time i was really noticing my head getting hazy um i was kind of and i am i'm struggling for you know to find the right words usually i know exactly what i'm going to say i'm ready to go i'm flowing but this has really kind of put me in like a bit of a haze and a cloudy haze like i wouldn't be doing anything that needs your uh you know utmost concentration and focus because if you're trying to do something like very meticulous with your hands or something where you really need to concentrate uh and you need that extra brain power this is gonna suck that brain power right away from you so this would be like you know going for a walk or doing something where your mind can just kind of wonder but to be honest it's not really an uplifting strain i mean i'm pretty chilled out this is definitely staying true to that eighty percent indica 20 uh sativa so i'm really honestly i'm kind of i'm enjoying this medicine it did get me medicated it didn't get me like all the way knockout but like this stuff absolutely is potent and it's no surprise i mean if it's testing out at 22.42 anything i said it a million times anything 20 to 21 22 you know and up is really gonna be some potent medicine so yeah it might not be the most potent i've ever had but i'm definitely going to give it the benefit of the doubt in the potency department and give it a 2.0 in the potency um it's really it's effective and it's very hazy it's very cloudy this stuff is not uh something again you want to be probably doing before work or enjoying before work so for those of you who have been paying attention it is a 2.0 in the look it's a 1.0 in the uh uh smell excuse me a 1.5 in the taste and a 2.0 in the potency this stuff is going to be a 6.5 it was so so close um to getting my dank thumbs up approval but it is just not there and i mean listen for 40 dollars for an eighth you could spend an extra five ten bucks maybe even and get some really good high quality medicine i don't think this stuff is on the level i do think the effects are there and you know it for as fresh as it is it's pretty damn dry this stuff crumpled up really really um fast when i ground it up so yeah i don't know you know i wouldn't probably go rush out for any dna genetics um but as an ftp for like a freebie this was definitely a good freebie and you know it's really um some of the best state that i uh excuse me some of the best flower i've seen out of that copper state facility so i'm kind of shocked um that the dna genetics is definitely uh you know a nice step up but yeah really lacking in the terps really lacking in the uh the taste so uh let me know what do you guys think have you tried the recon kush let me know in the comments below and then let me know what you want to see me review as well and until the next one please take good care of yourself and one another and i look forward to seeing you guys soon peace", "uEIKFMlxKb0": "right [ __ ] what it says on the tin let's actually look at the contents of the tin [Music] probably due to its 50 50. percent sativa and hybrid what am i talking about what am i talking about i can't do reviews i can't do reviews i need i need to have some time to think hello and welcome to look at the wrong way [ __ ] sake start again look that way not there because that's not looking at your eyes and it's disrespectful to my viewers look there right in their eyes start again hello and welcome to another episode of strangers my name is rizzler and this is a wee viewer of raw view weed view raw raise the raw i don't know anyway it's me on my phone taking the easy option not much editing not much production just on the mobile phone and making sure we do some reviews because i've got a bit of a back catalog people are sending me stuff to review and i haven't reviewed it yet but time's ticking and also i'm smoking the strains so we've got hurry up before there's no weed left to review that wouldn't be too good would it no it wouldn't be good at all so what is on today's episode you've probably seen it a few times now but yes cherry gorilla now look at this peeps it's in one of these packets that means the weeds better obviously isn't it that just automatically means weeds better when it's all done nicely there's my posing okay i love posing uh let's get it out let's talk about subscribing because if you haven't subscribed to strain games before then how dare you no it might be your first time there if it is your first time here make sure you hit the sub button hit the like button just assume it's going to be a good video like it already and comment and what else is there share as well yeah make sure you share it sharon's carrying people and i'll be most grateful if you could share this link to other people maybe other stoners out there that haven't seen this before maybe stoners out there that have smoked this string before or maybe people that are not stoners and you're going to send it to them anyway i i don't care either way share that video now enough of this cherry gorilla this is by baraleo i think i've got the pronunciation right parallel and it's got the information on here as well which is always good saves me working out what i'm smoking saves me pressing uh cherry gritter on google what what is this strain i'm going to smell it a few times because it is dank now four things to cover when we do the reviews and we view is where we're looking at the uk strains going around at the moment and this is landed in my hand just like that i wish it was imagine if it just raining bud god please make it rainbow one day come on 2020 has been a bit of a [ __ ] and i think the least you can do is make up by having rain of weed please just eating bud might as well like what am i talking about it's a raw it's a raw audition people which means you're gonna get all this crap i don't cut this stuff out you're getting it all unfortunately i'm sorry about that so yeah four things to cover we're looking at the site we're looking at the smell we're looking at the taste and also we're looking at the effects and someone else my dentists are calling me up oh [ __ ] say what do they want sorry about that but actually was my dentist and uh my teeth are [ __ ] thanks for rona virus i'm blaming you china uh anyway yeah it's now got even less time to do the review because now they're just called up to say we can fit you in before i was had to maybe about a month i have to wait to get my teeth sorted uh but now they've had a cancellation and i get it sorted today which means i've only got a few more minutes to do this review which means stop chatting crap let's get straight down to the point let's cover these four things as i said sight uh i was gonna say sound then never say sound sight smell taste and effect we were scoring these out of 10 so the top score will be 40 and nothing's come close to 40. i think the highest right now strain table right there it's about 35 35 and a half i can't remember but it's there for you where will this hit where will cherry gorilla hit before we even look at the categories we have to do a bit of background knowledge a bit of info for you how did this cherry gorilla come about who was his mummy who was its daddy who invented it who smoked it let's find out it's the history so after a little bit of research in-house genetics apparently famous for their micro breeding and crossing of famous strains and also exclusive strains so this is probably a fine example of crossing the cherry uh black cherry with gorilla glue that's all i could find uh also the percentage is actually not as high as probably one would think about 17 between 16 to 18 thc around about 17 average on this one let's have a little close-up look of the cherry gorilla so i always like it when you've got the information right in front of you and this is a lot of information on there so cherry gorilla 3.5 well it used to be 3.5 until uh yeah i started to smoke it uh contains thc [ __ ] good job if you didn't have thc and i brought my money back not safe for kids or pets duh cherry gorilla is a hybrid kind of a strain well balanced in its effects uh gorilla glue fans get their taste for a generic so mix a genetic mix of gorilla glue 4 and black cherry pie breeders this is in-house genetics and gg4 cross bcp look at that just all properly done for us or even harvest on the 12th of july of 2020. anyone got bags like this they tell you when they're harvest because that's the first time i've ever seen that nice little touch and this is a uh love the uh artwork as well really nice artwork also a 50 50 hybrid that's right straight from the middle no mucking around 50 sativa 50 percent couch bong and grinnell 4 is famous for its couch lock so then got half couch lock here and then half is the non catch lock again tells me what it's good for when it comes to the medicine side of things you've got chronic pain smoke this if you if you're depressed smoke this hey you're feeling nausea i've got something for you take two of these and call me in the morning and loss of appetite you'll never go hungry again well actually no no that's the loss of appetite is the fact that i forget that sorry i've had not much sleep but i have not had much weed as well and i'm gonna be smoking some very very soon i promise y'all promise you've got make this quick video yeah right so quick hurry up hurry up it's now into the categories of the i don't know i'm smelling it i should be looking at it it's the site oh i just dropped it i didn't drop it i just picked it up by really a really really weak part of the bud and then the rest just stayed on the floor so i know a lot of people go he's always dropping the bud officially i didn't drop this bud officially the bud dropped itself before it even took off the ground is that even possible i don't think that counts as dropping no anyway here it is we're looking at the sites out of 10 first of all i think why do i keep smelling it because it smells so lovely i can't wait for category number two but stop spinning it okay looking at this right now no let's be serious we're never serious on string killers are we if you want serious read reviews you're on the wrong [ __ ] channel i'll tell you that now anyway sound effects oh there's no sound effects because i'm going raw i keep forgetting i'm raw [ __ ] i've got no powers look nothing's happening ah hold on [Music] i've got a little bit of power okay so let's look at this site first thing i'm noticing about this is the crystals is very powdered very frosty extremely frosty uh and probably the most frost i've seen on a gorilla glue strain or grilling glue cross very light in color very very light in color yellowy light greens here and the shapes of these buds again not big fat round ones they're all very quite thin yeah so as i said the buds are not that fat and big they're all very similar shapes actually um sight on this one going to score up very quickly because we've got to hurry up i'm going to give this because of the frost it does help it out not your hardest of nugs definitely not that compressed that was a bit tired to be honest but still a lot of give so i'm gonna give this a seven and a half for its site average right now just average but don't worry we're smelling it now we've got seven and a half for the site we're smelling it and i cannot stop smelling it it really does have that green more or less gorilla glue smell coming from here can't really smell black cherry i think i've had the black cherry before so i wouldn't know what to look out for or smell out for but uh it is lovely easily slight bit of citrusy fruitness in there and i always find a bit of fruitness from the gorilla glue so i don't know if there's also some cherry going in there as well but mainly uh diesely the diesel dirt these will dirt with a hint of citrusy berry and i know that's weird because berries aren't citrusy but right now that's exactly what i'm getting berry citrus is that is that even legal it's against the law you can't say that i'm going to smoke this i'm not i'm not going to like give this to some innocent person and they can get coronavirus now if i've got the corona it's only me that's going to be affected and i can't affect myself can i so stop sticking up your nose [Music] it's a really nice smell uh not the nicest is in like i've had because i'm loving this because it's dank but there's other dankier smells out there from other strains but i do like the smell so i'm gonna score this up i'm gonna give it an eight eight seven and a half and eight let's go quick we've gotta hurry up let's go to the taste and i do have to skin this up okay i've got the joint rolled up we're running out of time i've gotta go dennis soon let's have a painkiller also i'm just guaranteed that someone's going to knock on my door or someone's going to ring the phone so i'll hurry up people do apologize although this is a complete new format well it's not a completely new format but it's an old format that i'm bringing back again slightly different because i'm using my phone and trying to do it all in one take yeah right as if that's going to happen i'll do my best the main thing is to get these reviews out there quicker than i am doing right now at the moment third category the taste you actually do you know what you can't really smell the cherry when they're smelling it you can definitely taste the cherry on this i'm a fan of cherry tasting stuff as well i had a black cherry alcopop yesterday so i've still got cherry fresh in the brain yeah definitely cherry also you're getting your diesel dieselness from the gorilla glue still quite sweet as well i always think grilla glue's taste is not as a strong point it's definitely more on the effects uh for gorilla glue four it's very dirty strain taste i think this is a sweeter version this is like grilling four but a sweeter version of it i've heard that some people can taste coffee in this again one of them tastes that you think more of once you know about it so now i know there's there's coffee in there or no i know the people have tasted coffee from the strain i can now taste coffee from it but to be honest with you and i want to be as honest as i possibly can if someone gave me this and told me to write down 10 tastes that i'm getting from this i don't think coffee would be one of them but i can see where they come from it is a bit of a coffee taste to this its main taste though is definitely the gorilla glue diesel with diesel edge and then the sweetness from it as well these are nice i mean i do like the taste of gorilla glue some people don't like it some people don't like a lot of people i know do not like any kind of diesel strains they think they get headaches from them and they don't like the taste of them as well that's not me i actually do like the taste of grilling glue and i think this tastes better than grilling for yeah definitely screw it up i'm gonna give this a high one actually for the taste better than the sight better than the smell the taste of grilling glue to the taste black cherry cross gorilla glue form which is black cherry get that right so i can't do it i've gotta have some takes i've got something it takes gotta do it again where was i let's begin black cherry definitely tasting the griller glue from this however i can't remember what i was gonna say i completely put myself off i'm gonna score this high we had seven and a half for the site we had eight for the smell for the taste of it i'm gonna give it an eight and a half really happy so we're going up half and half and half does that mean when we get down to the effects we're gonna give this a nine find out because we are now covering the effects the effects what is it doing to me right now well i've spoke this a few times uh prior to this review so i know the effects already i'm not going to give the effects after smoking it for a few seconds that would be stupid but i know the effects are definitely uh a mixture of the two the black cherry and the gorilla glue the gorilla glue 4 is usually just pure up couch luggage not going to be moving it's gonna among you out and you're getting that massive body gloopy feeling dripping down from your head all the way down to your toes uh i know from smoking this i've smoothly during the daytime as well in fact i've actually waken baits with this and i've carried on as normal um probably due to this specific probably due to its 50 probably due to its 50 50 percent sativa and hybrid what am i talking about what am i talking about i can't do reviews i can't do reviews i need i need to have some time to think pick up anyone that does do these reviews and does it first take because that is a lot of hard work and experience i think you have to be experienced on talking so much without these things happening i just can't do it i really can't do it but yes the effects 50 50. would it be giving me 50 50 on the effects i think so because yes couch lockage definitely i could feel that nice warm gloopy gloppy stone body stoneless feeling from head to toe but i have been very creative on this i have been doing lots of editing i've been doing lots of work lots of housework on the house i'm a housewife believe it or not yes so this does not stop me during my um daily chores uh if i was smoking critical four yeah i wouldn't be doing [ __ ] or i'll be literally on the sofa and pissing my pants and [ __ ] myself i wouldn't be that bad but yeah you know what i mean this it feels like i'll be having enough energy to get off the couch and go to the toilet so this would stop me from pooing myself so if you're pouring yourself on gorilla glue four just get black cherry a mixture in it and get the gorilla cherry you'd be fine to go to the toilet you'll have enough energy to wipe your own bum so the effects [Laughter] on the effects on this is gonna score again another another higher one and you know what i'm not doing this to keep the nice pattern going like that but i am going to give this a nine for the effects we've gone seven and a half we've gone eight we've got eight and a half we've gone nine i've never had that happen before on a weed view and i promise you it's not on purpose it's the way i feel this is very good uh my eyes look at my eyes my eyes are getting heavy already i can feel that already and that's a good sign to say that this is working only 17 roughly thc oh and someone's at my door hold on and hopefully no more interruptions let's finish this off yes so even though it is um more of a body stone this i still am getting quite uplifting effects i wish my eyes were uplifting they're not they're down lifting um here they are getting really heavy my eyes but yeah very uplifting still i'm still talking quite quickly and my speech would be affected with the gorilla glue on it just on its own but the black cherry is definitely keeping me going i'm guessing black cherry must be a sativa or a hybrid gorilla glue's a hybrid this is 50 50. i can't remember the last time i had a streak down the middle sativa indica hybrid how about yourself let us know in the comments section i also find from gorilla glue it's not really a happy strain to smoke you're not really like oh really happy and cheerful it's more i'm like down now well i still feel quite happy and um yeah just get about my daily strain which is good best of both worlds so i'm really liking this for the effects as i said i'm giving it a nine it's gone up try and let this up in fact let's not do that i've got a little bit of power i've got a little bit of power and here is the score for cherry gorilla also known as cherry gorilla glue um but yeah cherry cherry gorilla or cg if we quit cg probably not but yeah cherry gorilla loving this really liking it there's the score sorry it's going all over the place but i am trying a new format to get these views out there the wii views are one of my favorites to record but they also one of the hardest to edit as well so this one hopefully not too much editing should be out very soon hopefully get it out with the next day or two it is wednesday today it's a weed's day so it wouldn't be nice because they always film my reviews on a wednesday but they never come out on a wednesday unless it's like two or three years after that wednesday then they usually come out but yeah hopefully i can get this out today so wednesday the 20 is it the 30th i don't know what's the [ __ ] date wednesday the 30th september is it out did it go out today let me know in the comment section below actually you don't need to let me know in the comment section below because i'm the person that uploads it so i will know as well if i make me on deadline or not anyway i'm walking way too much this is cherry gorilla cross with black cherry and gorilla glue 4 great great hybrid smoked it before let us know in the comments section did you enjoy this video or would you prefer the other weed views that take quite some time to make if you did like it let us know in the comment section below my name is rizzler this is strangers i'll see you later bye you", "63Lnju-_oH4": "foreign [Music] what up what's good guys welcome back to another chronic close-up and man you already know what's on the agenda some more top tier gas this is a new company for me man i'm a little uh upset that nobody put me on these guys i had to stumble across them this is 1937 and uh we're doing a review right here of their sorbetto this is a cross between sunset sherbert skittles and f11 magnum opus and 100 is in the lineage of rents and that skittles gas and that sweet candy terps this is definitely one of my new favorites as you guys can see super dense super appealing purple vibrant nugs just coated in crystals man and it 100 is kicking off a super sour lemon gassy candy smell like but definitely some fuego highly recommend seeking anything from 1937 but uh i'll get to smoking gets a review and got griffin with me and i will let you guys know we think thanks for tuning in what's good guys welcome back to another episode of strain tasters cannabis reviews it's your boy milano cookies tripp said griff and we back man we're here to speak the truth not to hype the booth and then man this is definitely not no booth right here oh hell no today we're reviewing some sorbetto from 1937 farms some super fire man this is definitely one of my new favorites them as a company have nothing but gas that i've tried so they're one of my new favorite companies and also this strange sorbet of definitely one of my new favorites i hadn't heard of this company before uh milano went to go pick some up i've been meaning to pick them up for like the past couple of months but they sell out super quick and i see why because it's straight top tier gas oh so true and the sorbetto is a sunset sherbert skittles crossed with magnum opus it's 100

cush is an indica leaning hybrid and is testing at around about 20 to 26 percent THC the strain is also a cross between the granddaddy purple and the Durban poison and the effects include relaxation euphoria creativity and up lifting effects and the smell and taste is a very sweet and earthy sort of herbal smell and taste to the strain very very nice I could refer it or say that it is similar to sort of a garlicky sort of smell very interesting as I said first time ever trying it so super stoked so far very impressed let's get into another second rip and see how we go okay so as you can see there are some absolutely beautiful shots there of the the cherry pie really really blown away I love the smell of the taste so far the first hint is catching up with me as you can see the eyes tell

"2v-CXbFZn2M": "hey y'all EQ here about to do a a unboxing of the shake that I got the other day I wanted to keep it closed and and get to show y'all so as you can see it's still sealed hasn't been opened I'm about to do that now I can figure out how to do it without putting down the camera I did not consider that okay you see what I'm doing hold on just a sec okay now I'm back better open and holy heck can you see that that's a lot of shake that's all of the nice while good grief look at the goodness there all righty yeah that's that's a good pile of shake all right y'all I just want to show you that I'll probably go back this next week and do another video as always like and subscribe I'm EQ same Brad time same Brad channel later y'all", "E23eThJHapk": "guys welcome back it's tony here from vape thing always mega store um today i have something different for you we are going to be doing um mtl juices um from prime's range and we're going to be doing those juices on the best possible device for it which is the lux vm 40 from vaporesso okay let's do it first let me tell you a bit about the juices this is prime's wrath of the grape mtl juice it is a sour grape flavor and it's absolutely delicious i won't be doing a finger taste on it because it is a 12 milligram and yeah the other one we have here is mango to the max also 12 milligram and this would be similar to a um a ripe mango that you can just jump into on on a hot summer's day both of these do contain a little bit of ice so yeah all right let's do the box the luxe bm40 i already have one of these but i love it so much i want to show everyone um this color is known as the j color and uh yeah it's gonna live up to expectation let's see let's see what's in the box all right firstly yes couple of user manuals in here i don't need that um it's got a usbc charger again it's a more accurate charge it's faster charging as well okay right off in the box you can see two coils going in and there are two parts and that is why i'm going to be doing two juices because this device allows you to do two different juices if you want a different flavor in each all right a closer look at the device itself five clicks to switch it on one two three four five it's got adjustable airflow as well i do like it open if you like it more restricted close your airflow all right there we go so as you can see it's got a maximum of 40 watts the range is from 5 watts to 40 watts if i press this three times i'll be able to set it manually but uh vaporesso has made this so special with the smart mode on your is that you don't need to set it because if you use a 0.8 coil or it'll automatically detect it for you and if you use a 0.6 ohm coil it'll automatically detect that as all right so i've been vaping mango mtl for quite some time and i actually love this flavor in the 0.6 ohm so i'm going to be setting this one up with a 0.6 and the wrath of the grapes will be going with a 0.8 version all right so first quail now priming the quill is very easy it's five drops down the center see one two three four five and it just slides in here any way you want it to it'll work either way all right then to fill it up we are just going to open the pot it's very simple you can do this while it's installed on the pod or if you take it off you'll see a little rubber on this side this is anti-leak it just fits right in there and then you can fill it up there's a maximum line so don't fill it over that line and there we go now i'm going to show you a close-up of when i actually put this in when i put the uh the pod in the device it's currently set on 22 watts but i know this pod this coil can run a bit higher so once i put it in that 26 watts automatically all right you can see on yeah i've got 85 battery power it detects the coil as a 0.6 and there we go just underneath that is a little buff counter as well all right let's try it out 12 milligram prime i know what this tastes like it's amazing oh what a hit i love it ntl gives you a hit in your throat um it's not as much nicotine as what salts is but it does give you a more satisfactory hit all right one more it's not too icy and it's such a sweet flavor i love it it's delicious it really is i've literally been vaping this for years all right let's do the other one okay then the next one we're going to do is of course the wrath of the grave now i am very set in my way so i love the manga so this is a treat for me i've never tried this 0.8 ohm coil for a bit more restriction five drops down the center one two three four five and this also just slides in anyway there's no dif no wrong way of doing it open it up fill up your pod and bam we are ready again i'm going to do a close-up to show you how the smart function works on yeah again currently it's on 26 because the last coil it detected was the 0.6 now the 0.8 cannot run at 26 watts and it needs a bit lower watts so it automatically jumps back to 18. they just did this this is the easy way here's the other part again 0.6 bam it's there and i want to switch back 18 watts all right let's try this oh much less of a throat tip that's delicious that is that is a whole lot of grape right there and i'm getting a sour sour taste on my tongue as you can see it can handle quite a big pool as well this is still 12 milligram nicotine even though it doesn't hit as hard as the mango in the throat i'm still getting the nicotine in i can't do this too much yeah importance of having this smart function on you is that if you are switching between a 0.8 and a 0.6 ohm coil it won't just burn your coil out it will just run it where it's optimally designed for right sure that's all from us and we'll see you next wednesday", "-1wVJ0Jo4uk": "[Music] well it's good job welcome to another episode of Huisman I'm Alvin and today we've got circle punch let's get into this profile as urple punch you guessed it a cross between skittles head to purple punch holy [ __ ] man bred by in-house genetics and grown by my brother the real rocky mountain high seven one nine go give him a follow on instagram and of course if you want them hi beans make sure you hit them up too but yeah man skittles and purple punch it's I mean guaranteed to be flavorful can't find too much on the internet other than buying it but my guess is gonna have a lot to do with pain stress insomnia a lot of appetite stuff because it is a hundred percent in the common extreme a lot of the flavors you're gonna get is gonna be a lot of grape notes too obviously but we'll get into more of that later um but yeah once again bred by in-house genetics and grown by the homie real rocky mountain high seven one nine on Instagram man and yeah let's check out the senses our man so on some of the sentence you know the first thing that I'd like to do is to smell it so when I went over on 4/20 I went over to the this little get-together they had over in Boulder Colorado man and uh man my boy gifted me some of this [ __ ] and so I put it in a jar so let's pop this job down so I mean strong strong grape flavor I couldn't tell you if that's from the skittles or the purple punch but the fruitiness oh my god it's incredible I just got this bud here it looks like about a gram and a half maybe a little bit more but it made this entire mason jar just foam holy [ __ ] man let's break this [ __ ] up man so I've been doing recently cracking it hearing the sound and you get a like I said a a better idea of how long it's been dried how long it's been cured things like that so let's give it a crack [Music] whoo so from the crack it's not too loud so it's not very dry it's not incredibly dry I'm bus man [ __ ] I was breaking that [ __ ] Oh bro I mean just loud [ __ ] loud you know holy [ __ ] I mean it's just covered in trichomes it's reeks of like fruit with funk I mean it's just like great like real tart fruit man and just incredible funk oh [ __ ] I'm just gonna break a little bit of this up I need to save some this man this is [ __ ] Wow I mean you can't even see it alive [ __ ] man this [ __ ] is killing him how did yourself bro you outdid yourself man I appreciate you brother but yeah I'm gonna go ahead and just save the rest of that we don't need to be wasting time I was - [ __ ] her up and see what it smells like real good god I can't contain myself man yeah I'm a hype train guy for the most part I like getting them hype strains they're hyper because they're good but I'm also classic guy I like my Northern Lights my white widows my Afghan ease my Hindu pushes all of those old-school flavors but I will say that this is wonderful because it gives you a little bit of that old-school funk but a lot of that old school or new school nose so a lot of these fruits and these berries but man man just looking at it and smelling it I can tell you this is [ __ ] flames I haven't even smoked it or a baby yet so we'll get into that a bit oh man when you grind it and you're breaking up of course obviously you release more terpenes and on this particular strain how many's hundredfold crack it smells wonderful bad again lots of heavy heavy I'm gonna go with grape and very notes in regards to the fruit smell and then just a layer of funk to top it off not too much because that fruit grape berry smell is super pronounced and it's very up there man I love it man I can't wait let's go ahead and just [ __ ] hate it oh wait you got to look at it first so look at it it's been behind me this whole time so long look man it is frosted out it's beautiful hey I wish I could just smell through the video but obviously you know the size just gonna have to do because I mean this shit's frosted look at take a look I bet if you squished it the rosin is incredible man from her pain standpoint it is just a bit reeked of just that we wonderful wonderful great I'm very inflamed am but with that said it looks good we've seen it we've heard it we smelled it let's taste that I can't wait any longer I mean I've been holding on to this since 4/20 and I haven't tasted it just so that I could do a tastes and give you an honest first time reaction because y'all know y'all watch this if you have watch this I usually taste the strain pride I haven't actually taste I'm actually getting to it very very strong grape like berries right off the note I'd like I'll even say that it's grapes and berries together ma'am yeah there's a sweetness to it a sweetness credible very little of that funk that came out of the smell that's in taste in the taste it's nothing but grapes and berries very little bit of that funk very little as I expected man it tastes good this fire let's get hot my man if y'all watch me before y'all understand how I do this 510 rule man 5 minutes I get lit let you know how I and I feel my mind and my body I know Chief for another five minutes and at that 10 minute mark but you know how my mind and my body feel I eat let's get her man so we at the 5 minute mark and it is definitely a hundred percent excuse me hundred percent edica it's got me chilled it's got me but legs got me stuck so at five minute mark now it's pretty good it's pretty good for an indica but we keep on chief in the holla at y'all another five I mean we have ten minute mark and hundred percent indication show ladies in bags I just bagged up and it's still got me coffee [ __ ] fired man but yeah definitely an indica you can feel you can feel how heavy just drag it's like gravity close to some [ __ ] it sounds like a dolphin show man it's right over view circle hot yeah it's it's fireman so it's a cross between skittles and purple punch and it does not leave you disappointed bred by in-house and genetics and grown by my brother the real Rocky Mountain High seven one nine on Instagram please give them a follow and check this out this [ __ ] is flames you can go to a whole different bunch of different seed banks and [ __ ] but hit up go to Instagram and hit up my man at the real Rocky Mountain High seven one nine good customer service you don't have to worry about any hassles I mean the guy is a solid solid man there's not gonna be any problems with shipping or any other of that [ __ ] that you'll run into with the other bigger seed banks but I digress but yeah man hit up the real rocky mountain high seven one nine on Instagram if you want to pack at this fire cuz I'm telling you the dirt bolt punch is flames man a 100 percent indica got me stuck is the [ __ ] and then I'm gonna guess that it doesn't actually specify but just like any other typical indica heavy into come when I have to say that it helps with pain 11s stress mitigation appetite stuff as well as steep stuff so it's on me I would say what is that when you when you don't want to eat I don't know but that but I would definitely say that it's very very great heavy on the flavor you do get I would say 60 percent gray 40 percent berries or let's say 30 percent bear 35 percent bears maybe five percent player [ __ ] on the top as far as flavor and smell go but yes on a scale of one to five this is the first time I'm gonna do this this gets a six it exceeds it it exceeded it it exceeded exceeded my expectations it exceeded my expectations from a flavor standpoint from a smell standpoint I mean it skittles in purple punch both of those [ __ ] flavors on their own are packed with terpenes and in their fight but together you didn't know what was gonna be dominant it seems like it seems like it's purple punch dominant I don't know that could be wrong it seems like that's what it tastes like now the skittles I don't know if that's a hundred percent indica but I'm not - couch lot I'm I'm very couch like that it took me some time I'm not that even just chief here right now you know I'm waiting a little bit but I gotta say that you know you are definitely there's a little hint of sativa in it because otherwise look at what the energy that I have right now that's just my assessment but again overview scale of one to five this definitely it's more than that I'm gonna get us sick what's causing my workout [Music] all right so uh first and foremost you know I'd like

"BL60ox4I_Kw": "[Music] ladies and gentlemen it is time it is time that you found out if the new cartridge brand that you purchased is a real company or just a package supplier [Music] so this information comes to us through DAP connection comm none of these are of my own investigation unfortunately so thanks to those guys who have no idea I'm doing this so forgive me and I thought it would have been a good idea it was too good of information and just kind of let go and doing my research on these guys that seems like it's pretty legit info but before we get started consider subscribing and punch that like button in the face if you end up staying or half of the video at least so that a deal deal okay so I'm not sure exactly how to do this [Music] you know what I'm just gonna the bran heads roll well I do a little ranting stay hydrated look I'll tell you right now that I've tried spotting faked packaging and it's always like the Mandela effect sometimes you're just like one comma away from being right and one comma is too big to risk a dead cart so I'm happy that these social medias are getting ahold of testing and sharing the information that we need plus a lot of companies are putting QR codes on packaging as well so you can see that they're legit also most legit dispensaries are posting QR codes of their license so you can check to see if those legit yourself as well the bottom line here is that anyone can make counterfeit carts anyone can make counterfeit packaging it's our moral compass that's the problem why are we gonna be lured in to buy something just because there's like a cute 4/20 nurse in front of us and we don't want to look poor there needs to be a change in the system to help professionals and everyday users identify and trust the brands no one seems to own these packaging companies like Mario karts or dank vapes the trail always seems to end somewhere in China it's too bad because there's a lot of great growers out there who make top-quality stuff if you want to feel safe and you want to be able to trust your purchase then I wouldn't buy from anywhere that isn't regulated I'm seeing way too many people unaware of information that's out there I seen the comes below that people just want to learn and grow and then comes another person it makes fun of them for how little they know this is a time for justice a time for parler everyone should be on the same level of information when it comes to legitimacy so as a bonus I'm gonna show you a few brands that pass testing now I'm not here to say that any of these are safe but they did pass phase 3 testing so do your research and what I mean by research is you know go to the brands website they should have authorized retailer on there and is that place that you got your cart from is it on their authorized retailer list and if not email them or message them on IG you know that's what I did with this cart you know this is a the Jade cart and you know I asked them if you know I got it from ie twin palms and the Inland Empire it's it's definitely a little cheap place to go but you know I mean I'm just that places license you know Jade Jade is licensed too so it's just like I mean everything's everything smells like like like a legit brand you know so plus these insights that display test results helps as well but what if research on your particular brand hasn't been posted yet just because it's a new brand doesn't mean that it's not legit you're gonna start seeing new brands popping up in the next few years a lot of older dealers are gonna start going legit with newly formulated newly tested and labeled content I want to make a video on what to look for when you visit these regulated dispensaries I'll have one coming soon but until then I hope this video was helpful things seem to be getting bitter and more ways for anti counterfeiting is on its way like share subscribe for more videos like this and as always stay safe do research and never babe

gram cartridge over there from move florida like i've said 50 for the half gram black mamba is a indica the lineage of this parent of this strain the parents are unknown but thought to be uh gdp or granddaddy purple crossed with black domina or black domina and i think both those strains uh accurately represent this at least the uh granite purple of course it's very similar to that granddaddy perp uh with effects as well as uh taste particular thc in this batch is 430 milligrams per half gram cartridge or 86 percent and uh 1.8 cbd in this particular batch i'm glad move actually put the uh stuff there on the package i know it's backwards but black mamba they're up top 430 milligrams 0.9 and that's it's half grams 1.8 but yeah you got your vape pure there this particular batch was harvested and packaged uh this was june 8th 2020. now that we got that out of the way guys let's go ahead and get another rip in before we get some more information and uh go ahead get that out of the way we got your blunts your bongs your joints your vape pens whatever you do to get it nice and right get nice and medicated with me let's go ahead and get this cheers everyone the particular blood structure of this strain is said to be very dark green hard dense buds with purple and dark green leaves uh sugar leaves on those i definitely agree with that i've never seen the buds of this particular strain but from what i i can taste in the pictures i've seen online i definitely agree with that according to leafly it helps patients with stress insomnia and pain definitely agree with the insomnia uh the couple times i have medicated on this i've only done it a couple so far but um very sleepy definitely had it definitely holds true to those uh og uh what's it called og uh what am

up on some tv i don't know yet for fifty dollars can't beat it i like this a little better than that blueberry one i previously reviewed if you haven't checked out that blueberry cartridge review definitely go check that one out like just like this pure i believe i did that last week and for fifty dollars for the half gram here on that medical market that's not very not very bad competitive wise i should say for the price i mean i think the cheapest distance cartridge we have right now is either the 30 ones over there from one plant which i don't like or the 35 dollar ones pop azure cartridges over there from liberty health sciences i believe i believe those are the two cheapest but um yeah i think it's worth more to pay for those better terps as well as i think it's a little better quality distillate as well go ahead and get one more rip here cheers everyone i don't know if i said the smell and the taste on the strain um i would say it's sweet fruity and peppery in my opinion and that would be for the smell and the taste uh the taste the fruit in there i can't decide if it's citrus or grape in my opinion maybe a little bit of both but it reminds me of that granddaddy purple in uh no contest i would say i would whoever guessed that on the genetics i would say is pretty damn close i want to say this is named after that basketball basketball player kobe bryant that passed away i'm not sure though because they did call him black mamba don't quote me on that though this is a little bit stronger of a cartridge over there distance-wise 86 percent i'm liking that as well i think that last one i reviewed was i want to say 75 i'm not mistaken really good i've been enjoying this uh truly battery as well i've been only had to charge it a couple times i think i've charged it i wanna say twice now in the three weeks i've had it maybe four weeks the only thing i do hate about it is that magnet there on the bottom that metal piece is very strong with the mechanism there inside i think you can see that you gotta pull pretty hard i can't get a grip on it with my fingers i mean look how big that is i can't i can't get a grip on that i gotta use my shirt or some kind of cloth but besides that i like it all the same especially the little window here you can see how much product you have left it works out a lot you got just over just over half there all right in conclusion definitely enjoy this uh pure black mamba cartridge over there from move florida and uh definitely recommend it to indica lovers as well as people that enjoy i guess granddaddy purple you know or moved products moves dislike in general it definitely holds up to uh products and the consistency of uh what moves putting out over there go ahead and get one more rip

of cookies again for another strength tasters cannabis reviews episode and today we're going back man we're throwing it back with some classic gaps as I say it it kicks in we're doing a review today on noble Farms cherry pie cherry pie being the classic strain this is like one of the first strains I ever grew cherry pie if you haven't had it it's a super gassy sweet flavored strain that like probably was the like one of the first strains to lead to all the exotic strings that we have now like this was this was one of those strings when it came out everybody was raving about yo you need to get some cherry pie literally I remember 2009 2008 member whenever cherry pie first came out and it was available in California to buy it record but not wreck shops medical shops I drove all the way to San Francisco 7:00 in the morning and bought like 10 cherry pie clothes and I was like my first real borough I grew a bunch of different stuff granddaddy purple cherry pie whatever was available back then but that was I bought it at burners club - that was a funny thing I bought it the THC which is the hemp center that was a burnished Club way back in the day but yeah man this cherry pie right here super fire from noble Farms hello affordable I got the [ __ ] for 35 dollars and eight and it's way worth it as soon as I opened it boom kicked me right in the face with that sweet gassy smell new right away just because I grew this before I smoked tons of it I knew right away okay that's 100% cherry pie done right smells good looks great - tastes [ __ ] amazing cherry pie is across a lot of granddaddy purple and Durbin poison both of those super sought-after gasps strains so putting those together is what brought this [ __ ] beautiful bun to fruition and yeah man this uh this one right here is tested in at 23 percent THC zero percent CBD yes fire its fire like for me I give cherry pie on the on the rating scale like specifically Nobel forms I give there's like an 8.5 because it looks good smells good tastes good and it's affordable could it have been more gassy and more sweet absolutely you know it's a hybrid strain so it's not really like super into kendama knit like I like or super heavy you know that's kind of what I'd look for what I'm trying to find a weed that I like but if you're somebody who looks for a balance a balance strain that's gonna give you a little bit of both I would definitely recommend this and for the price link you can buy two weights to this you know for around the price that you're gonna get 1/8 of like some exotic [ __ ] and I think this is [ __ ] it's not all the way in the 90s but it's it's right there it's gas so I would [ __ ] with it but yeah man [ __ ] I'm definitely gonna look for more stuff from noble Farms I first time ever happened them first I'm tryna I was over there at Green Theory on a bell red and one of the budtender said man you gotta try this stuff right here and uh I grunt cherry pies I said you know let me take that chance see if they got it and then very pleased with noble form so eight point five noble Farms cherry pie oh yeah make sure you guys keep an eye out and go look for that and once the game

Beasley's everybody subscribed so that he can keep doing videos like this man and it could be one of you guys you never know mark you've only spent thirty six thousand so far that is optional a lot of that he still has to get his wife's approval on for now we're gonna add that to the total thirty six grand ever since mark became a millionaire he's really got an expensive taste treat yo'self 82 inch TV I'm gonna get my family some Christmas presents two four six eight ten twelve thirteen you're gonna be broke and see how you can see yourself in that screen so he's gonna get a g7x and then also this camera right here so you're gonna have the exact same setup we do but you do need some tripod right we will literally have a room full of camera batteries because some of our videos require ten cameras or that one time we film the Battle Royale 58 is that what we use three who is 58 cameras so we do our best guys oh this is a great deal double it double it something I'm good I got the cameras two pcs keyboard mouse headphones two TVs right got the sound bar that sounded like a jet engine coming in here so chill there what you get a lot of Apple products how much does this come out to that's about two full six eight and twelve so far twelve thousand of your $100,000 has been spent no okay so far sixteen thousand of your hundred thousand dollars has been spent thirty thousand dollars I want the best fitted I got here I want to talk on refrigerator when I wake up with like good morning mark that's the one these are my dishwashers right here yes right here but not anymore this is your dishwasher I think we good but one thing I do want to get can I get you don't have to know I want to seriously and he he wants to buy me again they see what you want yeah I want to get matching galaxy watch this yes right so we get two of them thanks man so to wrap up this best buy trip it says 29,000 fifty four dollars we'll just round up 30 grand this is literally everything you'll need your entire house will be perfect yeah it is and I'm so happy thank you guys mark do you want to tell them what you plan on doing plan on going to my mother house and I'm gonna give her $15,000 and then afterwards you want to also give your mother-in-law $15,000 I want to get my mother-in-law fifteen thousand that's dude that's so I think we're good on purchasing things for today now we really need to sit down and talk about taxes I know a lot of you may be younger but since he's receiving a million dollars he does have a large tax bill that we need to talk about you know at the pay taxes I haven't done it ever did you do so before we go any further let's break down everything we spend so far you spent $23,000 at Best Buy for $8,000 on a wedding ring a hundred thousand dollars on cars on hundred sixty five thousand dollars on a house thirty thousand dollars on furniture and thirty thousand dollars on appliances so so far we spent three hundred and sixty eight thousand dollars on material things fifteen thousand dollars for the closing costs to your house twenty thousand dollars for utilities bills just random things that go wrong and you've given away thirty thousand dollars fifteen thousand to your mom and then the fifteen thousand you told me you want to give to your mother-in-law so Chandler one hundred that was a predetermined rule before the million dollar challenge the code to the contestant got a hundred grand and then also during the last to stop biking video you said this you win the million dollars do you want to give him 50 grand yes I want to give 150 grand Oh basically you promised Jeremy fifty thousand dollars I did and that brings your total up to five hundred and eighty three thousand dollars so now this video is gonna get a little more serious because obviously mark needs to set aside money for taxes it also do some investing so mark didn't actually receive all a million because he gave Chandler one hundred thousand and Jeremy fifty thousand so what he got is eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars so mark was set-asides $340,000 basically 40% just to make sure all his tax liabilities are covered but now let's talk about Chandler you spent 16,000 at Best Buy and forty four thousand dollars on bills so you spent sixty so you said you spent sixty grand Jeremy spent thirty thousand dollars and then set aside 20 grand for taxes so that's another 50 thousand so that is exactly where nine hundred and twenty three thousand of the million dollars when I'm trying to be as transparent as possible because I know a lot of you won't believe me that I gave away a million dollars but I'm literally showing you right here we did you really did you have 77 graylen I know you talked about wanting to maybe invest 50k and then set aside like the other 23 for just other little nuances here and there and to be 100% honest we went into an investing firm and they told us we couldn't record so you'll have to meet with the financial expert on your own I really wanted to show you guys where all the money went I'm gonna just close this a million dollars that's where the million dollar mark it's crazy that all this happened because you put your hand on a million dollars and you were the last to take it off one of my goals for this video was just to make sure you don't get screwed over like I genuinely think you will do fine if you ever need anything just let me know thank you and I appreciate everybody thank you for believing in me and giving me this chance um subscribe he said it [Music] you change it once or twice but I think continue to stay", "NxEAgqkpn1k": "if you could buy the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "l7PHGUHdhNc": "story this evening an empire of illegal drugs that's the description of a massive THC vape cartridge operation busted in Kenosha County investigators say they saved about a half a million and a half dollars of illegal drugs our Hanna Jewell is live with what's been found so far and how this all started with somebody's worried parents yes is this one of the largest drug operations you've had in Kenosha I don't think it was but of this type it's the largest we've ever had and as far as I know it's probably one of the largest in the country Kenosha County Sheriff David beth says the THC vape cartridge operation was being run out of a house and paddock Lake and a condo in Bristol Beth says they seized THC products with a street value of 1.5 million dollars focus was on making money sheriff Beth says two brothers 20 year old Tyler Huff Heinz and 23 year old Jacob hoppings are both facing multiple charges for illegal drug violations that's just the tip of the iceberg in this operation search warrant served at the residences last week led investigators to find more than 31,000 illegal THC vape cartridges almost 100 thousand unfilled cartridges and dozens of mason jars filled with THC oil imported from California they would take a syringe and they inject it into the cartridges the sheriff says they also found guns marijuana buds cocaine pills and $60,000 cash investigators say they may never have uncovered the covert business if it weren't for a couple of parents in Waukesha who tipped them off to a THC cartridge they found with their son I asked all parents out there this is a perfect opportunity and a friendly reminder to have that conversation with your kids six deaths have been blamed on vaping nationwide many more injuries federal investigators are stepping in here now to see if any of those cases are linked to this case here reporting live in Kenosha Hanna Jewell Fox 6 News", "qbqDc9NbUMU": "hi everyone welcome back to hey bartender my name is gustavo rojas your personal bartender finishing my guinness float this is actually one of the nicest cocktails that you can be going to be able to see on on the other videos this is gonna be the shamrock uh drunken shamrock challenge 2021. just do your favor to yourselves google and see how we're gonna be preparing this guy um it is absolutely delicious and now that we're talking about cocktails you guys hey welcome thank you very much for all the support and all your thumbs up uh for all the videos and uh please if you haven't please don't forget to subscribe right there in the little red thing just clicking it you're going to be receiving two cocktails a week hopefully if everything goes okay and everybody's healthy and everybody's doing good and uh today we're gonna do something a little bit nice and special so i've been trying to work out on these uh very interesting cocktails and a system to make a cocktail so today we're going to be making a really cool version of the strawberries and cream which is going to be a pink cocktail a clarified cocktail so i really hope you guys enjoy it please stay with me and let me show you how we do it all right so uh a clarified cocktail or the clarification of a cocktail it is a system that uh it might sound not very practical to make it one by one uh especially if you work in a bar because basically what you're gonna be doing is just like mixing some uh cocktails and some spirits uh some syrups with uh uh milk products or like dairy products or products that they can tend to cradle and once they do that you're going to be filtering and uh what you're going to be needing basically is you're going to need a really decent amount or a size container you're gonna need a strainer a coffee filter or a muslin cloth uh and there is a couple ways that you can do it there is like some clarification with protein there's some gel that they sell then you can do the clarification with the gel you can look like a requires to put them in the refrigerator for like over 24 hours uh one of the interesting things is that you can make these cocktails in the large batches and uh i was kind of like a skeptical with the actual finish product but one of the things that i like is the flavor the flavor is just very unique very outstanding so i'm like hey what the heck why not let's try to do it today and today well we're going to be using this amazing product which i love the most it is absolute strawberry and juice and some absolute vanilla but we're going to start by putting your milk so in this case for me i like to use coconut milk if you decide to go for something you know like vegans you can use coconut you can use almond and we're gonna go for one ounce of coconut milk so i made it in this clear glass that way you can see the whole process of it and see how actually it tends to start crawling at one point okay so we're gonna put half ounce of lemon juice remember always fresh on your sweets what you're going to be doing is uh the mirror syrup or turbinado syrup it's going to be this nice brown uh beautiful brown sweet toasty notes on that syrup you're gonna go for half of an ounce [Music] and now what we're gonna do is ounce and a half of strawberry absolute vodka and half an ounce of vanilla now we have our cocktail done you are not going to be shaking it with ice basically what you're going to be doing is just stirring it in order to integrate all the flavors and you're going to start seeing right away that there are some curls on the actual cocktail all those kind of like white pieces breaking down okay so you want to start having that and what you're going to be doing is just like put your filter on top of the strainer and add your cocktail in it i'm going to make a second one because i'm going to have some guests coming over in a couple of minutes and i'm going to be able well a couple hours so i'm going to be able to actually offer them one cocktail for each one so we're going to repeat the whole process of the actual cocktail and i will see you in about 30 minutes all right you guys so we're back and uh well apparently our cocktail is nice and ready to go so i did a double filter after you finish the first filtering you're going to do a second time on so that way it's going to take all those little impurities on your cocktail you're going to see a little bit of grease and that's okay you just want to put this thin away and you have your cocktail ready to go so we're gonna put some ice like i said i'm making two cocktails for two special guests so i'm putting all our mix inside of the shaker and let's check and check for this cocktail we're going to use two nikon aura cocktail glasses and your final strainer [Music] this thing looks almost perfect and we're gonna garnish with something nice but at the same time simple and elegant a couple pink petals [Music] there we go and there you have it you guys this is gonna be your strawberries and cream a pink clarified cocktail salute everyone and i hope you like it enjoy you", "PxL8RgmvK3I": "hey what's up guys what did do is you boy mr. bling see I'm coming back at you with another video I think I just cringed after I said that but uh anyway today I wanted to just talk about some carts uh in specific fake carts because like I've been watching a lot of other people's videos on like your views of carts and [ __ ] and anytime they review something that's like a dank vape or a dab wood or like a cereal cart all I see in the comments are over you smoking home to fake cards oh you've got no food carts oh that car doesn't have the holo graphics on it so I think that fake um I would like to just say shut the [ __ ] up cuz like I'm pretty sure everyone who smokes carts knows that all of these aren't real carts because I mean it's pretty obvious if you smoke them yourself you can get different packaging which are like fake our carts from a fake cart in general but just starting off this video all of these carts are fake these two are real though I'm just gonna show you the packaging on these real quick so first off they have the California label and that's something only some of these fake car companies can write or copy onto their packaging but uh anyway you have a sticker that clearly labels your total THC and CBD content your strain how many milligrams you're getting and what type of weed it is you have this sticker label on the top that seals the box you have this sticker label on the back that lists your THC and CBD again and a government warning all of this information is on this legit kingpin packaging even the way the packaging it comes in obviously I mean like these are long since weak but uh you get a nice little kingpin cart it looks very nice it's all high quality you can open it in case you want to take the wax out it's a legit kingpin cart it even has the like the label a you can't scratch off I just hit my camera mess up my then I think it was a shame all right so you have all of these other companies that are making black-market cards all of these are black-market cards the thing is it's just some companies do it better than others and I don't know why some companies decide to lie about what they're putting in the curt's like trap house they put a rough percentage of your THC content they put all natural high percent organic no PG VG or PE d and they even copy the California sticker the thing is trap house is an alleged company and so these aren't real cards they're fake cards but they're high-quality fake cards if I would say so myself I just finished their Venice og one and like the waxen this was just as good if not better than the wax and these kingpin cards don't hate to kingpin though these were nice um but yeah so like just because it's a car is fake doesn't mean that it's not gonna work the thing is these are full of harmful chemicals not full of them but like Oh some more but these are pure wax they're not gonna harm you these though even though they say they don't have PG or VG they do they're mixed with that it's real wax but it's mixed to dilute it in therefore you get more use out of it the way you can tell if it's a higher quality fake wax is if it moves slowly and if it's like a deep golden color or like yeah a deep golden brown um I think out of all of these carts the worst one I've had was this chronomaly skittles cart obviously the packaging is fake I never seen Khurana play anywhere else it doesn't even have like the fake California label on it oh yeah it does but it's like an even weirder one they always say lab tested on percent organic but they're not like it's very obvious when you're hitting these cards that they are mixed with something some of them here really harsh dank babes as you can see his had to change sorry about that I had to fix my camera back because I'm sort of hit it while I was trying to talk about these dang babes packaging um what I was trying to say was dank babes has had to change their packaging three times since January because other people are now taking their packaging and putting fake tarts inside of already fake cart packages which is such an insane thought to me but it's kind of good that dank vapes likes to like at least change up the way that they're selling theirs think their stuff so that people are at least getting somewhat higher quality wax under thinning that I like another thing that I like about dang vapes is that you can't open these see cell atomizers that they use for their wax they're stuck closed and that's a good thing because the fact that all of these companies mix actual THC like weed wax with VG and PG it makes it harmful for you if you take it out of the cart when you're smoking it in the car it'll make you coffee cuz it's kind of harsh it might taste really good but it's still not that great for you imagine that but worse if you take and open these car packages and then you try to actually dab the wax from them Auto break some of these companies make it so that you can unscrew the top of their carts you can refill them obviously but then you can also take the wax out and that's where you can run into problems once you burn the wax that's mixed with VG and PG on a rig it can be super harmful for you because we're not supposed to be combusting those chemicals they're used in actual vape juice that you would mix with nicotine for people to stop smoking they're not meant to be used for THC cartridges obviously you can use them and people are but I feel like people should just put out the information that yes these are fake yes they do work but you have to at least also be careful with them and know what you're getting yourself into before you start trying to like just smoke cards out of the blue and thinking that all of these these are legit I'm pretty sure even exotic like their wax is around the same quality as dank vapes I'm not sure if they're super legit but I know that their wax is not like an amazing quality wax it's decent but it's not great these trap house cards they are pretty good I would suggest them just as highly as I would suggest at King pen but only with the information that these are mixed with VG and that they can harm you and I think like my basic opinion is that these cards while they are fake are just as good as legit carts as long as you know hey I'm sort of damaging my body by using these and you just continue with the information in mind if you can get legit carts I would highly suggest doing that because while they may not like get you as high as these like immediately you might take me need to take a few more hits but these also last longer they're more healthy for you and I mean the smoke is super smooth so it doesn't feel like I was harming myself at all when I was using these cards these carts are probably cheaper and more available to you so if that's your like only choice try some of them out but like try to figure out what brands you prefer over the ones that are like sort of harmful um I feel like this video ended up being a bit of a ramble I'm sorry about that but I also hope that if you did watch you enjoyed and um yeah I'll just catch you all next time see you", "sQF8-dl5fls": "[Music] yo guys what is going on ethan here today we are going to be reviewing some of my orange cookies wax so hopefully that does look good on the camera i don't know how the lighting is but yeah hopefully you guys do see that

heat up my banger and i'll be back once it's all hot so i'm just waiting for my trip timer to go off but here's the the wax or sauce so it's really saucy and once this timer goes off i'm gonna go ahead and put this on top and we're gonna go ahead and take a rip i'm gonna pick up the rig so you guys can hopefully see the smoke more but yeah i'm just waiting for this timer to go off so i know how hot it is should be any second now like five more seconds and it should be good all right so let's go ahead and give it a hit put on the top now let's go probably have about one more hit okay so that was a really good hit i'm going to take one more and i'm going to end off the video there so i'm going to do again i'm going to heat it up and wait for the timer to go off and number two of the orange cookies cheers so super tasty oh makes me feel really nice oh that was really good so like i said this is the orange cookies like a sauce tastes amazing so i want to thank you guys so much for

watching make sure you guys leave a like comment subscribe all that and this is ethan signing out peace [Music] you", "27dIDqrHsFE": "[Music] hey everybody dr john here with uh extract lab i'm going to be talking today about what is delta eight delta eight is a form of thc that really is a little bit different from a delta nine thc delta nine thc everybody knows that's the thc that makes you guys has some psychoactive effects it's also the main psychoactive ingredient within the marijuana plant and what delta eight is is it's a form or an isomer of that delta nine thc the reason it's been talked about a lot is because a lot of people are using hemp and derivatives of him to create a delta eight thc and they're doing this with some organic synthesis jiu-jitsu really in the laboratory and they're taking cbd and converting it over to delta 8 on thc the reason they're doing that is because the delta atfc of course has some of the same psychoactive effects that delta 9 phc has albeit they can be quite attenuated from delta a lot of people would say it has like a mellow effect so they're using hemp derived materials um they're hooking it up and they're processing it to the point where it now is converting into a delta eight thc molecule that then they can formulate into vapors or gummies or whatever that is that they're looking to formulate for so that's really what delta eight thc is when you look at it just look at it just look at it it's actually an oil and it looks a lot like a cbd oil or it looks a lot like a thc oil you've seen some nice golden pictures of some of that oils as they're flowing out the oil itself is a little bit more biscuit so it's very very thick hard before you need to really heat it up in order to pour it if you want to make products associated with a delta eight a couple different things you need to be thinking about the first thing is you gotta make sure that there's no delta not in your product because the law says that you have to have less than 0.3 delta 9 thc if you have a delta h thc and you have too much delta 9 in it you're not going to be able to use that product for your vapor or you need to dilute it down so that it doesn't have too much delta line in it that really is delta eight how you can use it the oils they look beautiful for them and you can formulate them into different products like that so really guys that's what delta 8 is all about please subscribe to our channel on youtube like us on instagram we have all kinds of calculators for you guys to use on our website we have guides i don't know a lot of people don't know this but we have guide after guide after guide for you guys we have extraction guides we have distillation guides we have a hemp curing guide go to our website you'll see that there's a lot of products there for you to really look at when you get to the point where you need help with formulations give us a call alright this is dr john thompson for extract lab thanks a lot and take care you", "blDq0V4rO14": "what's going on youtube it's your boy marijuana mike and i'm back with another one and this one well it's different i'm honestly not sure if i have done a vape pen review on this channel um if i have i completely forgot but it was probably on this same exact strain because well this is one of my favorite strains but before we get all into all that guys this is a medical marijuana channel i'm a medical marijuana patient here in the state of florida and this channel is designed for those over the age of 18 if you're under the age of 18 grow the hell up each day shut up so here we go guys this video is probably going to be coming out after the how to clean your glass video so if you haven't seen that make sure y'all go up here somewhere go check that out but long story short guys if you've been paying attention on instagram at the real marijuana mic or you just been paying attention here you know that a couple of weeks ago i ran out of my allotment when i went and picked up that ounce of weed a couple weeks ago i had already used up my concentrate allotment that's why i actually got that ounce because i didn't have any concentrates so when i picked up that ounce i used up the rest of my flour allotment now people can ask me what the hell is allotment allotment is just the amount of marijuana i'm allowed to purchase for instance every month i'm allowed two and a half ounces and i'm also allowed 14 grams of concentrate i've already made a call to my doctor to get that from 14 to 21 so that's what's up it shouldn't be a problem anymore plus i got that nut smasher machine coming so i ain't got to worry about them i'm going to be pressing my own concentrate soon and i will be making plenty of videos with that machine guys so stay tuned for that i also have an email that should be coming here today um so be on the lookout for that as well but topic at hand here this fake pen so long story short i woke up today i'm like dude i need something because last night i scraped all my bowls i smoked all my resin i woke up dry today so i'm like do i need to figure something out here uh just because honestly guys i've been smoking for so long without a break that it it already in the few hours that i hadn't been smoking dude my anxiety and anger level just crazy so i love mia indica this is a hybrid but still either way so i woke up on like dude let me try to see if i can get a couple of carts you know so i put two court two two orders of the mimosa and so and i'm looking and then then somebody hit me up and i was like oh [ __ ] that's right this falls under inhalation so inhalation you know like smoking all that i already used up all that so i was like [ __ ] what am i gonna do i'm like screwed i'm just gonna show up and maybe they can help me out so i get there i'm like listen i have an order for two cards i don't even know if i can get them my allotments up she's like listen you have about point five four of you know allotment left i'm like oh i bet so i went to the back long story short guys i ended up being able to pick up just one of these cards okay now the vape pen that i'm using is an open vape oh oh pan vape the letter o the word pen and then vape oh pen vape all right this is my go-to vape honestly guys i i haven't really experimented too much with vapes i usually just find a product that works and kind of just stick with it to be honest um but i'm not sure if i did a review on this if there if i did just go look it up try to maybe type an open vape but i don't think i have if i haven't i will make sure to get a review up on this soon but uh i picked up five grams of mimosa which is honestly guys i have not tried every single card i've tried maybe a handful if that's mimosa is by far hands down my absolute favorite card in the world i don't i'm sorry but the flavor on this is just nothing but sweet sweet juicy oranges like the taste it melts me bro every time i taste this and i know that sounds really weird and [ __ ] but i'm just keeping it a buck i honestly guys could suck on this all day pause i'm not trying to be like your girlfriend but i usually put this this has three set up though i say that for the review so as far as the mimosa goes guys this was coming in at 86.7 something percent and i'll tell you what i like it i don't like okay about vapes and why you don't ever really see me vape okay and i'll just give it a book the thing the number one thing i don't like about this is this it's right there at all times okay so wake up out of bed gotta take my morning piss damn that piss has turned into a [ __ ] time for breakfast [Music] oh that was good need to smoke i just smoked after i ate but i need to smoke like that's the issue guys it's just all at all it's literally here at my hip at all times i'm at work i'm in the bathroom at work i'm talking to somebody at work like that's the only thing i don't like bro i'll fly through this thing okay like these are good like if you got a low tolerance and you just don't dab and [ __ ] portable dab right here but if you're like me you're diving every day you're smoking every day like you're going crazy ballistic i'll fly through this it won't last me long this is a half gram and this cost me 48 okay but i will say this i love these for the convenience and i more importantly dude i love these for the flavor okay if you smoke for flavor and you don't do vape pens bro you're missing out on a ton of terps okay i believe the terps on here are like four and a half percent okay so it's just flavor every hit now i don't really draw too long because as i said i'm out of my allotment so this and the uh syringe of true clear which i'll be doing a review on as well stay tuned for that um this has got to last me till the 23rd which it probably will obviously but i want to keep that mentality so i don't burn through it regardless keep that tolerance still kind of dropping a little bit you feel me all in all guys mimosa is the way to go if you're looking for just taste on a vape pen man that's the only one i go to bro i don't really trust nothing else you know i was gonna try some sunshine cannabis but the flavor on this bro i can't you know i can't give it up i'm hooked but i love y'all i appreciate y'all like i said if you haven't seen that glass cleaning video go check it out and i'll be putting out that banana kush true clear syringe video as well and i just appreciate all the support guys 600 followers on instagram organically is crazy in a three month period to me and uh almost 140 already on youtube real crazy so i just appreciate it man don't forget i got that nut smasher coming so you're going to be seeing plenty of nug smashing videos concentrate videos um i got that email coming so expect that to happen a lot of you know melt shot videos i'ma step it up and i love y'all so make sure y'all hit that bell tell me what you're smoking on where you got it from where you're coming in from i'll see you on the next one", "EPWvs6u4_jE": "bell peppers are quite easy to grow especially with the following tips and take up little space in the garden compared to plants such as tomatoes or cucumbers they can even be grown in containers if gardening real estate is in short supply such as that available on a patio or deck 1 start seeds indoors bell peppers can easily be grown from seed started either indoors or sewn directly into the soil if conditions permit if you live in an area that experiences cold winters start seeds inside 6 to 8 weeks before the last predicted frost for your climate zone plant two to three seeds per container and thin out the weaker seedlings after a couple of weeks to transplant seedlings outside pepper plants need outside temperatures to be a steady 70 degrees or warmer to flourish when ambient temps hit this mark move seedlings outside plant them about 24 inches apart in an area that receives plenty of Sun this provides ample space to grow but puts them close enough to help shade each other in the hottest Sun choose planting spots with nutrient-rich well-drained soil 3 mulch around plants mulching around garden plants is a beneficial step that many people often overlook a thick layer of mulch over the soil surface will help to keep weeds down retain soil moisture and keep the soil cooler over the roots you can use commercial bark chips pine needles grass clippings or even straw as suitable mulch 4 provide adequate water pepper plants will need 1 to 2 inches of water per week for maximum growth notes bonnie Plants this amount may need to be increased slightly when the weather is extremely hot and dry water at the base of the plant to avoid saturating the foliage 5 apply fertilizer to promote growth for optimum plant growth bell peppers will need to be fed to replenish nutrients lost from the soil wait until the plants blossom before fertilizing them to encourage fruit production fertilizer applications prior to this will promote vegetative growth instead of blossom formation 6 treat pests accordingly insect pests can cause a significant amount of damage once they infest a vegetable crop keep a close eye on bell peppers to spa infestations quickly early treatment can help minimize damage and resulting yield loss common pests in bell peppers include blister beetles aphids cutworms mites and pepper weevils staff at a garden center can help identify pests and recommend appropriate treatment options 7 harvest fruit when ready peppers are ready to harvest when they reach the size and color you'd like a wonderful aspect of bell peppers is you can harvest them even before the fruit is fully matured random fact green bell peppers are immature orange red yellow or purple bell peppers when harvesting the fruit from the plants it's better to cut the stem 1 to 2 inches above the fruit instead of pulling off the pepper that helps avoid damage to both the plant and the fruit", "MkSRS7QzefY": "i'm going to show you a fake glow cart versus a real glow cart real packaging fake packaging super big 10 of these are not going to fit in when a box meant for these that one came in this box 10 came in here see 10 cow this is also old boxes these are still floating around so just because your box looks like this doesn't mean it's fake just means it's old these are the new boxes new carts boxes i believe the cartridge itself is still the same good that's the carts this was a real glue cart i finished it a while ago and i just kept it in the box and didn't ever think i'd make a video like this um but my buddy actually got this one and i told him to get me one because i wanted to make this video he didn't charge me i mean he did charge me for it but i'm just going to give him a real cart instead it's showing the difference um charge me 20 bucks for it i normally pay about or two for these p 22 20 anywhere between 22 and 25 is what i pay for these right now it's not the best price but hey it works um this is the real one i'm sorry i mean i paid 22 to 25 for these these are the real ones not that um but as you can see there's something still in here it's a gold oil gold amber color oil all of them are they're all like this this is a fake one that should crystal clear they're not crystal clear but i don't know what the [ __ ] that is it's some weird [ __ ] and that's how it is when you turn it upside down it moves slow this is still like i think this is delta eight tell you the truth i think somebody stuck delta eight in a fake glow card because it's harsh as [ __ ] and it like gives you this weird like hi i only took a couple hits off this thing and try it out to see what the [ __ ] it was uh because my buddy was smoking them and uh they didn't do [ __ ] to him yet but you know i don't know it's one of those weird things i wouldn't i'm not going to smoke this [ __ ] i'm throwing this out after this video actually i'm going to keep it just for like you know future references never know make another video um but yeah that's another thing you can tell the fake ones you see the way it says glow right there for one that looks [ __ ] weird why does it look like that on the metal piece right here that shouldn't even be there um that's how you that's a dead giveaway your card's fake all cards that have that are fake glue has never done that has a california logo on it but that's that doesn't matter so this is another thing i was going to address right there it says c cell on there but that's fake because these aren't real c cells these are some shitty [ __ ] um but they've done that that's the fake one this is the real one and the real one it looks like it's actually like engraved in there like laser etched not engraved but it's like done with the laser that almost looks like yellow paint yeah this almost looks like yellow paint so not that is um the middle of the rod right here in the middle is super thick on this one too you can notice that this this metal rod right here is thicker than this one is see and if you say oh it's because the liquid is magnifying it or something i will show you another part of glows where's my [ __ ] battery yet give me one second guys this is my cart that i'm using right now you see [ __ ] is hella thicker still now rose isn't the best oil around you know you're still gonna get bubbles and everything those are just air bubbles something don't move when you turn it upside down so you know these aren't real clothes you can piece it oh it looks there's all those bubbles in it they're [ __ ] air bubbles you don't know [ __ ] don't talk [ __ ] did you see this i got [ __ ] boxes you know i don't have to worry about getting fakes i buy them by the box bro there's another [ __ ] box somewhere here by the box you know i'm able to [ __ ] track my [ __ ] i don't know about y'all i have like my plugs going directly from these vendors these glow vendors so we know a thing or two about the you know good carts for the price you know for a street car here in my state cost about 130 prior to tax for a gram car of distillate distill it not no special rso anything like that just distill it and i couldn't imagine paying more than 20 25 bucks for one of these things dude i just can't so yeah um you want to see you know be like oh that's a fake card still i'll [ __ ] pop open another one for you guys i glow even sent me this is one of their older masks they have new ones out now you can tell i put it through the machine they also sent me a hoodie but that [ __ ] was too small that is an xl i wear like [ __ ] 3x bro i'm [ __ ] 6'2 and 250 260 pounds dude come on help me out here [ __ ] i can't try and do this one [ __ ] hand in my ass here we go there's a fresh cart right here this is the uh cereal milk i wonder if that strains supposed to be sold anyways is this like one of those terpenes i don't know i kind of think i low-key just think it's different terpenes they add to their distillates so it gives it its flavor because it's kind of artificial you know it's an artificial flavor and for sure but um yeah no it's just uh cards are pretty you know all the same say glow extracts right there as you see california they come with seals the glow um then there's a couple's likes they should all always come in a box like this now these are the updated packaging like i said there's still these around because like let's just say i know a thing or two about them and they were still making you get some of these when you ordered the new ones and uh yeah you got the new ones you had to get some of these oh sorry i just got a message i was reading that and uh you had to order some of the older ones obviously get the new ones so they wouldn't be stuck with a [ __ ] ton of old ones you know nobody wants that and they wanted to get their supply out so that's what happened with that um besides that happy smoking you know i hope you really enjoy it um you know i'm just trying to help you guys not get ripped off like i said don't buy these big-ass boxes what's in a big-ass box where the cart doesn't fit snuggly like these carts fit snugly in here you know they move around a little bit but not much in here the cart's going to move around like [ __ ] crazy it's just not it's going to move you know that's a dead giveaway [Music] they don't even make these anymore but this is the same one of that box this one was the real one oh yeah this is another thing i know look towards this little extracts right here and right here says glow extracts there's a space between there shouldn't be that so yeah look out there guys don't get ripped off please", "Nu2XMLKU-Z8": "hey guys welcome back to my channel my name is Alana jacqueline and I'm your friendly neighborhood patient advocate today we're talking about medical marijuana I've been a medical marijuana patient for about a year now and I've had a chance to try plenty of different strains and different methods today I'm gonna talk about some of my favorites from a dispensary called Tru leave and I also have some products from a dispensary called fluent I'm not gonna get too in-depth right now on medical marijuana the background the laws or the process just about these products today which ones I liked and how they work the first product I want to talk about is the vape cartridges I use the indica strain indica is really well known for being a very relaxing body and mind high so it's really good for chronic pain and I also found that using the vaping method really was the fastest and strongest way of getting this medication into my system so the indica that I use is the nine pound hammer the other one that they have is called granddaddy purple but I don't really see much of a difference between either of them just from a patient perspective they both tend to have the same sedating effects and pain relieving effects the next product I want to talk about is their oral teacher now I have two different kinds here both are indica but they come from different dispensaries this one is from true leave with the tinctures it does take a long time for them to have an effect and they certainly don't hit you in the face like the vape does the effects do last longer and it's great for more internal pain I use it for any time that I have a really bad stomach ache or GI flare that's definitely my go-to I really didn't like this bottle this tincture from fluent dispensary it seriously tastes like there's tobacco in it and it's just disgusting but I paid a lot of money for it so I guess I'm just gonna have to do with it for now the next product is a topical THC lotion this of course is for topical pains it can also be used for arthritis joint pains and you can rub it onto the surface of wherever your pain is I have a had a great deal of success with pain relief from the topical lotion unless I have a bruise or a cut that's open and I want to put this around it not on it or in it it just doesn't really do that much for internal pains like joint pain even though that's what it's recommended for the last product is truely's true clear syringe this is some powerful stuff to use this you would hold the syringe under hot water for about 30 seconds and then squeeze a little bit of the solution onto a cracker you eat it and then well I don't know if this is for everyone but at least for me it takes about 6 to 8 hours for the effects to kick in so once they do you are feeling it very much and I really like to use this if I know I'm having a procedure or any kind of painful doctor's appointment or something like that in the morning or the next day I'll take it at night and know that I don't have to worry so much about the pain or the anxiety about the pain in the morning I hope this gives you guys a better idea of what's at the dispensary in true leave and let me know if you've tried any other products from their dispensary or other dispensaries like this one stay tuned for another video coming soon about different CBD and hemp products that are not prescription and subscribe to find more videos like this one thanks so much for watching", "bBUh-oUKjlk": "hey what's up everybody it's your boy max beets we're gonna be doing a review here on medical or Florida medical marijuana rather or Florida cannabis and it's gonna be by a company called truly there its I did do some research before I went here and it seemed like they're the best so far so I they seem more professional to just have a lot of information so I went ahead and I went to their dispensary now before we get started I just want to say that if you're looking to get your Florida Florida Florida if you're looking to get your Florida medical cannabis card that's a little bit of a tug test or so make fun of me how you'd like if you're looking to get that then just go Google of some information and make sure you go to official government websites you can tell if it has the government website is if it has the govt like govt gov or whatever at the end so I went to the Florida Department of Health the Florida Health gov I think it is and I applied on there from application but before I did that I went to a doctor and I sent that doctor that was qualified to recommend medical cannabis I sent my my past my medical history to them so basically what I did was I called the place that I had that had my history and I had them sent I had them send that over that information over so after that I went to the doctor's appointment they asked me some questions they received my medical history and they were they okay we'll recommend this fill out this application I did that on the Florida Health website and it's I think it's called a medical marijuana use registry so I did that and it took about five days for the payment to process and then BAM a day and a half after it processed the payment I got my approval called my doctor had them send over the prescription to the dispensary so anyway we're gonna get right into the review here we're gonna start off with a sativa babe cartridge and I'll go ahead and show you guys that so you can see it and it's just a true leave vape cartridge it's a sativa super Sour Diesel so I'm excited about that it comes in this little glass container that comes in a box and then what's in the glass container we have your product and it here that's right here this little babe cartridge but I'll show you guys the stats and stuff just so you know it's a 51 percent THC super Sour Diesel and yeah that's it I'll also take it out as well you guys can get it better you know site of it close up so you guys just so you guys know what you're getting it's very small us about an inch inch there vape liquid so I'm gonna get into the little bit into depth more of what I use and what I'll use is let's call the actually I use three different batteries I guess you can call them and we'll start off with here we'll start off with this this vapors delight it's basically like a you know pen style battery and uh you just take the rubber off that sorry if my nails are a little bit dirty I was messing around with this I got two more products by truly they're tinctures I'll show you them in a second as well so you just screw on the pen is very simple for anybody who doesn't know this already and I haven't tried their other ten tips or cartridge tips I just grabbed what I could at the time and I don't know let's see how this is let's see how I'm gonna do a review on the super Sour Diesel hey I've seen some other people doing some medical reviews as well and they all are awesome - I'll leave some of their just links in the description so maybe you guys can check them out as well make sure you to like comment subscribe this video as well if you like to you know tell me what you guys got if you want if you want me to review anything specific in the dispensary I went to the Vero Beach location shoutouts to those those employees that work there they were great they liked or super patient with all my [ __ ] questions that I had so I'll leave the description I'll leave in the description a link to their YouTube the people that I watched as well because I was curious and I wanted to make videos myself on reviews on medical marijuana in Florida and I was like I wonder if anyone else is doing this so I like what an iGoogle of medical marijuana in Florida reviews and there was a few that came up there was a male and two females that I've watched that have reviewed and I like them shoutouts to them I don't I'll tell you they're just the Lincoln I'll leave a link in the of their youtubes in the description I remember off the top one of them was like flow 20 and the only reason why I I remember that is cuz the name was pretty nifty I thought that was cool and uh she'sshe's cool Joe check her out I thought it was cool so before I could take this hit cheers - Cheers floor flow 20 I thought that was nifty to Florida and for 20 it's cool so here is the vapors delight super showered is the vapors delight battery with the super sour diesel pen so right off right over it it's it gives me that taste of when you're vaping when you're vaporizing flower if you ever have yeah not bad has some smoke more than more smoke than I've gotten with us vaporizing flower and again this is 51.4% THC and the CBD is 0.5% and the ingredients are our cannabis oil 250 milligrams THC and MCT oil as well as terpenes I guess the ad terpenes for a flavor I don't taste I don't taste any sour any sour in there Sour Diesel not maybe a little hidden in there but I just tastes that taste where you get as if you were vaporizing your flower so that's that as far as the vapors delight I use three different style pens I use I also a yo can that's called here's the box for it it has its pros and it's cons it's a dry herb I mean I'm sorry I know it's a oil dab rig as well as a cartridge oil so the davor you can put in here and it has like coils in there I'll show ya these coils see that so yeah I didn't was the the cons of it was it didn't even work when I tried all in it it didn't work as in it malfunctioned I had a vey defective device with that I could have brought it back but I found out too late I didn't put in any dab oil in it when it was too late so oh I do recommend it though as far as if it does work you know because it comes with this tank that you can fill up and that's what I did with the true clear syringes and I'll get to those in a second as well and basically what I do is it comes well first let me show you this it comes with a attachment that you just go ahead and put that at the bottom of your cartridge twist it on and it acts as a magnet so all you have to do with this is you drop it right into here and that's it it's a magnet it stays in there so it has a button 3 press to change the voltage because it's variable voltage and 5 press to turn it on it's already hung see so I'm gonna leave it at 1 it gives us a nice hit it's strong like it gives you like a stronger hit the normal but uh I also want to I want to talk about this now the true clear I have true clear in here and basically this is true clear true clear indica the super Sour Diesel was a sativa so we'll move on to the indicas the super Sour Diesel and I feel that I feel the super sour diesel already actually those two or three hits that I took just then I definitely feel an up and up lifting because I have a little bit of depression and anxiety and pain so this is for a pain when you don't want to be like sleeping you know I mean it's like for about your day I actually feel like I want to go out go out get up and do something actually I feel a little bit more but like I said I have anxiety so I tend to stray away from the sativa because it's an up and I have anxiety already so I like to settle down a little bit so I do like Sour Diesel though so if there's ever some sour in there you know enemy I'm gonna pick it up because out of this atiba strains I really love the the sour when it comes to sativa so if you guys want me to try any sativa I'm down to try it whatever I'll review it it's just I just prefer the indica strains just because it just gives me that medal oh you know what I mean that mellow type feeling and I don't have to overdo like you know I don't have to overdose I don't have to give it like too much so you do a little bit there it's done so I'm gonna move on to the the granddaddy purp no and I'll show you that so you guys can see it so here's the granddaddy purp and it has about 87.3% THC and has is eighty eight hundred and fifty milligrams of THC cannabis oil is one point zero grams the THC V is zero point two the CBN is zero point for the CBG is 1.9 as a total of ninety percent so if we go ahead and take this out you gotta squeeze the cap to open it this is what it looks like it's a bit of a syringe or a tincture yeah you can put that on your tongue underneath your tongue in your mouth whatever you and uh you're good you just say I drop a pea-sized or two and it'll get me feeling good this is my first haul this is my first time trying it so what I did was I put it you could put some under your tongue I tried that yesterday and it's a longer-lasting and then you want something quick just for like until that tongue tincture kicks in in about like an hour or so you can try this and what you do is like I said before you get the yoke in or whatever device you have I would like something that I would that would work for I would like to dab and this doesn't work like that the yo can I tried it and it it malfunction it doesn't work with it alone so I would like to try something that does work as far as the the two and one or three and one whatever you have it so you just drop that in there and this is I actually mixed I have nine pound hammer as well I'll show you this this is an iPad this is 93 percent team see CBD 0.3 CH T's B is 0.6 and it's 850 milligrams you know that has the terpenes and the cbn is 0.3 CBG 1.8 total of 96 percent so what I did was I got both of these and I put them in the yolk in cartridge because I heard you can vape this as well and truly shout out to them they they told me that you could do this takes a second to heat up because in this the oil is very thick this is only 50 percent THC so this has a like coconut oil mixture this is just pure concentrate so it's thicker and takes a little bit longer to heat up so you can put it on a high voltage or just hit it a little bit longer it'll heat up but yeah once it gets heated up this stuff is strong so yeah that's it for the excuse me see this is a little bit strong so this is like I said the nine pound hammer and the granddaddy purp mixed together and I only put like a little bit in there and it filled it up like a quarter of the way so I was very pleased with that I have one more here it's just I can get it it's called the enjoy I'll show you and now you can get this at like CVS or Walgreens and basically it's like you squeezed and it's just like I keep three on deck just in case if one of the cartridges aren't working very well so truly provided this cartridge and yo can provided this cartridge that I bought it was thirty-five bucks this pen right here was about ten fifteen bucks I bought at a gas station and yeah that's it nine hundred granddaddy purp super Sour Diesel truly that's the review form I love them it gives you a nice feeling the indica deed then these two are indica the granddaddy purp in the nine pound hammer and I feel the effects already it's bringing me back down instead of having that uplifting it's bringing me down to that mellow I can feel it kicking in now that feeling that's euphoric I like it I don't like the taste of the yolk and it gives you like a I don't know I feel like yo Kim it's good and it works by feel like I don't know it can be a little bit better what I recommend it yes if it if it works properly if it's not gonna be a malfunctioning I think I just got like a problematic one but who knows I also want to just add that I got my receipt from true leaf and it has your product information on it so they told me to keep this on you at all times because it's like having a prescription without a label on it if so that you can get in trouble if you don't have this so keep it on you at all times with the medication and all you should be good [Music] that was my review of true leaf and some medical cannabis products and I hope you guys enjoyed I want to thank Mike from the Florida healing connection dot-com you really helped me out a lot so shadows to him stops to truly chefs all their staff there in the Vero Beach location shot of Saturday on YouTube and before I go I'll take one last rip from the yolk and and that's that'll be Etta all right well I hope you guys enjoy it and for those who steam around this long I just want to say thank you alright see you guys later on the next review", "f8wm34q_Ktg": "hi my name is matt and welcome to the american cannabinoid association as i've previously stated this industry is brand new to everyone this is especially important when considering law enforcement professionals at the local state and federal levels remember that literally overnight plant material that looked and smelled like marijuana suddenly became a legal commercial scale agricultural crop similarly unique chemical components contained within or derived from this new agricultural commodity went from being completely misunderstood to being completely protected at the federal level as a result of such a drastic and immediate shift in policy consumers entrepreneurs law enforcement professionals and their regulators have all been struggling to interpret this legislation as accurately as possible unfortunately that has created a bizarre avalanche of misinformation throughout the industry the remainder of this video intends to clarify the legality of emerging cannabinoids such as delta 8 thc at the local state and federal levels now i've had the honor and privilege of working with a lot of cannabinoid industry professionals for those of you that haven't met me personally my background is actually in chemical and legislative consultation so back in the day i would help explain chemistry to legal professionals so they could craft better legal strategies for their clients and i would explain law to scientists so they could understand the significance of their testimony as fate would have it this is the exact background necessary to analyze legality of delta hthc at various legal levels i want to start by addressing the dea's interim final rule that was issued back in august of 2020. a lot of industry professionals incorrectly assumed that ruling would somehow impact the legality of delta 8 thc at the federal level the following serves to clarify why that is not currently the case but before i go any further i want to begin by emphasizing my respect and support for the dea for all of its agents and for all of its legal professionals they are hard-working americans that are working every day to protect our best interests and enforce the laws as written you know they're not the bad guys that are out trying to destroy the cannabinoid industry and the reason that's important is because firstly congress is the law making body with constitutional authority to write laws and pass bills so the 2018 farm bill which was crafted by congress and signed into law by the president clearly establishes legislative intent that specifically protects hemp as currently defined now this protects the plant cannabis sativa l and any part of the plant including the seeds derivatives extracts cannabinoids isomers acids salts salts of isomers whether growing or not as long as it's below 0.3 percent delta 9 thc on a dry weight basis this is important because regulatory agencies do not have the constitutional authority necessary to change this law until congress passes an amendment or updates the language of the farm bill in 2022 this federal definition of hemp that protects delta hthc and other emerging cannabinoids remains the law of the land secondly the language of the interim final rule doesn't target delta 8 thc instead it references synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinols now while delta hthc is structurally considered a tetrahydrocannabinol the language of the farm bill specifies that its congressional protections supersede the classifications found in the controlled substance act furthermore delta eight thc isn't usually synthetically derived now while it can be chemically synthesized from non-hemp derived precursors it is generally derived from hemp via the isolation of cbd again not only is delta 8 naturally occurring in the plant it is also derived from the hemp plant both of these characteristics make the compound federally compliant under the 2018 farm bill now i know there's a lot of you out there saying that obtaining commercial quantities of delta athc involves a synthetic process and here's why i fundamentally disagree take for example terpenes right there are hemp derived terpenes there are plant derived terpenes and synthetically derived terpenes now if i take my hemp i run it through steam distillation i isolate some of the terpenes are those now synthetically derived terpenes of course not the addition of a man-made process to consolidate isolate and or derived a chemical that doesn't impact the idea that it is still naturally derived in order to protect the legal nature of your delta athc you need to prioritize seed to sale traceability you also need to make sure that you are licensed in your state and you are following all of their guidelines including local labeling laws finally it is important to recognize that while federally protected delta athc is not legal in every state municipality for more information about protecting your deltae production and sales please reach out to our organization directly i very much appreciate your time and consideration i look forward to speaking with you in person best wishes from the american cannabinoid association", "SuT5jh-jUXs": "was today I'm vo gang we back with another review from North Fork today we have a special request from my boy he rates the silence you want to see how this look I would smoke I smell the effects of this poker going dude we got the sour blueberry cush and this thing is loud just as loud as the Kindle and I'm gonna give you guys an in-depth perspective on my behalf it's very honest I'm not getting paid for this I'm giving you an honest review now here's the thing with reviewers I want you guys to know what you guys are getting yourselves into right before you purchase any of this flour I'm doing on mine just oh my my my good spirits you know I'm saying I I'm not charging these guys to do it don't make no sense you know that once I get a bigger platform maybe right now this come on now I'm just doing this because I love you guys this is a community yeah I want to know how something

flower or dab any of the smoke levels try this out man they're good I'll turn this now almost pop this open I'm gonna give you my view right I can smell it from here this is a sour berry it is extremely sour smell like solid diesel diesel yeah diesel and sour is what I'm getting from this diesel in sour that's all I can say they should call this our diesel this is how it smells trim is pretty good on here nice medium-sized buzz the small sized buds and I have a close-up for you guys actually give me a second get that closer for you now yeah there are a couple C's not a lot have a nice well stickiness to it not to watch the market down pretty easily though yep smells good so this is a fair short I won't see this until the video plays this is a blunt you about to see look up the stickiness around it if you ever get a hemp flour with that stickiness around it when you smoke it it is some good it is some good that's all that stickiness from the play it is good do those look fire or would that look pretty good at huh nice little trucks on there there are a couple seeds not many it's a couple but man oh man oh man the smell on this bud is crazy when I say crazy I know it

not even opened this is Wow my wife said this one was louder than the orange Kim which it is this one has more flavor to it the orange Kim is just straight diesel this is sour and diesel and undertone I can't say berry because it's not really various more of a lemon so this is like a sour lemon diesel fish the baryon really smell I love the smell blueberries not much like a unripe blueberry a balanced smell blueberry all right so just shake yourself so we - four - so far on the smell and the lips at orange at North work cheaper to nurse a nice local dairy stove with this so he - four -

don't live when we had a fun little for it for take a little for a layman's background so so depending it specifically yeah everybody's different and I'll all have their own special ways of a festival but depending on where or how the different pieces of the molecule are laid out you you know the difference between THC delta 9 and T and C a is th EA has a carbolic acid molecule in its tail and no boxer group carboxyl group and in another thing there's Delta 88 C which has gotten really popular with the water clear trend and people would you know they would throw a bunch of carbon and some acids and stuff into their boiling flask and then they'd start distilling it and it's coming out beautiful water clear they sent test results or they'd sent testing labs and then it's yeah like very low percentage of Delta 9 THC eventually we started they got standards for Delta 88 C then started quantifying that there's more THC in us that there is but then there's still a little missing piece that like you'd see you know 60 to 70 80 percent cannabinoids and this water clear stuff that you know it's all cannabinoids and there's plenty of isomers and stereo isomers of THC and these are things that happen through different reaction their reactions that happen through heating and the presence of acids and bases and given the different environmental things or what was sprayed on those so that that can actually be a big indicator what's happening into the reactions as well so so good all that distillation method we're like you put stuff in a pot it boils at different temperatures and all that well throw catalyst in that pot that you don't know is there like you know people spray put sulfur on their plants or people you know certain things get sprayed on plants and when you concentrate that thing in a hot flask under vacuum where fires and fire attack there's a whole bunch of ways you could do that but to go back to Delta 10 Delta 10 is simply an unknown type of THC that until recently was it is yes in different income in different ways they affect all three of those can affect a single person completely different no they've been discovered but they're only being mass-produced yeah they yeah macula vanilla and knows about him and he has and we are just now mass producing them because we have the freedom of the market to start and start playing and then we also have the competition in the market to try to make the clearest most beautiful looking oil which you know well it used to be Delta 8 th DW I mean I we can I know use I'm saying historically historically when they first started getting this perfectly clear bottle of oil it was Delta eight and they would do this refluxing carbon acids and but but but yeah and that was it then they would use a catalyst in the flask that they were boiling in one we're talking about people who appreciate the clarity that clear net the secret is that the consumer is that an expert consumers okay and what's your opinion on consumers have been led to believe that the clear the oil is well and and and that clear could come from a lot of different things it can be cut with another clear oil that it makes you know just diffuses what color is in there there's a lot of things that can clarity is definitely an indicator of purity though it was an indicator but the a slight yellow amber tint the these are little little atomic level refractions that are happening with chromophores that hold into the the tail end of the molecule these these are what a chromophore is uncle mela these they're they're basically like atomically small things that will refract light at a different color so you have so by breaking that bond you you like that's when people distill with certain things on the flask you can break that at that chromophore bond and it you can also break that bond by through chromatography as well which people eventually developed a method for Delta 9 THC does anyone clear water clear yeah and it that was just a method of taking a single pass distillate and then passing it through a series of usually magnesium silicate or floor so actually and then but different color remediating adsorbents that were also being used to remediate past asides and they still are used to remediate pesticides and it just happened that you make water clear delta 9 after remediating pesticides properly as sometimes depending on the oil and what kind of colors and that the condition THC 8 and 10 have been known for and their-their prevalent in the same way that THC is in Canada like there is it kind of like a is it a totally different cannabinoid that is in very low percentages in well zombie health of ours not so much on the cultivar it's a reaction through processing so you're not gonna have those you're not gonna have a bunch of Delta eight or delta10 any in your flowers you're gonna have it in a kind of a crazy their isomers correct and it was the one thing everything we're talking about is like the ability to narrow the bands of what you're capturing well if you cuz you're right it's it's these little slices but the only way that's possible is that we've now created these massive machine that will process a lot so we get bigger trends you know we we see information come out of plant material from farms all over California grown differently going different ways different yields different strengths different compounds or the makeup of the cannabinoids in that specific strain like it's really interesting we get to see a lot of those so at the same time as we're narrowing the focus and really like getting to chop down into you know now we're we just picked up a machine that will separate out individual cannabinoids so you can collect them individually it's a centrifugal partitioning chromatography this company called rodeo cron they catch it you guys okay yeah sorry THC eight and ten are kind of like mine or like other cannabinoids that we've known about it but haven't been able to isolate so on the market are we gonna eventually see like THC eight tinctures and THC ten tinctures in the same way that we see other kind of my hair cannabinoid totally and we've been seeing mostly we've been seeing a lot of THC eight cart hay in cartridges and there is subsequently a decent amount of Delta ten THC that's in there well no they're just calling it if you're buying a card off the traditional market you they're saying it's one thing but who knows what really is in that cartridge right so but because you can take garbage oil and by attorney by doing this process to convert it to Delta eight clean it up to make it look clear a lot of guys do that ii buy a really cheap oil get a little bit of a fraction of that off and this really nice-looking oil and then it's just cheaper the way that that's produced then I like water clear Delta nine it takes extremely expensive absorbance and a process to do it with the Delta eight you throw some activated carbon in their flask and if you distill right here you can get water clear I mean there's a few other a few other parameters to change but you just dump a bunch of garbage in your flask and then just mix it with your oil and your oil is coming out nicely that was what a bunch of people were doing to fix their dark oil especially in the early day when people really weren't distilling very well", "bcvJBXr6bSU": "[Music] what is going on youtube it's your boy turpatom coming right back with you guys with a nice awesome medical cannabis review and this one i'm going to be doing a dislike cartridge durbin poison you guys know durbin poison is one of my favorite sativas right so as soon as i get out back in my little spot we're going to get straight into this derby poison the cartridge all right i'll see you right back so like i was saying this desolate durban poison grass root cartridge half a gram i believe it was uh 50 bucks and it was like 15 off i believe yesterday on their their sales they had so uh look at the numbers here guys real quick hopefully it focuses for you right you know i'll do my little zoom in thing give you guys all that nice info all right you guys remember uh it's a south african land race variety right uh energetic uplifted happy euphoric and creative well it's supposed to help the stress depression inside chronic pain muscle cramps and uh fatigue a similar strange like i was saying is jack hair super lemon haze ghost train haze uh j1 jack the ripper j or xj13 and clementine all right so i got my nice [ __ ] ooze stainless steel battery here i'm gonna hook this on it should be nicely freshly charged um there it is unopened all right let me get the sticker off um i haven't had a distillate cartridge for a minute um i mean if you consider co2 cartridges distillate then i guess that's a dislike cartridge but yeah i haven't had this cartridge in a minute so let's see hopefully the headspace is [ __ ] minimum probably won't be uh that's a [ __ ] man dude look at that headspace that is just crazy i feel like i get raped every time and i buy from them at least it's not 60 dollars for the [ __ ] sauce guard i guess i mean but still 50 dollars for a dislike cartridge bro i like the color on it but grassroots y'all really gotta gotta do something with this and i see that you actually changed the plugs up here so i'm sure it's going to be yes a hell of a lot easier so thank you for thank you for changing the plugs up on these things because my last video uh maybe the last few videos of the the uh grassroots cart like this i had a hard time getting this little piece out so thank you for that but man that headspace that headspace is just craziness like come on guys all right my dog's gonna bark so i'm stopping and i'll get married the head space yeah i'm really disappointed in this head space here guys i mean you're spinning 50 bucks even at 45 for a half a gram it should be [ __ ] full you know what i mean that is that's just it's just ridiculous it should be full i'm out back guys i'm sorry i can't i can't help the dogs bark in it and stuff like that uh it is what it is right but yeah let's hook this guy up to the [ __ ] battery and uh give it a go first i'm gonna do a dry test like normal all right it has that it has that super lemon that like uh lemon sweet a taste to it that taste word just wouldn't come out of my mouth there so yeah here we go once again thank you shout out to mark and uh young crews thank you boys here we go cheers that is definitely tasty you could really taste the lemon in this one guys this is really tasty and i was i was really expecting the distillate um the distillate tastes like like straight up um i really wouldn't say like a burnt cartridge taste but most thistles kind of have that burnt cartridge taste at least in my opinion it does right and this one does not have that burnt cartridge taste right now and for being distilled that's really good like i said this is a pure [ __ ] sativa guy so this is a good one for the morning it's a good one to smoke when you want to get stuff done yard work uh on a job site whatever it is and you got to get some [ __ ] done this is a good one to have on deck like i said they're really convenient they're really uh you know sneaky you know what i mean like like the smell on it on this one the smell is going to be like like lemon hazy kind of a smell sent to it don't smell like weed at all so i really love it i love these things and with the ooze batter it's nice slick too so uh if you can make sure you guys go pick up one of these nice slick batteries i think they're like 12 bucks 17 like that and they got the adjustable uh things too so i'm actually going to turn it up a little bit at 3.8 and start at 3.3 i'm going 3.8 and give this one a a hit a little hotter and see if i could get a little more uh terpene taste out of it let's go cheers all right so i had more of the lemon taste and had a little earthy taste as well uh so i'm guessing the hotter you get the more terpenes you kind of bring more to taste out and distill the carts some cartridges are opposite the less heat you have the more taste you have uh yeah so for for being a distillate cartridge after hitting it two times i would definitely call this one a win like i said i'm not happy with the headspace and uh normally most grassroots cartridges have that headspace it just the [ __ ] is there i mean what can you do about it you know what i mean besides [ __ ] about it and hopefully they fixed it they fixed a little cap issue so that's cool but yeah man i'm um thank you grassroots this one isn't too bad for being adjusted to the cartridge the taste is good the effect is good as you tell me i feel like i'm just just chit chatting away my eyes definitely feel a little low but they're always [ __ ] low right uh because you know your boy turbo tom stays turkey stays medicated uh 99 of time besides when i'm at work now with this new job but yeah anyway uh mama i love you guys make sure you smash that like if you want to leave a donation you guys know in venmo uh smash that like share subscribe all that good stuff yourself up money's durbin poison grass root this with the cartridges you won't be disappointed i'm telling you for being desolate you won't be [ __ ] disappointed alright peace out", "cVoQG7IDVD0": "hey again everybody this is Ken eccentric films and I'm excited to be back at you with another legal cartridge review here in Illinois as you can see this is a Lemon Drop disposable point three Gramm yes point three gram cartridge I didn't know they made them that small but you know it's a nice little disposable cart the first disposable I've tried here in Illinois and you can see it's in the matter line of products by far McCann which is a cultivator here in Illinois now in this instance I believe Lemon Drop is not a strain specific flavor but instead it's a kind of laboratory infused combination of terpenes for a sort of confectionery flavor I would say that flavor is definitely achieved it's got a delicious almost like that lemon head candy if you've ever tried those tastes just like that to me kind of a harsh hit but I really enjoy the high from it it very much that put me in a cerebral headspace where I was like really productive for at least felt like being productive and didn't want to sit still very sativa dominant in terms of the high for me but yeah great taste like I said a little bit of a harsh hit but I do like the disposable convenience and as you can see in this video here no external battery or charging required you just draw and you get a nice hit out of it and this stuff is good medicine now let's talk about price so pretty much the standard recreational price I'm seeing after-tax there's a little bit of give or take to this depending on where you're located in Illinois but pretty much to give in to price after-tax for these point three gram disposable carts is about 50 bucks which is an unbelievably horrible deal I can get full Graham carts for considerably cheaper that are just top-shelf quality from the black market which is the case for most people I know but nevertheless why I'm here is to document this legal cannabis situation here in Illinois and it's gonna continue to progress hopefully and hopefully prices will be less [ __ ] but hopefully this painted a good picture if you're interested in picking up this cart I would recommend it for it's great lemon confectionery flavor and its really awesome sativa dominant productivity inducing buzz that's all I got to say today though guys stay safe", "9CI5ulyvp3I": "accurate more than 99 accurate in detecting 12 different specific drugs according to the

it is that you have settled in to watch this video so today for our opening we have a new one from now I'm stay its whathe I've not had this brand yet so this is gonna be completely unknown of what we're gonna be looking at inside here today is June the 28th and it looks like we have a package day of June the second so it hasn't been in this bottle for too long hopefully it has a seal over it and because it has been in for a month so will dry out over that a little bit of time obviously before we get into that let's pull this guy up here there we go BAM right where it should be okay so we know she's working right bring my top off bring the top over zero it off I said zero it off I don't I don't know what that was anyway continuing sharp pronounce this name horribly wrong when it pronounced it - so opening this and we do have an air seal it's always a great sign because well it's not gonna completely just between my fingers hopefully we're gonna find out right now so bring it up here for a nice quick little view hmm welcome pretty nice lots of crystal give it a squeeze she has a bit of a bounce to her she bounces back a bit that's nice that's always good I'm gonna bring out a smaller piece here to try to run through my fingers so two fingers that's me absolutely nothing breaking off and I almost lost that one and it's completely unfocused there we go so we're gonna try it between two or three it is barely even coming apart definitely gonna need a grinder or some scissors or something for this guy I mean you probably pull it apart with your fingers but I can guarantee will won't break up as good as if you put it into a into some sort of grinder or such something is not right with my top today so I'm just gonna do that all right so bringing her in I mean it was a little bit of void space in the container again it's not one of the worst containers but it's also not one of the best containers so get the packaging down eventually I surely hope anyway moving on there is basically a non-existent amount of shake in the bottom of this once I start pulling it all the buzz even the last little bit in there seems to be but that is always good we don't like it when the guys try to fill up their last little bit with a bunch of shaking bottoms no one likes that let's be honest okay so it settles out 3.5 right on the dot awesome exactly where we want it to be kind of had a feeling this is gonna happen if you guys haven't noticed at first they were wavering a bit some of them we're a little bit lower some of them you know might have been not quite but we're good now I do believe that is all for this time guys until next time", "LfDTC8ihl28": "I must deal y'all and we'll get dope back with another banger y'all ready nois up if you new to the

and Instagram it's your boy captain cush beard with today's strain of the day I will be reviewing the last of my move gold sweet insanity I've been holding on to this for a minute as kind of a strain that not many people know about let's be honest because I can be a selfish bastard I'm gonna go ahead and say this strain is a freaking Goliath its potency is not that great it's like right around 70 percent sixty nine point nine seventy percent so some people are gonna turn their nose up at it not me I look at the strain DNA this strain is packed you've got gorilla glue number four you've got Rainmaker and Durbin poison I will say that again gorilla glue number four Rainmaker and Durbin poison this strain is a freaking banger I mean really heady I've smoked a lot of it so I can talk about it without hitting it that's actually what's steaming off there right now I decided to cheat and take a hit before I started but this stuff is just really really the sauce on top is really like syrupy the crystals underneath are very small they're not really thick but very very tasty I'm gonna go ahead my keys are falling out of my pocket over here I'm gonna go ahead and hit this and so tasty well oh oh wow so first thing I'm getting is hints of skunk hints of uh hints of skunk and cheese so that would be the Rainmaker I think there I'm kind of tasting that like gorilla glue on the back end and I still got some of my tool little bit of citrusy to little hint hint of citrusy so definitely tasting the Rainmaker definitely tasted the Gorilla Glue and I think those two tastes kind of kind of shut down the Durbin poison on that for me this is a really good one for me for just getting my mind right when my depression can be a little crazy at times for my pain before I found the RSO at night for my nighttime migraines and stuff that I was dealing with I was smoking a lot of this this is probably the fourth time I've gotten this weed insanity maybe the fifth I want to say actually yeah probably like the fourth or fifth I've probably gotten one of these for every month that I've worked at move I want to say and this time and this is the second time I got on the gold really enjoying it I've had it in the shadow also I've had it in the blue you know that and all and and all three I want to say I probably even had it in as been a disposable pen at one point I'm just really fond of it honestly like you can you can feel every hint of of what you're getting you know when you look at the strain DNA it's a sativa but it doesn't make my heart race like it doesn't it doesn't add to my anxiety I feel like if anything else it clears my mind up to function I've got a lot of clutter going on in there today if that makes sense tax day and my dumbass forgot to print at W - so I'm like scrambling around to do that at the last minute and then at the same time I had my physical therapy to go - still dealing with this pain in my neck honestly it just feels like it feels like someone's pouring hot water on my neck and show that's that that's the best way that I can put it and you know then just got [ __ ] to do you know you gotta get your life in order so that's kind of where you know where I'm at today I really needed this strain specifically and honestly before I head out um I'm gonna take another rip just just for the sake of now that is really crystally on that one so this is gonna be a fun little rip I think and close that up and we have liftoff [Music] keep talkin y'all take care", "BtNzwL-e4W4": "expiration date for this drug test cup is on or better than july 31st

if you are like me and have never tried northstar let's go ahead and talk about it this is almost a purebred sativa it is a 90 a 10 indica that is a cross between two of probably the most popular strains of all time one of which is northern lights the other is afghani so two old school strains coming together to create this north star so i'm gonna bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out then we're gonna take a look at it together okay so you just had a chance to check out this north star what did you think of this stuff let me know in the comments below so the first thing i got to tell you guys and local joint i i know i've addressed this before in my other reviews that i've done for you guys but why is the medicine not sealed why can anybody just go open these jars or packages in the back any of your da's can just open these seal the packages seal the package this is a health and safety concern you guys i know that this is not going to pass once wreck and uh the wreck bill goes into effect so yeah start sealing the bags here you guys this is like just unheard of now here's the deal and this is kind of something i want to talk about so this stuff was it's got a date on here of 9 24 september the 24th i picked this stuff up on 11 25 so basically two months after this stuff and i'm guessing was harvested or maybe packaged probably the package date so two months after the package date and i'm reviewing it a month after that so today is actually christmas day it's 11 25 today um so it's three months from probably the package so this is starting to get a little bit old it does have a thc percentage here of 17.42 now i'm not sure if that is the total thc or the total cannabinoids um i'd really like that printed on the package here so i don't really know but i'd be very curious to find out now um you know let's get into the smell let's just open this bag and see what's going on like a tiny bit of like sweet spice but i mean honest to god i really had to search for that there's really not any terps in this jar and uh are in this bag and i can tell you that when i ground this stuff up there wasn't really any additional flavor that came out i mean i did smell kind of some of the sweetness the haziness that was in the northern lights um but that's about it it's not like it smells bad or anything but like there's not really any terpenes to report i'm going to start calling this the covet weed you know honestly the weed that doesn't have any smell i'm just going to call coven weed so yeah i mean there's just not a whole lot of terpenes to report and let's look at the buds themselves and see what it looks like really not the best looking buds you guys these are just all popcorn buds in the eighth i mean and mind you this is a 33.8 i mean in honest-to-god 33 you can spend 35 and go get some sonoran roots from health for life um there's just not really like there's it's just that light lime green color these peach colored orange hairs they're not really sticking off the bud surprisingly the butt is actually still a little bit malleable which i'm shocked that it still got any malleability to it um this was absolutely run through an auto trim machine it's just all the butt is pressed up against the the nug you can kind of see that that's indicative of an auto trimmer it's not really sticky and there's just not really any trichomes on the butt i mean it's really really struggling in the looks and it's really struggling in the smell um perspective which is probably it's just it's indicating to me that this is probably going to lack in the taste department as well but what i want to do is before i get started here i want to go ahead and i threw this back before i started filming today up on the penny fenders test because i'm pretty sure i actually caught local joint pinching from a half ounce that i got from them so let's see if they were pinching on this north state uh star by copper state farm so here's the penny fingers test now okay so the time has come for the penny bingers test let's see if this north star by copper state farms weighs 3.5 grams like is listed on the package here it was weighed out by the local joint so let's see if they're penny pinching i'm going to go ahead we'll get the scale turned on here i'm going to put a dollar bill on the scale to make sure that this weighs 1 gram and that we're all calibrated here perfect let's go ahead we will put our cup on the scale and just so you guys see this bag is still sealed so let's go ahead we'll get our cup put on the scale i'm gonna go ahead and tear that out so that is not affecting the weight now let's get the bag opened up and we'll dump the contents into the jar and see if we have a pass oh no that is a penny pinch 3.46 grams from local joint penny pinching you guys that is very sad i am very disappointed in your local joint local joint local joint local joint a fail on the penny fingers test 3.46 that is just a travesty and a shame and i got to be honest with you guys i did call local joint a couple weeks ago about three weeks ago to tell them about my experience and a couple of the problems and issues i had with their buds one of which was them not sealing the bags the other witch was me buying bud that was like three four months old from them uh another of which is me telling them that i didn't like lemon terps only to walk out of there with a half ounce of bag of weed that had lemon terps um and i believe again the other issue is the penny pinching they never called me back and i was really disappointed about that and it's crazy because after i posted my review on instagram and youtube they reached out to me on my instagram page saying hey thanks for the review come back in and try the other flavors and it's like are you kidding me you guys never even followed up with me you never even returned my phone call after i took the time to call and address my concerns so yeah i'm until this gets resolved i'm not going back to the local joint to pick up more flour that's for damn sure um so i'll let you guys know if the issue gets resolved i'll update the comments here um but yeah did not leave a good taste in my mouth failing a penny pincher's test like that again definitely not leaving a good taste in my mouth local joint start calibrating your scales and if you're coming that close start putting all of your bags over you know 3.55 is not that hard to put on a scale but when you're penny pinching it just leaves a bad taste in patient's mouth so i can tell you that i really hope the taste in my mouth is a little better after i get some of this north star in me so today i'm going to be enjoying this north star hopefully enjoying this north star out of my arizer extreme q desktop vape i've got it set to 375 degrees fahrenheit as you see right there my whip which is basically just this silicone tube that gets the vapor from the vaporizer to me the end with the screen on it that one is going to go sit atop the bowl which is sitting on the vaporizer i want to smell that bowl to see how this stuff smells just a light subtle sweetness nothing really to report there um and so this is how that looks with the screen end going into the bowl that is sitting on the heating element the other end is going into my scientific innovations triple filtered bubbler i'm only using two of the three filtration chambers today i've got some uh brand new distilled water in the second a brand new organic cotton filter in the third that'll filter out any potential impurities that did not get purged out in the final stages of growing um and properly you know if this bud wasn't properly flushed that's going to certainly help and you know honestly i'm not super thrilled about the growing practices over there at copper state farm so i think i'm going to need all the filtration that i can get here um so if you guys are ready i'm certainly ready to get down let's try out some of this north star by copper state it's been on the back burner for a little while you guys you know i'm not a fan of copper state farms but i'm going to keep this review on bias so let's go ahead and burn it down and see what this stuff is all about okay so it's just kind of a little bit of a sweetness almost like a candy sweetness not really fruity maybe a little bit fruity but it's almost like a uh light candy so subtle sweet candy let me dive in for a second rip since that first one didn't produce a whole lot of visible vapor okay so kind of some more of that subtle sweetness not a whole lot of flavor here it was fairly smooth not the smoothest that i've had i had kind of a little pinch in my throat towards the end there it's really lacking in the terpenes maybe like now kind of like a sweetness a tiny bit of citrus in there it's not really doing much for me you guys i gotta be honest um in the flavor department at least just yet now i'm gonna finish out this bowl so while i'm finishing out this bowl i'm gonna bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out under the magnification with 25 times macro lens you can get a little bit of a better up close and personal view of this north star while i'm finishing the bowl so here it comes now okay so you are looking at the north star by copper state farms and this stuff has got that typical lime green coloration the orange hairs on this are very light in color they're almost kind of peach in their coloration and they are hugging up so tightly to the bud they literally like it's almost like so you guys see this butt is fully smooth and flat so the hairs are really really kind of mostly coming from underneath the bud and kind of just spreading like a little bit of a spiderweb inside of this but um definitely lacking in the um trichomes on this bud this but definitely looks like it was run through an auto trimmer no excess leaf material but um you know definitely indications that it was run through an auto trimmer you know while it's not the worst looking butt i've ever seen it's just that really really tightly packed dense but that looks like uh greenhouse grown bud like what they're growing down there at copper state farm so yeah definitely some room for improvement on this stuff okay so you just finished checking out some of this north star under that macro lens what do you guys think let me know in the comments below now you know i gotta be honest like this stuff yeah i'm not even i don't want to waste your time for those of you who are not gonna watch the you know till the end of the review but this strain in particular um and just copper state in general for me it's just not medicine that's really on the level which is why really the only time i review them is when i get these free eights or these free grams you know as a first time patient or like as a bogo or whatever it is um they're just not one of my go-to strains um there are some decent things about this and i want to talk about those um you know the potency actually being one of them shockingly because at first i was like this isn't coming on it's not coming out then i'm kind of like no you know what for like a sativa it's it's actually does have some some decent effects but i want to talk about those effects i want to talk about how i'm feeling how the whole process was so let's go ahead i want to start by talking about the looks and let me give you guys my rundown of how i do all of my reviews so all of the strains i rate i rate on a scale from 0 to 10 0 being the worst 10 being the absolute best i break that down to four different categories look smell taste and potency or how effective this medicine is i'll sign up to 2.5 points each in each of those respective categories we'll tally up the total at the end anything seven or above is going to get my dank thumbs up approval anything seven or below will not um and if it does get a seven or above i'll tell you if i would go out and buy this straight again so let's start by talking about the looks or bag appeal of this bud i'm gonna bring it up on the screen one last time so it's fresh in your mind then we'll go ahead and get into my final review on this north star by copper state farms okay so you just had a chance to see this bud let's go ahead and talk about the looks now to me there's just it's not like this is bad looking bud there's just not really anything redeeming about this bud and in all honesty it's like there's just there's like hardly any trichomes on it and just overall it's like the fact of the matter is that it's it seems like they sprayed growth regulators on these just because of how tight and packed the buds are it's it's been auto trimmed so ran through an auto trim machine which is kind of like just a grater that runs back and forth and trims up the bud um you know it's just got that light lime green coloration there's just not a whole lot of things that are like you know amazing about this bud so for me i think from the looks perspective it's only going to be a 1.0 out of 2.5 because it's like it looks okay but it really it just looks okay is how it looks um you know it not definitely not even a 1.5 on this and the looks and the smell i would say the same thing like you know the fact is there's really not any smell in this jar to begin with excuse me in this bag to begin with just this little bit of a sweet kind of a haziness um which is almost just a little like spicy almost kind of like peppery um but you know you gotta go searching for flavors on this so for me the smell is also only going to get a 1.0 out of 2.5 now the taste i thought this was going to be more like 1.0 but you know the more thought i gave it it's like it was pretty damn smooth all things considering and while there wasn't a whole lot of flavor it wasn't like it was like harsh or rough to smoke and even till the end of the bowl it was like it wasn't like it went to like that burnt flour taste real real quick and you know it was just not enjoyable at all like it was pretty smooth medicine i want to give them the benefit of the doubt in this category and give them a 1.5 um in the taste because it really it wasn't awful it just there's not really a whole lot of taste there so there's not a lot of you know flavor to report um so 1.5 in the taste out of 2.5 and let's get to the potency you know for me at first i thought this was a 1.0 because it really what didn't come on quickly at all it's kind of a little bit of a creeper but the more i you just kind of settled into this it's like it is a sativa dominant like almost full sativa um very alert very energizing i can certainly go do anything i need to do today very clear minded and you know not really any haziness a tiny bit of you know i got a little bit of pressure on my head some very subtle effects in the body um but it's mostly a heady type feel you know i do have that pressure and it's it's in my head a little bit of cloudiness a little bit of haziness but honestly god i'm still pretty damn focused for the most part um so yeah i you know it's funny i think i would put this potency at a 1.5 as opposed to a one um even though it's not very very potent medicine it's like that you know the analogy i i you use you guys like the car that just like you know uh the the the light turned green and then it just went and stalled out or like the airplane that never took off you know so you know i i'm gonna put it a 1.5 in the potency so for those of you who have been following it's a 1.0 and uh look 1.0 in the smell 1.5 in the taste and 1.5 of the potency so it's going to be a 5.0 for me from uh for this copper state the north star by copper state farms you know not the worst meds i've ever had but certainly not going to be getting our dank thumbs up approval it's going to get a booth thumbs down that x this nickel cross and uh you know again this has a 33 price tag on the back i don't know anybody who'd be buying this for 33 bucks if you are one of them i i'm sorry i i feel bad if you have to go grab this because truthfully i'd probably rather just not really puff or like let my tolerance come up and puff this meds uh and you know local joint get it together with the penny pinching and just with the recommendations that you guys are doing and you know call back your customers when they're calling to give feedback to you guys about the dispensary and about your herb um it's this this whole experience did not leave a good taste in my mouth and again i know this was a freebie but yeah it's like free or not let's put it this way i i wouldn't drive down there to get this as a freebie that's for damn sure i don't care if they're giving it away literally absolutely free like i got mine for free um just not worth it so yeah unfortunately this north star by copper state farms not getting our thumbs up um and let me know what do you guys think it's a 5 out of 10 fair let me know in the comments below and then let me know what you guys want to see me review next and until then you guys please take care of yourself and one another and i look forward to seeing you guys again soon peace", "-Zubr2VnWN4": "our next speaker is a Monica Garcia there well from Mexico she cried graduated in agricultural engineering from tech damontre in Mexico and afterwards she works in a worked in the lunar greenhouse project in Arizona in the United States and then she came here to do her master's degree in the in our program and Monica will give us a representation on characterization of only two gallon accessions by morphological traits and resistance to a peck to bacterium a carrot of orem okay good morning everybody as already mentioned we're going to talk about Bernadeau gallium characterization biological traits and resistance to speculate film character border reto golem is a genius of herbaceous bubbles perennials belonging to a family yes Santa say this flower is native from South Africa and it has colors sorry from a white to jello to do to deep orange some members of these generals are used as ornamentals either for cut flowers or pot plants production depending on some character characteristics mainly morphol morphology searches in fluorescent size and number of flowers and commercial bulk production of furniture golem is mainly concentrated in Israel South Africa Netherlands and United States in fact Israel is responsible for the eighty percent of the flower sales at the European market during the winter set season with the total sales of 15 million euros a few species offer neato golem are known for the has sapped ability to sell broad bacteria vector bacterium character boredom character burnham specifically these bacteria produces produces spectre lytic enzymes that causes the softening of the tissue and eventually it's complete maceration indeed the susceptibility of Anita Gollum to this pathogen is the main limiting factor for its development and production and this pathogen enters mainly through stomata organs and we can see here colonization of this pathogen in the intercellular spaces and the complete maceration of the chloroplast and here we can see complete macerated bulb today the main control is through cultural practices and there's no chemical control existence because of these the only the only option is through breeding and according to previous research some cultivars and a species over NATO volume are more resistant than others to pick the bacterium but even so there are no reports of this time screen for assistance against this pathogen in the genomes taken together this is studying Intendant to find a species and cultivars suitable for inter and intra specific breeding towards more resistant or need a valium varieties and this study was divided into sections the first one was with greenhouse plants were morphological traits biochemical assays and bacterial resistance SI was measured and the second part in tissue culture greater of growth and development of planting vitro were recorded and bacterial resistant SI the first part the greenhouse plants which were grown in a polycarbonate greenhouse 13 lines were used in this section which were divided in four different groups depending on the species dubium destroyed us arabic on and some hybrid and the first experiment was the measurement of morphological traits his was performed for the three months twice a week the leaf length and width of the first to develop lives we wanted to see if there was some correlation with the development of the inflorescence and the flowering the inflorescence length number of open flowers and the sides of one open flower for each inflorescence here we found first the inflorescence size as we can see the group's the lines that got the biggest inflorescences we're sodas an arab Akoum with an average of 60 to 70 centimeters we can also see that the dubian group with were much more smaller in general and they reach a high height of maximum 40 centimeters of more or less and in the hybrids we can see that they reach an intermediate size this characteristic is really important because for cut flowers it is more desired inflorescences equal or greater than 50 centimeters whereas for pot plants it's better to have inflorescences less than 50 centimeters also we can observe that for example the the line 452 was one of the most uniform in development in this group and we see that the 99 4960 reach up to really soon in the season and didn't continue developing more and these two lines to 10 3 and 2 10 5 had a really slow development at the beginning and then at the end they they had a more faster development then we have the average number of flowers where the most flowers were seen in the Destroyers group with a total of 74 flowers and then a we got the most flowers in the hybrids was the line 281 and in the dubian they were yv was the most whereas the lines with the least number of flowers where it is to also in dubium we can also see an interesting trait that some lines started to flower from the beginning of the season and continue building flowers all along whereas others like this one just flowers at the end of the season and almost open all the flowers at the same time this is also very interesting because again for cut flowers we we want all the flowers to open up at once whereas for pot flower for pot plants we want a flowers all along the season so here we can see the differences and the hybrids might be better for pot for pot plants because they mostly just open up all the flowers at the same time we also had the size of the flowers where the biggest flower was in there a vehicle that estoy this sorry this graph is divided in groups the red is dubium this is their sodas arabic kumon hybrids so here also inter-service we see a very big flowers we also see that the hybrids got intermediate flower size between these lines and the smallest flowers were concentrated here in these lines we can see these result better here a comparison of color and size of the flowers again we have the biggest flower arabic ohm and their sodas and then we see that dubium has much more smaller flowers and the hybrids got an intermediate size except for this one but it this is very interesting because we can see that the size of the flower can be inherited to the offspring as well as the color because we have very deep orange colors here and white here whereas we have a more moderate jello in the offspring and then we we did some biochemical assay to measure the indirect resistance to the bacteria and this because we have it has been seen in other studies especially in potato that the level of the nose and the activity of ends of sums and sounds like DeRozan A's and peroxidase are related to the resistance to vector bacterium carrot-o room and they even a correlate with each other for these so for the protein activity SI first we did a protein extraction using two biological repeats from young lives of a tornado gallium line and then we we move to the protein assay using be ored SI for quantification then the enzymatic SI we use different buffers we used oppa to measure the terseness activity and we'll use tmb for peroxidase activity afterwards we read the absorbance at different levels for different buffers for this one we see that the highest level was seen in their sodas and the lowest levels were seen in dubium however the levels of protein were lower than expected and here also for tyrosinase we see that the levels are more uniform along the lines with the exception of the YB in the dubian but even though we have some differences in the lines a we believe that the below the levels were very low because of the time of the physiology physical physiological a stage of the plant at the time of the of the sampling because for a practical purposes we made the measurements at advanced stages of flowering so I think measuring this early in the season we'd also be helpful to observe the level of activity of the proteins then we have the poly phenolic concentration and it was done also using two biological repeats per line then the samples were fractionated with xane to remove hydrophobic residues the final x SI using phenol reagent and then we measure the absorbance and at seven thirty five nanometers here we can observe that the levels were higher we got a really high levels of the nose and we can see a trend that the hybrids reach a really good levels whereas our aleikum reach really low levels and this line also had really a high levels and however as we are going to see further these this chart doesn't reflect previous results where the phenolic level is correlated strongly with the resistant to other bacteria and because Arabic whom was saying that it was really a resistant to the bacteria further analyses have to be done at early stages to say this and finally we did the resistant essays on leaf accession disks first we prepared bacterial cells with gfp protein then 20 millimeter leaf discs were placed in dishes like this one and each lyptus was pierced at the center and infected with bacterial suspension after this they were preincubated at 22 centigrade for 24 hours and then transferred to incubation at 28 out centigrade for 24 hours here we can see the leaf discs for hours a 48 hours post-infection with PCC here we can see some references whereas this is almost completely clean we see intermediate level of infection till a complete maturation of the leaf discs we can also see this here this was taken in a binocular using gfp protein and white light first we see the control which was a very susceptible line belonging to the dubian group which is known that is a very susceptible then we can see the negative control we can see nann infection here and then we see again I radical which is very resistant and then 452 belonging to the dubian group also with a medium resistant there were two to measure the resistance we measure the average area in millimeters of infection and the percentage of this of this infected as we can see the control was completely infected whereas we got none infection and the negative control and then we see that the most susceptible lines were in the dubian group this one too and then the most resistant lines were Arabic on their soils and the hybrids got really good levels as well so here we also see that there was some correlation between the level of proteins fennels and the resistant in the high rates we got really good resistant in the hybrids however we didn't really get correlation in the Y V which presented really high levels of finals however it was susceptible and also arabic own and then a tissue culture here we work with 16 lines again we divided these lines in the four different groups and then we started with the tissue culture propagation and youngleafs segments were used to generate calluses and produce cell cultures of eternity volume line for these we used live segments we cut it into small size square pieces and grown into media with hormones after that they were incubated in a growth chamber at 24 centigrade with 14 10 hours light dark cycle afterwards we transplanted the plantlets into a new medium without hormones then after 70 days we transfer again the plantlets into the same medium and later a we transfer the plantlets into a hormone without sugar to prepare it for bacterial infection here we can see the small square pieces the initial tissue culture and and then we see the development of the bowl blitz shoots and roots of the first stages and then the last stage where we only transplanted 5 plantlets for each flasks and then what we observe was that the fast development in a total of twenty three weeks was seen in these two lines that were the hybrids whereas in these other lines we also saw a good development but a little bit smaller and the lines that didn't react at all where these ones so we couldn't use these lines to to do the bacterial infection so for the resistant SI a we use ten leaf segments of 20 millimeters a of our interval on lines in an angle shape as we can see here we place it in a petri dish and then fresh cultures of a vector bacterium were prepared for inoculation and then the bacterial culture was in the middle of each petri dish and finally they were incubated in the growth room at 22 centigrade the main symptoms we could have served in this essay was the colonization not only in the tissue but also in the media we saw yellowish and softening of the tissue and we saw some bending of the of the segments so we did the first observation after seven days and this was very interesting because mostly all the lines were still green we can see the negative control completely perfect also the the positive control was still green and we just started to observe a little bit of jelly wish we did a second of observation after 10 days and then we could observe much more the symptoms hearing the positive control the tissue was already completely macerated and really gelish and in general in the other lines we started to see some bending much more bending and a bigger colonization of the bacteria in the medium and as a difference in the control we could only mostly see the infection in the tissue whereas in the other lines we also saw it in the medium so the result was that in the disorders a group these serial serial 36 was more resistant than this line but but both were really good and both produced some routing it was really interesting to see that besides the bacterial infection actually a deer stories lines i started to route also this belongs to their stories and produce the biggest roots and this is belief that the quality of their starters for routing may propose that they can also be propagated but by leaf segments we also saw that in the hybrids this one looked more resistant than this one and this line had a medium resistant and this was expected because it belongs to the dubian a group and again this is the most acceptable one we can see the example of the hybrids again here here we have the parents this is a very susceptible line in the dubium group and it is at their stories which is known that it's very resistant this is 10 days postinfection and we can see that these stitch tissue is already getting macerated whereas this looks really good and we can see intermediate resistant in these two lines but however we can see some differences in the resistant this again was more resistant than this one and to conclude this it was very useful to separate the lines in in groups because this allowed to see that some trains were transferred to the hybrids such as the resistance such as the flower size and color and we saw very important traits in found in Arabic ohm and this was very interesting to see because it is the first time that such resistant analysis is made in this line also that your sodas groups is show very good resistant whereas the dough biam we're very susceptible however the dubium are have interesting traits in flower color for the breeding programs and biochemical assays need further replicates and correlation we believe that we need to do more essays a long decision to make comparison of the protein levels and activity because at the moment we made it the proteins were already degrading Thank you Thank You Monica yeah we have some time for questions seem to be that you are well using several methods to several methods to describe the resistance of your lines so one was on leaves one on seedling so shoots young shoes and then you took the shoots and you a go and you checked did you see any differences between the lines when you're comparing all these methods or all these methods gave you the same results and you mean the resistant in vivo and in vitro yeah we have a general trends like the dubium always showed the most susceptible resistance and then the tier soil is a that you certain was really interesting because we observed the resistant both in vivo and in vitro because we were able to propagate them in vitro so we saw that in both in both systems it was resistant I rabba come in the other hand and we believe that it's a very interesting line to use it in breeding programs however it hasn't been able either even knew even in other studies to propagate in tissue culture so we cannot relate it to it yeah some lines didn't react to tissue culture and also the hybrids we saw that they got intermediate resistant in both in vitro and in vivo and for example in vitro we have a lot of systems that you can use to to see the resistant and we use specifically this one because we had a very few material do we have other protocols that I don't know my look different Monica how is this disease distributed in in agricultural fields or greenhouses how is it is easy transmitted from one plane to the other from one field to the other yeah it is um the the bulb laughs they have to be change a every a every short periods because the infection gets transmitted through the bowl blitz and the lives and well I don't know in other countries if it's really distributed but at least here in Israel is a big problem and also in South Africa but once I have a greenhouse with with the clean from the disease and the ballots are clean then Nick how do they become yeah how do they become infected because it's an opportunistic bacteria so it enters through wounds so especially if the workers are not careful with the tools it can be easily transmitted by the by the workers or by not having the proper cleaning and it enters also through stomata so yeah it is very contagious between the plans yes botelho see how long time you wait to see the result of the bacterial infection si after how many hours are after how many days you you took the result of the bacterial infection se which one in vitro in vivo both and in vivo was measured after 24-48 hours and then the in vitro was after seven and ten days did you have some replicates also and we only did once we had replicates I mean different petri dishes replicates for the lines but we didn't repeat the experiments afterwards okay in your result there was a line which has higher phenolic compound within it but the resistance he was poor that means the resistance is not related to the phenolic compound what is your conclusion about it it is believed that it is correlated that the thing is that we did them the sampling at a late flowering stage so at this stage we believe that some of the compounds were already a degrading and for example a well never mind and the YB with so really low levels of fennels and however it was very susceptible when we did the experiment this line was still flowering was still at developing whereas in Arabic oom we got really low levels of a nose and we really high resistant and this was because they are a beacon was much more a say nothing the flowers were already dying trying so we believe that this affected the results that means if you check the same plant line in different good condition they will perform different yeah I think we believe that if we do this analysis in different stages especially at early flowering we can see more active levels of proteins and finals thank you monica after doing all this a work in the greenhouse and at the lab can you actually give a recommendation for the next breeding program I mean for next year do you have any ideas what should be the best lines and the cultivars to to try yeah I think I ravikumar three sodas would be really interesting lines a 44 resistance I and also for big flowers the hybrids would be I think interesting to grow them for pot plants because they beer the flowers at the end of the season they open all the flowers at the same time also it would be interesting to find a way to propagate arabic comb in tissue culture and find if a we can observe the same resistant here and the dubians were would be very interesting for the flower color other questions please yes indila here this small question forgot the negative concern and just curious about that I'm sorry the negative control was not infected we only put water on it and the positive control was infected with the bacteria we use for this dopey online which already we already know that it's very susceptible are there any other questions please okay so thank you very much Monique on"}
