{"LCTKbSAgqkE": "[Music] what is going on you [ __ ] bunch of stoners my name is yay 1 and in today's video we're going to be discussing the pros and the cons of opening a tall piece and a short piece as you can see today I've got native the tallest piece that I have at 15 inches our Cheech and Chong be Kabam we also have the Cheech and Chong up in smoke which is measuring 8 and about 7 inches so tall versus small we're going to take two hits out of each piece discuss the pros and cons of you know hitting out of a tall and small piece if at any point of time you do enjoy this video guys make sure you smash the [ __ ] out of that like button if you're new to the channel hit that big beautiful red subscribe button and that notification bell so you can stay posting when we drop more videos like this or we go live with you bunch of stoners so I'm going to start off with the the tall piece here I'm going to take a rip out of the Cheech and Chong bika as I said this is measuring 8 of 15 inches so we're actually smoking on some of the locomotion flour today shoutouts to Bryan from GM GP let us know down in the comments what we you are smoking on and let's [ __ ] sync our first cone out of the Cheech Cheers okay so now what I do like about beakers is the fact that you are able to stack the smoke the smoke does take quite a while to obviously reach your lips until it gets to the point where you're actually inhaling smoke so what I find with beakers is they're very good for taking big rips and being able to actually clear them so like bait beakers so this is the one that I'm dreading in my opinion that the smaller the piece of the hasher that it is this piece as I said the Cheech and Chong up in smoke sort of the little rig here I think that it's personally more of a debrief than it is for flour I've taken two apps out of it and I've taken flare out of it and I can I can personally say in my opinion that it's definitely more of a debrief let me know down in the comments what you personally think if this is more of a debris or piece for flour so hit number two eight of the seven inch Cheech and Chong up in smoke Rick let's get it now compared to the pica halfway through that Bowl I did not think I was going to be able to snap it as I said with the pika obviously the more room you have to stack the smoke the bigger of a hit you can take where is the small piece here as soon as I like that bowl the smoke it's already at my lips and I am already inhaling smoke so I thought what better way to bring out both sized pieces take two [ __ ] fat rips head of them and explain what we do and don't like about them both so what I am going to do is I'm going to take one more rip with you all head of the trusty beaker before we do sign this eight it's the first time actually properly properly smoking the locomotion flour here and I can say that it is it is quite nice I have been smoking the red cookies now for a good while so as you Stormers do know it is good to mix up the strains once in a while because you can get immune to it quite quickly so hit number three out of the Cheech Speaker of the locomotion flour I hope you all enjoyed this video please hit the like button if you haven't done so already let's take one more to the face Cheers [Music] good night Irene the who so there we have it you bunch of beautiful [ __ ] stoners tall this small which do you prefer let us know down in the comments you know the drill if you can't cope talk mob there is hope smoke dope I will see you all in the next one you [ __ ] bunch of stoners peace

get a poke for the weed i am stoked i had a comment made about the correct way to fill this type of a bong thank you for that here's the thing i tried i went to the link that you sent tried to fill it the appropriate way having both these covered and i got a mouth full of bong water that's what builds community giving each other tips seeing what works for you we just got to hear each other out right it's a good way to be cheers delightful david made a comment asking me about what it is about roar that i liked they were interested they are priced in a different category than most glass and so i think it's a fair question to be asked if it's worth the money my immediate answer is yes but please don't think that you can't get fabulous quality glass for a lot less money i mean if i had to pick it would be a tough tough choice to choose you know roar over those and so that's my honest opinion however i'm gonna go with my gut and say it's worth saving for okay i had to get a shirt on cause i'm right underneath the vent and i was getting the chill these are the two war bongs that i have come here come here with mama come over here it's not time yet it's not your not your show today i know you can't really see the lettering i know my lighting is crap hey y'all i'm not asking to get paid for this i'm doing this because i love you because i know you love me back that's all you can see the difference in the um just the thickness sorry my brain was not with the quickness with the word thickness this one's a lot thicker than this one and then okay you're on i'm not gonna give you something super official uh if you wanna do the research do the research i'm just gonna give you the information from me to you that i have in my head which between you and i do the research don't rely oh that should be a t-shirt i don't even think i told you guys what i'm smoking i'm smoking colombian gold from potent planet i i don't think i have any more ground up because i loaded my bows i brought in this one for example because this is also one of my absolute favorite brands which is mad glass or maverick glass you've got the papa bear the mama bear and the baby bear as far as thickness goes i have to say of the three i'm definitely a daddy's girl [Music] well i do tend to like my sturdy girls we're reliable folk i know the reliability however i love the pieces themselves the simplicity to me and then they have some that are not so simple that are just outstanding pieces of art i feel like they are constructed to hit differently than i want to hit as a regular bong user so let me just clarify that for the most part i'm bongs all day long and dabs that's kind of my thing is it it's fantastic if you are looking for like one or two just trips you know then then these are great chug-a-lug down stem hole in the bowl just huge everything about this for a constant use daily driver no for me at least so i love the pieces not crazy about the down stems well that's fixable and i i know that they have other options for down stems and i am at some point going to entertain those options but for now i have other way cheaper options and different bowl pieces you can swap out and i just use this is like ten dollars i think on any old website or headshot i don't know how much they'd be in a head shop fits just perfectly whichever size down stem you have you can swap it out so swap that out i need a 14 inch i'm sorry 14 inch bowl holy toledo uh 14 millimeter joint there she goes and i've already loaded her up you're welcome i'm feeling spacey like real spacey so this is a straight tube this is really neat kind of signature roar stuff this one has ice catcher in here which i i've used ice a few times in here on real hot days just to be silly and seasonal but not really i don't really need it i love the lettering the orange and blue i know it's kind of hard to see oh gosh it reminds me of roller skate attire cheers that one hit pretty good this one is i didn't tell you oh gross it's all slimy from the sea looks like i pulled it out of a lake this is the roar straight to i'm a lot more lifted than i thought i'll bring but this so let's take a little break after an assortment of minutes and seconds we're gonna would you it is not your time today they are not wanting to talk about you before that's nice and chill before we take our head off of the beaker bong our beaker here oh you can see a little bit better the lighting's better because there's less of it because time has gone by i told you i needed a minute if there's just this tiniest little corner and i don't neglect my corners i put nothing in the corner including baby so i want to show you guys look i got real sleepy made myself a coffee there's caffeine in my boot my kids got me that let's polish this off cheers well that was a terrible sorry about that there really wasn't much in there i wasn't paying attention i was trying to make sure i didn't burn the ding ding house down again okay done with this one this thing's been smoking so long if you're not much of a smoker but you want to associate with smokers grab yourself some raw hemp wick and just just hang out with this is the roar beaker bong it also has the ice catcher in it this is thinner i'm trying to remember what the measurements are i didn't prepare but i am prepared to take a hit for you um i always love a good beaker bong because it's so simple it's so easy to clean this does have the replacement down stem in it so this is not the roar down stem that was massive good night above look at the size difference i'm just saying we're gonna do it with some diy daily drivers on fire from the neighborhood kid but always lights fires [Music] i would say that's cash there's like a couple crumbs on the side i don't think i could get another hit but i'll try josh yep there was nothing there couldn't get anything all right so good did that one but what a mess look at that mass it's very important not happy about the mass if i had to choose between the straight tube and the beaker i would 100 percent go with the beaker even as the daily driver this is the size a hit it takes me fairly all day to find the comfort i'm just going off of what i have look at this magic it's kind of graphed itself in such a way i'm so high right now i do not want to explain to you guys how cool my brain thinks it is that we've sized itself off like that just to give you a glimpse of how high i am my mind is blown so this truthfully would be if i was going for the biggest hits of the three it would be this maverick one um however this produces enormous clouds too my go-to though would probably be the standard beaker one thing i will say about roars is when you get into those lower priced pieces this is not the higher end at all but it's definitely not the low light my mind is not prepared for this conversation but it's called like little sister or something i wouldn't go with those if you're if you're really wanting a roar piece and can save for a little bit i would just save and get something that you don't have to have there's like a carb carb function on it there's like a carb hole on it so who wants a roar that you have to like carb i mean i wouldn't i and it's not that much of a difference to save a little bit more you know what i mean unless you're going for like the mondo pieces so don't go for the little sister ones i think they're mostly blue or something save a little bit longer otherwise you know you're going to have like a carb cap carb hole to cover while you take a hit and who wants that you're supposed to be moving on up like the jeffersons not i what are you paying for at that point you know what i mean so that's my opinion it's my opinion i could be totally wrong i have no idea why i'm doing this literally just took a hit off of i don't even know why i have this because i am not a fan of smoking dry flour my throat now feels shredded i did all these bong rips and i feel totally fine about it and then i take like one hit off of this this columbian gold glass blunt and uh yeah my throat feels shredded so just do something cool but make sure you're taking care of yourself first that's the most important okay i'll talk to you guys later i hope you're having a great day", "84WnrvqiPGY": "what's up guys today we're gonna be doing a screening view we have three screens here we have this silver screen we have a glass screen which is more like a what they're called is see mines but you can see it it's in a weird shape sitting right here and then we have the brass screen so glass brass and silver so my favorite of them all it's gotta be the this one the glass the glass screen my bad but only for material dry material when I like not saying I won't use it what material I mean dry material and what material yes but material in general but for concentrates like hash or things like whatever else concentrates you guys like this is not for you because that that would not help with that kind of stuff I mean it would kind of but these are a lot more effective but concentrates and the difference between silver and the brass is really nothing it's just the type of material which you prefer I don't taste any difference I don't see any difference I don't feel any different so I don't believe they're actually different there could be a difference I don't know I'll have to research it out for myself the areas leaving the comments I'll do a review of this just to make sure I get what you guys are talking about or make sure I get the accurate information cuz I want to be my I want my reviews all like accurate and stuff so so I'll pull out a screen for each one I should have pulled it out previous or before but pull out now sorry my phones are getting texts so checking it won't do this so here are the three screens out of the box these glass ones would cost you a little bit more but they last forever basically I mean they can potentially break but I never broken one in my life and I always had this one I've been using it for the last four or five months so really good stuff it's gonna close up with the silver and the brass screens I can't read touch it just to focus white focus yeah there we go so the brass the silver the bolts are nice I think the silver is a little little thinner will catch a lot more material and the brass screen you can kind of see is is more thicker so I guess that's the difference there's one size is order brass is usually bigger and more like a bigger micron size and this is a smaller micron size so how they work basically I got a small bowl here or a medium bowl out I'll call it myself a small bowl because I seen like bigger bowls I have a bigger bowl but to someone else it may be big to them so you just take it like that you can either take a pen or you can take your pinky but I like to use the pen like this it's just a pen cap just put it in the middle and press it in and I'll give it the curve of what you try to do I'm having a hard time doing this because I need you don't I don't I'll do this but it's press in it's a brand new piece we're not writing a piece by a clean piece so it doesn't want to stick in like all usually does but you can use angle you can push it into the hole really durable anyway so basically that's what you get and oops I keep tipping it over I don't know what's problem but when you get material on there it'll stay in place it's pieces it's really slippery I guess and it works pretty well brass screen should be just as difficult because I'm having problems I just pushing it my finger works a lot a lot better now so you can just push it with your finger it works out generally good well as you can see it's more for I would suggest it's more for concentrates only because it's harder to put in and it would keep out concentrates pretty well but if you're gonna be doing straight material just take one of these babies you focus on that seal smaller they are you stick it in go catch yourself one of the prongs inside of it usually you want the longest prongs to be in there and then it catches it like that hold it like that you probably see it just oh just out of focus anyway so you see it has gaps in there so let's the air through but none of the material usually gets through depending on the both sides cuz if I stick this in the big bowl it completely blocks almost all of it so it's a lot better but it fits very nice so I do recommend these they work forever over the brass and the silver but you know if you doing concentrates silver and brass is your better bet yeah they're really cheap I don't remember the actual prices so sorry about that gotta tell you the prices but you guys can look it up for yourself it's not that much it's really cheap maybe like a dollar at most for these usually I don't know depends where you buy it from but yeah so thanks for watching guys kind of a long video but thanks for staying and watching the video peace", "jl4UhzjqYY0": "hello everyone this is a wax class for this piece we have five colors for choice now I will show you this piece the thick piece is a 10 millimeter and the

] mom go ahead two different pieces you don't hit the classic old-school if I'm about this I really know a focal Joe you're gonna [ __ ] a little [ __ ] with that big-ass glass you know gonna [ __ ] with this today also we're gonna do a little comparison to the [ __ ] maverick show me not nothing crazy now I'm got a pretty easy new piece for y'all but you know going to a person I'll do the rest of my pieces if I mean they definitely hit differently one of them was cheaper than the other but that also certainly mean it hits better that wasn't certainly been hints of it I believe it at that [ __ ] on so let me describe the hips I get from either peace with the maverick with this math piece it definitely hits how a bigger supposed to hit which it was means the smoker supposed to stack in the base in the beaker base then when you lift when you lift the [ __ ] ball to inhale all that [ __ ] rushes to your [ __ ] lungs your favorite sauce was here to bomb not all the time something like that all the time but if it doesn't it's usually because the ball was there's a lot of airflow it was the airy straight as a dry and strange there's a lot of airflow such it was you rushing through it could be whatever so obviously when you're hitting the ball as you can tell you don't want too much air flow through that bowl you want to pull nice and slow when you're hitting the beaker at least some shots again which I took a big clean he wants to burn a little slow so the smokin step because if it's very fast the smoke is gonna build up it's gonna all go the ball Peola period I came over to the boat is you gonna call you throw off it's gonna be terrible that usually happens with this [ __ ] like for some reason with this thing I was last May because of how thick the glasses I don't know maybe thick as last is better for [ __ ] day breaks maybe think that's better for divers who knows but that's something guessing on assuming that when I hit this one you're gonna see the smoke start to sack here but then quickly rise up to the top so that one that the guys last one that the smoke stacks in the [ __ ] neck that [ __ ] is a little harsher so I'm gonna hit that first feel me yeah hit that first this is gonna be a little harsher overhead still got that gg5 y'all filming point five letting each bomb it's a bomb you already know horse Bob let's get it got the trusty dusty torch you filming that Eagle torch let's get it all right the reason I gave that thumbs up is because the smoke was actually stacking in the base everybody else saw that the smoke was actually stacking in the base I stand corrected you know I mean it's how we hit it you gotta know I date a bong really cuz you just the type of person that [ __ ] lights the ball and just pulls and pulls and pulls and pulls it's not going to be the best best piece for you think as God's will not be the best piece for you because that [ __ ] will build up right into your drill you for trying to build up the smoke if you trying to stack it in the beaker you don't want to hit it slowly so it can't stack so I think the thing guys baths slowly I wasn't just ripping her like I used to I had to slow this whole wood stack and actually did anyway let's pack up this next mold get to the next piece and see how she's saying I ready for hit number two Oh focus show it done you gotta focus bro come back to reality come back back to yo GI Kevin was Isis no anyway we got this port five children let's go my camera right now hold on relax relax relax - shoo she's still bugging out anyway [ __ ] it I'm so that wasn't the guys buy ourselves a but a pool I expected also better pool I was a better hit than I expected on some real [ __ ] it really was I expected [ __ ] that's it straight up until my long term that did not just stack them I'm impressed the guys last is a plus in this video leave a like for thick-ass last you should we shout out this is the maverick now Maddie's mom alright this [ __ ] is they're not gonna soil alright job to put Fargo zg5 let's see how this ball gets compared to the other one y'all could rewind watch I'm gonna be wanna watch let's see yeah this isn't necessarily maverick vs. thick as grass is not brown versus brand nothing like that it's just different options there for you know not every glasses now not every glass blower is the same for me that all glass is the same every company's gonna have different yeah odors yeah I know this [ __ ] [ __ ] that as you see the smoke stacked a little little more in the base in that bond than the other one still [ __ ] with a

break I broke my very favourite Bowl you guys know that I got this about maybe a month or two ago enough already broke it it dropped off with my dad skin shattered into two pieces so I was looking online for some different types of bowls just because I wanted something different I feel like the number one problem that I have with bowls is that they get clogged super easily and I feel like that's because there's only one hole in a bowl so I looked online to see if I could find something a little bit different and I found this bowl that I think I have never seen anything like it before and I think it's super impressive I've used it over the break quite a few times and it functions extremely well so I am proud to show you guys the 25 whole bowl there are legitimately 25 holes in this bowl it is a thirty two millimeter Bowl that is attached to a 14 millimeter joint so the bowl is massive which I love because you guys know I hate packing bowls like that's my least favorite thing to do in the world is to pack bowls so this is a massive ass bowl with 25 holes in it so I'm sure it will not get clogged hopefully but let's smoke out of this I'll show you guys its function it really does function extremely well the one thing that I will say that I have not liked about it is that it is a [ __ ] to clean as you guys can imagine each one of those little holes gets clogged up with resin and basically I had to use a toothpick to kind of just like poke through each of them because it did get clogged eventually but it took a lot longer than it normally does for my bowls to get clogged I already have some cherry white widow ground up in the buds and beards grinder so I will load that up into this bowl and I'll show you guys the function when you first start to use it like right out of the pack because none of the holes are clogged the airflow is insane and almost like not in a good way like it's almost too much airflow to start with but once you use it one or two times a few the holes will start to get clogged up with resin and legitimately it makes the perfect bowl like I swear it's really really nice and even when you first start to use it it's not that it's like unusable it's just it takes some like getting used to because you're just not used to this much air flow from your bong it just feels like you don't have the proper seal or something even though you do and you get massive clouds from it anyways I guess I'll show you guys the function of it this is made in the USA by the way by a glass worker in New Mexico I got it on eBay but it is like made in the USA American made glass so I'll leave a link to it in the description of this video just in case any of you guys are interested all right let's light her up I feel like I should like get close up to the camera so that you guys can really see the function of the smoke going down through it all right you guys Cheers ooh but as you guys can see that smoke cloud was massive and thick and nice I [Music] love this bowl it's a great like party piece but it's also like great for somebody who just like does not like packing bowls and who just corners their bowls like me oh this is amazing and I feel like because of the shape of it all of those holes are actually functional like even when you're only using the right side of the bowl those holes on the left side still are like pulling through air and it creates like almost a cyclone in here and you can kind of tell that the smokes all gathering up and like collecting and building up and I feel like that's what makes the hits so big I'm out of breath trying to talk and hit this ooh let's hit it again cheers you guys I always feel like I have to hold my bong it's such an awkward angle to like get it all in the frame maybe I should start sitting farther back when I use the box that you guys can like actually see the full thing you know I'll turn it this way so you guys can see it Cheers I always feel like have to be so close to the camera and I don't [Music] the one thing that I do not like about this bowl is that because it is so big you have to hit the like already hit part the black part or ash part multiple times because there's actually still hips in there because the green is underneath that Ash so you don't get a green fresh hit every single time because you do have to end up reheating that ash at least once or twice even when the bowl is like all the way burnt all the way around there's still a few hits in it because it's so damn big but overall you guys I'm not mad at this purchase and I'm so glad that it was an American made like glass piece made by little glassblowing shop I'm telling you guys if you guys are interested in like small glass bowls or dabbers or just like small little glass donor accessories eva is a great place to look there are a ton of shops and ton of glass artists who sell there are almost exclusively through eBay and I have been like learning about a new like that eBay was a big marketplace for weedy stuff but I didn't know how big it was until this last year when I started really ordering stuff like dude like almost every not every artist but a lot of artists nowadays have a presence on eBay so check out eBay for like some of the stoner accessories like bowls or slides or banger stuff like that you can tend to find on eBay for a really good price and as long as you make sure to purchase from somebody within the United States you get it SuperDuper fast like I've been getting everything in within like two to three days [Music] [Applause] I'm stoned and I'm rambling but yeah multi-hole bowls have you guys ever seen this leave a comment below if you've ever seen anything like this like I guess should we call it maybe like a honeycomb bowl because it has like a honeycomb perk in it which is kind of functioning as that multi-hole part of it but I've never seen one of these before leave a comment if you've seen these before cuz I definitely had it and I would definitely recommend these I wish that there were more on the market because legitimately when I purchased this one I don't think I saw any other ones like when I looked for multi-hole bowls they're just not a lot out there but thank you guys so much for watching this video if you liked it give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel because I do three new weady videos every single week thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you guys around for whatever stony activity or video I come up with for next time bye guys just love the clouds from this bowl you

of my favorite waters we've got some OG Kush coming in at 23% and we've got the new booze glyco it's a glycerin chilled glass water pipe that you put in the freezer so this has been sitting in the freezer put the bowl in the freezer you put the pipe in the freezer that's what you do folks this is it it's frozen got glycerin it's ice-cold we're gonna see how this thing rips I've got some og cush 23 percent flour and we're just gonna see how it works so a little bit of water in it halfway this Tim is what I was told we're just about there everybody I'm super stoked to try this out I've got a really nice table that a friend of mine gave me with this dope chair and I'm trying not to get any water on the table so I'm being really gentle with this I bought this og Coast from flowing the other day just just for this piece so I would usually grind it up but it looks like this has a nice little like screen in it so I'm just gonna break up some of this OG Kush real nice just break it up like a fat bowl because you know why not it's been a long time since I've used a glass bowl or a bong as they call them I really don't use pipes that much I use my rigs because I really like concentrates I like you know the nectar collectors and the things like that but this is the first bong that I've had in a long time and I'm really excited about this piece right here once again this is the use glyco just released it's the blue model again it is me oh my shirt holding my yellow steamboat that's the sickest already know that now let's try this piece right here super strong it's actually cooler and smoothies than I would have thought that's just a browsing distillate for a little more razzle dazzle but I'll get to that I just wanted to make a quick video to try this thing out and spit it in the freezer you can see the smoke pouring down you just got milky pulling it's really nice the water down there yeah this is really great I usually wouldn't smoke sativa in the evening or even a hybrid leaning sativa but I just spent the day shooting with a homie and I'm about to work on that project I wanted to kind of throw this in the middle because I just got this I'm gonna be doing some photos with it but right now I just wanted to get used to it it's a great little piece that soon as I go we've got more on the way thanks for watching please subscribe follow do whatever you want or I don't

use and clean Daisy glass screens this episode is brought to you by Daisy glass screens you can learn more about Daisy glass screens and their other cool products at polychromatic calm because Daisy glass screens are hand-blown glass everyone is unique sort of like a snowflake so in a pack of hundred here you find a hundred at unique at different sizes and shapes there's also a multitude of colors and just huge variety and there's also a large size that you see on the ride there as well as the normal regular size that you see on the left so the first step in using Daisy glass grains is a pretty simple one just pick the right size and shape screen for your bowl and there's going to be plenty of choices to choose from the next step is going to be to place the screen and the bowl now you could try all day long trying to drop them down into the bowl and try to get them to land with the pointy side down good luck with that it's a little bit frustrating but it's so easy to do it this way just put the little screen on the end of your finger and then invert the bowl on top of it and turn it over super simple it doesn't really matter which kind of bowl you're using I just find that it really would be the easiest way to do it just put it on your finger stick the bowl over the top of it and flip it over it goes in just right every time [Music] once you have your Daisy screen in place the next step is going to be to pack and smoke your ball simple as that you can see that the screen sets at the bottom prevents a lot of the ashes and you know larger pieces of cannabis from breaking off from going through into your bong which lets you smoke them instead of them falling down and gunking up your pipes and once you've smoked with your Daisy screens a few times you will be able to clean it really easily you can now pop them out and then you can use a screen like this a little cleaner brush that I've got from polychromatic comm and you can use that to clean them or something like that a pipe cleaner or you can also drop them down in some alcohol and let them sit for a few minutes and after they soak for 10 or 15 minutes most of the gunk will loosen up and you can just use a cloth or a little piece of paper towel and just wipe them right off it's really simple you can see they got it mostly clean off there a little bit of tarnish left on it but it gets all the gunk off and you can reuse them over and over so when it comes to reusing the screen you just basically use them the same way you did when they were new and you could just reuse them over and over until they become too dirty to use again or if they break or you lose them again I would like to thank Daisy screens for sponsoring this video you can find Daisy screens and their other cool products at

"PzAkbP08RMQ": "hey guys going to do a review today on the mav glass dry ash catchers so these were requested by a lot of people for us to start carrying so we got them for you uh the dry ash catcher is a simple concept the name kind of explains it it's dry you don't put water in it and it catches ash so that's the concept we have these in 14 millimeter 45 degree and 14 millimeter 90 degree so the difference would be a beaker bone like this is at a 45 degree angle so you would use a 45 degree ash catcher with that while this is 90 degrees as you can see so you'd want 90 degree for that style as you can see a couple different colors and such available with these they are 54.99 and of course we always have discount codes available at fat ass glass because we like to hook you guys up and free shipping on orders 25 plus in the united states so uh yeah so that's kind of the concept behind these uh just to get a little deeper into it to make it more complicated um so what's the difference between a dry ash catcher and a water ash catcher is of course the water filtration so this is also by mav glass a beautiful beaker bong right here uh it includes a matching ash catcher with a tree arm percolator so this style right here uh the idea of the water ash catcher is to filter the smoke and add another layer of percolation so those are really cool but the one downside to water filled ash catchers is that the water gets sometimes the dirty water i should say gets sucked back into the bong so really the idea between an ash catcher is to keep your bone clean so the dry ash catchers are better in that sense because the water is not going to get sucked back into the bong making it dirty again with the dry ash catchers it catches all the ash which probably is a clear one to show you so it catches all the ash in the bottom and then once you feel like you know this is starting to get dirty and you want to empty it i mean every time you smoke you could do it or once a week or you know toilet puke but you can just dump it right out and then give it a quick rinse quick wash like that and you're in style so these again are just to keep your bone clean um and they in a way add another layer of filtration um i think they look really cool too like this the different colors are cool because you can kind of match your bong or if you have a favorite color you know throw that on so just more customization so those look really cool uh one thing with ash catchers probably need this to say but your bong needs to have a sturdy base uh if it's really a small bong you don't want it to tip over you know so think about it you're adding weight if you don't have a sturdy base it might make it top heavy but for the most part these are pretty light they're small they're not going to do that but again if you're adding this to a bong that's you know that big it's not going to work so uh if you guys have any questions about fitting or how these work or anything you know as always reach out to us fat ass glass dot com fat ass glass on all social media youtube all that good stuff and uh i look forward to sending out some dry ice catchers to you guys cheers have a great day",

around for over 28 years and this is the owner Ken how's it going and he's going to give us a walkthrough and show us what it's like here at chameleon glass right now we're standing in the color room and this is where you keep what is all this this is all the high-dollar color that we use to make the pipes really jump off the shelves and really talk to people what we're gonna do is we're going to come back and revisit this in just a second but we're gonna start out here in the hot shop and show you what it's all about so let's take a look oh yeah so today what we're gonna do today is to start with how we start every single day come in in the morning the Preppers start working off of some of the things that are behind the camera right now so on certain days most people do a pipe for at least one or preferably two days there are some half days but overall this is the schedule and I put the schedule up so the blowers know what they're going to be doing the next couple of days and they can get get their head prepared for it and then the Preppers will also come through and make sure that they're ready to go because listen when you go to an auto dealership the guys who are washing the cars maybe they're going to be a mechanic someday but overall they got to start somewhere we got a prep we start with Preppers so they get all of the all the musculature and all the stretching and everything that they need to develop to be good at this is what they do while they're prepping and then move on to making right now he will be comparing the 26 by 4 clear he also knows that we need to prepare the low fret with the teal additive so that we can have the little fridge ready and that this 26 clear is what is going to be used by Alex to make the Cyclops pipe on teal so how many of those is Alex gonna be making well every day there's a quota and they've got quota sheets so he knows but in general a cyclops gonna be 22 23 units per day about 25 Wow so they're making 25 pipes a day just banging them out yes all day long all day long that's cool yeah and then what happens is that at the end of each week we have like I won't call it a whole half day but we've got a couple of hours set aside for creativity so if the guys want to stick around and and fool around with different colors because realistically I think one of the things people don't realize about about blowing glass is that all the different raw materials they all behave differently it's a little bit like if any the people are familiar with playing guitar not only are you rolling the glass with this hand and putting the decoration on with this hand just like a guitar you're thinking three notes ahead of what this hand is doing while your mind is also concentrate what's happening right now and when you say raw materials you're talking like the colors themselves come on over this way let's take a look so raw materials wise we've got borosilicate and clear this is a big one this is what we typically will start for dildos with or we're going to be using the furnaces for a big melt this is the stuff that we we start with every day that are there here our rod whether it's colored rod or clear this is all of our back stock over here this is some of the color that's been prepped so each one of those tubes whether is white or clear or purple or amber or whatever it starts out as a 5-foot length of glass and we have to have that broken down by by Nick and what happens is we cut it down will fire polish one of the ends for that for the hands and then we can work off of this where as it's real difficult to work off the fiber so the Nick does all of the preparatory work done so it's just one person doing all of this right now because we need somebody for work typically just like I was talking about with prep somebody will do prep for a certain amount of time bring in somebody behind them to learn and then that person will move on to pipes and we actually filmed with Smitty a while back and he worked for chameleon glass he talked about doing prep for like six months yeah absolutely you know just think about it the guitar playing idea is really it are you gonna be eddie van halen overnight sorry to everybody know and eddie van halen doesn't exist except for one guy the idea is that if you're going to be playing guitar it's him taking a couple of years to get to play eruption or any of the good man Halen it's like Karate Kid wax on wax off that's right so it takes a long time to really get the the musculature the muscle memory to know that you can do this and this at the same time while you're looking over here how many colors do you guys work with a lot and I'll show you that next for the raw materials because it's a it's a bit of a surprise for most people so the difference between a an effective visual representation of something is based both on shaping and also on the colors that you use I like to think that we know our color palette better than anybody else and I can guarantee that anything coming out of China is not using the expensive colors because they make cheap pipes they use cheap colors we use the more expensive american-made colors from North Star and glass alchemy and I'll show some of those to you right now these are like the same colors that you know essentially the high-end artists are using yes this is a say except we're a production shop we use those same colors that's cool keeping it high quality all the way through we try and the fact of the matter is is that some of the cheaper glass because the the labor is not as expensive they're not as worried about if they lose two or three of them in on a day's production as I am because losing two or three to bad color match is not a good thing but the color is very difficult to make it's made at very high temperatures if you ever want to see some of the processes check out the North Star glass alchemy websites they've got really cool things that on the glass furnaces sparks hot stuff it's pretty cool what they do but so this is this is a rod of opaque aqua also known as teal you saw that earlier we're going to be using this very stuff to make the Cyclops today there tomorrow 60 bucks a pound you've got forest green here's some Illuminati right here that Lord Starr a was kind enough to give me a little bit out of the vault right now so this is about $130 a pound why it is an extremely difficult process at high temperature and the ingots of the active ingredients in Illuminati you have to have a special license here in the United States so to actually get Illuminati made the way he wanted it to be made exact the ingots are actually made in his New Zealand subsidiary and they're the ones who make the Illuminati ingots and Illuminati is UV reactive the ultraviolet reactive soda glow under a blacklight black light this is frit a lot of people don't know but this is a little trick that a product that we use to color the glass with talked about the contracts with the ridges on the inside this glass is it's just crushed glass and a hammer mill but by crushing it down into here we can now insert it into hard to get places and melt it in so all this top are all the different colors of trick that we use in the shop and in general because they're processing the glass further for it is always more expensive than the regular glass they have to use first quality because if they use anything with inclusions it will cause the glass to crack and then I'm going to be one too unhappy customer so they keep me happy all the different colors our warmer colors are in here you've got cherry lava canary you've got some blue moons caramels butterscotches amber purple which strikes that's another thing about colors is depending on the the actual chemical composition they may change a different color so this is some of the high-dollar raw materials why don't we go back out and take a look we'll start walking down the line here too we can see so this is where all the magic happens oh absolutely so right now Billy is using last words technology which is the torch that gets the hottest overall torches start somewhere around 1700 degrees Fahrenheit and put that in perspective lava coming out of the volcano on Hawaii right now and you see all those guys the silver suits and the long poles because it's too damn hot for them to get a sample from that's 49 degrees Fahrenheit so we operate to begin with 300 degrees higher than volcano this is Billy and he's making the chesh iers yep so right now he knows fire polishing the mouthpiece so that we get nice smooth glass to touch your lips how long we been blowing last for Billy oh five years five years how'd you get started you know what Wren was doing it just got me the job sweeping the floors and I worked my way up so you've been here for five years good for you now it's all you've made today yeah so far at least it's a start yeah the production so far as any come up handles now I made the pipe up the point turn it into a pipe now I got to take it off make up mouthpiece sequence what are some of your favorite pieces you like to make checker is definitely up there the Mario Brothers Luigi and Mario my frickin Morty stuff so Rick and Morty and he seeks to be head movie and pickle Rick those are some of my favorite ones amazing but I do most of the character character spec [Music] you know as opposed to some of our pattern and custom monsoons and stuff that Holly says kind of a character guy that's cool yeah how many glass blowers do you have here at this place so currently there are 11 of us before the onslaught of China we had two ships and 80 people and once you 15 so it's a lot smaller than it used to be but I think that we're in a defensible situation right now have a good group of people who know what here in the shop we'll continuing to cool stuff yeah China will knock it off within two months but I think that overall people are starting to understand that we make some unique stuff even the knockoffs are really not and you want to make a purchase a if you want to support your brother or sister in the United States we try and I try and have things so that people are coming up to speed full-time Gary right now is off of prep and on to making pipes he is making right now the blanks for the all of the baked on label pipes that we offer the entry-level stuff and so what he does all day long is he makes a very straightforward simple piece this is on black puts it into the oven we'll grab another piece and begins the process once again after these have been annealed properly and they're back to being nice and strong and what do you mean by anneal what's that well that's a that's a really good good question come on over here this is this is annealing oven and it's made by aim manufacturing we were pretty much aim and scut in this particular shot but if you look down here this tells you that currently the temperature is approximately one thousand and fifty degrees inside the annealing oven and not only is this piece of equipment very expensive in the first place let me tell you the electric company here in Phoenix they love thing they used to really love me when I had a tea glass blowers and we had thirty films on it but these things suck power like No so I mean I could get my hand used about that close but that's about it and what this does is while you're glass blowing you have to have uniform heat throughout the glass because something that is very hot has a lot of kinetic energy and therefore it's vibrating very fast and something that is very cold is vibrating very slow with kinetic energy and when you have the two of the same part of glass what will happen is the hot part vibrates so much that the cold part cracks so a weak garage the glass that they're working on to keep it a nice uniform temperature just under defamation so it will melt before they get to use it but then he can put that directly into the plane and immediately start working right now Ricky is working on Jack Skellington it's a what he'll do right now is he's ripping off the end to make a nice uniform [Music] you'll dab off that little dot of thick glass to make hold and now we'll open it up so you can start coil potting the white on to make Jack Skellington space but the thing of it is is that he's going to take relatively cold glass and superheated and it has to be a nice uniform temperature the oven or the cold glass goes very gently into the end of the flame to warm it up to the same temperature so the glass is friendly with the other glass hot glass and cold glass don't like each other so at the end of the day we fire this kill what firing means is that we will soak it in superhot temperature just under deformation temperature and what that allows the glass to do and this is something that we do that not necessarily everybody else does it's not a nice way to say it cheap sons of [ __ ] what it does is when you are you have a crystal lattice of glass that makes it very strong well when you blow the bubble out and then you shape the bubble and then you stretch it these bonding agents within the glass gets stretched out and they want to get back together because they like to be like this and this is where it's most strong but when you're done working with glass most of it looks like this and that makes for a very weak fight that the first time you drop it where you give any percussive strength to it it's going to snap what these ovens do is it allows the glass to flow back together to make friends again and to be happy and to lock into place if you don't emile the glass you've got weak glass it's going to break so that's why as you can see oven open open oven nice red heating elements are keeping the glass good and allowing it to get strong again after that let's go over to QC and I'll show you what what goes on there into here is where all of the items that have been made this is quality control so Bernie hey what's up how's it going so what is your job so I get the daily production that comes in from the day before I set it on my desk and I review it you not checking for cracks to check it for pattern check it for the right shape the right size has a carpol blowhole flat spot null piece making sure everything's not sharp just making sure the piece of the way it's supposed to be nice so you're pretty much the last step before it goes out the door almost okay it goes from me then then it goes to wrapping and then after they wrap it up it gets put in boxes and then they get and then it gets tripped from there how many pieces do you think you go through a day probably close to a little over 300 maybe 300 yeah and so you know it's legit when you got the stickers on it yeah you know if the jail when it has a sticker they means it's the first it passed and they went through me it went through you so everything touches Ernie's hands before it goes out the doors everything on that note I mean Ken how many hands go through these pieces of glass how many people are touching these things oh I mean when you think about I you know it's a really good point because a lot of people don't think about the the after-effects here at this location after it's been delivered and who knows how many people touched it on on the way here is we break break it down so we receive it it goes through receiving it comes in here it gets repaired so then it goes glassblowing stations the glass make what they're gonna be doing then Ernie makes sure that everything is squared away there's no cracks no crazing the shaping's right all the things he talked about then it goes over to packaging Vanessa's not right here right now but she wraps everything up real good and puts the sticker on it it goes into stock which is over here so we've got a couple of different aisles of all of the different items that we make that we stock on the regular and everything gets wrapped up properly with a catalog number on it so when it gets to the store or it gets to your house you know that that's what you got then what is inside here this is rocket racoon from guardians and this is just one aisle in the stock of the warehouse we keep everything available for purchase so that when you call and order a glow-in-the-dark pink flower power steam roller Mike will come over here and he'll fill your order nice so how many different types and items do you have here at chameleon so right now without counting any of the raw materials because there's there's plenty of those we have a little over 500 specific SKU stock-keeping units under management so at any point in time when you go onto the website there's more than 500 different unique designs we're going to choose from then you add all the parts Brown joints Stoppers all the the hoses all of the labels that we have to carry you know I'm carrying somewhere around a half a million dollars worth of raw materials and finished goods at any one point in time and that's just not true of a lot of the shops out there they run out of green they're gonna use mint because they got in order to push out me know will not make that pipe until we get the right green you can make something else so each one of those individual glass blowers that you saw out there and you only saw one line there they probably make somewhere around twenty to twenty-five unique designs that on any given day I'm gonna put their sample in front of them and they're gonna make quote on it so that's why we we have stock and we run things so that everybody can be working full-time they are they are constantly learning and you know riding that bike and we we try and market so that our customers are having a good display case of chameleons in their store or the other part of it is for the retail customer that when they come in and place an order with me it's not typically gonna be oh we'll make that over the next couple of weeks and we'll get that out to you wrong answer when you place an order with us I want to ship it within one or two days because realistically that's what China is and China is all over Amazon and Amazon is free shipping and they ship the next day well that nobody wants to wait alright nobody wants to wait to get their awesome chameleon glass and so hey ours is a you know it's reasonably priced and I try and keep it that way but we don't you know I'll be honest with you I'm not as profitable to some of these job shop companies because we carry the glass for you to buy today to be shipped tomorrow that costs money all right guys we're gonna wrap it up here at the daily sesh this is where they keep everything in stock here at chameleon glass if there's anything you want to see go check it out on a website we've got a lot of items from chameleon glass at the Daley center calm and if there's something you don't see there they have over 500 pieces there's a lot to choose from you can

items that should be laying around your house to get started cleaning your bong you're going to need blast pipe piece Chilam bubbler hammer whatever you got if it's glass and you smoke out of it you can clean it this way so you've got your glass piece and then you've got rubbing alcohol here I've got 91% I bought this off at Amazon higher percent alcohol the better the alcohol is what's getting off the gunk and then next just some table salt it's like 35 cents for this whole thing this acts as your abrasive the salt just spins around in there and helps clean off the gunk that's getting loosened by the alcohol next q-tips this is for those weird areas that may not be coming off completely and then for the extra little reach and scrub action I got a toothbrush hopefully it's a dirty toothbrush and don't plan on using it again and then plastic bags or saran wrap and that's gonna be to plug the bong up when it's filled with alcohol and you're shaking it and then finally I've just got some more Tupperware this is to pre-soak the stem or the bowl pieces that I'm not gonna be able to shake around as easily I dump the water out that's a given but the first step truly would be soaked like I mentioned you want to pre-soak some of your stuff so I've got a bowl and a stem here that are not gonna be cleaned as easily as this bong and I'm going to pre-soak these while I'm doing everything else so got a Tupperware dish just big enough to fit this resin II downstem in and I'm just going to literally squirt the alcohol you can wear gloves if you want I'm psycho so I don't care about my hands very much but gloves is good alcohol is bad for your skin so I'm literally just just filling this up with alcohol it's like $3 for a bottle so get that's why you want to be cheap because you're gonna want to use a lot of it to make sure that's fun pre-soaking just as long as the alcohol is getting in there that's good I'm gonna add my Bowl in there too while we clean the rest of the bottle we will be waiting for this pre-soak action to be taking place and so the next step is going to be soaking the bung as well so just like those pieces I'm gonna add this rubbing alcohol into the bong and I like to get a decent amount in there you know there's no shame there's no shame the more alcohol the easier so we've got a decent amount maybe a cup three quarters of a cup of rubbing alcohol in there as you can see that's already that's already taken off a lot you know you can see it's with all that brown stuff in there that's that's all gunk that this alcohol has just taken off on its own immediately and then the next step is salt and I'm just gonna dump that right in there with it the more salt again the better salt is cheap salt is safe I'm just gonna put a bunch of salt in there I'm gonna pour some in here and my pre soaked solution to I don't know if that's gonna help but when I shake it up later it will next step is going to be shake and before you shake this you're gonna want to secure it because you will get rubbing alcohol everywhere if you don't so right now I'm taking a sandwich bag and a hair tie top end is sealed I'm just gonna plug this up with my thumb and shake focusing on these gunky areas you can see right here this ring especially and so I'm angling angling the glass to where the salt is primarily hitting and if you're a perfectionist like me you will literally do this for ten minutes just to get all all those pieces off and so now we've got a pretty clean looking bomb 99% clean I might say and then this is where if you can get in there that last little hmm these last little bits are gonna come off super easily with a toothbrush so there's that that looks clean to me we'll see once we dump it out but yeah the difference the difference will be very apparent once I dump dump and rinse so dumping be careful dumping this stuff it smells bad you get it on your counter that resin will stain stick stink you know whatever grab my rinse water and you're gonna rinse this out a bunch cuz who wants to smoke rubbing alcohol I don't think that's safe step one two and three for the beaker gets you that and now for the rest of the pieces same thing they've been soaking you know something like this is gonna be really tough you know if your toothbrush doesn't fit in there this is where two q-tips come in and if you can see that because of the pre-soak action this is just all coming out immediately it's it's just like nothing it's like this wasn't smoked on for months and months and months you know it looks like you just hit it for the first time just wiping that out with a q-tip it's so easy boom all clear that's usually the hardest part the stem I'd say the bowl oh look at that that's just coming right off again the the hardest part of the bowl if you guys don't know this resin right here this is where this is where all the action happens this is where all the heat and initialled just madness happens when you're smoking weed so little dip dip and rinse see that that's already clearing out very nicely it's all over my hands - what you're gonna stink so what I'm gonna do for this bowl and this is really good for spoons and pipes as well it's essentially the same thing just alcohol salt shaking you know the same soak what is it soaked salt shake and scrub I'm taking this and I'm just putting it in a bag so I've got the salt here and this is enabling me to shake you can't do that with the Tupperware dish you're gonna break your bowl and this bags will break down they will leak eventually so keep keep an eye out if you notice drops coming out of the corner you probably busted the bag okay I'll see how that helps I mean it's looking really clean when I cover up the resin section with my finger all right so there you go clean Bowl so those of you that are able to clean this by your sink and not on a table which is probably what I'd recommend if you have a metal sink or even worse a ceramic sink be so careful he's so careful shaking this giant glass piece around in there because if you just touch the edge of your ceramic sink it's gone this whole piece is broken so if you're shaking it around in your kitchen you just go boom catch that on ceramic it's done all right so that that does it I like to call it the 5s system soak salt shake scrub and now the final step of this process smoke", "Se03Qk8Ql_k": "this allows water pipe this piece has a blue colored decoration bloomers piece bass rings and heinken perk it also had a nut perk with a round in line of work you see this this class has a very large base very stable and sturdy it has a 18 millimeter male don't you can use glass accessories also with ceramic dummies nail this is a great piece okay hair is still what it has", "B1MMwvVbeMw": "Hey guys I'm Mariah and today we're talking about\u00a0\nthe Eyce Mini Beaker.  All right you guys we're going\u00a0to start by talking about the features of the\u00a0Mini Beaker which is just half the size of the\u00a0\u00a0 regular Eyce Beaker. It's more of a compactable\u00a0\non-the-go piece and it comes with all kinds of\u00a0\u00a0 cool features including a bottom hidden storage\u00a0\ncompartment. See it's actually really big, and holds\u00a0\u00a0 a lot. We have your steel tool compartment right\u00a0\nhere comes out real easy and we have an additional\u00a0\u00a0 tool holder on the other side. It has a lot of\u00a0\nsimilar features to its older brother the\u00a0\u00a0 regular-sized beaker such as the ice chamber it's\u00a0\njust in a smaller more compact form.\u00a0\u00a0 All right guys, let's smoke it! We'll start by adding just a little\u00a0\nbit of water. \u00a0\u00a0 Next you can add an ice cube if you prefer for an extra chilly hit. It fits small ice\u00a0cubes into the ice catcher here. Next you'll pack\u00a0\u00a0 the glass bowl. Pack the bowl as big or small as\u00a0\nyou want just depending on your tolerance.\u00a0\u00a0 You will light the glass bowl, as you take a hit let\u00a0\nthe chamber fill up with smoke, and just pull the\u00a0\u00a0 slider right out of the silicone down stem. As\u00a0\nyou're pulling you will breathe in, and breathe out. Thanks so much for watching\u00a0\nour how-to videos for more\u00a0\u00a0 information you can find us over at eycemolds.com", "UnvBDBSq9FE": "[Music] hi there buds if you already saw the title of this video then you already know i feel like the luckiest guy in the world i get to sit here and unbox three brand new bongs with you guys these were sent over by ghost scentsy first and foremost i want to say thank you so much to gocency for sponsoring this video go cincy is an online headshop that carries everything from bongs to pipes vaporizers rolling papers rolling trays any type of cannabis accessory that you would need for your such pretty much they carry so you can check them out at www.gocincy.com thank you go cincy for sponsoring this video and without further ado let's open up these three new bongs that go cynthia sent over i'd also like to thank them for sending over this glass cleaner it's called purple power and i used it last night on one of my old pieces and it actually worked really really well if you guys have been following my channel for a while you know that i buy rubbing alcohol by the gallon because i clean my pieces so much so this will definitely come in handy and it's reusable which i really really like now let's get into the excitement three bombs i picked out these pieces they let me pick out whatever i wanted off of their website and so i picked out these three pieces but i haven't seen them in person yet i did open up the boxes just to see if anything was broken but i didn't unwrap anything so this will be a full first impression and christening along with you guys now the hard part which one should i open first i think i'm gonna open up the brown one just because it's different these two boxes look exactly the same so i'm just gonna open up this one first there's really no logic behind that just wanna open up the different ones well it looks like this one has two pieces in it so i think i might actually have four pieces to unbox that wasn't anticipated it was only sesame three thank you so much go cincy if this is four pieces i think it is though i need to get some scissors hold on i'll be right back this one looks tiny and i didn't pick out anything small so i think that this is like a little bonus piece it's a little oil rig and it's got like this like blue drip look to it i'll get a close-up on it that's not against these lights because i feel like you guys can't really see it well i guess you can kind of see it there it's got this like nice blue drip on it and a shower head perk on the bottom oh i like the design on the bottom of it too that's neat oh that's not the bottom from it's not a design on the bottom it's clear on the bottom but you can just see the drip from the side so it kind of looks like there's something on the bottom that's really neat i like this this will be a nice little oil rig let's see did it come with a banger or did it come with a bowl it came with a bowl but i would definitely use this as an oil rig not as a bomb just because it's so tiny i think that this would be the perfect little oil rig let me fill this up with water and then i'll grab a banger and we'll christen it it took me forever to find my torch but i finally found it we've got our banger heated up and a nice hunk of a wedding cake shatter right here let's go ahead and christen this cheers you guys oh it feels a little bit hot let's wait like one two three four five six seven eight nine ten seconds cheers [Music] me [Music] the dab just kept going oh my gosh i love it i love rigs this size mini rigs are the best i feel like you get a better hit because the dab doesn't have to travel as far i feel really you get more flavor you get all the terpenes oh my god i'm sweating and that's the first piece oh my gosh i'm gonna be so stoned by the end of this video but yeah i like miss little drip drip that's what i'm gonna call her little miss strip trip because she has the drippy designs i'm also just gonna throw this out there i'm sure you guys probably don't care but maybe you do out of all of the sponsors i've ever worked with go cincy by far has been the [ __ ] coolest they let me decide whatever i wanted to do like there are very few companies out here who are going to influences and are like create whatever you want like with no restrictions it's just really really nice working with a company who appreciates you know our little cannabis community thank you so much for being such a good collaborator i'm so stoned let's get on into the boxing of these bongs each of the bongs has a different type of perk in them because they wanted me to show you guys like three different types of perks in the bongs which i'm all about let's get to trying these three bongs out little miss strip trip has me feeling some type of way okay so inside of this box is another bong and it's all wrapped up so ain't my scissors let's cut it open i should start every video with like a dab i feel like i start most of my videos with smoking but like this one was like that hit me extra hard i feel like whenever i try to [Music] i'm so impressed because like i didn't pick out this color i did pick out this song but i did not pick out this color and i really like it okay so you guys probably can't see it that well from like here but it has a diamond perk on the bottom it leads up to a little splash guard right here it has the ice pinch on it and three different colored bands on the top near the mouthpiece which i think is so neat looking it's like an orange a red and a blue it looks really sharp actually and then the bottom of it is like orange and blue it actually looks really really nice i like it and it kind of like bows out in the center part which kind of looks different i don't think i've ever seen a piece like that this is neat oh and it has a shower head perk inside too i did i missed that it's right there so there's a shower head perk on top of the little diamond perk okay and let's see what type of bowl comes with it i'm assuming it's a bowl sometimes like the weirdest things come with like a bong or an oil rig like sometimes i expect to have a banger with it and it'll come with a bowl for some reason and sometimes i'll expect a bowl and it'll come with a banger oh i really like this bowl okay it's like got um a screen built into it so there's a screen built in and it kind of goes down that's neat i've never seen a bowl like this and it's got like little handles on the side of it which i like okay [Music] okay let's fill it up with water and then we'll test it out you guys so i was filling this up with water and i checked it out in the mirror to make sure that i had the water levels right the perk in this is so effing neat i've never seen anything like this look like it's perking from down here and then it's like perking up here so like there's two perks which i've seen that before but i've never seen it like pull the water upwards like the shower head perk is really neat like that's really really really neat okay let me load this bowl up and then we'll christen it always get asked in the comment section what i'm smoking on today i'm smoking on some sherbet and it's actually been really good all right you guys [Music] cheers that was really smooth actually and a nice hit too like it's not too big it's not too small i feel like this is like my perfect size piece i don't know how many inches this is um i'll check the website and then let you guys know in editing but whatever size this is i feel like this is perfect for a daily driver it's nothing too small um but it's not like too big i think this is going to be one of my new favorite pieces i love the aesthetic of it and the two perks i feel like i'm noticing a difference because i didn't cough from either of those hits and that was after already having just dabbed if you guys watch me you guys know that normally i'm a call for for speeding that [ __ ] up by like 500 in editing so that i sound like a chipmunk but not not not this video not not this fall so i like you i don't know what we're gonna name her if you if you come up with the name leave a comment down below oh my god another box i wonder what's inside i know it's gonna be a bong you guys one of my favorite things in the world is christening new pieces i could have the worst day in the world and just getting a new piece would make me so happy okay so it has a small box in it too so i don't know what's in the small box oh okay there's a down stem in here it has the vitra logo right there which i've never heard of this brand but i saw that they had quite a few pieces by this brand on their site and they looked pretty sharp as a bowl and it has a screen in it again i really like these bowls with screens in them and i love that they all have handles too because i prefer a bowl with a handle on it it's like they knew or something because i genuinely prefer bowls with hands i don't know why it just makes it more ergonomic i guess and now for the piece itself it also even came with where did it go a cake clip to keep the down stem in place like that's really nice that this was included sometimes bond manufacturers give uk clips sometimes they don't and i think that all of them should because i personally use a k-clip anytime my bong like has the ability to use it if that makes sense because i notice i will pull the down stem out if i don't have the clip in place anyways without further ado it's so nice and like just clean very simple i have a couple of bongs like this that are just like straight tubes which is your basic down stem i mean there's nothing wrong with that i like a nice basic straight tube bong i think that they look nice and classy i think that the logo on this one looks really nice too it doesn't look too much it's actually really big but it doesn't look like too much and it doesn't look cheap like it actually looks really nice and sleek i like that the down stem is green and that it matches the green on the bottom and on the mouthpiece that's a nice little touch and the bowl actually matches the piece too it's kind of nice let's fill it up and we'll take some hits off of this straight tube i'm really excited about this one i mean like i haven't even seen the third one but i think out of the three this one like appearance wise is my favorite let me give you guys a nice close-up of the function [Music] it's a nice chugger this one's really big it's actually bigger than i thought it was gonna be but i like it like i actually really really like it and i like that the base of this is like really big like really really big way bigger than the pieces i feel like this will be harder to knock over which is a problem for me like one day i'm going to show you guys my glass collection and i think it might be coming up pretty soon because i think i'm moving and when i do it's going to be more of a long grain yard than it is a collection because i just have a lot of [ __ ] pieces anyways let's hit this piece and try it out cheers you guys [Music] so that was like a long punch like i told you guys that other one with the two perks you could feel how much smoother it was this one was like a long punch now let's discuss that i don't mean that in a bad way like i feel ten times stonier off of this one than i did that one so it's just kind of a preference thing do you like a bong that is legitimately going to punch you in the lungs every time if you do something like this that's maybe a little bit more simple that maybe only has just like your traditional down stem straight to might be the way to go because it's like a really dense hit that packs a punch really fast because it's just going straight up into your lungs straight tubes are i think my favorite types of bonds i'm not gonna lie i'm not gonna lie i think this is my favorite okay let's kristen open up the last one oh my god i'm so stoned it took me a second to get that sentence out like it took some concentration i think i'm going to name this one the jolly green giant so this is the jolly green giant and this is little miss drip drip so the other one still needs a name and i need to open up this last one i'm so stoned when i get stoned i really start to think about naming pieces and stuff i think about the most random things when i get like super duper stoned like they all need to make sense it's not that it doesn't make sense when i'm super duper stoned it's just that i think differently if that makes sense i feel like very much more creative and just think very outside of the box okay let's open up what's in this box which should be another ball let's wrap the bubble wrap [Music] on camera it looks white but in person it looks kind of yellowish it's kind of got like this yellow tint to it and i've never seen a bong that has a down stem here and a perk inside so you get that like classic down stem hit but then it has like all these perks inside like there's like at least one two three parts in there three it looks like shower head not showerhead i don't know what they're called to be honest maybe fountain perks i'm wondering how this is gonna hit because i've never seen a piece like this where there's legitimately a whole remote people downstream right here like i almost feel like you don't even need it i feel like you could just well i mean i guess this bowl wouldn't fit in without the down stem but like i feel like most traditional pieces would just be just like this it wouldn't even have the down stem so it's like getting double the percolation i'm excited to try this oh yeah and it did come with a k-clip too and the bowl is also a screen as well and it does come with the handle like every single piece came with like a very nice little bowl piece it's not like a super large bowl it's like just enough for probably one person but like a nice bowl piece that actually has a screen and a handle and that matched the piece like all of it matched together which i feel like coming from a lot of headshots i've ordered from a few different headshots on the internet and depending on like how much you spend um some of them just come with like generic bowl pieces some of them don't look as nice um once you get them as what they did on the picture like i don't know but this is a really nice piece like all of them are really nice pieces i've been very impressed with the quality of the pieces and like the function of them so let's hope that this one's not any different so when i was testing the water level of this piece i also felt like man this feels different than any other bong than i've ever hit because it takes a second for this one to actually pull and it actually functions like a recycler like let me show you guys see how the water drains back down into the down still [Music] and i think you guys can actually hear it and see it like it's taking me a little bit of time before it actually starts percolating which is so different there's usually not any type of delay but i guess because this one has so much to pull through it just it takes a little bit of lung power we'll see how this hits i have the bull loaded up right here thank you so much go scentsy for sending over all this stuff like i said before you guys can check them out at goscency.com you can also check them out on instagram at gosensi and yeah all the bongs were very reasonably priced and like i said i'm very impressed with the quality of them they don't feel like super thin or anything they all feel pretty thick the bases of them are all very nice i was very impressed with that like all the bases are very wide like wider than i feel like most other pieces are which i feel like is going to make these more stable and less likely to be knocked over which is really nice and the perks in them have just seemed kind of next level but like i feel like i kind of stick to the basic pieces though to be honest i don't really go with these more elaborate perks but maybe i should start going with some of these because this has been a really nice like experience and definitely if you feel like you're getting bored with like the way that you're consuming cannabis try a new piece try a different perk like it does kind of spice it up and i don't know i feel like i get stoned off of new pieces like like more stoned if that makes sense like and i know that's not a true thing but like it's just a feeling i don't know i get so stoney during christening videos anyway cheers that was actually really smooth like i wasn't expecting that to be so smooth with it being so hard to pull from but it was like really really smooth [Music] that's really neat too i really like how smooth that is like it's it's noticeably smoother than i feel like both of the other ones like this one i feel like is the smoothest out of the three and i think it's because of the extra perks like i don't know i really like all three pieces like i feel like i'm going to have them for different occasions you guys will be seeing me use them a bunch on my channel and in social media because hell it's three new pieces and i actually like the function of them and i'm always so concerned i delayed it it's sneaky i don't know what to name this one either so i need a name for this one and i need a name for for this one leave comments down below let me know what you think um just say the colorful one or the the more clearish one and then list your name suggestions in the comments i'm so stoned i'm so happy like i love christening new pieces this was like the the best sponsored video ever thank you so much go cincy for sponsoring this video you guys can check out go cincy at ghostnc.com and you can check them out on instagram at gosnc thank you guys so much for watching and i'll see you guys around for whatever stunning activity or video i come up with for next time like i'm having a hard time speaking at this point like i'm like out of breath just from talking and then i'm like also like out of breath from smoking and i'm also like really stunned thank you guys for watching this video and i'll see you guys around for whatever sony activity or video i come up with for next time bye guys i legitimately don't think that you guys realize how much i feel like the luckiest stoner in the world like being sent like so many pieces was so spoiling like [Music] thank you so much and thank you guys so much for watching because without you guys none of this stuff would happen so thank you guys and thanks for all the support and i love you and i hope you guys are all doing well through all these hard times um oh my gosh my cat's meowing i guess i need to go feed her or give her some love or something bye guys she wanted love bye guys [Music] you", "ENiMODcF3d4": "it's Wednesday guys happy Wednesday happy hump day and we're about to blow some glass I got in a new order from lamp wood supply so we got all our big tubing for making we got a bunch of tubing for it ordered that we're working on for cigar tips and we're also using that same size tubing for the backs of rigs hello all welcome welcome and I'm pretty excited we got this new tool we don't hardly ever buy new tools so it's pretty saying this is called a deck to the rats I believe brass making tools made by Griffin glass tools and this can be used for many many things one thing it can be used for us to split a tube that I wouldn't be able to split with my nippers because it's too big so we're gonna see how this works I've only seen this done I've never done it so we'll see basically you get a section five in the flame then you just rotate it on that netting cooler you kind of wiggle it just kind of pops apart we'll see suppose we kind of like method got that well I'd better work try to get threatened again I might have to watch the pork videos on how to do this properly here we go okay well we did it whoo so [Music] got that off there so what that does is you're getting it high and then you're touching it to something really cold and it creates this like eat difference that kind of lets you make a nice clean snack so that was pretty fun and then you can obviously use this tool for lots and lots of other things you know it's kind of like how a knife has many many uses or a spoon Forks not so much but you know like a rubber bands got a thousand uses to it so you know this tool has many uses to it but that's just one of them all right so we're gonna make a bold piece today someone asked us to be that last time you guys got any questions throw up a comment shout out where you're coming from where your protein from say hello to everyone you know let everyone know what you're smoking on all that type of stuff if there's any quick quick front comments here a have I ever burned myself absolutely I don't think you're a real glass blower unless you burn yourself and cut yourself pretty good I haven't put myself in a really long time probably like months like I don't know like three four months maybe no jinx it's just about being careful that's all burning yourself Duchess if you're focused and you're careful you will not burn yourself the only times I've ever burned myself are when I hadn't been paying as much attention as I should have but you're  awesome mama bear what's up I love all you people so much the positivity I can feel it I can feel it growing growing stronger the love is in the air alright so we're gonna go with cubing luckily I just got so this is amber purple two things so this is something kind of fun I don't know if you guys eat a lot of raw materials and other glass boats anything so this is what you start with for making rigs make it Malo carb calves pieces pipes whatever this is amber purple this is a beautiful purple blue shades on the strikeout in this right now it just starts out kind of fluff kind of yellow so we're gonna pull some of this down to do that I have to attach a smaller diameter tube so we're gonna go ahead here and the cubing I've got here is 16 you know I'm gonna save some of the mill I'll say the millimeter sizes a lot that way if you guys watch a lot you can try to learn okay that you'll be able to be on Kia at uber ride like that's 12 millimeter that's 40 millimeter because that you know if you're interested in class and you want to cut the glass floor doing sizes for things does help and it does take a little I'm I'm so bad at I like sizing things you know distances things like that so it took me a long time to learn even what you know twelve millimeter looks like versus nine millimeter but it's definitely a useful thing so I'm looking for my tweezers here there because it's kind of smell all ugly right there there's like this this part hanging awesome just can't pull that off so we get a little bit better connection there we go and I've got a bucket full of water right here guys generally our hearts that teeth bucket for the noise it makes good tink well you're not gonna flat pieces okay so these are totally different diameters right so I need to layer this one meaning to make it wider right at the end something that's enough so there's a lot of different tools you could use I'm going to be using just my tungsten pick these tweezers jacks reverse jacks being is the Animus kind of widening out the lip get America's up yep so now we got close enough of the merits it's not perfect but battle line all the way up to make a feel another thing starting out like it when I first started going glasses would have felt super awkward to hold in my hand and spin and there was like no problem so that's a way of starting out with black swelling you've gotta you gotta take into account it's kind of like when you're learning a new sport I'll tell them to care about this and when you're learning to be sport like basketball or soccer you're gonna be really really sore right when you first start and it's gonna feel uncomfortable to your body parts to your legs to your arms whatever if you're not you know prepared for it or thinking about that and it could ruin the experience for you if you're you know not aware of it you thought it was gonna not be something simply challenging and then it is you might be upset about it so don't forget glassblowing is physically challenging it's not super hard like play basketball but it does require muscles that you don't normally use coordination you know with your hands and your eyes so I'm just I've got this connected or just pulling down on a little section that I'm going to use for the bowl flame cutting that long so now instead of working with this big thing I can work with this little section there see if there's a questions real quick smoking on some star dog nice sounds tasty I don't even know why half the strains are these days what type of cash do I use good question so on most torches for melting borosilicate glasses a mix of propane and oxygen if I was melting quartz for making ports fingers I would have to use acetylene instead of oxygen [Music] awesome but you guys like the little bit--it info thanks for joining and don't forget we're doing a giveaway here if you guys have any requests in terms of what you'd like to see me make it definitely just throw down a comment if I don't make it this time I'll make it probably next time all right so we got this okay so that's great we've got that prepped up man we gotta get our jewel so let's see I'm going to use this 18 millimeter male I got to find that's cool cool I guess for holding joins it's Hollow the top is all directed puffs air into it it seems like like that now Graphite's hold this is going to get really hot so I'm going to kind of preheat this thing in the kill which of course isn't on so we're not gonna preheat it in the kiln we're just gonna hope it doesn't crack on it okay so I don't need all this clear all this extra clear so we got to pull that off right this is where the bowl is gonna be so if I wanted I could it middle a part of this down they make a whole piece just add the filling and then add some color accent things like that definitely a faster way to do it less expensive ways I'm just using the clear glass of the nuns like Caitlyn and there's several ways to make mole visas actually there's a lot of ways to think whole pieces there's two basic styles that I see and think of which is push pull and principle so one you're gonna blow a bubble and then pop a hole there possible just like you would apply it the other one you're going to just open up your cylinder and push little pools and it's creative pinch so I'll show you I'll show you both of them that way you guys can let me know what style you like from the feedback I've gotten so far people see you too even though we like haven't really made any others yet I'll make one here today and then there's a lot of other sound like there's some crazy styles okay so that business when I grabbed it it came right out of my tool because it's not really in there you got twist it it's really keep it in there and then I just I'm pulling like our itself got to make 7up or too hard there you go better okay so I pop guys open now okay so I set this down for sack I gotta open up this other end what do you guys like better I'm going to work on this but I want to see some comments do you like pinch style or push pull better whoever has the most comments here if that's what we're gonna make so right while we open this up mr. reminder we are going to do a giveaway we'll do it here right in the middle right after we make this we Oh [Music] and you'll find certain tools work better for certain things you'll have your favorite tool you're go to go tools alright so I open that up I'm cleared it out now we're going to attach our joint to our color and let's see what the votes work for we got push Bowl if you want to order shirts send a direct message someone asks where can i order shirts send a direct message we don't have too many left I would love to do my own TV show someday I'm young I'll get there keep watching okay so we're making a bull today case you just tuned in I guess we're making a push ball because there was only one boat I mean we're making boat who were making a push ball first the difference is actually a little earlier one is you blow it now and pop a hole and then push a ball the other one you just simply open up your cylinder kind of like how I did this and you create pinches if he's here to watch sentence but here I'm trying to make a really smooth connection I did [Music]  out a little air that just helps me get a little bit okay because so here's where you would start doing different stats right so here's where if I was doing a pinch Bowl I would kind of pull it out a little more and then just cut off at the end but because I'm gonna push for a minute condense down in the blowout of a ball and again you guys bear bear with me on patience because it will pay off but at some point we're being gonna be getting some really cool lenses for the camera I gonna get another phone set up and then we can have like multiple angles go see some really cool what's going on here the flame action okay so I can then spit a little I closed it off pulled it off from this other tube then melt it in and kind of flow it out into a bubble and this is a great way to even out the wall thickness on whatever piece you're working on colors super creamy really nice really nice color to work with thirdly box it hit down a little lasting kind of hard not always make sure you're spinning while you're blowing or you'll just blow out your pop a bubble right on the side of your thing they try to blow some of this I got a condensed for center of solid right in the tip so I'm gonna try to blow that out I might have to pull it and you can see here already see how that orange is kind of like painted on there almost that's some of that striking that's gonna come out from the amber purple it's gonna be really beautiful [Music] okay I'm going to pick a little hole you have I played that real small and you want as small as possible so you don't want to heat up the glass to buy more glass you heat up the more it's going to pull out when you grab it okay so I made a little little hole right there we built that so it's 9:00 sharp little bit so here's what I'm gonna push my bowl I need my bowl but this tool graphite and see I was just kind of we're gonna heat up around only pushing it right before I push it that's gonna blow some pull there right on that cool hopefully keep the same to it cuz again you don't want to set down your hole oh that I can't believe I just said that but you don't want to stretch out your bowl otherwise all the green good stuff is gonna fall through what a great t-shirt that would be for glass Floyd's don't stretch out your hole no one likes to stretch down what [Music] but you gotta be a little quick as we didn't have a cold air on it it is cooling down it will not move once it's too cold but do you see there we got a pretty sweet hole push and I can push it more I can make it deeper so don't worry about how deep it is on your first push is like I'll heat it up again now and I'll push it more heat it up around the edges - that's kind of where it's pushing in from this a wealthy permit oh that's a gorgeous bull and even you know so my hole when I popped it wasn't exactly dead center so it's actually even a little bit on the side which is really nice because now for sure the ashes are gonna fall for as easy so I like this bogeys let's put a handle on it I really have been finding that I love having a handle on my bowl piece so let's go what color [Music] color combos yeah let's do somebody I'm trying to think either this CFL pink that goes pretty cool after time double my time I just bought this fella to thank you everyone so much for watching if you have any questions this shoe department and so this is this is double behind it's gonna change completely to dark blues and purples kinda demerits they ever purple so just a white light flame or whole piece that I want to might eat on the air it'll collapse cause it's Hollow but this drive got fully in the flavoring and when it's good and ready I'm gonna make this connection in the there we go pull it out of the flame back in the flame rotate angles back in the flame out of the flame walks a little back and forth but it's perfectly attached now and then you gotta decide what shape you want your handle the beads you want to be kind of flat one ski around a nose on a horn I'm just beautiful with a paddle skate the kind of flat very easy to grab so you can see I just flame pipe a little bit they're gonna melt that kind of dove in again it's back and forth rotating rotating switch hands if I wanted to get back and forth action lots of different ways to do things but there we go right there really nice handle I'm leaving it like this if I turn it up gravity's gonna pull that handle down or so I'm gonna let it cool in this direction and that's good now it's not gonna move around so here's how it looks right now all these colors are gonna strike out just super super nice we're gonna get this out of the holder here that's so much stuff on right fiber blanket please grab this came right out super nice here's the finished piece throw this in the kiln but the color is just hot and we'll make that pinched bowl next after we pick this giveaway winner don't turn it away don't you know before the giveaway don't miss out oh that's right I forgot that kills off so we're gonna let this pull on the fire blanket I'll throw it in the kiln later again there is a possibility that it's gonna crack on me as it cools because that joint was in a whole rack bite folder the entire time and I was eating the rest of it so if there's any stress plate as it's pulling down get my crack I don't think it will have a pretty good success rate if you ever want to figure out how good your seals are how clean your connections are makes up and don't throw let's see what cracks see what doesn't you'll really see where you need to work on certain things what you're really good at you'd be like why I didn't crack any of these without throwing them in the kiln like my connections on that these are super solid laying of this these Maria's I need to work on better because I cracked like eight out of you know 20 of my marinas or whatever so it's a great way to to see where your pieces can be more structurally sound where your glassblowing healer lives more technically sound all right let's get it giveaway going down right now the eyes closed up and down up and down up down and stop on a cold two three three two you are the winner congratulations thank you so much to everyone for watching and let's see already through the comments real quick I hope it doesn't crack either if it does as long as it's not on the actual physical joint then I should be able to fix it so it's not something I discuss about too much again I feel pretty confident it's not gonna crack [Music] do I do break video so personally I've only made maybe like four or five rigs so far I don't enjoy making them on the torch setup we have this because the flame isn't big or hot enough to melt the glass quickly enough to my liking and it's bushy so it's not necessarily an accurate flame if that makes sense I'll show you right you see how kind of skinny this flame is it can get much bushier if it's bushy it's less accurate in terms of like precision where you're hitting your heat which doesn't matter a lot in terms of rigs and shaping and then I just also don't have certain tools that would make it a lot easier and more fun for me to do so I don't I don't really make a lot of rigs I just don't enjoy it as much Ben is super into making rigs that's why we've got that thick case the tubing and then our employee is getting really good at making rigs he goes by Buddha boy glass if you guys want to check them out on Instagram he's got an Instagram it doesn't post to it to to off because we keep him super busy but yeah definitely lots more rigs come in as soon as Ben gets a little bit more comfortable with making rigs he's gonna meet you and a bunch of them on the Live will be doing customs like you guys were just getting started with this glassblowing thing best believe it it's gonna be going to the moon and back where with the ideas we have and the equipment we're gonna have in the facility we're setting up so I mean it's if you like glass stick around follow us we we keep it pretty pop in itself [Music] I'm super happy that you guys are learning stuff from this - I think that's really cool I really appreciate all the questions all the curiosity appreciate all the attention for you guys watching  yeah you learn send us a direct message and they're pretty sure you bought some glass so use skins get sent right out with the giveaway the way we work it because we're doing giveaways every single day on top of the other giveaways we're already doing we're just asking people to pay the shipping cost or we'll hold on to your auction or your your giveaway win until you can buy something and then toss it in for free so but if you happen to win right after you use bought something boom goes right in the box no problem I'm pretty sure that's what happened with the winner for today so let's do it all right let's make this other style of Bowl easier if get a little glowworm the torches are high they definitely have been a lot of heat so I got to take off my sweater we got the back door cracked open across ventilation always remember this cuz if sucking air out doesn't mean you don't need a fresh air coming back into your area so always have replacement fresh air no windows or something anything but you gotta have it otherwise it's gonna suck create like this vacuum and your attic and suck and suck down here fumes and gases from your house sit like that okay so we need a different toy let me see what I got another 18 we're gonna make a matching set here because I think matching is awesome I think the human brain just loves one thing he's matched in your patterns vaccine is just all about patterns so we got another joint puts it in there so it's not like pulling on it's not coming out at all although sometimes a twisty part and then it really it won't come count like probably just there we go you gotta be careful I've broken pieces before trying to get the joint out of the holder there's a little tap trick like tap on this it's suppose to make it come out easier but sometimes it does now got be a little careful on that okay so we're gonna pull down another section of this amber purple first thing the idea is palpable that way we can attach it to that's why I thought the cake bucket just blaring this with my pick we've wax on there keep it keep it slick [Music] and here you can see see how that color really comes out that's purple or that amber purple really nice okay so I'm gonna cut this too so another safety tip when you're cutting this is how probably I've got myself the worst is using nippers sometimes as you're nipping these because they're so serve the people just kind of unexpectedly crap on you if you're pushing with the wrong angle you're gonna drive a sharp piece of glass like that right into your thumb on your finger and oh my god it hurts really really bad it's gonna draw on you for like 30 minutes before the throbbing goes down and then it just hurts normal but it's no fun at all cuts I would say hurt a lot worse that burns in my opinion obviously I'm sure there's people to disagree with me and obviously a third-degree burn is gonna hurt worse than a little cut everything in terms of degrees but glass cuts art Darlene Darlene earlier so I don't know too wide of the opening here luckily so I don't the player this two minutes probably plenty right there we get the big tube go opposite sides this time with my hands work out the left a little it's always good to practice using both hands switching up your hands it just makes you a more skilled black scientist makes you able to do more better thing about you know it seemed as basketball like if you can dribble with both hands you're better at it if you can blow glass with backseat with both hands you're better then someone who can only do it kind of right here we always pull it off a little section here [Music] nice and thick - it's too big like one of the things you guys might not know about when you order last colors if you do not get to see what they're sending you before you get it so I ordered this color based on a picture a piece of amber purple now I didn't get to see what this tube would look like I didn't get to see how big the diameter was what the thickness was so that's more a little bit of a crapshoot or like just learning right different companies send generally different thicknesses like North Star tubing is gonna come generally a little bit the prison drop in art glass tubing uncle just kind of have their standards that you have but sometimes even you'll get a lot of variants of the same might get a 28 millimeter one time and a 19 bility or tubing next time so it's don't expect to get something super uniform you know machine like these are you know a lot of these are hand pulled pieces of glass [Music] and they cut them we got this bit here get a pop a hole in there that way it's ready to go and attach to the joint you got any questions definitely throw it out diplomas thank you everyone for tuning in and watching alright we got that got that ready to go all right now we're gonna pull this extra glass off here Aaron is spitting out some of the glass I can have that ought to make a hole blood and black jar all right so you got that white and down now we're gonna make our tentative but it turned my fling down soften up the heat this is where you want to try and spin your hands evenly next year all right so I got good connection there just gonna keep that connection up a little bit more Oh so I'm going to stretch this out a little try and get a shape that I like which is pretty much straight just kind of going for gonna be a little bit bigger on the top part I really only need half a listening see I pulled off beverage now we're gonna make a little hole there at the top so a little different this is where we're doing it a little bit different than the first one is this hole that we're making we can make a big one because we're gonna flare it there we go whole there they were flaring it all right so there we go you see now I just got this hollow cylinder it's not quite a bowl piece was actually almost done turn our flame down we're gonna heat up one spot [Music] we're gonna place with our pick okay so see I just pushed it in there gonna create it this little inner part do that again another spot [Music] and then you do that third time got three page nice okay so you guys can see it makes this beautiful natural screen and that's a pinch bowl I'll put a handle on it still but that's the difference between and see if this is still hot [Music] this thing pulled all the way down and didn't crack on me no problem so I felt pretty confident about but here's the difference pitch bull push bull what do you guys think which I wish that would be like better throw a hand on this stuff [Music] they get a nice little handle on this guy feel like big handles on these don't look it's good because they're a little more sleek it's three brands I like you well it works free wine candles but that beautiful if I do say so myself [Music] all right so let's grab this see if we can the Epson came right out so that's great that's what we want to happen don't have to get stuck awesome well I will see if there's any questions here and then that'll be it for today and we'll do something really fun tomorrow for you guys as well [Music] ah your phone died right when you won that's funny I could not figure out what you were talking about earlier well rewatch the alive I'm about to post it right after I click at the end I have usually post them up so you can rewatch the parts that you didn't miss if you don't know in the live feature if you just kind of tap on the screen it'll shoot you forward like I don't know it's like a minute or 15 seconds I don't know it skips you forward a little bit in the video so you can skip parts you don't want to watch every part we watch parts you want to watch alright well thank you guys so is it hard never the last question is it hard to make a shorter Bowl I'm not exactly sure what you mean just like really swai yes because it would be closer to the joint and it's just harder to work stuff closer to the joint because you can't write you don't want to melt the joint otherwise you  with the shape of it it needs to maintain that like perfect 14 millimeter 18 millimeter shaping so that's just the tricky part but thanks so much guys in see you again tomorrow [Music]", "-KCgGMtYTcM": "what's going on everyone you know the south class Viacom back over here at the world famous original Purple Haze then I'm going to be showing you the 17 inch bigger bottoms out this guy teachers and I say darn tree per each of those morons have two slits on them for a total of 16 slits all together each one of those arms are also used to the center so that means that any vibrations anything that you get when you're hitting it or if you're passing along you know on the side it's not going to shake that time to break it off or anything features also a nice splash guard or there's a water will hit your mouth as well as a three-prong eyes pinched so you can throw a piece of the ice and they're cool down to smoke now this piece is gonna be smooth already so you don't necessarily have to but if you want to get to arch on you go thirty pieces eyes down seven if your standards off down he's got three slits on the inside for a total of six slits and this is your standard 18 millimeter ground last wine very thick and durable the waterpots itself is five millimeters thick so single absolute you've been in full of water should have bottles since it's a beaker you're gonna take a little bit more water than either straight fans but same concept with any any of your water pipes the years jobs to make sure to cover all the slips on the regulator that means the down seven to one so all the slits on that preper to cover out of the bottom now this village that should be plenty of water right now bottled water that is all slip to the Bott recovered here they're all slits on the treat bird cover see how follows together take a nice big rib we've been really nice and smooth no water in my mouth is that splash guard to save me it also comes in a straight tube or it comes with the UFO perch you curb on Fort Street which other videos to see what we got thanks for watching", "7EijRAlasUA": "[Music] and today I want to talk about the fuser peds man these little things the diffuser beads they are wonderful these ones right here are made by elevate they're made out of soft glass they are glass and they're super awesome they're great for defusing they're great for weight they've been used to stir feeds and I think we're gonna go ahead and get right into that stuff so the first thing we're going to talk about is the actual diffusing of the beads so you can see in this piece right here we've put it in there and it really is going to make the diffusion good you can see back here just really you can tell how it breaks up the bubbles it doesn't have this big chunk it really breaks it down they start breaking out you know it's gonna hit the next one and break out and go to all the different areas out there but I really love how great it diffuses it you can add it to any piece like this so if you have a piece and you don't have any slits in the bottom and it comes out straight it's a real easy simple way to go ahead and upgrade that to do that um the other sin that's the other great thing about those things is they add a lot of extra weight to your piece so this is a really nice piece it's made out of heavy wall but because it is small it does have you know not as much weight so by adding these beads it's definitely gonna go ahead and add weight to it yo so you know what another really really dope thing is that you can do with these diffuser beads it's freezing and cool your head down that's right take it down another ten twenty thirty degrees just take this whole thing throw it in the freezer pour it in there boom Bing it's gonna be a really really nice cool thing then you can go ahead and take them out refreeze them up not probably good to put them out on a towel so you can go ahead and kind of dry them out then freeze them up do whatever the really really dope for that go ahead freeze up those glass diffuser beads add them to your water pipe Bing you got a super cool Colorado Rocky Mountain fresh of smooth vapor another really really don't think about these diffuser beads they make your piece look fire watch this you can go ahead take some red ones right here drop it in this clear piece fill er up fill er up fill er up look at that don't miss now we're gonna go ahead and go ahead and all I gotta say is look at that that looks fire way cooler way heavier probably would need a little more diffuser beads in there just because of how big this piece is and we'll go ahead and really helps diffuse that stuff up but makes your piece look dope another really really dope thing that you can do with your diffuser beads is you can also use them as a Terp pearl or curt bead or Terp tool or whatever but they work really good in there they're you know about a quarter inch in diameter spin around do whatever now they are soft glass so I honestly thought that they will go ahead and pop really quickly heating them up and whatnot but I did do a very cool experiment where I heated the banger up red-hot I put in a red one it turned black did what after that it does and then I took wax mount plopped it in there so I could cool that bead down as quickly as I possibly could and Bing that thing didn't break I'm good to go so I do strongly believe that these are awesome affordable tert beads and if one breaks on you man they're like 15 bucks for a whole case of these things a whole jar of these things so super cool one last thing about these diffuser peeves is when you get your water out you have two diffuser bees in there put a little alcohol in there swish them around and you can see they're really going to move around of all that extra weight in there is going to be able to help scrape out the edges of your water pipe help cleaning it up so they also work amazingly as a cleaner balls or cleaner beads or something like that whatever you want to call their diffuser beads multi-use product and you can get them at elevate glass gallery like 15 bucks for a whole jar of these things affordable Terp things Terk pearls amazing diffuser beads but either way a it's an amazing product [Music]", "xJWwJ0wf--A": "what's up everybody cupid's here and on today's video we are going to be reviewing

properly to make sure you order the correct size and fitting for your application now in front of us here we have four different down stems and three different slides you'll notice that all of the down stems appear to be different lengths but upon measuring them and again remember we measure from the joint down to the tip you'll see that they are all the same length they are all four and a half inch the only difference between them is the fittings here now starting from the right we have a 14-10 which means it's a 14 millimeter male and it'll take a ten millimeter slide like this right here this size right here is a 18 14 so it'll take a 18 it'll go into an 18 millimeter female and it'll take a 14 millimeter male which is this middle size here this one is a 14 14 so it'll go into a 14 female and it'll take a 14 bolt which is here the last one here is a 18 18 so it'll go into an 18 female and it'll take an 18 bolt shown here now remember we always go by the female fitting first so we go with whichever one that goes into your tube first so if you need a 14 if your tube is a 14 it can take either this them or this stem and then you have to decide which slide you want to accept if your tube is a 18 female it could take this stem and this stem and then your only choices here would be to take either the 18 bowl or the 14 bolt so I hope that guy I hope that helps guys and makes things a lot clearer make sure that you guys get the correct size you need", "cc95tLU9qCU": "this is the green secular with double cones and connected by two tubes it has a 40-millimeter male don't

a fat half gram because it's stuff all the way to the top and we move over to the 18 millimeter Bowl which is obviously if you just kind of see it's a bit bigger fully stuffed up so this is about a five point eight point nine so this is the daily high club bong when I Dani I come dab glass Center bug my first speaker bong that I got if you guys been following for a while you gotta have seen this in a lot of videos it would a lot of older videos at least and this is you know a daily driver for sure I've got this off at DHgate 9 millimeters thick like my better bongs bought fake ice glass down

the fat point eight about a point nine in year this is gonna be the last longer if we tackle it so like I said we went smallest not necessarily small these are still big bombs but you know I mean as far as my 3 meter bombs go this is the order that they are small it's the biggest farthest bongos I'm actually less worried to hit this barn than any of them just because I've been hit this bum for so long and I just know how to milk this one up this is like my this is my baby right here and like I said it's the cheapest farm that I ever bought it's $42 on Budaj gate but it's nine millimeters thick

honeycomb rag it'll smooth out all the sharp chipped edges so that it's temporarily usable [Music] wet/dry sandpaper is a great quick fix to help smooth out areas on rough glass whether it's a chip on a broken mouthpiece like this or if there was a marble attached that happened to break off and it was sharp or a broken base that's been chipped off and it has a sharp edge and you want to smooth that as well basically any minor chip scratch or crack that has a sharp edge to it remember this is just a temporary fix so that you can continue to use your piece without cutting yourself but ultimately we recommend getting the piece professionally repaired or replacing it because this may not be a long-term solution and further damage may occur without a proper fix to start we're gonna need a few supplies we're gonna need wet/dry sandpaper we're gonna need a plastic Basin to be able to put water in we're also gonna need latex or nitrile gloves first is our wet/dry sandpaper you can find this at hardware stores or online and you got to make sure you buy wet/dry sandpaper which is used with water unlike regular sandpaper this wet/dry sandpaper can be used on metal or glass it comes in different grits or levels of abrasiveness so I recommend having a few different grits so you get the smoothest results I have some 500 and also some 1200 wet/dry sandpaper here we recommend using some latex or nitrile gloves so that you don't accidentally cut yourself on the broken glass while working on it or so the sandpaper doesn't irritate your skin while you're working on it optionally you can use the same nitrile or latex gloves to plug up any of the openings on your piece so that no glass Tabriz get inside for this twist honeycomb I'm gonna plug up the mouthpiece opening and also the ground joint opening alright to plug up your piece all you have to do is just kind of pinch it in the middle go ahead and twist it and then just place it inside and then start kind of turning like you're kind of screwing it in and obviously the deeper the better so that it acts as a plug there we go now I'm ready to hold it like this and then sand it down alright start by filling the basin with water I'm just gonna fill it about halfway we don't need too much water here and I've already plugged up the piece make sure the gloves fit nice and snug to seal up the openings watertight I'm gonna start with my 500 grit wet/dry sandpaper so I cut a piece in half I folded it I'm also gonna fold it one more time and again I'm looking for a manageable size here so that way I can polish it and and not have you know be too cumbersome or clumsy so I have this is perfect the lower the number the course or the sandpaper and we want to start with a coarser grit to work out all the large rough areas first and then we'll finish off with our 1200 finer grit for a smoother finish alright so I'm going to go ahead and grab my piece here and again the holes are already plugged up I'm gonna just grab it by the neck I'm gonna bring this into position here and then I'm gonna dip this in the water because again it's wet dry sandpaper and I'm gonna just start sanding the sharp areas down and yes this is gonna take some time because you're manually sanding it coming in here we're gonna start sanding all the really sharp areas first getting in here and getting down on it and then I'm gonna dip it in some more water and I'll switch cuz you know the sandpaper can kind of get worn out so just start on a different area working on this real sharp part first and I can kind of fold it get into the little nooks here okay dipping it in some more water I'm gonna move the glove out of the way and work on this area now and I could already see it kind of polishing up a little bit or just kind of smoothing out now this was a really chipped mouth piece it's again dipping it in the water you want to make sure that it stays wet now I have a really large you can see there's a really large crack right in this area and I'm not gonna be able to polish it all the way or sand it all the way down but I will be able to remove that sharp super sharp edge and kind of round it out because of the really rough shape of this broken mouthpiece I'm not trying to you know clean it all the way up I'm just trying to smooth out the really sharp is to make sure that it won't cut anybody if they wanted to handle it if you wanted to go through and completely smooth it out it would definitely take you a while but it's possible make sure you constantly dip your sandpaper or the piece and everything is wet you don't want any of the dust or it actually won't even work if it's not wet all right now it's been significantly smoothed out here I probably spent about five to ten minutes on it with the 500 grit I got my 1200 here pulled it down or just fold it one more time grab my piece and let's start working on it it's a little bit of water so now I'm just going in with the 1200 doing all the the exact same thing I did with the 500 it's just gonna get a finer polishing so it's smooth it out even more now this is looking great you can totally see it's just a lot smoother where before you didn't even want to touch this and you'll see once this is all polished out and rounded well even do a water test on it that it works good enough to put up to your mouth all right let's go ahead and take all the gloves out and we'll give it a rinse add some water and give you a water test Wow this piece and I can't believe just by using wet dry sandpaper how smooth that is I could not have done that before it would have cut the [ __ ] out of my finger now check this out I'm put my mouth on it and give you guys a water test this is just a temporary fix we would still want to repair this piece check out our other video on how to submit a repair so we can actually repair properly but for a temporary fix that's the way to go all right let's go ahead and recap our steps we had a broken mouthpiece on this twist honeycomb that was way too sharp to even actually think about using so we wanted to polish it down and to do that we use the wet/dry sandpaper very important we started with the 500 grit and then we followed up with the 1200 grit we folded up some sheets of sandpaper we took our nitrile gloves we plugged up the piece we put a couple gloves on our hands to protect them in case the mouthpiece cut us and then we used a water basin filled with water we dipped in the sandpaper and just started polishing away and now it's good I want to say thank you so much patrons out

what's up what's up today as you can see in the title we got another unboxing 18-inch bomb the reason I'm doing another one is because the thick-ass dice bong that I had previously has broken well it hasn't broken but the joint a piece of glass chipped off of the joint and there's extra airflow so I can't really take hits cuz there's air for coming from other places but let's get into this and I don't like to waste time so let's see what they got to offer I order them from Dane gate this is a dainty purchase guys should know [Applause] try to [ __ ] cut myself part this actually came early it was supposed to come tomorrow but you know dengue is [ __ ] it like that as always super guts the almighty keys let's get it all right anything else it's a big box don't know I'm Victor let's see him speak it so let's get into the unboxing shall we I'm excited to get some new glass doesn't know about the same piece for a minute but I'll tell you right now it's pretty much the same [ __ ] different brands will see you super quality every cell think it is it always a pepper the type of rooks we're going for it kind of down stem it comes with you know [Music] there we go there we go it's definitely definitely less thick than that thick ass blast bong we got but as you can see we have got ourselves a maverick bong maverick you know laughs down stand definitely last [ __ ] that's a disappointment you know what I mean that was some big ass blast but this is our piece slimmer to its slimmer in the base but we'll take the hit software and see how it is I a few more specs I didn't hit before go out alright number one this is did not come with a bowl I got these my own Bowl no problem but the only thing came with I sketch I'm already forgetting to tell you the specs that came with ice casts he's really nice got some what I mean but I take 2.5 hits about take some nice bongos over this [ __ ] so let's get it yo so be back y'all thank you back but really I recorded a whole nother [ __ ] video and that [ __ ] guys I deleted that's about mistake I would call it a whole [ __ ] a whole video and I've deleted that's it huh that's all you always [ __ ] pissed i sat there just looking on my feet looking at the camera for like the scrolling through the [ __ ] videos for like a hot 10 minutes just look this angry anyway so we got the bong here as you can see there's a little this little bun-bun floating around little calcium on the glass we took the pencil ready but under this maverick I will show you right now I'm [ __ ] with you [ __ ] Willy we got the ice nice cuts as you can see we got the [ __ ] point five right here about to hit that [ __ ] [Music] I left the torch inside I'll be right back recording [ __ ] Airport Ian you got the torch so y'all know I don't like to waste too much time but check the description of this video I'm gonna be live streaming on Twitch now twitch smoking primarily but also some gaming here in the gaming but my friend with my partner who i game like he streams heavily like he streams all the time so if you really want to see me playing all the time watch his [ __ ] cuz he's gonna be he's gonna have more content of me

0.5 we're now smoking Orange Crush this is now orange curse whole different day whole different strain whole different bong orange cush let's get it the later I itself that [ __ ] is as smooth as can be I just took the hit I'm talking fine no she may be a little strain in my face but um I said it's lit you already know this maverick 18-inch bomb which is lit I'm [ __ ] with it the video stopped recording [ __ ] days ago I've been hitting this [ __ ] I [ __ ] with this bomb more than the other one I had I [ __ ] them more than two guys glass I fell I shouldn't say that but you know it's the truth I [ __ ] with it I [ __ ] would it hits better in the thickest glass when the smoke doesn't collect down here collects do it outdoors the whole [ __ ] on this bar the smoke will collect down here first before you [ __ ] home hit that [ __ ] before you inhale all right I'm gonna pack this next Bowl up and be right back y'all mmm make sure this is recording that should be [ __ ] up alright shot he's up low number two is that bone number to another point five your Latino Oh Joe I was just thinking about some [ __ ] me and my friends are talking about this yesterday just like I even know what subject is college just [ __ ] geography they're like earth geography earth science [ __ ] meteors [ __ ] arms drawn to me [ __ ] I was going to break this down to them yesterday that [ __ ] because we are talking about the ocean how we only know 5% of the ocean that's it a 70% of our planet we don't know anything about 95% of it that's [ __ ] crazy but um I was trying to break this down so on that if a meteor hits the earth there's something called isostatic depression and like there would be a crater where the meteor hit but the earth has to compensate for that somewhere else so like say that [ __ ] hit I'm not gonna say please I don't wanna I'm not gonna say especially hit like just somewhere on like an island a peninsula some [ __ ] there'd be a crater there that should be the sea level would rise right I don't even know but the land would sink the ocean would take over the land but somewhere else on the globe there like the crust would compensate with that isostatic depression it would compensate somewhere else you know what I mean and I guess that's where different lands that were below like coral reefs coral reefs like [ __ ] like that that would rise up and it will be all grassland there would be [ __ ] you know animals all a [ __ ] but [ __ ] the Ice Age that happened in the ICS now with a comment both the AI seeds was caused by a comment I'm not gonna get into that I could the comment hit the earth yeah okay I'm not gonna get us all that [ __ ] alright but um that I see it's the [ __ ] biggest glacier huge glaciers that were on North America that was causing isostatic depression and like other land masses on the [ __ ] earth were flourishing flourishing the earth was in an ice age most of the earth was cold but there was like warm spots on the earth that were flourishing it was like in the video that I watched it called it our Garden of Eden type you like [ __ ] like that like don't put of I want a 7-footer videos to where in the descriptions but there's so many videos like I'm gonna put some in the description I'm at all summer in description I want to tell you our wedding skips that shouldn't even skip Obama say I'm gonna skip zoo all that all right pack that one to tell y'all this [ __ ] is smooth as [ __ ] and y'all cop his bum just though ice and ice can store ice in there bro first hit right out of the gate don't ice and ice is [ __ ] amazing [ __ ] wit so I'm [ __ ] with you all right so imma leave with us imma leave a link to this bong also in the description imma leave it to dengue Kappa referral link it's not unnecessarily at this code I'm saying necessarily it's not a diss code but [ __ ] I'll get like whatever you pay I'll make 7% apparently that's what you start if I have it was my company I would

subscribe I'm out peace", "KE5QugNl92o": "hey hello and thank you for tuning into sound this is kind of part 2 of 3 video the Chi Chi unboxing that I did previously if you'd like to see that video you can click it here well in that video we did an unboxing a triple unboxing of some Cheech glass that I got and this is the second piece out of the Cheech bucks that that we got and today we are going to devirginized this cheek piece Cheech piece Cheech piece you see that that was tricky wasn't it tricky okay so let's go right ahead and get into this and we might even do do a dual cam just for for just for fun I mean there's not a lot of diffusion going on but this is the thing about this one is that I am a fan of little diffusion I like just a little bit so all you need you don't really need sick sickness amounts well that's just me I mean that's that's what I like so there we go so let's go ahead and get get a ripper going here I try to find you you you like the perfect bong hit sighs well I mean if you're a big fat stony head like I am it's a perfect bong head size but if you're just a normal smoker you could probably pass this around a couple times but we're gonna go ahead and put this to know in the new grafic Cheech bong that was said to me out but Cheech glass and here we go Cheers volunteers yeah yeah [Laughter] [Music] wanted to point something out then I noticed about the cheat if you take a look at the bond cam oh it is the right way this time if you take a look at the bond can you'll note that the down stem only has one slit in it it looks like there might be two cuz it's on the other side but there's only one slit in it and that's kind of interesting because I I've done a lot of filming of videos and bubbling and you know percolation all kind of stuff and a lot of the down stems have three slits in it generally and what I've found is that when you take slow-motion shots the down stem but the three slits only the top one works like smoke only comes out of the top slit the only time it really comes out of all three slits is after you've carved it which you're not entering air into the chamber you're actually not doing any scrubbing anymore the scrubbing is already done by that point by the time you pull the Chamber's full so it's kind of interesting that they only put one slit under downstem because that works I mean you only really need one slit on your down stem and that's kind of something else too when you put three that weakens the integrity of a down stem when you just put one I imagine that's much less well yeah inherently it so there's less stress being put on your down stem which i think is kind of cool so that's the one slit see there it's just one slit of diffusion but I think that's really all you need you know now that I look at it and have done the videoing and head out of it this thing is a freaking beast man I of I can't tell you guys Cheech I love beaker bongs and I've always liked the graphic ones I thought they're kind of neat looking just never won never just grab it I never gravitated toward one but this one gravitated toward me which I'm down which is even cooler that it it gravitated toward me oh that's the other thing to the ease and Cheech I didn't it was a good sample of it oh the ease in Cheech I didn't realize that those were like eyes and a happy face you can kind of tell him the shirt he's got a little though it's like a face see that little dots right there those are pupils I didn't know that there's something cool about Cheech glass that we didn't know that the little you can see the little dots in that right there those are supposed to be eyeballs and then the smile at the end of it well that's I gathered that from their shirt there's a little smiley know that before but I just wanted a tune in and thanked each again and show you guys the new glass and how well it works I knew I hadn't smoked out of it yet but I knew it was gonna work really good I the balasso bong is this shape and the bee last long as a beast as well this is really really cool Cheech life oh there's an alien skull can you see it right there there's an alien skull it's funny man every time I look at this there's something new that I didn't see before [Music] that got me high is Frank you guys if you can't tell okay guys I just wanted to come on and smoke some rippers and show off the new glass thumbnail I was posing for thumbnail I don't know if you caught that and I never use them either I always do that and I can never find I can never find it when I'm editing I don't know it just alright if you guys want let's just go ahead and do it right you guys wanted me to do another Ripper right this one's just gonna be a baby Ripper though a baby Ripper baby rippers in the Cheech glass Cheers well that one was very successful curb lamo to the face brain part hole okay that's all I got for today thank you guys for tuning in please make sure to subscribe to tip boys sound got thumbs up please and a

out my [ __ ] head you [ __ ] pillow and i'm standing in 18 up cannabis youtube channel for weed stoners and we smoke weed and get high as [ __ ] and i just wanted to show you guys this is the nice quick one because i know i've been making a lot of long videos and [ __ ] this is that clean ass bong look at the bong it's so clean cleaned and nice out that's always got to clean your pieces you don't want to be smoking out no nasty ass piece you feel me you want to always be cleaning your pieces i use formula 420 original cleaner this is probably the best 710 is also good and i like that these 420 cleaners they have fragrance so they don't smell like ring alcohol and salt you know it smells good whatever smoking on some uh some uh i don't even know what the name of this one is i forgot the name of it but it's good stuff we're gonna smoke through my clean my clean bong you guys are gonna witness my clean bong you guys gonna witness it all let me get it glowing yes sir got the bits glowing now let's rip cheers my fan nice nice clean bun but you see how quickly it does get dirty it gets dirty real quick you can clean your bun but the moment you smoke out of it it's dirty it's dirty you can smoke a few times but eventually that down stem drop in whatever the [ __ ] you want to call it that gets dirty black and you want to [ __ ] clean that [ __ ] out i use i use a simple method for my for cleaning first of course i put my cleaning solution down the neck and down down the down stem um my bun could have used a little more no no that's just the angle i'm looking at it's pretty deep pretty deep in there to be honest but um then i make sure the salt in the down stem uh if there's no salt in the downstem if there's no salt in the downstem ah you need that salt to be to grip onto the resin but if there's too much resin residue inside of the down stem my method is to get a simple plastic straw and to stick it down the down stem and to scrape off the walls you don't have to get it cut all of it off just gotta get the majority of it off make sure that the salt can get to the glass you want the salt and uh rubbing on call to get to the glass so you want to take away some of those layers in there because this is where all that [ __ ] goes is in here that's where all that [ __ ] goes it goes in here and then you in your slide so all that this is the dirtiest part of your bong this right here is the dirtiest part of your bunk so you want to make sure that this is clean because this is not clean your your weed angle and taste good so what you want to do is you want to scrape you want because a lot of down stems they have these little holes on the bottom and they have these slits on the side this is basically a standard down stem they come in basically standard bongs you got other types of down stems that you can get other name brand downstairs better downstairs this is i'm not gonna lie very cheap downstem this is a very expensive bong but all the minor pieces are are cheap uh like the bowl is a cheap bowl the down stem is a cheap downstem but they're good they're you hear that they're strong they're strong glass so they're not cheap isn't necessarily a bad thing i'm just saying that there are more expensive more high quality like quartz type drop ins quartz type uh balls quartz type bangers uh non-breakable glass bongs they are that exists so does rolling trays but we're talking about cleaning the bong today so like i said you want to scrape up that that thick layer of residue off of your bong and and then you put the salt you can either put this in a bag and do it that way or leave it in the bong i leave it in the bone it works perfectly that way uh you put it back in the bong you you gotta tilt your bong kind of to the side here like this and you pour you pour the salt in there and don't untip it you want to turn your bong away from you and you want to start shaking it vigorously so you want you want that salt to be resting on the side there do you want to you want to do some circular motions you want to do some back and forth motion and you don't want to you want to grip your bong confidently you want to make sure that where you're gripping your bong you have full control you have full grasp on your bong because i'm not talking about like shaking it like this you want to get some of those in but but initially you want to be shaking it pretty aggressively you want to be shaking it pretty aggressively um so knowing you can grab your bong and knowing that you have your bond confident in your hands is very important to cleaning your bong um and uh from that point on you shake it vigorously for i do it for if the bottle says for a minute i believe it says for a minute says step one shake bottle thoroughly and pour even distribution of crystals and liquid into the item step two cover all open openings and shake for one minute so yeah shake for one minute but i normally shake for a good amount of time it can be one minute but normally i'd shake it until i'm nice and comfortable where i'm nice and kind i i used my visuals as when i should stop shaking because before i clean this thing today there was a thick brown layer i hadn't i i'm not gonna lie i hadn't cleaned this piece in a while well no not in a while but i smoked from it a lot from the last time that i cleaned it so uh it got it got really dirty and it started it started smelling bad tasted bad i couldn't stand it anymore and i said this morning i got clean especially since i'm gonna be going back to the studio uh that's another thing i got to tell you guys go check out the new uh music channel black sheep studios uh on youtube uh we're gonna be doing some uh sessions uh we're gonna be doing some studio sessions we go i'm gonna be taking you taking that channel along some studio sessions with me and joshua and aka joe and we're gonna uh do all that and it's gonna be great content you guys are gonna probably learn how to make some music um and you guys can see what we're working on and you guys are gonna be able to get hyped and tag along on this journey that we make it big with this black sheep studios making wraps and [ __ ] but back to the bomb uh i said i had to clean my bond because i was going to the studio and and i definitely had to do it today but i it wasn't really that it was the fact that uh i have the cleaner and um i have the cleaner and i cleaned it let's read step three step three thoroughly rinse item under warm water wash hands and enjoy so i wash it under very warm water very hot water and then when i'm done with that because for bonds like this you can tell me if you if you experience this but this is what i what what happens to me so this gets really foggy this part right here gets really foggy and what's actually happening is when you're pouring the water in it's not getting all around the neck all around the neck so uh what i do is i get at least six paper towels and i fold them at an angle and then i fold that roll in half and then i stick it down the neck of the of the bong and from that point on when i get it down there i start twisting the bong around and pulling the paper towel out but i don't start pulling the paper towel until the piece of paper towel that i'm holding at the top is really tight and then i start slowly pulling it out and it's going to be nice and tight because the way you rolled it so it's not going to tear and the way you folded it it's not going to tear so you're just going to keep spinning it and you're gonna pull it out and you'll see that your paper towel will pick up some dirt some some residue that's still on this on the walls of the bong and that make sure that your bong is really clean and then just hot to finish it off i get i put a little bit of dish soap on my fingertips and not that much just just a drop i rub it between my hands and then i start rubbing them off rubbing it down the i know this motion is weird and i know you got some of these disgusting people gonna see that and you're gonna be like oh they look like he jerking off his mom get your head out together [ __ ] okay uh you're gonna put you gotta rub you're gonna rub the the soap on on the the mouth the rim and the mouth the lip and then you're gonna go down the neck then you're going to rinse it upside down because you're going to rinse it off upside down so this is going to be facing downward and i'm not going to show you that because i got bong water in here but um uh but the reason you do that is so that you don't get because you're going to you're going to put you're going to have a thin layer of soap now on here and if when water hits that if it goes inside your bottle it's going to make soapy water and you don't want soapy water in your in your bone so you want to make sure that outside that's upside down so water doesn't get in it and you want to clean that off then uh you want to rinse it off fully one more time with with uh slightly warm to cold water uh and then you're gonna dry it off with a paper towel not a towel a paper towel because it's more sanitary that way um and i think i've done both i've dried it with the towel and dried it with a paper towel and i feel like the paper towel gives me a better finish i don't know why i feel like the paper the regular towel just smudges it a little bit but the paper towel just takes it right off because it absorbs it really well um that's how that's how you clean your bong uh is how i clean my bong today uh i'm really high off of that off of that rip you know and uh yeah i'm [ __ ] blazed off of that rip uh and that's that's that's the benefit of uh cleaning your bong every day or clean your bong frequently you can clean it every day you should clean it every day uh i i don't because uh i just forget to um i had so many things going on so i just forget to do it um it says here on the bottom of the bottle it says cleaning tip number one always change your water that's true always change your water it only takes it takes 20 hours for bacteria to grow in your bone in your bone water i'm gonna smoke again through the uh the bomb smoke again through the bong uh i hope you guys have enjoyed this video um this video is just a quick one uh because i really i love the way it looked when it was clean i loved it and i wanted to get that on camera and uh should took pictures of it but i recorded it and showed it you guys but i i can always i'm gonna clean my phone again and i'm just really good at it but i wanted to show you guys and tell you guys how you guys clean your bong if you have a bigger bong that's like mine you can follow my steps exactly but if you don't have a bigger bomb you have a different type of bong that's fine mike's the steps are basically the same thing it's not that difficult uh we're going to rip some more weed out of my clean beaker bong cheers so god the rip is so clean there's no hesitation there's no resistance it's like i'm stupid high right now guys like really really high um i got nothing else to say to you guys i have a really i have a video i mean that's in the works

thanks for joining me in this video if you were new to my channel I get high and DIY on the internet I am also the creator of the stoner proof coloring book Color Me cannabis and in this video we are going to be decorating a bong using vinyl decals that I'm gonna make on my Cricut machine if you aren't crafter and you don't know what a Cricut machine is essentially it's like an electronic cutting machine I can like design stuff on my computer and then this machine will cut it out for me so I don't have to do like any of the hard work it's amazing I've been wanting to do this craft for a while but I knew my fiancee would kill me if I tried to stick a vinyl deckle on our Brewer bong which is like our daily driver so when I saw a daily high clubs box for January and this little cute piece was in it I was like yeah I'm gonna get this and put a sweet little deco on it the vinyl we are going to be using is holographic because I love hollow stuff yep and I think the holographic will accent the nice iridescent II mists of this little piece from the daily hard Club as well last night when I was stoned I created the deckle on the Cricut design space this is where you can like create all the things to cut with the Cricut machine but the file is all good to go now we just need to load up my Cricut machine with the vinyl cut it and then do a couple other little things and stick it on the bong and then we're gonna get high okay let's hop over to my Cricut and cut to the vinyl decals mm-hmm hop Cricut this is our holographic vinyl it's like plasticy on the one side and then when you peel it away from the backing it is sticky on the back so yeah that is um about six to stuff now we're just gonna lay a piece out on my mat it's going to be about six inches oh wait that's upside down plus right now that was making sense my decals gonna be about six inches long and about six inches wide so I gotta cut out a six inch square out of this okay there's my square it's more like seven inch by eight inches but it's better to have too much than not enough so now I'm just gonna lay that on my mat and then we load this into the machine this is my Cricut machine I just pull that up and that just flops open over here is where the little knife things are that cut the vinyl got some storage right there this little thing all I have to do is click make it a [ __ ] I missed a step just a second you're not gonna believe what I just did I just deleted the file that I worked on last night so yeah looks like I'm gonna be doing this again let's go back and make this deck hold all over again okay this looks close enough to how it did before I deleted it so yeah we're just gonna go with that now we need to load our hollow paper and we should turn it on vinyl pressure deep song okay now he's got to press that little it's almost done okay I think it's done it's not yes okay the next step we have to do is called weeding which is like taking away all the vinyl that we don't want to leave only the vinyl we do want so I'm gonna flip you around and show you that process we're just gonna start off by peeling away a corner of the vinyl oh my god that looks so cute okay let's like try and visualize this I think it might work I don't know hopefully it works the next thing that we need to do is put some transfer tape down on top of this which will help us move it from this piece of paper over onto our bond there is my transfer paper cut to almost the size I need I just peel away that piece and then we just a line this up over our graphic now we just gotta rub that down so the deckle is now sticking more to the transfer tape then it's gonna to the back so we can like peel it off you know crazy oh hey we're getting pretty close to putting the deck lon so I should clean the outside of the glass with an alcohol wipe when you're putting on decals you want the surface to be nice and clean like no fingerprints and whatnot cool there we go it's just perfectly clean all right we got a nice little bead mat to set her down on so she like doesn't roll around and break before I even get a chance to use this piece so apparently all the like bigger pieces of this has a problem sticking to my transfer paper but it's getting a little bit picky with this small bit really rub this [ __ ] out of it come on get on there you little [ __ ] I hardly keep doubt on my vinyl transfer paper and it's showing my advice is don't skip out and buy the cheap crafting supplies never works out okay I didn't get all the bits off of the backing but I can come back and get them later and stick them on the bong that will be easy enough but there we go there is the majority of my design all right the time for the big moment I'm gonna try and do this hopefully it works oh yeah see I screwed up can I go back let me go back there we go from thank goodness hmm ya see it curves so all of my vinyl is going on a curve I did not anticipate this problem I need some scissors okay I'm just gonna cut off some of this that transfer tape and then like reposition it so my stuff is straight because I don't want crooked [ __ ] okay this decals going on in a couple pieces okay so now I just rub that on to get on the stick my heart's working this is like peel porn yeah yeah that looks sick this isn't going exactly how I thought it would but you know we're making it work today were supposed to stay yowzer yeah I think I need to invest in some better transfer tape okay we had the problem of my moon and some of the other details not coming off because my transfer tape is garbage apparently so we can just kind of pick these up as well and just place them on the bong but the other way is definitely a lot faster and more efficient yeah so you just place it on there push it on no the rest of the deckle bits that didn't come off on the transfer tape I'm just gonna stick on there right now quickly and then we will come back and do a grand reveal I love how this turned out it looks so freakin cute alright let's get high I got this so wheat neon yellow lighter that I also got in daily high clubs box also a quick shout out to daily high club for giving stoners so week last like this even without the decals this is a really cool piece and I am quite fond of it alright time to christen it I love it so much I am pretty fond of my new little bond that turned out pretty cute I mean it was cute otherwise this piece is adorable but adding the little Hollow on there it's like the icing on the cake my friends if you're still watching this video then hit the thumbs up and if you haven't already be sure you subscribe to my channel and join me in more of my videos I try and post them police weekly but not all the time like you know", "U7P2OkHXRjQ": "I was gonna be boss time for new video and this one the vortex bomb I'm recording this clip after I've recorded the whole video because I realized her an editing that I [ __ ] it up so yeah I'm that now before we start this video I do need to say this channel is designed for people that are 18 years and older any younger you need to leave this channel my videos were also intended for educational and entertainment purposes only that means you should not be trying the [ __ ] that I do at home you can leave it to me but that the way era is the vortex bomb you've obviously seen the thumbnail you can see the tornado that it makes and it looks quite a cool I pulled this off wish it was cheap and it was the coolest bong that they had on the app so I bought it one pet peeve that I do have about this thing is you need to put a lot of [ __ ] water in it it doesn't know how much is in there no but watch what happens when I start putting on the same you see that literally up to about here for the water is there's not much room to get the smoke in there she can take the fattest hits as far as I know I've tried it already a couple times but I had a little bit of water in there and it wasn't doing the tornado property so it's bit of a pain in the ass took me a while to figure out that this is how you do it so this is actually gonna be the first time hitting with this much war and taking a rip as it should be something that we're curious about is how much splash back and ends up getting when I was using a little bit of water and think of rips out this I was still getting splash back and I've got over twice the amount of water in this oh yeah I'm probably gonna be swallowing some [ __ ] bong water after this [ __ ] bongs also comes with a standard little bowl this is an 18 million I'm pretty sure I hold at 14 but they gave me 18 now to be perfectly honest review it doesn't matter if you get 14 or 18 mil because the airflow is going to be restricted by the little slits in the bottom which help it spin so regardless of the size you get you're probably still gonna get the same airflow so just get whatever you've got the most bowls of I'm not gonna waste any more time we have the bolt packed it's quite a fatty this is quite a wide bowl so I'm happy with that you can get a lot of weed in there I wanna try to get this whole thing in the shots you can see it [Music] [ __ ] I knew it oh [ __ ] soon as I cleared that my for the wall [ __ ] you it burnt my dough's I'll finish it I didn't even pull that hard I'm just gonna die for a minute holy [ __ ] that was [ __ ] fire let's take a bit of time to recover alright here's a problem that I have with a yeah so when you're pulling it you form the tornado and the waters going up when you're doing this no smoke is actually coming into this chamber it's just filling up down here as soon as the water level goes down in here it this smoke breaks through when that happens you have to breathe it a completely different sort of strength to what you were and there's a pain in the ass because it messes up your head and then obviously the amount of splash back you get grit so if you were thinking about getting one of these bonds either see if you can get one that's really well-made or just don't get one at all because it looks cool but in reality it's just [ __ ] that's a bit of a waste of money sorry about that but at least if you were thinking about getting one of these you know that pretty [ __ ] [ __ ] so yeah I've got me [ __ ] beat and after the end the video here guys right", "P2byzzOzMDk": "hello everyone this is Dan from smoke cartel and here in front of me is a very special collection of water pipes from Kade made these water pipes are special because that they are 3d printed if you're not familiar with how 3d printing works it's very similar to a 2d printer only layers of molten plastic build and build on top of each other to form an object maybe if you or someone more manly than you has ever built a house out of bricks it's a very similar principle so first you start with a computer model and then the printer takes that model and with a tiny nozzle builds it with molten plastic and it doesn't get much more precise than a computer 3d printing started as kind of a novelty but it has become a very powerful building tool so it makes sense that they would use this technology for one of mankind's greatest achievements the bomb the wave long's work does require a lot of precise engineering so bongs and 3d printing go together like peanut butter and jelly and weed it comes in a few different varieties that all the designs are very beautiful as you can see with this one it has bands of color represented by the layers of molten plastic and if you look really closely you can see that all the bands are kind of beveled and textured and you can actually make out precisely where think Peter started on to a new layer there are a number of advantages to using a 3d printed ball one of the biggest ones is that they are shatter resistant and extremely durable much like a silicon piece but unlike a silicon piece they're not malleable so they retain their shape so in a way you could think of it as combining a glass piece and a silicon piece but that's not really it it's kind of its own new thing so it gives you a lot of different advantages and it makes these pieces that definitely some of the most unique you'll have in your collection by far you can definitely expect to see a lot more smoke where utilize this technology in the future because it's relatively new so check out our collection of 3d printed ones on our website smoke our Telkom because they're definitely unlike anything you've ever seen before in the industry [Music]", "EmLC84R-3ro": "[Music] man your camera's ridiculous the color on this is dumb like that doesn't is that doesn't look that blue back how's it going everybody it's me vitamin C and today we are on our way to the post office because we are

modular bombs like I was saying and with every bomb or every modular piece plants a tree and I bought myself a full bomb which means I plan to two trees that's great ain't it this is what we first get when we open the box got some paper here let's see this packaging is unreal check that out the tie glass that's their name check them out Instagram telling vitamin C's said hello or vitamin C sent you oh it says something right here it says I alone cannot change the world but I can cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples by Mother Teresa take this piece out alright check this out this

that design that is a nice design Thank You beat eyeglass this is their other one and I really like this design not just because of me being me but I like it's a dreamcatcher so this one is a little different it says here do your little bit of good where you are it is those a little bit of Goods little bits of could put all together that overwhelmed the world by Desmond Tutu we have the olive wood connector ring this is what you would put this piece on he goes like that and then this would connect to the base [Music] we're almost getting to the base we have a few more things this feels like a bowl that's a bowl that's a nice looking bowl it's got like a pink leaf on there they gave me the option between green or pink and I decided to go pink because all my bonds are already green all right now for the moment of truth oh my god this is the base check that out vite eyeglass logo on the bottom it's really nice I love the way it goes to a showerhead from an inline that means a percolation on this it's gonna be ridiculously insane I can't wait to fill this up with water [Music] how's it going everybody we're back here we've kind of switched views we're now on the DSLR and now right here we're on the Hawaii 30 Pro so without further ado everybody we have ourselves here the Voyager this is an incredibly beautiful piece and I can't get over just on the way it looks alone that I feel like just hitting it it's gonna be a game-changer alone let's grab this here get some beautifully delicious gorilla glue number four it's got a nice little pink leaf on it this is the one thing that's actually different out of my entire last collection I don't have anything pink all right kind of excited kind of nervous this is the Voyager from me tie glass are you ready I'm ready [Music] here we go [Music] that I can't even explain how amazing that hit is either that's disgusting there's something right sonority in the top there but you see how disgusting the yellow that Rick was right I'm good I'm good I can definitely go for like four more I feel like cameraman needs to take a riff for this so before we continue I need to actually grind up what we are smoking right now this is gonna dump the [ __ ] I don't my grinder but one good thing about this grinder it is provided by myself MTG I bought it but it is a static crew shredder grinder and I've had this grinder for about three years now before I see and I haven't had to really clean it once and it gives you a really nice fluffy grind and CLE out fresh meat I don't know it's just a beautiful piece of art compared to like all these other bongs because like this looks like I don't know like how that's way more futuristic compared to other blocks right like most build the bongs look so generic where this one is it actually has like elegance to it some of those build the bombs they just have clips on them and then those clips can break off like don't mind the dirty bomb but these are the kind of clips right here they're called cat clips and they're meant to keep stuff like down stems in but some of them are meant to use hold the whole building bombs together and I've seen people hold to build the bombs like this and the peace [ __ ] fall right off and break and I'm very confident that I can go like this right now take the bowl out go like this right now and the bottom ink will fall out great it's just shaking the water up now and linking that look kind of gross but the whole point is to get this ball Garrety I bought this ball through them using the payment plants Ezell if you guys have ever heard about them let me know in the comment section below let me know what you guys have on current payment plan less sizzle maybe it's a puff coal peak maybe it's a something else whatever but you can get this on payment plan which I did without further ado I'm just gonna rip it again cheers everybody [Music] believe that already I can't remember how many rips we had out of this piece but it's starting to get pretty grimy so I think we might have a nice cleaning video for it eventually also I'm not sure we got a good view of this but the logo is on the bottom it's sandblasted that's the logo eats a glass we need to get this bomb dirty so here we're gonna take it and smoke it for the next few days so here's a montage of us smoking it Cheers [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "3ACmYxAlH0c": "hey guys so today i'm going to show you how i um do my i'm going to say vase i sell them as vases so to start because i have not found an adapter that really works for these yet i just literally use a ton of tape just green painters tape any tape will probably do and then you want to make sure that you have a really snug fit that way you can keep it level and you don't have to worry about it falling so i am going to go prep this and then i will be right back okay i'm back and here we have the prepped face and i have taped off the rim it's really um personal preference to me some people don't like the epoxy touching their lips they say it's you know unhealthy not good for you dangerous toxic all that stuff but really i wouldn't think it's any different than drinking out of your tumbler without a lid but anyway i use automotive primer it works really well in my opinion all right so all i did was spray this with white primer and taped off the rim and we are going to be using pink and purple monkeys platinum diamond you guys can see this one pink and purple monkeys pearly gates and then the inspired angels tootsie roll so i'm going to go paint the top of my vase gold and i will be right back okay guys i'm back so i ended up painting the top a tan instead of gold so um anyway i mixed you only need about 5 ml less than 5 ml for this because we are going to do the thinnest layer of epoxy before we put on our platinum diamond from pink and purple monkey and our pearly gates from pink and purple monkey so um i used cc diy fast set so i'm just going over this spreading it making sure i cover all of it without putting too much my turner arms are different on a couple of my turner's they're all from bj turner's brian and jennifer make the best turner's um i've been using them since i started using motorized tumblers and i and the whole time i have i think it's 23 now total i i can turn 23 tumblers at a time with their turners of various sizes and i've had one motor go out in like two two and a half years now i think something like that um this was supposed to be a live video but since i have the electrician coming for a rental today last minute on a saturday even that's living in a small town i decided to try to put the video together for you guys so you could at least have it once i'm sure that i have a good nice even thin thin layer all over this and i do all the way around um where the stem goes because i use a drop-in stem and it the epoxy doesn't touch it so it never really gets heated i also prefer to do these on the vases that have an ice catch just to keep it extra cool i know that the epoxy isn't getting heated enough to be toxic okay so once you have it coated i'm going to grab a piece of paper and i like to start with my lightest color first so i'm going to use the pearly gates and start at the bottom make sure i get it all and then i'm going to slowly go up and then about a quarter inch from where the white ends i slow down make sure i get it all the way around there and then i go back up to that the edge of where i stopped and i sprinkle super lightly i take it a little bit into the tan not too much turn it around so you can see towards the tan i get really really light okay and then i'm going to switch out my glitter and then we are going to use platinum diamonds and same thing i start at the i start at the top instead of the bottom and i go down to about a quarter inch from where the white starts to bleed into the tan make sure i get all this area good make sure when you epoxy you get it inside the ice catch holes and then again we'll just lightly sprinkle down a little bit into that where that white is make sure you get both sides of the stem i know the one side's a little tricky to get and then i will show you guys what that looks like so here is our first layer and i'll only do one layer of glitter on this you guys um if you spray paint with a coordinating color and use high quality glitters do you guys want to see this with flash it'll be crazy look at all that sparkle so high quality glitter is key you use it it seems more expensive but just like laundry detergent you use less of it and it's beautiful don't worry about inside the stem we will get that cleaned out after we do the next coat of epoxy and then i wash these really really well before they go out so once this is done we'll come back and i'm going to put a layer of epoxy and then we'll do cheetah spots i cheat with my cheetah spots because for some reason i cannot get the black edge down to save my life so i use vinyl for the black and then glitter for inside of it but i still think it's going to be super cute so today we are doing part two of our glitter vase so i already i thought about it after my last live video and i was like it would be silly to come back and just epoxy this so i went ahead and put the epoxy over the glitter already and sanded so if you guys can see i epoxied and sanded this after we glittered it that way we could move into the next step so just like with your tumblers when you mix your epoxy for this you just want to do a nice even layer just to make the glitter smooth okay and then i told you guys that i cheat so i have a sheet of spots that i've cut out with just regular black permanent vinyl and then i am going to place them over the gold i'm going to leave the white empty so i'm going to start i just take a little piece of transfer tape and pick up a spot or two and i start placing them on you guys can see that and there's no rhyme or reason to how i place the spots i just do it until i think it looks good okay so then when you're happy with your spots i think sometimes i put too many because i just don't like the spaces okay so i'm gonna call it good on the black spots i think then i'll take it off and show you guys all right so if you guys can see and then we are going to do the spots tootsie roll from the inspired angels and this is my favorite chocolate brown so when i apply these inside the spots i use mod podge and whenever i use mod podge underneath a glitter i try to mix a little bit of acrylic paint into the mod podge it really helps with hiding any imperfections or whatever so i ended up using chocolate bar which this is also the color i use for my north pole mugs for the hot chocolate drip i think it's the best so then we're just gonna use just a regular little paint brush nothing fancy we're gonna dip it in the mod podge and then let me okay and then i just try to dab it because you don't want to get it up onto the black vinyl if you can help it so if you just dab it and use the paint brush just spread it and then you don't have to um glitter it after each spot but i'm gonna take it off the turner for this i guess might make it easier okay so then you're just gonna keep dabbing the paint inside the spots if you do get it on the black it's really not a big deal you can scrape it off before you epoxy and you don't want it to be too thick because you want it to dry fairly quickly and i mixed a ton of acrylic paint mod podge you only need a tiny bit so then i just tap it on the bottom a little bit i blow it on it okay so i'll blow it off and then i will stick this in my dryer and um dry the mod podge even quicker so we are going to you want to make sure that your mod podge is dry okay so i just use this like bristly brush it came in like one of my super cheap paint packs from walmart i think and after the mod podge is dry i use this to just brush off the excess because it really likes to stick onto the black vinyl i like to make sure it's super good before i seal it some people don't steal it once they get all the glitter off but i've had too much shift even after brushing it so i like to brush it off and then one mistake i made on my last one was i didn't go through and get it off the black spots so i had little bits of brown glitter or pink glitter on it so i'm just gonna use the tip of my finger and some rubbing alcohol to brush along on the the black vinyl just lightly to get any little brown pieces of glitter off and then be really careful that you don't like shred your paper towel on the spots like i just did if you can see right here i have to pick out so now i'm gonna scrape this out of here so i'm gonna seal this one time with rust-oleum triple thick glaze and then i will epoxy it it's going to make my store stink but i will just do it right here so you guys can see okay so then i'm going to brush it one more time just to be safe okay so this is what it looks like after we brush it all off okay so krylon i think i said rust-oleum earlier it is definitely krylon triple thick crystal clear get glaze and i'm just gonna do a light coat over the the glitter spots okay and then while this is drying i am going to work on taking off the tape i like to use electrical tape so that i can kind of pull it like this because then i'm going to go through with a hot knife to cut off the excess epoxy up there you have to be really careful because if you don't take the tape off you know after it's been spinning for like 30 minutes or whatever you could easily break the seal okay so i just use these um i buy like a whole thing of [Applause] i buy 30 at a time and these like the blades just snap off after you heat them too much so you can just keep using them until you can't anymore all right so i just put out some of my blade and then i use a propane torch i'm going to heat up the blade and then i'm going to i kind of have to hold it by me so let me i go along the edge of it like this first and trim off the big lip excess and i just continue that all the way around you want to make sure that you do this before your final coat of epoxy okay so after you cut the big lip off it'll look like this i know it's kind of ugly um but you're going to go over it again so i heat this up a little bit more and then i'm going to go along the bottom but if you're really confident in yourself you can do this you can just skip straight to this step but i've always i've learned the hard way that once you cut it off you can't put it back so i like to do it in sections slowly so then once you have it edged we're going to tape it again okay so i like to use electrical tape i use packing tape when i can't find my electrical tape but electrical tape is flexible which around the lip of the bong is perfect because it will bend under and then on the final coat of epoxy i'll probably take the tape off before i leave work tonight so i'll leave here at like five-ish maybe maybe six and i'll peel the tape off before i leave just so that it's a nice smooth finish tomorrow okay so then once it's taped it should look like this you want to have that little edge right there so that the epoxy can seal where you cut again you could avoid that if you take off your tape when you're supposed to um so i am going to use stealing my kids magnet resin because it's small and easy to tote around we are gonna mix equal parts of a and b i think i normally mix i'm gonna mix 25 ml's it's probably way too much but i can't remember and i know a lot of people use two cups they like measure by weight they do all this fancy stuff it's i literally pour in you always pour part a first since it's it's thicker it's like harder to judge how much you actually pour i pour part a first and i'm gonna try to get this to a three line okay and then equal parts [Music] so equal parts of a equal parts b b i always pour second because it's thinner as long as you pour slow you can normally get it right exactly to where you need it which in my instance is six drums okay so once you have it mixed thoroughly make sure you're scraping the sides scraping the bottom mixing well okay i'm gonna grab some pearl mica really quick for the pearl we are going to use um pink and purple monkeys pina colada and then i'm just going to use this little wooden stick put a little bit in the cup not a lot and i'll probably mix like five mls i'll pour five ml's in with the the pearl so now we are going to coat this in our epoxy and we want to do a little bit of a thick layer because we want it to swirl a bit down on the bottom you also want to make sure that your clear coat is dry don't forget to get inside the ice catch with your epoxy those little holes really make sure you get this bottom edge you don't want to use too much epoxy that it creates waves and drips off when you heat it so i'm just going to put a little bit more on make sure my holes are good make sure around where the stem goes is good one more time lightly go over it with my finger alright so i'm gonna start drizzling the white on in strips or the pearl i mean not white you guys if you try this and they fall off your turner they break if they just don't turn out how you thought they would don't feel bad my first tries were not always perfect either i mean they're still not perfect obviously but i'm gonna bring it a little bit into the tan i'm gonna get it on the base too without getting in my hair okay so i'm gonna use my torch to this is how i apply my air bubbles i know some people do not agree with this method i know some people like alcohol i liked the rubbing alcohol when i could get 91 percent but since i can't get anything over 80 right now i've been using my torch and honestly it's it's been a lot better so i'm just going to go over it quickly evenly you don't want to heat it too much or you will ruin your epoxy okay so i'm going to show you guys what it is looking like and then like i said before guys inside of this um we'll clean that out when we're all done tomorrow i'll put one more coat of epoxy over this and then it will be ready to go yesterday we finished off adding the spots and epoxying this today i wanted to show you guys i told you not to worry about the inside of this that we would get it cleaned up um as long as you're careful when you epoxy no epoxy gets in here so this is just a little bit of overspray and glitter that's kind of stuck in there so what i do is i get i just take a little razor blade and i go along the inside edge um if you do get a little bit epoxy inside of here like around the lip on the inside just heat your knife and same thing just scrape it along the inside edge be careful obviously because this is glass okay so then we are going to grab a paper towel um a little bit of acetone again i just use this gallon of acetone that i get through napa and then carefully you don't want to get it all over the epoxy on the outside so carefully just take your finger stick it inside i do that a couple of times some paint is harder to get out than others i use automotive primer and sometimes getting it off of something you don't want it on can be difficult because it is a very strong primer so you just i stuff it in and twirl it around a little bit and then as you guys see it all wipes out um because it is clear glass you can see on the inside it looks like there's primer and paint but that's just um because the glass is see-through but um we already took care of the rim but before this goes out i'll just show you really quick i use these they are 75 alcohol these ones i left open so they're a little dry so i'll just add a little bit of alcohol to them but i wipe down everything before it goes out and just as clean up you know i go through i clean all the little crevices i wipe it down wipe the mouth but here we have our leopard milky way vase or cheetah i'm not even sure i can't tell my spots apart you guys so this i will sand if the customer wants their name on the base i will add the name to the base and then i will do the final coat of epoxy it's already pretty smooth but it could use one more coat in my opinion so if you like tutorials like these make sure you subscribe because we will be posting a lot more videos in the coming weeks and i cannot wait to share them with you guys so make sure you subscribe and have a great day", "VAQN7y_pSKE": "hello everybody today I'm gonna show you how to use this water dog pipe and Lisa Lisa when I sing how to use water pipe part is all kapanke usually we record a water dog I think you feel with a little water in here so right here for this one I think is probably inch yeah about 7.5 inch here there's so many versions sound coming with a feet you can stomach it is but I don't recommend you carry the water dog with the feet the easily Tobruk the second way to use it he's a get a cup get a water I mean like this well when you're finished use the water dog pile each occasion putting here like this is it easy to hold or you can put in a RS in the mug and put the pipe in the eyes so you can lie here only when you inhale you can gather that couch eating feel the smoke whatever you call it that's a second way to use it you can also use the glass also like to us time or something will you finish use just putting five in here or monk this is this way is more safe compared to the water taco is back you just put her on the table he's now very safe we're putting them on a cop it's not very easy to

old philosophy and English major has taken a year off of college to work with glass blowers to create a new market and a new appreciation for smokeable glass pipes vices Erica Matson went to an art opening in New York to get a look at some expensive bongs so the art exhibit tonight it's actually being held at a guy's apartment named mr. gray all I know is that he's 21 years old and he's an art collector in the south mr. gray welcome to great space art today nice to meet you right now these guys are killing it in the world of cannabis but the condemned girl world has no quit exist yet so all these people are coming here tonight they're seeing this for the first time and they're going wait a second that's a beautiful piece of art and I go yeah you could also smoke out of it and actually this piece in particular you take the dome off and it's another piece really yeah oh that's really cool yeah oh it's really the highest-end stoner art you could get to the point where it's not stoner art at all its art that that reaches the contemporary art world yeah I mean they shouldn't be in a head shop right exactly and you know Robert Mickelson himself is actually very converse possible he's been in the Smithsonian before Corning Glass Museum he was classically trained really well known glass art right money for what all right there's a random man just keeping put money in your pocket you're like you know that's what happens here greyspace our magic happens yeah how did you get involved with this whole thing I joined a venture capital group and it was only for weave companies and there I'm a the guy who manufactured bones and I saw the manufacturing process which was interesting and then he said take a look next door there's some artists doing some interesting things there and I walk next door and there were these artists renting a warehouse from him blowing glass sculpture that you could smoke out of these weren't bongs first and foremost they were art and I knew immediately that I needed to bring it to the contemporary art world [Music] I'm not selling pipes on selling pieces of art be to smoke out and I want people to see it in the right setting and this is the right setting this is New York City and if people ask me all the time opening Colorado that's that's where the cannabis businesses it's much more about the art market and art is flourishing in New York more than anywhere else in America me and mr. gray actually went to kindergarten together like 20 years ago what's the surface real name Ben Benjamin Milstein for me he's always been B so the weird thing about this party's it's happening during New York Fashion Week but what you're seeing was a lot of people who are kind of in the fashion world in the art world young people eating very nice sushi drinking very nice champagne trying not to knock over very nice boxed you're one of the artists behind one of my favorite pieces and one of the most expensive pieces here tonight so can you tell me a little bit about this guy this piece is a robotic ocean protector goddess when it does get smoked it'll be a special time you know like a fine wine this is a bong this is you try to be kidding me how is this a bong so the mouthpiece that you put your mouth use right there the hole this is the joint where your nail goes on for concentrates and then this part comes off the frame comes off and you can smoke and clean it well this is to me like it's all ready to take this to the next level of art because it's taking the space that we know art as which is wall display and doing what you do best which is turning it into a bowl think a lot of my work kind of has that quality to it desire to see classy beautiful things that are recognizable in the art context I believe in the shared vision that a lot of pipe artists have to put this work out there in the proper setting and show it to people they might not ever run into it why did it take someone like you who's very young to come into this world and say I'm the guy that's gonna take this medium and make it a contemporary art idea you know why because it takes someone from outside the bomb scene to see that this is not a bomb at all that's a piece of art as the people buying this right now they're they're smokers they smoke out of these pieces and so they see it first and foremost as a functional piece of art and I see it as an art piece that's functional [Music]", "7t4bkAwzxNs": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]", "dRrwkC3yXwI": "my name is j12515 guys i just wanted to say a quick apologies before we get into this video for uh not uploading for a little bit uh we've been a little bit under the weather guys and uh unfortunately i've not felt like uh putting together anything uh so i just wanted to put that out there for you all we are okay uh we're still breathing we're still above dirt which is good and uh all we can do is really push through and uh come out the other end smelling like roses so as you can tell by the title of the video we got the glass uh parade and we've got the plastic homemade parade here glass versus homemade bongs which is better so i'm going to be taking a hit out of both of these pieces i'm going to be telling you the pros and cons of owning each piece and just give you a little bit of my thoughts and experience on smoking out of the glass and the homemade before you get into this if you do enjoy the video make sure you slap that like button and if you are new make sure you hit that subscribe button so like i said we got some nice herb grinded up here we got some of the fire oh gee courtesy of the mojave med delivery service so let us know what you're smoking down on the comments and as you all know we've hit friday so uh let us know what you've got planned for the weekend all right so packing up the homemade bottle there and then we will pack up the glass parrot [Music] okay everybody like i said i hope you're smoking along enjoying your day let's take a rip out of the powered first homemade [Music] okay bowl number one nice and smooth what i like about homemade bottles is i've smoked out of a lot of glass if you're looking to get that huge hit straight to the head glass is the way to go homemade bottles i find that i can pack myself one after the other you know still hits me but not as much to the point where i don't want to pack another one also the other thing i like is the fact that you don't have to worry about keeping it so clean as you can see we actually cleaned it out for this video so we could uh get a nice result from each piece but yeah like i said i like the fact that it can be a daily driver you don't have to worry about it uh worry too much about cleaning it and if you do want a new bottle it'll cost you less than a dollar so i can't argue with that homemade bomb [Music] done so now like i said we got the glass parade packed [Music] let's get into the glass guys cheers [Music] oh [Music] finish the milk kids so taking a hit out of the glass as you can see here comes the cough if you notice when i took a pee i took a hit made of the uh the homemade it was a lot smoother now the glass put a hole in the back of my head so like i said i do like to keep my pieces um as clean as i possibly can but uh you know having to keep your glass clean especially when you do clean it there's risks of breaking it you know so there are pros and cons with only glass but um like i said i hope you enjoyed the video just letting you know a little background of uh what i like about the homemade and what i like about the glass [Music] let me know down in the comments what your preferred uh bombing is to smoke out of whether it is a homemade or it is glass i hope you enjoyed the video everybody like i said please smash that like button if you did share to a friend if you are new subscribe and if you can't cope don't move there is hope smoked oh have a good weekend you bunch of [ __ ] stoners peaceate family [Music] you", "C7G6m57o03w": "well hey party people hey hey how is everyone that I completely forgot about okay I placed an order on grass city calm back in February it's from the Netherlands which feels that much cooler does it not ordering paraphernalia from the Netherlands it's just kind of a cool game okay so grass City calm they are an international shipping headshot basically as far as packaging goes there is one little bang in here but it feels you know it's it feels very insulated so I'm not really concerned with you know damage but we'll see everything else on the box is great three condition as far as if you are wanting something a little bit more anonymous or just however because it's coming from customs and they do have to let you know like what's in the box what's in the box well that is listed on here but it's not specific I feel like it says glassware so just as a heads up get heads shops that's so stupid [Music] you could say it's a laws on Mildred you know who cares but there's nothing in here that says grass city or anything that mentions lead or whatever so I'm not never shall we unveil yes yeah can you hear my dogs snarling Berlin some Sour Diesel here you guys see the discoloration this is my graph Reap East grandeur I also have the four piece but I don't really it's Lieutenant Dan rolling around on this back anyways I am I soaked this overnight when I was cleaning it in the IC pro ball and it stripped the color just saying he has a wheelchair he is a little chest lock why he was stomped on as a puppy I adopted him to rescue and his back legs don't work but they were there my kids always like it's got two minutes you fools he clearly has for only two or functional okay although the original Lieutenant Dan did have his legs removed [Music] the grinders that I have like my lift grinder I love but it's I don't piss the bikies stuff just bring all of it on all the time okay keep it simple folks let's get into this and just close this up I'm on a tangent here this what smells so good we're gonna close it up living thing I put my eye on this on a couple different places and ones to like oh you know anymore I used to buy a lot of plastic figures anymore unless it's out of necessity I've got some poker poker bowls or not what is it called but hold look who that is right so I'm gonna be getting one of these that's metal so I can just torch the poker because I'm classy AF I got a war tray right but I don't remember how much this was but it was a heck of a deal and it's beautiful and it's hard so the only other thing I got here can you guess used for tobacco only guys hmm so they gave me some free screens which I won't use but I appreciate the sentiment it might be a smell proof bag so usually using it or using it as it's another little screen but this is a glass it's like a plug okay so I am a Worf and it's a little thinner I mean I knew it was thin going into it I knew it wasn't as thick as my other ones but red and white that is gorgeous so there were often Tiffany tag here I seem to fit glass for me it's easier to clean on my hands cuz you really a lot of times you really got to get in there and scrub that just gross gross stuff takes hand power and you get some fancy-schmancy stuff like this right here that's tough to clean this is much easier this is much easier and just look how so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get this new girl lined up we're gonna take I don't know a couple good hits so you see the priest would you look at this down step this is a long guess that is going to cause a spectacle this is a commanding downstem I mean that is a presentation it seems large and in charge have another rawrr 18 millimeter because that is the size of the down stem in the joint but I am just going to use this little 18 millimeter like very happy though because guess what kids under $200 under $200 for a war it is a little bit thinner but it is still really good quality and I'm not real rough on my stuff I'm not a child I I buy things that I want to cherish and take care of or if I don't like pass them on but you know I mean I'm not gonna be flinging this thing around so I don't need something that's ultra thick because I'm going to be manhandling it enough about this can we get something in here and get it in here that's kind of let's do that okay they're like a holy crap with this girl listen listen to this chug I mean it moves the whole that's a monster okay you know what this isn't gonna cut it I want to welcome her into my home with authenticity and really I want to give her a good scope of what we're gonna be working embrace who she is in this home also so we're gonna go ahead and pack a bowl in the particle if I have ground enough I might even need more we don't need to fill the entire thing up but I think that we need to get that's a lot of weight so let's go with that I'm not gonna put any more in there let's just try to roast through this it's 9:20 in the morning you know what I got library books to drop off you girls got things to do this Sour Diesel is gonna keep my wheels rolling okay so let's jump right in I am a little nervous trying to do the whole bowl I think let's get it in two hits shall we because I just I am an adult after all and not not that adults can't do really fun things like try to roast through a bowl that's made for four people but welcome home sweet girl let's just do this let's just do this my lungs invite the gift that you are about to bestow so cheers to everyone out there welcoming my new piece thank you grass City for once again making things effortless making prices completely reasonable and making me smile sure I'm ready listen to my dogs here we go did I get this whole thing in me are you kidding [Music] okay so close oh wait crap that was way more smoke than I was expecting just dead center like a professional it's in my nose alright she's far more powerful than I gave her credit for I apologize okay of course the weed clipper begins as soon as I push record so it's been about an hour maybe yeah thanks thanks pals thanks friends I'm gonna take another hit because I promised a couple hits and before I get this video up we're gonna take a couple hits so one more and my new sweet little thing I don't even know what to call her yet but she's a little delicate I'm just a little nervous because she's used to my roots but it's good to have delicate things every now and then remind ourselves that we need to just be gentle with things okay Cheers I'm gonna try to get through the rest this bowls you can see it it's huge huge so we'll see how I do all right buddy [Music] the windows open there's just the tiniest little car I got most most of the ladies though so those two big hits were to be hits however feeling good foot Lucifer greatest our day because as much as that tasted good I really do have things to do so welcome sweet new piece thank you guys for watching I will see you guys later have a fantastic day [Music]", "P56Fwke8xV0": "hey they're really quick I have another ceramic smoke we're video on how to make this ceramic water pipe so if you have any questions be sure to check the description box and then leave your comments below and if you like it or you want to see more be sure to subscribe alright guys enjoy using any clay you want start by wedging the clay I rolled mine into a cylinder so it fit into my coil extruder now instead of a coil extruder you can use slabs wheel throw or roll out your coils to no more than a quarter of an inch to build the tube for the water pipe I am using a two inch in diameter plastic tube that is ten inches tall you can use any diameter high or material for your tube I begin by rubbing the tube in petroleum jelly so the clay won't stick as much you can also wrap the tube in a single layer of newspaper for an easy release [Music] to make my base I use a three inch diameter metal disc with some petroleum jelly then I slip and score my coils as I wind them together [Music] remember when you make your water pipe you can make it any size for your tube and base [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] as you continue to build smooth out the coils so they are no longer visible and this also strengthens the piece don't forget to slip and score all the way [Music] once I reached the top I smooth out the cylinder with the help of my sponge [Music] [Music] next I'm going to carve a hole near the base for the smoke to enter the piece to figure my diameter for this downstem I'm using a pack of water tube after I carved my hole I'm going to remove the tube and clean up the hole so I can insert my perk for the perk I'm going to roll the coil around my needle tool and then thin the clay out so it will fit into the hole at the base of my cylinder I'm going to seal the end off and use an 8 inch drill bit to create four holes keeping the perc on the needle tool slip and score the sections where the perc and the cylinder meet and carefully insert the perc into the cylinder [Music] after you insert the perk into the cylinder you're going to work on attaching the cylinder to the base here I wanted a bigger base so I made a five inch in diameter disc and attached my old flattened base to the larger base [Music] when I was ready I used my needle tool to measure where the cylinder would rest so I could slip and score in the right place [Music] [Music] next we can build the tube for the bowl to sit in for this I use my three inch tall pecs tube lathered in petroleum jelly I then smooth the tube and Bennett so it would say appropriately on the cylinder [Music] plus I place the pecs in both ends to touch up the cylinder on the inside and smooth the outside [Music] I realized the tube was too small to accompany the water level so I built it up an extra inch and made necessary trims to create the fitting I used a glass 18 millimeter fitting that I picked up from a local glassblowing shop you can also use any fitting size even if it's from a bowl loop the fitting and insert it into the clay while the fitting is in the tube slip and score the tube to the cylinder [Music] I had a piece of coil to support the tube and place the sponge underneath before I removed the fitting [Music] to make the bowl start by coiling a bowl to any size you want I use the 18 millimeter joint and my finger to help shape my bowl [Music] for the male fitting I start by coiling around my pecs [Music] I drilled my hole here but I do not recommend it right now so hold off [Music] at this point you'll slip and score the fitting to the bowl [Music] the pecs was too big so I used the bottom side of the down stem and thinned out my clay fitting until it would fit into my 18 millimeter lubed female fitting you may need to widen the top of your fitting to have an accurate 18 millimeter fitting to remove the fitting from the glass below on the backside of the tube and gently pull the bowl until it releases then this is where I recommend drilling your hole for your bowl with a 3/16 inch drill bit and clean up the hole after drilling I was unable to record this part but before you bisque fire once the piece is completely dry you want to see if the bowl will fit into the clay all the way if it does not fit gently and carefully spin the bowl into the 18 millimeter clay tube and it'll start sanding itself down do this until the bowl fits all the way you can use sandpaper too but I found that to be the best way to have an airtight fitting after you Biss fire begin glazing with the glaze that corresponds to your clay since I'm using high fire stoneware I will use high fire glaze to go with it I apply three layers to the outside and to the bowl make sure the bowl has no glaze near the fitting or it will not fit right same with the bottom of the base leave about a quarter inch free from glaze to prevent the glaze from running and sticking the piece to the kiln shelf before glazing the inside pour some water down your 18 millimeter tube so the perc won't absorb as much glaze next mix your glaze with some water so it won't clog your perk holes plug the fitting and with your thumb and pour the glaze in dump out immediately and blow through the fitting tube to make sure no glaze will clog the perk holes with a sponge remove all the glaze from your female fittings so your Bowl will fit correctly after firing do any necessary touch-ups at the end load the water pipe onto a kiln shelf that has kiln wash to prevent the glaze from sticking to the shelf place the bowl near the level of the down stem so they shrink at similar rates that's how you make a ceramic water pipe if you have suggestions for my next video leave your idea in the comment section see you next time [Music]", "qoID9DfH3f8": "guys thanks for joining me

more about each aspects of one doing really and as you all know if you've been following the channel for a while I gave up tobacco not September and since then this has been my best friend so going with me today this is the qiong's we don't make a bomb the bombs that I had back in the day rose I have some old crappy acrylic ones I have a really nice bong that was a glass double percolator condoms brand but it was really really nice and then I accidentally broke that that actually was about four or five years ago so there was a good gap between that time before I went out and invested again in another glass bomb fast forward to about a year ago and I was out in Greenwich in London and I popped into Shiva head shop and I asked them for some recommendations and they recommended the Widowmaker so the reason that I was initially recommended it was because of the thicker base which meant there was less likely to break however I liked it for a number of reasons the first reason that I like it is the cool black accent at the top I think that that matches the bone that it came with and also my Darth Vader bulb which I've switched out for also the ice catching functionality of this bong is brilliant so it's got some little knobbly bits on the inside there which got ice so it can sit there and that enables you to get a really cool hit when you're smoking through this bomb another thing which I love about the Chong's Widowmaker is the actual shape of the bong itself the actual chamber is like almost like a test tube it looks like a giant test tube but it's not the only test tube shape on that chance do I've seen a very similar one as you can see the glass off goes outwards into a nice white base obviously then you've got the ice there's no middle percolator in this bomb like in some of the dapper angst I've got so if you look at my fabric you can see that that's got double percolation and this bomb doesn't actually have any percolation but that being said it doesn't tend to make difference when I'm smoking through this I think that this size is perfect as well this is what I would call a medium-sized bowl never seen bombs they're a lot bigger than this I've seen bombs that are a lot smaller than this and she's got a little bomb there with an ash catcher this bong is bigger and results in a much smoother hit as well that is why I love my chums bong and white is quite fond of choice and hopefully that will give you a bit of an insight into some life thoughts and reasons behind purchasing this book so this isn't a paid product endorsement in any way shape or form I think that it would be rude not to hit the bottom now that we're talking about it [Music] lovely Holy Grail smell soap guys is now about that time and I'm gonna show you the functionality off the chomp widow makeup I'll see you on the other side Cheers [Music] [Music] such a fresh hit such a smooth and enjoyable it through the chums Widow makeup and that is one of the reasons that I love this bomb I would highly recommend getting a bomb like this guys if you are not a bomb smoker and you joined sori Bert's flips just try it out I mean I didn't initially think it was my favorite way to smoke but once I got over my tobacco addiction this became my best friend and that's not an exaggeration I [ __ ] love this from you will see I've cleaned this this morning and there is already a lot of discoloration happening from the head start taking an enjoyable bonk I so hope you liked that video have you other insight into why I like my chance Widowmaker so much let me know what you think guys what is your bottom choice have you got something different what features is your bond got I want to know leave me a comment and I will be back soon with another video [Music]", "-QRTMHYLZEY": "all right hello I'm salt and I am privileged and honored to get to participate in this livestream thing that the Corning Museum of Glass is doing so I'm going to demonstrate some pipe technique really excited to get to share some of the pipe culture with the overall glass community so you know pull up a chair get some popcorn and I'll try to explain a little bit about what I'm doing so today I used some Paramore peach and I did an application over clear as my base and I'm also going to incorporate some alchemy potion nice new CFL activated color and I'm also going to incorporate some the original gun mounts made here at Corning many many years ago for television sets so and the spirit of kind of marrying the past and the future together I'm gonna use these all these different colors on one piece and I don't know hope you guys enjoy so all right so traditionally to make a pipe bubble in other words to get the smoke from an elevated position down into the bottom of the water chamber scientific technique was adapted in order to do something called a down stem there's other things like butt seals and ring seals also adapted from scientific glassblowing in order to create the functionality at least traditionally and so what I'm demonstrating right now is called Rip Curl and it's a version of what I as a salt perk which stands for sculpturally applied linear tube or tunnel and so this is my adaptation of an organic and sculptural approach to making something function and I feel like it's probably the one of the most innovative things that I have to offer and that's why I chose to show this for the live stream so I'm carving in some negative space here into the wall of my water chamber okay now I'm satisfied with the depth and the definition I'm gonna use the tungsten pick to get some holes in it I banged it on the table just in case there's any little flecks of glass in there I don't want them sticking arbitrarily to the inside of my bong that I'm making here all right now I'm gonna make the rest of the downstem by covering up part of this channel with some of this potion minor adjustments here houses nice classes quiet right now nobody's saying anything all right I got it all melted smooth can I show you guys a little closer what's going on here okay so the smoke will enter up here travel down this tube and tap into the bottom of my vessel here apparently you might notice I just popped a big hole on the side of this thing and I'm gonna try to do something interesting with it and all right so now I have a window of potion that lets you view into the bubble chamber of this bong I'm making in the pipe culture the ability to see what's going on inside is highly valued so that's why I've innovated this technique we actually hand me that rod of the peach stick it out of the kiln it's on the right there thank you so with this paramore peach color I find that it along with a lot of the paramour colors they work better for me if I mix them up a little bit so I'm just going to prepare a little section of that mixed up color that I'll use to do some eyelids and other details on the piece that's what I'm doing right now Phyllis [Applause] alright so I just added what's called a bridge for this piece of clear excuse me this piece of clear glass adds structure to what I'm working on but will not be part of the finished piece it's just there so that I can be more aggressive and get the glass hotter without it losing its shape yeah there was a bubble and I popped it and now I'm melting it out okay now I got a lid on my bottom window there I call that a soul window because it's you know the eyes being the window to the soul and this allows you to see inside to the functional part of my Rip Curl and on this side I got one of my traditional salt eyes also lid it up yeah where's my new tool at there it is yeah shout out to Scott Griffin my TA and maker of Griffin tools for hooking up this special tool real time for me yeah yeah we like we talked about it yesterday and he already had it made but this morning so you're gonna plug your website real quick yeah yeah we'll talk about my fee later on all right cool all right watch out behind me it's all in the wrist y'all behind me is the little wick tool the is it out back there no right here I planar with the paper towel on it here's the trick for the internet pipe cleaner with the paper towel to get the condensation out of my tube Thanks hmm like that the spot I really don't like right here so I'm just gonna take it out go are we doing on time it's noon right now I keep going the camera guy says I can keep going so I'm gonna keep going for you guys looks like I got it too hot it's kind of bent over so I'm going to cut my bridge or I'm gonna attempt anyway to cut my bridge and straighten it I'm working very very aggressively right now in order to try to finish this thing in time for you guys so sometimes that causes unforeseen issues like this one this is closed set I'm scared shoutout to Krista the tech who's been helping me the whole time I was here all right can you want y'all lop the end of that off so it's open for me no it's okay it's fine as is thank you so I choose this imagery of eyes and teeth sometimes claws and armor for my pieces because the salt pipe grew up in an environment where pipes were not sometimes not seen as art because they were functional or just because of the stigma attached to the pipe and also not seen as legal at times and so I make a pipe that's both camouflaged in order to protect itself protect its end-user and I use this imagery of the defense mechanisms featured and animals and insects in order to kind of give my pieces the tools they need to defend themselves in these harsher environments and at the same time the salt pipe is meant to be treated like a living thing you know if you take care of it it'll take care of you and so I like to think about the symbiotic relationship between the owner and the piece and how these people the vast network of people that everyday use their salt piece and have a positive experience maybe have like a perspective change and those ideas are really exciting and satisfying to me and so this is why I do the things that I do will you run the condensation tool through that please thank you it's alright if it's not gonna work I'll just take it okay so this is how it goes sometimes because of how quickly and aggressively I've been working in order to try to finish there were times whenever I would have normally reheated this thing in the kiln and as a result I've got a crack but I'm gonna take this opportunity to show you guys how I would fix this so first I'm stabilizing the crack with an annealing flame so it doesn't spread and I'm getting everything that I can see on the surface fully molten and then I'm gonna look through this clear bottom to see on the inside if there's any more crack but actually I do see a little bit and so the fastest way to fix that is like this that's not the fire alarm is it I hate to have to finish this thing with the building burning down around me okay again I'm stabilizing and I'm gonna go inside and hit the back side of the crack which usually will make it just immediately disappear and it did I got lucky because it wasn't a bad one it was literally just as a result of kind of pushing things a little too far in order to try to finish and now I'm kind of using my mini torch like a flashlight because it will it will light anything up that's damaged and let me know students do you guys remember when I was talking about these pressed glass colors wanting to separate and crack on the surface that's what I was talking about it it makes like it's it's a crack that if you don't deal with it it can be really bad but if you if you get on it immediately they like kind of go away on their own yeah on this one I had two different spots on one the clear was cracked and that's why I went inside and what happened was I was just too aggressive with some of this texturing and on the other part over here I had a light surface crack go through some of this texture that was on the outside but it didn't go through to the clear and so now you can see I'm just kind of paddling back and forth over it and kind of burnishing it back into place and then I'm gonna redo my car blinds alright I'm just gonna close this up and let it sit for a second I probably do it's pretty bad so some of that texture that I put on there that caused the problem is actually one of the things that I always incorporated in my pieces because pipe art is experienced in a different way than most traditional forms of art in that you're supposed to touch it and not just touch it but you you share it you hand it to other people and you have these social experiences with it so knowing that I try to take advantage of those opportunities and add textures for the end user to interact with while they're smoking out of their salt pipe and some of those textures are meant to bring you into the moment you know some sharper points you know that are there to remind you that you're holding a piece of glass and just also to be present and enjoy like what's happening right now whereas other textures are meant to be more relaxing like a worry stone or you know one of those little squeeze balls and while others are meant to be kind of meditative so if you're thinking some deep thoughts about something you can kind of pet your salt pipe and it will relax you and help you think in theory [Music] you [Music]",

show you how i clean my glass i know to some of y'all this may not be super dirty but to me it's a pretty dirty piece um i've just been using the nug plug through it this little slide right here has a little insert you put inside it goes through the little divots you can kind of see one right there take a head out of here and then we'll start cleaning this and i'll show y'all what solution i use [Music] all right let's get this thing cleaned so that was the dog plug i'll do video on those in the future but yeah this is it right here focus it for y'all uh kinda yeah this is it see right there and kind of see a little wine yeah they're pretty good slides i like them a lot got a lot of flavor saves your bud pretty smooth i barely cough alrighty let's get this going so uh what i use to clean my glass is this right here except degreaser i get it from the home depot for a big gap for a big jug like that it's a i think like ten dollars and the way you can use it you can use it like this i'm doing for this piece the mobius eon we haven't seen the video this piece i have one up from a few months back but you can just let it soak if you want to or you can try to shake it up we're gonna get a hot water insert here and then uh yeah we'll uh put this up in here so i just try to just i don't really rinse the [ __ ] out of it i just dab put that underneath and toss it real quick or maybe [ __ ] 10 seconds and then like because you i can kind of tell when it's gonna get a lot of resin and the first few seconds of uh the water running through the piece or running through the down stem then i'm going to grab our zip lit off all set here do a pour the way i do it i have these little uh if i'm not going to soak this piece so for this one right now i'm not soaking the peas obviously i'm showing you how i clean my glass so a lot of people if you want you can put salt in here shake it um i personally don't do that normally i just shake it with just the zepp inside here first see all the damage it does and i go from there i'll do one shake like this and then i'll take the downstream out and there you go i already got a lot of the grime out of the downstream pretty quick you can see you got quite a bit out of [Music] there this right here the outside of it still pretty caked what i do with this the outside i get a paper towel right there take this part [Music] i'll crush it like this take the zip now this little dab on the paper towel there and so for this part up here i can get in here there we go one little line and then on the outside let's see get this real quick so let's see try to get a focus there it is see if it gets off [Music] so we got the outside now we're going to go on the inside just got water running waste of water like an idiot twist this get it real thin i just have one paper towel that's it right now that i'm using when i say one i mean like one little uh square of it i'm not saying i have one paper towel for the whole thing then i get this as far as in here as i can go it's getting some of it any better if i put on the other side yep [Music] so i just ink this in here [Music] this here spin it around oh there's some stubborn resin on here after that another hot water in and we're right here so once i'm at this portion i put it back in the bong like this and i have these things called scrubber duckies they're right there it's a magnet it comes with another little magnet that's like a scrubber so you drop this into here just like that take this part and just do your thing so let's see they'll show it here some right there if you guys can see any of the resin i get so then i just scrub the piece a lot of downstem soaks there's a little bit of grime up here get it yeah these little scarborough ducky magnet things are lifesavers they're really good for honestly single chambered pieces like this you got a beaker i even use it on uh like my uh 50 by five three lines off and when you get them they come with some smaller ones and it's not a company i'm like sponsored by or anything i haven't sponsored [ __ ] uh so it's just something that i got that was a good idea i got them years back you got three years ago now after that we're putting the downtown after a small soaking there i couldn't see if i can get the little bit of grime in here this is what happens after having this thing for days just chilling but yeah i've been using the nug plug that went through that and barely had anything in it so it's a pretty good slide it keeps their pieces pretty clean almost got it all i'm kind of neurotic there's a little bit inside here though [Music] i'll throw it the other way make some [Music] more oh let's get that too right up here get the joint real quick tiny little clear resin looks like resin or reclaimed i'll somehow that part of my finger all right oh good wow now we're doing this guy i can't reach that all right we're gonna plug green oh it's still in there it's still attached to it i'm sure get the rest of it right here where's on the outside of the pizza accent from my fingertips all right take this thing out dump it out give it a rinse so these can get kind of sudsy that's how it's gonna look i got dirty right when i'm dumping out to that [Music] another rinse out and one more i'll take my towel [Music] i just have this towel designated for drying off pieces cleaning glass [Music] and bam look at that much cleaner looks great looks fun to smoke out of [Music] and yeah we just cleaned that thing pretty quickly too if i don't mind saying so try the joint and let's take a hit of something real quick because i've only taken one hit this video just pulled out this little three line i normally use water from a jug but since i'm just right here at my cleaning area we're just going to use a sink right now dry drives a bit of water in here yeah i hope that video helped out y'all cleaning your pieces um that's how i do it every time that's the dirtiest a piece has been here for a while i'm pretty neurotic about cleaning my pieces i don't want to do it every hit so like i'm going to take this snap right now and i'm going to clean it directly after it i just got over cleaning a bunch of like deep cleaning a lot of pieces was getting really old so i'm instantaneously over it let's have some a little bit of shake in a jar right now because uh my lady put it in here she wanted to smoke something else so i think this is like cookies or something like that alrighty thank y'all for watching bye", "avc0iBVlmL4": "what up everybody today's a great day because I get to do an unboxing on this awesome glassblowing starter kit that we teamed up with ABR imagery to bring you tons of you have asked how to get into glassblowing and what you need well this kit is gonna make it super easy for you maybe you're in an area where you can't take a workshop where there are no other glass studios and you're a boss and you want to get this glassblowing starter kit to set up your own shop well here it is today I'm gonna personally walk you through everything that you would get in this kit and we haven't even unpacked it yet because I want to walk you through what it would be like for you to receive this and open it yourself alright let's open it up is this big ol top layer of foam and you know they packed it well alright here we go I see the goodies you know nothing's gonna break when you get this box all right let's start with box first we got our fuel propane regulator let's go ahead and open it up so I can show you what it is you're gonna need this to put on to your propane tank and again this is all high-quality stuff here we got that fuel gauge gas gauge right here what do we got here we got our 6x6 graphite plate you've seen me do all the flattening on this and it's just a solid piece of graphite that is polished down so your glass won't stick to it alright we got another box here this is our oxygen regulator and this is a must-have this is going to be hooked up to your oxygen tank so that way you got your fuel and your oxygen it's go ahead and open it up for you there we go just like that all right we got our safety Phillips safety glasses here let's go and open these up for you these are a must-have these are your died idiom lenses they got the safety frames on the side as well so high quality super thick exactly what I use comes with your lanyard to put around your head as well alright nice look at this here we got our high heat pad so that way you can dust off your glass any of the glass dust from from the graphite or kiln or just working dust you go ahead and you know just dust it off so we got our pad here oh look at this we got some raw materials we have a assorted color rods that come in this so we're gonna actually make something in the next video where I show you how to use some of this let's go ahead and open it up and see what color they gave us it's a whole it's an assorted pack that I wanted them to put in so that way you have some stuff to work with this is dough look at that oh there's some lemon drop in there there's some great white some blue star dust this is a really killer pack right here alright we have our kevlar sleeves here so this is to put around your arms when you're getting started out just any hot glass that hits your arms it'll protect them so let's go ahead and open this up so here's the sleeve we're opening this up so these will go on your arms just like this to protect any hot glass from hitting you or the heat from the flame so that way it doesn't you know any residual heat doesn't burn you we got some tools this is a three piece tweezer set for your glass for your hot glass tip that you get to work let's go ahead and open it up extra large one to be able to tweeze off and work some your glass you have a medium-sized one as well right here and then you have a small one for any of the delicate or intricate stuff nice we got some graphite some solid graphite rod this is exactly what I use so you all you have to do is let's open this up and this stuff is packed really really good they know what they're doing over there at ABR okay so you got small or you got medium small and large graphite rod you can actually just polish this down and make your own tools with it if you want to make larger Reimers you have this one or even a bowl a smaller bowl push you could use this to just shape the end this one you could use for a reamer and flare glass open and this one's great for the same thing alright so awesome we have our claw grabbers you guys have seen me use these a bunch these are super important this is so you can hold your hot glass or even hold the base of something or a mouthpiece so that way you can get a lot closer the flame and you're not gonna get burned or not you know have any issue but it's just a claw grabber so it opens up and then you can turn it and grab things and be able to spin it nice we got another we got a nice reamer here you've seen me use this a bunch to be able to open and flare feet or your to shape your glass open up a tube okay we got some glass cutting glass cutters so if you want to break down rod really easy this will just snap it super fast so these are great these are just glass cutters all you have to do is put some rod or small tubing in there you just pinch it and just kind of pop it and that will snap your glass but again you know safety glasses on while you do that in case any chips come up but that's a really fast way to break down some tubing or you know I've showed you how to use the flame break down or different things like that but this is an even faster way all right so we got some flashback arrestors these are a safety thing that you hook up in between your regulator and your hoses so that way if any flame travels down your torch it is not gonna blow you up basically so this is a great safety precaution to have we have them on our set up let's go ahead and open them up so it prevents any spark or flash back into your propane or oxygen tanks so you'll see I'll hook these up in the next video so that one's for fuel it's red and then your oxygen one is gonna be blue you got your oxygen one there nice definitely need some hosing to be able to hook up to your torch and your tanks so we got that here this is a 12 feet of hosing just enough to be able to give you the distance that you need so you have your propane there excuse me you have your oxygen hose and then you also have your propane hose on the back and it's 12 feet each look at this we got our nice tungsten pick with a handle this is really great you you get to work your glass or kind of shape it with this and it won't burn or get any residue into your glass and it takes heat really well you've seen me use tungsten picks all the time look at this we got our Bowl push so when you want to make some bubblers and some flower pieces you want to push a bowl or even just to ream open some glass

chill smoke session I won't know you guys have been wanting these style videos so what I'm gonna do just gonna take a few fat bong rips I'll show you guys some close-ups of what I'm gonna be smoking on and then at the end of the video I'm gonna take the are one of the attachments from the u-joint by B nail I'm gonna throw it on my Baker bond I'm taking and I'm going to take a super fat Baker bunk dad so one thing I did want to show you guys I'm upping the quality on the channel got some lights I have three of these lights I have a desk one right over here already broke one of the bulbs [ __ ] around so that's awesome but this used to be what my lighting was so yeah that will lighting I mean it works but you know not as good as it could have I guess I got some soundproofing as well and now this is what our lighting now looks like you guys see really really really good lighting you guys could see my eyes and those like but for real just really really good lighting so I'm excited to bring this new quality to you guys let me know what you guys think of the quality and yeah let's just go and get into these hits alright y'all already know it's first things first I went ahead and clean up the bong that is probably as good as I could have I just kind of wanted to hurry up and you know get it clean so that way I can go ahead and start filming I am right above my kitchen so that way if you guys are I am right below my kitchen so that way if you guys do hear any sort of bumps or noises or anything like that it is probably right above me but anyway let's go and start packing up this flower like I said what I was gonna do is um just pack up a few bowls take a few hits of some first I'm packing up the banana push this banana crush looks amazing up about the close-ups here somewhere on the screen so that way you guys can see what I'm smoking on up close trichomes we're on point to run point when I'm breaking it up it's real like dense and sticky you know it's moist on the inside so that you know the humidity is on point and it's just some pretty good flowers so I'm gonna go ahead and just take a fat ball wrapper to just get nice and baked for you guys let me go and take this ball rank Cheers hopefully you guys are smoking along with me whether it's Kronecker concentrates how about as well stuff the rest of this in here make it like I said it's gonna be a fat session for you guys like I said if you guys hear any [ __ ] thing I have people right [ __ ] above me I told them if they can be [ __ ] quiet cuz I'm shooting but you know they're not [ __ ] listen anyways Cheers I'm going to turn up the music so you guys have to hear [Music] I really do like this lighting it just a lighting is everything to be honest when it comes to certain videos and stuff like that I guess and it's not even as good as it could be right now because you know I could have two lights up and everything like that all right yeah put my Bujji band on here I always forget just go ahead and wrap that on here so as you guys who don't know what Bujji band is must look to Luigi band they actually hooked me up with two of these things just like a little velcro strap you put around your bong has a magnet can hold your lighter on there and what I honestly I didn't think it would be strong enough to hold up the lighter well I had the Tokra filter on there but it is so that's like at 6 but hey I need that light so why do we got to go ahead and do is pack up a fat bowl or some Holy Grail we'll take that rip and then I'll go ahead and show you guys if you guys haven't checked out my review with the dhobi plus on the go bu joint from B nails what I'm going to do is take one of the attachments out of here stick it in here and it's going to allow me to take the quartz castle that I need to grab here in a second and what I what to do is just go ahead and throw the course castle on here and take a super fat dab let me try to grab like a decent amount of it let's go ahead and get this [ __ ] bowl of holy reloaded a pile of this holy grail I think it's to me it's a bit better than the banana cush more or less because when you break it up engine it's just that classic just funky weed smell you know what I mean like it has like that classic just really really I don't know like when you described weed smells or some tangi ones there's cookies that are kind of sweet whenever you think of like that classic weed smell you think more or less oh jeez or like Diesel's you know what I mean cause like whatever I like I get Death Star it's a since he started Sour Diesel mix and the sour D so it comes to really strong so it's just super pungent and I love that just classic weed big smell I like the taste of wee I think that I think that's just a really good like that's one reason why I don't like why both live resins or kind of like really lemony you know like really [ __ ] citrusy and [ __ ] like that I like really gassy strains what's going to take this next rip Death Star and like I said we want to go ahead and get into the [ __ ] dab right after this but we know you guys like the lighting if you guys I don't know if I already said but I'm looking at my mirror because there's a you know so I could see the screen because sometimes it'll stop recording there's been temperature I filmed like seven minutes worth of a video and I went to end the video and it wasn't even recording in my dumb ass and you could notice both really like in my new setup I think I'm gonna get some more soundproofing maybe expand it a bit farther out do some more [ __ ] with my room but just a more or less my studio Ramon even sleeping this one I have another better but cheers let's beloit and let's go ahead and blow into the fat cloud in the sense preservation of my homeboys we know what what were club is always ready but whatever standing free we never beat this cancer took up on everything that said it's me oh yeah guys imma go ahead and posit for one second because there's no was going on above me and I don't want it to [ __ ] up the video anyways like I was going to get it to the dad portion let's go ahead and open up this go bu joint this isn't like you know the review video or anything I'm just using and showing you guys that it's useful for Shay like this but 14 millimeter - wait yeah there's that 18 yeah that's 18 millimeter - fourteen millimeter I'm trippin so got that allows me to put 14 millimeter so I'm gonna put the quartz castle on there and then what's nice about that is not only does that allow me to hit the dab off of there but it allowed it but it also allows me to clear it like a bomb so if I'm hitting it I can pull it so we're gonna have to see the quartz castle is kind of clogged now that I'm with that it's kind of hard to pull it you soon I'll [ __ ] unclog it give me a second when inna got the [ __ ] dab on the dabber what's up to dab the lad and me and a few of the homies up with the dope series 3 sword divers these things are [ __ ] dope if you guys are heavy divers you guys would like really think do the [ __ ] Club me at least I do these are [ __ ] and some of the dopest divers in the game of my opinion but like I said I got the go bu joint attachment on here like I said I went ahead in the clog bit so that way I can actually [ __ ] take a whip out of it so so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna try to get all the breath out of my lungs all the air out of my lungs and then just go in on this super fat dad that's what I wanted to hinder of this video to be I'm actually gonna grab a bit more because like I said I want it to be fat so they go chunk at the end with a nice little slug snake it's not necessarily a snake cause it's not that long but oh yeah and I got some stuck on my finger I hate that but let's go ahead and get this [ __ ] going take a super fat hit along with me the goal with this one I just want to blow like I said I didn't want this to be a unedited video but it's like every time I'm trying to record is when there's [ __ ] going on and I you know it's like I don't want you guys to be hearing a whole bunch of random noise you know it's like I want to you know no bucking that's like one of like when people are recording that's like one of the thing you hate the most is when there's other noise going on while you're trying to record it's [ __ ] annoying but cheers everybody we can just move it along with me with the Taconic er concentrates taking a super phat rid of some monster cookie or Cookie Monster those of you guys who didn't know it Cheers approaching [Music] [Music] tell you what just for you guys we'll go ahead and write down one more another one I know for a fact my lugs on out the lessons I have learned I use them often when I'm dreaming Bank will never shake its cars - just wanted to blow like one more fat cloud for you guys give me a second I need to take a few deep breaths that she hasn't me [ __ ] wrapped up guys that's one thing I thought I'd take like super fat dabs it's hard for me to talk guys whenever I take like Bhangra you guys can see me recover pretty quickly but dabs are like really [ __ ] major to me there you guys have it too fat bong rips two fat dabs just wanted to make it a bit nice and you know since I wasn't able to make it a bit less edited I figured I would just go ahead and take another fat that for you guys but yeah let me know if you guys want to see more videos like this just more fat smoke sessions I might open that have a great [ __ ] dad to everybody subscribe for more peace out", "9BlKPO7234g": "welcome to tow for 20 candidates 18 up

today today is more of an unboxing episode we'll put a little we'll put the clip it's of our session when we finally do it in a later video but it will be this is a very important piece to us that we've been looking forward to I mentioned it in both my previous videos that we've been looking forward to it actually if I when I look on my Amazon account it actually says it hasn't even been delivered yet so I don't even know if this even is the package but it looks like it but save that package unboxing time we got a package got package I can't wait here we are package is in front of us I'm gonna get our knife unbox this thing it's plastic so we don't really need to do this do we [Music] [ __ ] maybe we do first time first unboxing [Music] [Music] I mean when I'm about to of it sit on back up just a little bit go back to move it back to rest oh very excited about this all right we have to I'll let you have this one okay [Music] [Music] [Applause] okay so it looks like in here we have oh [Music] this is the first time I ever held one of these watch them a lot of other channels such as like crutch 420 positive smash 420 I've watched shoutouts to those guys go watch their Channel go subscribe to them they're awesome channels they're what inspired us to make this channel so we got this at this piece here gonna put this right right here did you see it and then we looks like we got another percolating part here I could feel how fragile is in my hand and it kinda it kind of intimidates me this is how this goes like that by the way this music that you hear in the back of talk for 20 videos is by an artist called fkj PressTV Jews we discovered him when we were we used to get just a hide that's all we would do listen to music eventually talk for 20 we'll have a movie of all of our old videos that we use tonight when we edit it and take all the crazy [ __ ] out of it hey yeah so here we go now we're gonna open up let's move let's move this over here and now for the big reveal [Music] [Applause] see now the first thing I notice is that it advertised it with a with a bowl but I don't see the bowl with it which is not a problem because I can easily get another bowl but it's also missing a few pieces like it's missing its dropping it was hidden I get this look at the size of this [ __ ] is so swinging look at the sizes look at the size of this [ __ ] I swear to god it's it's smaller it's quote-unquote smaller than I thought it would be but it's also larger than I thought it would be so here we got the drop in dropping up that in there like this like that I'm sorry I'm still new to all of this still and this is the pieces yeah she's learning I've done a lot of studying on these pieces so I know exactly how it's supposed to go you got the ball here this is a nice a nice nice Bowl right here I got a so now what I'm not well I'm just curious about is I'm not supposed to water in here I noticed was the water in here so let's uh let's set this [ __ ] up and let's see how right um at the end of this video I'm going to hit it up with some close-ups of this thing this is a very very beautiful beautiful piece I'm I am NOT disappointed everything that said it was coming I was coming in it came with it I have to get a carb cap but I will be getting a carb cap soon but let's just see the function on this the function I'll get some close above the function too but so it's got a it's got a double perc you later it's gonna perk you later here and perk you later there got an ice cube hold it here for very very cool hits I've never I've never tried it with an ice cube and I'm excited to try it this is where you grip it it's kind of got a kind of chamber here that it bubbles here so it's it's like your triple chamber it has triple that's percolate here here kidding here let's see how this works see how this works okay okay [Music] [Applause] see how that looks with the nail yeah you want to try it yeah so I mean I mean uh that that's that's our bong that's our 13-inch first first bong and like I said like I said in the previous videos it will always be a staple in here scoot over a little bit they'll always be a staple in our in our videos they'll always be sitting right here well I'm gonna try to remember it always sit right here it's not gonna be here all the time but one day we will be here we will be getting off of that we had plans for this we're not sure if we're gonna stick to it but because I might we're very curious about how it's gonna feel so it might we might do it sooner than later [Music] but yeah that is that is the 13 inch Amazon triple percolating bong that we got off a mother and it's beautiful it's beautiful and it's it opens up a door for us personally yeah you know door do this well yeah but it also opens up another version another way to smoke it and also opens up another beginning to another collection I have pipes I have I have big pipes that little pipes have one head I have a little the mini pipe from the other video I have a tomahawk I have a lot of different interesting pipes but I've never had a bong and I've never hit from a bong before so I'm very interested to see how this reacts so when you see it will most likely be my first reaction to hitting weed out of evolve I paid it out of my perk you later back here this is the closest thing we have to this this device that we've that we've already had this actually has a function that I have yet to see if this one has yet I don't think it does this has a choke has a control but I think bongs that choke control is when you like that and that clears it but this this little device here this is a percolating rig there's a percolating hybrid brick just like this one is this is a hybrid this well bongs are hybrids period but this is a hybrid rig built to do this so this one had come to the bong came with a nail for wax or shatter and it also came with a bowl for dry herb this one it came with a glass now I chose to do titanium because at the time I heard the titanium was better to dab off of but I've heard reason I've heard since then that glass is easier to clean so I'm at the moment I'm looking for my my glass now but this this nail here this is my only titanium nail and I just recently figured out that I can switch it it's it's not permanently like this like this I can I can do this also probably put it in here so I could even dab out of there with this with this titanium now I can dab out of my bong with the titanium nail and on that note I'm gonna wrap up this video I brought out I brought out the blue pen brought the blue pen we have some CBD in this cartridge here and when I smoke off of it while we go but on that note Oh smooth CBD but on that note stay happy stay peaceful peace [Applause] hey Google next song that's going into bloopers", "4ZJYJbzF9OQ": "hey yeah this is dawn down a bit thought I would give you a show on a piece we got today this is the clover sprinkler sprinkler slash jellyfish

"ug-Q-D-cKtc": "[Music] what's good youtube it's your boy king knobs and today i'm gonna be reviewing this little uh this little beaker bong [ __ ] i caught the other day [ __ ] was like seven bucks

right so i didn't have a lighter so i just went to the store called brand new lighter so yeah let's get this started oh it's already packed um water let's fill this [ __ ] up alright so i cleaned up the water that fell and uh [ __ ] finally cheers all right that [ __ ] it's different as [ __ ] yeah i thought this [ __ ] would be like i don't know what the [ __ ] i thought but it's not what i thought this [ __ ] hits hard as [ __ ] like uh yeah but um [Music] [ __ ] yeah if you see a little baby bomb i definitely suggest you will cop it this is like half a water bottle like easy as [ __ ] to hide um yeah easiest [ __ ] to hide like hella like hell easy to hide like i hide the [ __ ] behind the soda can like just straight up behind the soda can like you first glance you wouldn't like notice it so if you're like me like you're allowed to smoke in your crib but you don't want your [ __ ] to get taken by like a sibling or like even like my mom would be taking my like the bongs and [

comments uh thanks for watching peace", "M62HqDee3IY": "[Music] yo what is up guys a plant ogre back here again and welcome to another episode of cheap-ass class in today's episode man I got a double perk you later straight to the Leben inch bong off of wish this is probably going to be the last thing I'm going to get off wish for a while I'm going try some other websites for the future episode 3 on because I just don't want to be competitive and having to order from which time and time again you know what I mean but if you are new to this series man g-packs boss it is kind of a challenge for me to be honest and I'm here to show you guys some dope-ass pieces for some lowest prices and you don't have to spend like a one to two hundred dollars on like a big-ass wrong I mean just go on the [ __ ] Chinese websites save yourself some money if you don't have the money if you have the money man go get yourself a head piece make yourself happy I love heavy but I don't have the money so I'm sticking with China class for now so the whole point of the series is to find pieces for under $50 and that includes shipping so I got this piece for 16 bucks and shipping was 19 wait now shipping was nine dollars so altogether it was 25 bucks and I originally ordered this on July and I had to cancel it because it didn't show up for like a like five six week so I cancelled it they refunded me the money and wish credit and then they had it for way cheaper originally it was 30 so I saved myself five bucks for the second time around kay make here in two weeks really [ __ ] good so let's take take a riff sorry if you're talking so much me on but let's take a rip let me know if your session long down in the comment section below let's get Lydia like a titty Cheers a couple so I'm going to start off with the pros with this one pro you it's a [ __ ] trippy aspies it's really cool it's really different when I first got it I was having a little bit of trouble figuring out the water levels and I'm still AM but overall I think I got the block water levels pretty good and it's kind of cool because was it having a double percolator this piece doesn't have water there's a little sectioning so it cools down the smoke so you're not inhaling [ __ ] hot smoke and it's a waste with their like experience and I think you can put like a ice cube in it might have a nice country I'm not sure if you guys didn't know I am visually apparent so that's one pro it pulls down the smoke another thing that I like about it dude really thick for torrid being 25 bucks sleep this is some thick guys boss like I already dropped it two times and it didn't break on me like I was so [ __ ] the weed like really thick ass boss the packaging was really nice nothing was damaged I was just in the foam box like really secured really like nothing damaged do they have bubble wrap over it really nice another thing that I like about it it's portable and you can just hold it with one hand dude and it's 11 inches but I guess that's like all home for the pros for you so let's take another rib and then I'll get on to the cons so Cheers [Music] we've got a little water on my lips dude so what the carnies ma'am first off it's kind of a [ __ ] to [ __ ] get the water levels right that is one thing that kind of annoys me is there's either you get little too much or a little like a little less than what you need it's nothing in between like [ __ ] vision and beards I have a hard time [ __ ] like seem like what levels are [ __ ] right for you're like both for the percolators but I think that's one downfall because it may experience with having the bong water splash on your lips is not never a good time you know what I mean but it just smooth that's hit that oh that's another probe that I forgot it's smooth as hell so another con I would say oh you can't not a good dog break not a good dad League I just tried I took a couple of dabs out of it this morning because I was going throw throw some bad flips into the intro not a good dad rig because it's not a universal old piece it's a floured piece only like yeah like you don't build up to any smoke or anything like it doesn't know good like how it does with flowers and I like I take like a couple like it wasn't really even melting up so I think that's like one downfall if you're trying to use this piece for like Instagram where the type of [ __ ] you know what I mean but I overall man that's it for the cons for 25 bucks not this is like literally got [ __ ] steal for 25 bucks I like it for flower use this is probably going to be my daily driver till I turn 21 when I can start going into head shops and say I blame cause for myself I turned 21 pretty [ __ ] soon in the next couple of weeks I can't wait man but sorry [Music] getting sidetracked BAM I'm really [ __ ] stunned to be honest guys I'm going to give this a five out of five this is really worth it big guys glass dropped it two times they even break like I'm really [ __ ] happy really trippy eyes peas was it having to perk you ladies I know the top one is a honeycomb I'm not sure about the bottom one I mean if you guys know let me know down in the comment section below let's take another talk out of this thing man and then I was about so Cheers let's get Lydia like a titty one last time [Music] [Music] oh damn so that's it for the video guys if you are new make sure to subscribe and until next time guys see you looking like a titty piece", "8ZiqyohHyZs": "for me with their hand I was like holy [ __ ] how do I do that like that's cool what's up everybody welcome to another episode my name is Taylor some people don't know that because my initial I don't know I'm 26 BlueGlass mountain bike snowboard pretty average guy the glass consumes my life it has the past seven years got into it at Mesa Art Center about six years ago and then started working at chameleon for about a year there I really learned the fundamentals of glassblowing I prepped for them for six months and then after that they let me make pipes I did made pipes for about four or five months for them it was brutal 40 hours a week we just bust out hand pipes but uh I've made a lot I've made a lot a lot a lot of hand pipes so from that I I've got enough money to buy my own equipment had a place to do it and I've been doing my own thing the last five years pretty cool very beginning you took some classes at Mesa Arts yeah massage centers they offer entered introduction to flame working to spoil silicate which no pipes or anything just like pendants marbles dishes patterns things like that and from there I a friend of mine from high school told me that this pipe shop was hiring I was like well let me go check this out so I got wind it in for an interview and they hired me and I started the following week so the first time I ever saw a glassblowing was in a high school art class my teacher showed us Chihuly and I was hooked the moment I saw them with a molten piece of glass and like an inch thick of newspaper wet newspaper when I was like by forming with their hand I was like holy [ __ ] how do I do that like that's cool and it was nothing like she just kind of showed us this video for something that I don't even know the project was but I'm cold months later I finished I wanted projects earlier and sort of a friend of mine and she kind of took us aside and we made beads on a map gas torch in pots yeah in school we gotta said we liked it a little bit of bead making my torch and how it's just like this is cool it's just tie it like I like this but then I started asking about classes and where to do it and that's kind of how it all started yeah well that's the funny thing about it so I took about three months worth of classes but when I went in for the interview they asked me if I had blown glass before and I said yes and they kind of were discouraged because they like to teach people who have from a fresh start so you don't have to reteach any bad habits but I was still fresh enough and didn't have a my own feeling for it and was like kind of spun at the time of information just absorbing it all that they they're like well he doesn't have any bad habits that we can't correct so I showed them in my interview what I could do and they figured I'd be a good fit so yeah honestly it wasn't even prep but it was prep but it was only one task all I did was pull points I pulled points for like 40 hours a week right for six months yeah it sucked I hated doing it it was hot in that shop I had just kept doing the same thing over and over but I attribute the fact that I can spin glass well is because of like you know 10,000 hour rule I think I've put it in close to like 7,000 all that [ __ ] you know not really but like that's the ideology I kind of yeah exactly if you do the same thing just like a bunch you're gonna get good at it so the way that works was that it's like they had only so many hours that the shop was open and if you put in 40 hours on by Friday whenever you were I finished up until like seven o'clock on Friday you had free time so let's say I had my 40 hours done by two o'clock on Friday I'd have you know five hours of free time I can use anything of their just would you start me at that point um it was really hard to work 40 hours doing the same thing over and over and then wanna go blow glass afterwards you for yourself so a lot of the times I didn't use it but my boss knew that I was interested in glass outside of the job so one day he came up to me and asked I wanted to come in on Saturday and he would be willing to teach me whatever I wanted yeah and so I was chase chase goes by chase AZ glasses chase glass yeah yeah yeah I think I came over exactly what handle it yeah he was today's wonder studio now but that guy's a bother he's yet he taught me a lot of things taught me how to make a pipe me how to make a bubbler was more than willing to share technique and a key kind of when I worked there he was kind of the good guy like for me but everyone the other guy the other managers were kind of like work harder and she's like we're doing good man okay yeah Chase is really cool so you went in you Brett made some prep start blowing glass pipes did that for how long about six months of glass pipe making I was there for a year six months of prep six months of this thing man that's made a couple thousand there yeah and the quota per day was like 50s nearly forty five yeah that's like [ __ ] like ADA eight an hour maybe a little under and there's are just like little spoons like Hume the outside maybe a design on it or something like nothing spectacular yeah and I had to make him in like eight minutes or less it was like go go go save your money started yeah I bought a torch bought a kiln my grandparents were going to let me use a shed in the backyard of the studio so I did that for a couple years and then what was like one of the first pieces you made I actually do I would remember this my friend came over that night and I made this little reticello pendant it was just like slime and yellow and it brokes I didn't have my kiln wasn't I don't have the electricity setups just the gas and yeah that broke but cuz it didn't Emil it's gonna be looking yeah I'm finally free I'm doing my own thing yeah do you ever work for anybody else happened no I haven't I was four years ago turn five cool so let's talk about the people you meet today what is it it's a recyclate it spins water it's got an uptake god drain it's uh honestly what is it I don't know it's this color right here home blown made this color I'm going glass but they're down here in Tempe a couple miles away yeah this is something that they put into a pot to stir it up dip into it yeah like a drill like a drill bit of hole I like this like a couple feet long stick it in the pie just spins it up yep some little stick of big old chunk of glass clear glass in that pot pull it out and it'll just be this big like lava glass stretch that down and we get this cool color it's not named or anything that's just a nice teal good yeah I colored is a lot more glass right oh yeah a lot I mean like a click pounded by the pound okay so I'll pound of colored glass usually goes for like 80 bucks and you do $100 and it's not like the rare stuff no I feel good there's just one color company molten Aurora they're making color that's like 160 bucks a pound that's a little bit different this rig I use probably a little over a half pound in it so on my end it's like 40 bucks where the material time-space and paying for all the equipment doesn't invested in and everything there's quite a buildup maybe a bug maybe yeah maybe a dollar and that's like the high-end sigh max like best clear because there's different grades of glass I mean I bought today I I pumped went out today that was about four and a half hours on this recycler from scratch normally I'll take my leisure time and we'll take like eight to ten hours yeah what color yeah how much more I would add you to the line where you're the weak leg stuff like this um so I've got to prep the line tubing which takes probably close to an hour then I've got to actually do the pattern work it's another hour on top of it and then I've got to incorporate that into the piece because there's some there's more involvement with that now that you've got the pattern section you would have to add that to the piece and it's a little more involved there things can go wrong there's more risk involved yeah it is it's something that you kind of build on top of with your recyclers themselves isn't there a little bit of yeah there is the proportions of the uptake sand drains those proportions of the top can and the bottom can those things aren't right they won't work correctly yeah I've got a list have small been a few pictures of things I've tried before prototypes of different styles you know what works what doesn't what's aesthetically pleasing what isn't because without trying you don't know I don't know I thought I'm kind of I think incorporating more pattern work into my work is really what I'd like to go it's just a little risky taking that leap because I may not see that return hopefully yeah I mean I'm still having fun blowing glass so it's not that doesn't take anything away from it but I do need to get paid so I can make hype tomorrow okay when I was looking at your stuff [Music] yeah it is it feels good to understand what I'm doing and have control because there's a there's a big part of me and I still don't have full control of what I'm doing a lot of like a glass is learning everyday it is a hard thing to do and I still [ __ ] up [ __ ] all the time man I've had I can't tell you how many times I've dropped a piece when it's almost done just like just like right off there like so where I put those little bridges on my handle sometimes that area I can get shocked and snap and so I've dropped probably five or six pieces directly from here all the way to the ground sometimes they break sometimes they bounce I pick it up and I continue working yeah it's uh go home I don't know I tried sometimes I'll fight through it and I'll start over I've done that a couple times but a lot of time I just give you sad yeah yeah no accepting failure is something I still haven't done but it's something needs to be done how about I collapse yeah yeah yeah and on top of that peace is the maker [ __ ] cool [ __ ] like definitely some advice over the neighbor shout out the studio yeah they shot the future is there anybody for you to aspire to work with get to make that dream come true collabs are a lot of fun to do [Music] so now your skill set for this guy hi man it's been nice

calm we're back over here at the little famous original Purple Haze and spam we'd be answering some letters I've wandering in the pocket this is from a little Tommy out in Walla Walla Washington heat says Professor Gill what the [ __ ] is a UFO mom this is a UFO and now we're gonna get a little more detail right now I actually drew out a little something-something just to show you guys you know I'm always describing you about the tube and everything but just this way you can see it up close and personal we get a Sharpie out not strong enough there we go alright didn't get you down Sam and your bowl over here you know alright so as soon as you light your bowl all the smoke goes down in there bubbles up after you down stem and then the smoke finally reaches this chamber and that's the UFO perimeter smoke is gonna go up through that Center so there's a center tube right to the middle so it's not going outside into this second chamber yet it's still in that - oh it's gonna come out the tube and it's still trapped in this dome area it's still trapped in that little done smoke is gonna go back out by the way there is water covering probably about that much covering everything the smoke is gonna go back out and then it's gonna go out through the slits let's start bubbling up you can go out to those lids there's a lot of splits on this percolator so it's gonna bubble up really nicely it's gonna be really nice smooth so bubbles all the way up there and see your splash guard so just in case any water something comes up there and on top and hit your mouth the smoke actually exit through those slits as well on the bottom and on the side so it's gonna come back up all you do is remove that slide and that's a perfect hit right there thanks for watching and me answering some more letters from some more viewers and a little bit", "7do1xC9h24Q": "so this video is to go over the difference between the dab rig in a her blog to make a video short really there is no difference it's all preference at the end of the day but we'll go over some of those preferences and why so on the left here we have your classic beaker bong style which i think is a good hairball try herb on one of the reasons for that is it's simple it's easy to clean so you can see it has a slid down stem that's removable so your dank tobacco is not gonna get stuck really in there you know a quick alcohol wash or 420 clean or something like that cleans it out really easily over here we have a recycler new just added to the website those are common my opinion should be used as a tab rig they have really good function so a smooth hit that leaves a lot of good flavor and cool temps Moke so people really like the recyclers for dabbing but it doesn't mean you can't take quartz banger out for the dry herb slide in vice versa you could take the bong slide out of the bog and put a banger in so I mean again really at the end of the day its preference as long as you're balling is 10 millimetres 14 millimetres or 18 millimeters we do a video a few posts back showing what different sizes are and how to tell the only bong that's not gonna work for oils is this type of style and the reason being it's not 10 millimetre 14 millimeters or 18 millimeters so you're not gonna be able to fit a banger in there so one of the great things about having a millimeter sized joint you can have attachments so for example at a drop-down then you can either put slide like that put your barrier back in so this is gonna catch any type of reclaim ash anything like that it's going to keep your rig cleaner and it's also again gonna catch any type of reclaim and you can reuse it or do whatever you do with it if you're actually listening to this video here's 10% off just use discount code cheers to checkout and go over some more accessories so it's kind of cool you can build the belong in a sense you know with accessories you can really add anything you want so this is a 14 millimeter to 18 millimeter male to male adapter so we'll throw that in and this is a reclaimed catcher again with the last clip removable jar as you can see jar comes out and easy clean and you can get your reefing right out of there put this back together Oh putting it on wrong there we go so that clips in that clip so on another popular accessory would be a ash catcher soon as you see 14 millimeter fits right in there and if you guys have any questions feel free to reach at any time we have a ton of different accessory options some different bond options rig options again at the other day it's really preference so don't do something because you think it's the right thing to do do it because you like it so cheers guys", "TwxfEGCjQDc": "[Music]", "WAbmZ3IDoVk": "what's going on guys so we're back again with another daily high club unboxing this is actually going to be the august box the september box is still coming i'm unboxing this late because the main rig in this box uh when i received it was broken into a bunch of pieces and i had to wait for a new one to be sent out i just got it the other day so i can finally go ahead and make this video so i do apologize for the uh delay it's not even my fault it's usps but you know that's neither here nor there we got it now and that's really all that matters and i just got the email today that the new daily high club box for this month was sent out today along with hippie butler's box and i got do you goodie box coming this month as well so we're going to add a new box to the lineup and it's just like it's just going to be a crazy month man we got a lot of boxes to go through and uh yeah i'm just going to shut up and just pretty much hop right on into this thing so as always this is the box right here go ahead and crack this thing open for you guys now i didn't cover my mailing address on this so i'm just going to open it up this way as you guys can see this is the broken rig right here i'll show you guys the damage on it it's like it's pretty pretty gnarly and you know honestly like as you can see there's the stem right there i don't want to show it to you guys right now because i like to like i'll do it at like the final reveal but it's broken as [ __ ] here's the thing i don't honestly think it was usps with it that did this because if when you guys see the piece you'll know what i'm talking about the piece comes up and then goes sideways and when i got it it was like literally look like it was put in this box already broken i can't i i can't like prove it i don't know for sure but i feel like if it was put in there like that like wrapped up in a bubble wrap they probably should have known it was broken but they're probably like mass packing these things and they just really like it it might have just slipped their minds like it might just slip like quality control and just you know it's what it is all right first up we got a nice mat right here it's like a mouse pad you put your pieces on there and it looks cool and that's pretty much all it is it's literally a little a little mouse pad for your pieces it's not even really a dab mat it's literally just a coaster for your pieces but it's really [ __ ] cool and it's got like some i don't know it kind of looks like a mad scientist on there that's kind of like the theme of this box as you guys will see um since i already opened it i i'm not really surprised i already know what's in this thing next up we got a pack of zags hemp wraps i've never actually had this brand before this is the original slow burn so they're not flavored they're literally just plain jane wraps right there zags i don't know if they're like from zigzags they're not i am yeah i think they are next up we got a clipper lighter this is a clipper jet so this is actually going to be a torch i believe yeah bloody and it burns red you can never have too many lighters man but like i'm getting to a point where i got like a [ __ ] ton of letters right now we got a couple stickers um and i don't know what this thing is when a mega box some promotional [ __ ] from daily high club right there set that aside stickers this month are going to be in case of fire stay lit which is kind of like dark humor right now seeing how california is pretty much a living hellscape at the moment and again fire inside definitely too soon but that's literally what they sent me uh next up we got a little cap case right here this is pretty much gonna be a little concentrate case you go ahead and put your wax in there it's made out of silicone and it's just literally a nice little case i don't really use i don't really like use a lot of concentrates but it's still really nice to have for like the off chance that i do use them next up we got a pack of plain raw papers right here the original papers it's going to be one in one quarter it's a brand new pack and if we look on the back right here they're gonna say sale only allowed in the united states these are genuine raw papers and they're just like another pack of papers man next up we got not gonna lie this box is a little short this month like literally this is the last thing in the box besides the piece so this is gonna be like a genuine short video right here but we do got some cool [ __ ] we got some [ __ ] that i actually haven't seen before in the subscription boxes at least with daily high club and i do appreciate that very much it's always nice to get some new [ __ ] this is actually glass right here this is actually like a glass pencil poker can you guys see that right there it's made entirely out of glass and it looks really [ __ ] cool it's actually pretty unique i've never seen one of these before and i've never actually owned a glass poker so i'm really excited to go ahead and use this thing and give it a go but it's literally just a pencil it's got the eraser right there and it just looks really [ __ ] cool i like how this is like the amber color you can kind of see through it a little bit it's got the black tip and uh yeah it'd be cool if it said like number two on there like stanford number two or some crazy [ __ ] like that but it doesn't all right we don't need that box anymore so we got more stickers that they actually sent me with the replacement rig and those stickers are warning smoking chills this is my favorite one out of the bunch let's get mummified it's just a different sticker i have not seen this sticker from daley high club yet and then we got the provencal parental advisory sticker dank as [ __ ] and they're literally just stickers dude i got so many [ __ ] stickers like when i start making my own [ __ ] and like sending out shirts and everything like that my own merch i'm probably just gonna like give you guys stickers until i run out of [ __ ] just until i run out of them because i just got dude i got so many [ __ ] stickers right now from these boxes next up we got our basic ass bowl piece i say it in all these daily high club videos out of all the subscription boxes i have received so far cannabis based subscription boxes their bowl pieces are literally my favorite i don't know there's really nothing special about them other than the fact that they're just a little thicker than most they got the nipples on them and they're just like they're just nice extra ball pieces to have moving right along we got our showstopper right here round two i'm gonna go ahead and crack this thing open this is probably why we didn't get a lot of stuff in this month's box like the box seemed a little short and this is why right here because this piece is significantly bigger than the other daily high club pieces i've received and it's also really really [ __ ] nice looking as i said before this is like a mad scientist like themed box and as you guys can see this bubbler right here it's a literally looks like it came it literally looks like a beaker bubbler it's got the long stem right on the top right here i actually don't own any pieces that actually come off the side like this i've seen them before and i've just never really got around to getting one and our ball piece goes right there on top i don't know if this is actual measurements right here of like water um volume but you can fit a lot of water in this piece right here and it's literally just a really [ __ ] nice piece there's nothing fancy about it it's not like it doesn't have all kinds of crazy colors or anything like that it's literally just a basic piece and it's like kind of like to me like simplicity is key like the simpler the better i like it to look simple i like i like my pieces to be simple but i like them to look like really [ __ ] nice as well like every once in a while i'll get like a nice colored glass piece and it's cool and all but unless i get them from a subscription box i'm not going to go ahead and personally buy one unless it's something like crazy that i had to have like this amg [ __ ] bong right here this amg i call it the hentai bong because that's pretty much what it is it's got a bunch of anime chicks all over it and this is literally the only piece i have that is like fully decked out in decal and that's just because i saw it and i had to [ __ ] have it but other than that this kind of style like a lot of colors and flashiness is really like not my style amg makes really good products but i saw it i just had to [ __ ] have that piece but i'm more inclined to buy something like this and i'm just honestly really glad i got it finally i'm glad they replaced it and i really just can't wait to [ __ ] use it i'm probably gonna spark this thing up tonight and uh give it a go and see how it goes i'm sure it's gonna function perfect and um yeah that is this month's daily high club box right there i am very sorry for the delay guys again it wasn't my fault i'm glad i was finally able to sit down and get this video out before we get completely overwhelmed with boxes this month if you guys enjoyed this video be sure to give it a thumbs up definitely let me know what you guys think in a subscription down below if you guys got something different in the august box definitely let me know i like to like see the variations and everything and uh yeah hope you guys have a good night and i'll catch you guys next time bye", "WjhCvolqoo0": "[Music] Charles the people yo what is up YouTube into boy coming at you with another video you fill me back to vagus another day we got another package to open up real quick though let me uh though some smoke in the air like my brother southern Dever 4/20 would say let's throw some smoke in the air BAM little bolt little bit of weed let's get it start this off with a nice low bow Cheers she came out to the world blow y'all know so without further ado let's get into this unboxing you to me I got some Chinese glass from a Chinese wholesaler so it was cheap all I thought I'd try it out this is the package here and we'll open it up so get right into it okay well I this looks pretty [ __ ] ghetto haha fam that's what I got a little ball rigged for that ass so I'm gonna fill this up with some smells all right don't smell weird I'm gonna rinse it I'm gonna rinse this out put some water in it we'll get some gloves out of that and we also got here hey yeah see this was I was kind of upset about was I wanted this to be frosted I hate him when they're not [ __ ] sandblasted but I got these two little balls in here damn it I supposed to fit inside this and I specifically wanted it but it is alright boom we're back I threw some water in this thing let's check the function [Music] [ __ ] with this thing let's take it fat dad BAM going in awesomeness our cookies from old school extracts drop in the glob GMO to the world blow this still feels kinda hot so we're going in any wheeze looping my best bud Cheers this thing's a shredder I like it I got my new daily driver in this was really DHgate [ __ ] until next time Holly's your boy tap in if you're new to the channel subscribe if you like this [ __ ] hit the thumbs up you've got it loose any questions comments leave them down below the next video", "VcwZ149bHo4": "[Music] hey what's up guys it's a Eddie and Carlos from her smoke shop today we're gonna be showing you a few of our silicone pieces all right this is our silicone water pipe it comes with a glass bowl a glass down style and it is a 14 millimeter what's really cool about this water pipe it comes with an ice catcher and a nice little suction cup and you really can't drop and break this it's really nice and durable yeah very shock absorbing even if you have your down sonam add-on stem on there if you ever dropped it it'll probably absorb the shock the only thing that's ever at risk is gonna be your bowl which is always easily replaceable it's 14 millimeter you can find at any of your local Earth's no shops all right and this is our silicone rig comes with a titanium no also removable tub you can put some water in there comes with a nail and also a stash for year extracts you can just put right on the bottom of the piece which is really cool nice something that's also really cool about these oil rigs is the fact that I see here has made a specific nail for it so this nail was actually gonna have a heat diffuser right here so any of the heat that's being passed on from here to here won't really affect your silicone rig as well as it is very thick silicon so it will take heat very well so next we will be reviewing the icy hammer right here and this is a pretty dope unique little piece so it's gonna have your carb cap right here this is going to be easily removable and interchangeable with your oil rig if to use your oil rig for any dry or anything also it will have a stash container on the bottom and your little clinging to it let's check out the stash contain a real quick so right there you have a little bit of storage you know for all your on-the-go needs it's nice durable you can throw this in your book bag and nothing really happened you just take a little bow off of it and that's it you can add water I personally would add even oh my god an ice cube or anything like that just to give it a nice chill effect since it is silicone you can't put these in the dishwasher they are dishwasher friendly right they're ready to go these are patent pending so always look out for icy they are a great brand new this is gonna be like a regular icy pipe pretty cool size comes with a packer and a nice little stash as well right on the bottom does also come with the removable glass just like the hammer really easy to clean like he said it was dishwasher friendly really cool piece now with silicone one of the benefits you're getting as well as them not ever breaking due to heat or anything like that is you can be as thorough as you want with cleaning like let's say something like this I can easily stuff a bristle down the inside and run it all the way through no problem you know I don't have to worry that if I'm too rough with you I can break a or anything also with these you can run the bristles down the tubes and clean them all the way through because it is silicone it won't stick on it like as as much as it would on clasp as well so next up we're going to be reviewing the nectar collector silicone nectar collector this is not by IC but it is a silicone product that we do carry so right in here you will be just filling up a little bit of water just to give you that bubble effect if you guys can see that oh the water close that up now the water won't tip out or anything but it will tip out if you flip it over undecided right so all you're gonna do with this is you're gonna heat up this nail right here this is a heat diffuser so any heat wouldn't transfer up so right here you're just going to heat that up right you're gonna have your type of concentrates on the mat and then you're just going to wipe it right through so it does come with a oil pick right there oil stash right here and your little mat to store everything and keep it nice and organized or if you're tired of breaking your glass pieces and are clumsy person like me or Eddie here at times you know you can definitely go ahead and pick up one of these silicone pieces I will guarantee you this is the last piece you will ever need to have because you will never break it you can clean it you can travel with it disassemble it let's say something like the water pipe you can just take the down stem and the bowl and travel with it and go buy another down stem and Bowl if you ever travel on to the state or anything like that very convenient pieces to have especially if you don't want to be cleaning glass so much or you're not a fan of the yellowing that tends to happen with glass this is something very convenient and it's something revolutionary don't forget to check us out and subscribe on youtube check us out on Instagram for any of our giveaways this was Carlos with the smoke shop and this is Eddie thanks for checking in and definitely check out with all these silicone pieces while you laughs all right y'all enjoy peace guys", "QMZ7ZmxzIvM": "guys welcome back cccc we're here at the cave smoke shop in San Mateo and talked to Blake real quick and get a little update on the stock that they got here you guys haven't been here before definitely check it out Caves funk shop Sam - lets go in Blake to some of our favorite products that we've been carrying moving helping people get into their collections recently gonna start with one of our favorites pretty amazing artist he's been blowing glass for quite a long time he's known as one of the kings of tree perks but he's definitely been up to a lot of different stuff lately you know with the advent of brands like mothership sort of pushing artists to take things to another level we're starting to things see things like this the Christ perk recycler the Swiss tree recycler just guys trying to you know push the capabilities of what they can do in the designs and you know getting really awesome results on the function as well loops also making these little mini in cyclers lately they've been a really popular item especially the clear ones they're just out about a $200 price quite thick really nice well made really this water tested does it a nice little yeah I don't know yeah I just ordered some these are actually two the inverted 10 on yeah as our killer 1/2 even killing it with the tree Forex very cool to see some some new designs from them as well he keeps us fresh dive earlier in the colors here we saw these orders of origin within the month of getting them usually it's got the younger me a little loominatee there yeah cool guy he's been ministry for a while with other Ben's been in the industry for a while I've carried both of their bus and continue to do it for sure definitely check them out we have some of their work on our site we'll have some more going up soon c2 custom creations SoCal brand we've been carrying them for a little while now we really like these guys because all their pieces are super thick really well made very nice functioning earth they're a great way to get into that higher and scientific design out a bit a little bit lower price point a 150 these bubblers have this kind of flying their big brothers a little bit more also been really popular the 250 dollar larger tubes that we have here and $300 bigger brothers basically as a shower head to a ratchet disc his amazing function and it's just a real awesome kind of piece to have in the house where you have a lot of roommates wanting to share a piece and don't once I could be good yeah yeah River these guys are pretty killer also over here we have high side we've been carrying these guys for a while a lot of people know them for their showerhead stems all the wool balls little while ago they start coming out with these guys are perks just ton of diffusion and you know for people that want some piece where it's like sort of like you know so I'm gonna frig perks in other pieces that you've seen out there but still enough flow to get flavor with the really nice balance so yeah really cool pieces this little bubble of they do stacks all the way up to the mouthpiece so really really nice designs it's cool to see that you know brands that have been around for a while constantly trying to do new things let's remove those gonna be dangerous right there yeah they can but at the same time for people of this very portable that's the 2010 BC different clips and then a mainstay in our store we've been carrying us tubes for over since they started to Ollie's easy Nick yeah they have always been the toughest tubes in the industry look at how big the glass is on the base it's probably required a piece of tubing that was about this long to condensed down into a base like that yeah besides that their joints are also the thickest out there this is the thickest one they do the nine mil tank joint and everything skills go down to a seven mil piece you still got a really thick base and a thick joint just when you go to these nine Mills you start going to a baseball bat quality you know they even I have a special kiln a lot bigger than most camps it takes a lot longer for the pieces to cool now it allows the molecules to densify as much as possible so the annealing that they do is kind of unmatched in the industry you'll find other videos around YouTube of people banging these against other pieces even using one until I chuck out holes and drywall you know the air pump I personally had one fall over on concrete like ten times all it ever broke loose the bolts so really good investment you guys are clumsy breaking your bonds this is this is what you're looking for they also started doing a little mini tube that's been not so much am into a smaller tube that's been very popular as a nice split piece you know you can use it for dry and throw a cadaver said up as well and then one of our own local friends builds actually who you probably find some old CCC videos he actually designed this little mini tube with us tubes and these things are rippers they function really well they have that same durability these four mil tubing which is quite thick for a smaller mini tube like this and they've been doing them you know direct inject removable stand with the dome but then I gave them only update recently he's doing them with a 10 to 14 bushing downstem ready for a nice banger just throw right in there and get to work so excellent excellent little tube great starts you've especially at the 150 125 price point that they're starting at you also u.s. tubes they just start doing this with their percolator which is really cool they're doing sort of a bubble around each perk which will improve the quality of the percolation also just gives them a really unique look definitely something to stand out from the rest of the pieces out there everything is just straight tube exactly and then even with these bubbles are still thick you know still all pick they're percolated pieces you know that they'll be around the same price you'll go a little bit thinner on the tubing but then you get the perk as well and you still get a very nice durable all-around great - this one's a personal favorite of mine this is Mobius glass from Morro Bay just west of San Luis Obispo California oh yeah you guys had an eye on I remember and this guy the guy behind this studio his name's circle he put hard work he goes hard this guy's modeling stuff on AutoCAD before he's blowing it he's got an engineering mind the function of all his pieces is excellent the build quality of all of his pieces excellent and most importantly he's creative he's constantly coming out with new designs new concepts this really sick stuff we've been carrying his stereo matrix for about four or five years it's always been a big seller but even his bubblers the entry-level little $300 new pub ler they fly off the shelves and it's big brother the atom is one of the most beautiful production bubblers ever made we actually got a treat that we just got him which is one of the new color edition housing bubblers this one's all in Illuminati we'll make sure to mix in a shot with it with the UV light hitting it as well amazing function amazing design of these things for sure he actually just wanted to show them last year brought 90 models to market and he's currently working on another nearly ten models to bring to so he does not get stale at the same time he continues to produce all the models he's made just about for us so you have a huge library to select from if you wanted to come in looking splutters and he's kind of came up with so many different perks over the last couple years that have kind of led to more innovations and more different designs so yeah you could kind of take his 10 15 different designs he's come out with recently and look at 10 or 15 more that kind of branched off of those and exactly exactly like even case in point his fourth percolator that everyone's been waiting for for a long time which is called the polygon perk it's a hand bridged perk solid rod this is a special edition one that he did in lemon drop but literally all these little kind of balls that are created by the air sacs but basically they do have little but the belly button holes in between those that create a roundish kind of rift that's different than anything else and this one looks a little odd in the color but when he made a 23 arm variant of it we first mistook it for the old matrix percolator but it has a totally different hit yes I was just chugging - it's got the high flow diffusion that you used to with Mobius but a little bit more of a shed a little bit more of a kind of a round rip to it than you're used to which is really neat so both of these have been excellent and people have loved this scope model so much that he just most recently he's got this are just a couple days ago put your most popular matrix perk in the scope this is a killer combo right here and over here we got our good ol illa Delft always been a great gram for us lately they've been going to this new microbe series where they're doing smaller beakers which is cool because with the advent of dabbing and everything this makes a really great flip piece great herbal please throw nail on it's still a great dad piece for the size it also allowed them to shrink down their coils and bring them down to a lower price point than they've ever really been before while still giving you that like that you know high drag but high high cooling diffusion set up that works quite well you know good classic never seen one these before folks this coil up top is full of glycerin and when you put it in your freezer the blister and freezes solid like an ice pack and when you smoke on it the smell curls through the blistering coil and it gets you know basically coil condensed and cool it allows you to pull your smoke without adding the moisture from ice cubes into it which is really cool it also just got the ugly actually that's pretty cool function oh yeah with all this heavy glass people we're gonna forget about the function sometimes yeah we definitely see that you know we see heavy artists and also have very good function in their pieces yeah all in all we'll have a customer that's about to spend $500 on an art piece and then they'll be like well this is like my only piece and I'm a little this is your daily driver you might want something with a little bit more you know fusion Annika really depends if you're strictly divert usually to holes in the waters run deep amongst yeah so I'm trying to keep the closer we have been longtime fans of Toro we have worked very hard to carry their glasses over the last years our relationship has got nothing but better over the years and now we're really proud to say that we're gonna be doing a tour show towards the end of 2016 which is something I think the Bay Area is long overdue for we have a lot of Toro fans out here they'll really appreciate their wording Toro has constantly been improving the quality of his designs and the quality of the pieces themselves the the feet have gotten much thicker than mouthpiece overall pieces have gotten thicker more squared-off more angular more perfect more clean he's kind of responded to the gauntlet thrown down by some of the higher-end studios like mothership that are you know sort of creating a collector base that demands just the best quality that you can put into your work so we're seeing you know what someone who has employed a great team for quite a while has been able to take them to the level of which is excellent will continually love carrying their products you know their traditional macro still arguably one of the best daily driving little concentrates out there you know and they also have a new nail out called the Toro Grail it's a swing out basically a banger style nail it's excellent excellent nail it's probably one of the best ones in the market definitely check that one out too and then down here we got one more brand off of all I want to show you and this is ill glass illusions what a pretty cool this is pretty much as high-quality as you can get before you hit mother ship in the clear production world these guys are out of Colorado they have not gotten into many shops because the first shop that carried him sold out of mostly orders as they were being made so after a wait we were able to start getting them last year and they've definitely been a hot commodity even their entry level little guy which is kind of a competitor with the entry levels from Mobius and Toro has this great percolator called the 50 watt and it's basically a seal to the back of the can so you basically have a bridge on the front on the back down the back really excellent little design really nice diffusion give her a little peace when they drop this guy this got a lot of attention the flux tube and flux recycler which literally uses a perfect all the flux capacitor inspired by the one from everyone's favorite you know time-traveling film series which I always thought was very cool fusion on both the tube and the recycler is excellent one thing I also thought was unique on their recycler is besides having the you know traditional drain on the side of this distance ed up they also have almost like a clover splash drain up top to help you know get any extra water that you might splash up back down into the peaks so redundant really cool design really really good function on all these they do collaborations with some of the highest end artists in the world the collaborations are you know you know they're elite so I pretty much around mothership level so definitely worth checking out if you're looking for another very high-end production brand out there like mothership to get into definitely would check out Hill this is their latest piece that they just came out with its an I'm in love with it it's a really beautiful design stuff that like grated waffle I've always been a waffle thing yeah is this little grated scroll critted puck kind of like waffle inspiration down here it's really nice it is slid it around the side but gritted so you know it's definitely yeah and fixed towards the back again which is a little different than your sustainable and it's actually really neat that your vapor will come in through the joint and then go around the pretty much the extension of the neck down into the perk up and then into the you know return drains and back down again so there's a lot of motion like a continual river going on in here like I've heard others say about you know in cyclers and I've always been a big very big fan of these and this new model is the killer got another treat to show you these haven't really stayed in the store for very long after getting them so far this is the new brothership series that was created by mothership glass this year it premiered at age twenty sixteen we run the first shots to carry him we're pretty excited to carry these we have a long-standing relationship with mothership we did their first in-store show actually the only one to date and we've always just been massive fans of them I mean Studios led by Scott that'd be one of the greatest fight managers out there it's one of largest studios in the world of high-end artists and its really building the next generation of blast brothers the brother ship line was them pretty much wanted to come out with something that was a little bit more affordable where people can get their designs closer to the original pricing that they original motherships came out at the fab a especially excellent function ER but the straight fab the tours all of them are very very close to the original motherships in terms of function and the build quality arm is excellent you know there's a lot of people that have been capitalizing off the motherships hard work and designs and I'm actually kind of proud that they were able to put something out that you know was affordable yeah that's affordable that you don't have to go spend $1,000 on a knockoff fab bag and go spend a thousand dollars on a real fat bag that's from the people who designed it a more affordable brand yeah um and yeah I've been seeing lots of different responses online all I can say is store check them out for yourself you know you can water test them and everything yeah waiting next to them this little guy right here this little guy is something pretty special for sure mothership had a private dinner at the beginning of January this year where they invited their closest collectors to come and pretty much buy and bid on some of the most amazing pieces that they made today this by far is one of the most amazing pieces they've had our dings awesome this piece was made by Scott Dabney and it's not a bad plan for us this is a ball klein course you look at the can here you basically have a stem going in and and down you don't have the faberg\u00e9 holes here this is sort of like if a blind tourists were reimagined for dabbing this would be the ultimate piece for life yeah now besides just the basic you know beauty of it as it is this guy is fully faceted head to toe the mouthpiece the maria's the joint the internal balls and drains and then a diamond down here that was probably fasted out of a much much larger marble of Illuminati the entire piece is in UV reactive Illuminati once again we'll give you some cool shots of that together a little bit later yeah um but the faucet work what makes this piece especially amazing is all the faucet work on here was done by Scott Debbie's 17 year old son first mother ship keys for him to put his hands on this piece was bought at that private dinner last month not by us by one of our best customers a really awesome collector who decided you know in exchange for us helping him pick this piece up he let us display it a little while in our store so if you're seeing this video within you know a few weeks of it going up it's probably still on display this piece is pretty much one of the sickest pieces ever made come check it out for sure things are awesome you guys were coming in the day always a pleasure

thanks for watching the CCC fourth month", "Msog9pXJiW8": "and inside out get something inside out and just brushed my finger right through my Herbie's needle flame and oh my gosh what's up everybody it's Rick James with the daily session we got another episode today we actually have Larry limes glad what's up thank you like he's a perfect example of a home blown glass blower a lot of his work lately has been out of his studio from the house but he also works at a studio in Tempe as well yeah with a few other guys you might know um tea schmidty's fizzle goober Gabe they're all really cool local blast blowers I'll share time there but I always find myself coming back to home it's that's where I like started while working here I'm comfortable I know where all my stuff is you know and it's just I love it you know I love working with other people it pushes you it makes me wanna you know step up your game or a card or work more I definitely might work a little less at home some time to do some distractions but I just like being in the comfort of having my own stuff nice so let's try to get into it you're a little younger than some of the other people that films how old are you I just turned 21 about four or five months ago I was started doing this and I was about just about to turn nineteen and so I've been a little over two and a half years now and you just started doing it and I stopped going to school there blowing glass and what got you in the glassblowing um it's back in high school I had some friends who had some cool glass and Toros whatnot and actually every one of them convinced me to buy one home off of him and you know I loved it I got so interested in glass I started trading glass and just it was so cool on Instagram when I knew nothing like every day I find 10 more artists that I thought were like so awesome you can just make such cool things and I was just kind of made me want to put my hand in there and try so you're just like an everyday smoker and just started getting any glassblowing where did was like one of the first places actually saw somebody blowing class really is when I actually BlueGlass myself I think and that's when I wanted to get into it I really had not a lot of prior knowledge about it I just like you know bites of smoking back in high school you know I thought they are awesome stop everything you know and Instagram was awesome and then actually one of my brother's friends who he's like oh this great kid blows glass ask him you know he showed me some stuff and I just fell in love with it who was it um low-key glassblower rounder but real cool guy let me get on a tour so we do some stuff then I mean that's what started my passion I guess that's crazy also remember we were talking about how you've actually taken a few classes yeah that's blowing yeah so I've taken a couple of classes of actually uh Julie's high school in Seattle they just started offering flameworking classes they normally do soft glass in the furnace and uh I took you to a classes there which really helped you know just everyday waking up on glass with you know masters glass bowl and really just talking something to those classes just really sharpen up your skills like nothing else what you do another level exactly yeah you know and you just see these guys work and it's really cool just every glass blower and you know in the world works so different and that's what I really think is cool you know and see it work so different and as both have a beautiful you know similar piece it's just really cool about the process do you like glass blowers that you yep two side ever looked up to you know bug glass you know one of my favorites I try and make my skeletons without coming near his style at all cuz you know he just I loved him before I even you know started blown glass and I really respectfully does it's got Debbie I'm out of skew key he was one the classroom you just have great shaping and obviously the Italians Cesare all these guys let up chalk glasses just sculpting their big balloons but really you know all those guys I just I appreciate a clean work that's what I want to start doing this beyond class for words hard but clean adarand screen shape big clean optics you know and then start to throw in these v-mail fun little thing skeletons big horns everything that makes it a so anyone that talked to me about the piece that we've been working on we've actually been we're gonna feel like the past three days yeah so like I said I think a lot of time with my pieces and you already know from a day I guess you know a week a couple of weeks it might not be every day on the torch but yeah this was three days a hardware I probably 20 hours maybe I'd say here and there in total you know meet working on the torch or cold working on the piece what is it so it's just a big and blue mini tube the colors mystique from glass alchemy and then there are two new sections of chip stacks one on the neck one on the body what's a chip stack so the chip stack is where I will actually back together a bunch of glass I do it a lot different than a lot of glassblower so that's what I'm saying everybody doesn't different so I'll just back together glass imagine if my fingers were a bunch of rods of glass and then I just melt it down and I chop them up so those little squares and they have lines different colored lines go through them and then just puzzle them together in different patterns with the different colors or different way the lines are shaped like layers not necessarily layered but just like puzzle together flat and pieces yes exactly so it's like think if I had 40 tiny squares and I was gonna turn those 40 squares until you let square this big okay and then I have a square this big and what I actually it was fold that square into the circle so then gonna have a square like my hand I hold it into a circle and then you get a tube and you can work it on from there it also has one of my gremlins or I guess dinosaurs I still haven't fully decided I'm calling on you know let the people decide once I start making a couple more but and that's kind of eating the tube mouthpiece you know I'm trying to stand out do kind of my own thing with the skull there's a lot of people I couldn't you know think of ten people who are doing big skulls like that but hopefully it kind of is anybody else having this plate no one looks like it's getting the bone yeah I dragged that's why I could kind of just like it just really even man you know I like it's cool I think when you're actually hitting the piece it looks like you're you're staring right it's a dinosaur you know which is really funny and it's pretty cool I'm excited to show you so what's next for you um that's a good question no probably just you know start working with some other artists traveling a little bit more always refining my skills that's what I love that's what I want to always do do you have no goals um ah be to support myself in the future you know by making if I could say it's really my goal by making just what I want you know sure I said the pieces I want to make not necessarily I make something and everybody loves it and they want you know everybody wants me one of them cuz you know a lot of us do that I have so much respect for those guys making all those pieces you know it's a guide but for me I just want to kind of make the individual piece to me that I wanted to smell God if you know and then I hope I could share that with someone and it would be a unique part of their life as well personalized design is very personalized you know like I said sometimes you know these pieces I'll have in my head you know my heart for me a week a month you know and I'm slowly working on it always thinking things change up all the time on the fly how I start I think a piece is gonna end up some way it's always so what he's saying is Larry limes puts love into all of this glass hand-blown glass with love that is actually what I used to say all the time right sorry I stopped saying it but I think I'm gonna start again there you go that should be your logo right there is love put it underneath your bio on intagram I might I might do that yeah I think it's just you know it's just important to do when I was buying pieces I was just so it was cool I'd meet some of the artists I was what I loved it you know it was art for me really a real art and it made me happy if I was having bad days you know yeah I mean it's a bonus I'm smoking pot out of it you know I know the piece itself I take it with me I think you know and just you know I look at it you know over the mouth there Thanks kind of what got me into this level of glass and it's silly and it is you know being the pipes but I think I'll be you know around all types of glass not just pipes that's my life speak on that glass is kind of a hard thing to work with what have been some of the challenges that you've had blowing glass um it's definitely can be a little tough sometimes your things are great the more I you want you know someone like me you know where these other artists who spend 30 40 hours on the piece that can be really really tough when you're just on the tail end and something goes horribly wrong and you can just lose it all right lose it all you know like even with this one you had a crack in the piece but those are easily cleaned out yeah so sometimes you know crack would be a horrible thing on my skulls they're not the worst thing you know they're open from the inside and the bottom so if it cracks I can go from both sides really fix that crack so as long as I know as long as the hollow vessel doesn't crack right it's that's what's worrying because then you'll see a big scar but on this goal you only be able to notice and just to kind of clarify cracks you're kind of normal then glassblowing yeah a lot of the artists that I filmed before they have had stuff that add crack the glass the exact you just clean it up in as long as it looks perfect and nice yeah you know yeah so that's just part of the job like I said it's um you know sometimes this they won't work out you might have to fix um never you've burned or cut yourself oh yeah I got you know two really bad burns on my arm there you know my thumbs cut my hands cut now I may be a little sloppier than I shouldn't be and when it comes to being on the torch but yeah it's just you know part of the job if I'm gonna be doing this what is there anything hours a week the worst you've had worse day out it was actually I was at that glass school in Seattle patrulla via the hooli school format ask you keys course and I just trying to inside out get something inside out and just brushed my finger read through my Herbie's needle flame and oh my gosh where you could almost see the bone there I was just it was but it healed up great you know I was a little worried but you get up almost just about perfect normally oh that's where I heal so fast for burns now as I've been blowing glass you know and I almost don't even mind the pain anymore is glassblowing more of a hobby for you right now or yeah it's ah be that I'm lucky enough to make you know a little bit of money basically to pay for all my supplies and stuff so I'm not necessarily digging myself into a big hole I was able to have a little money saved up so like I said I'm just kind of I'm not making money I'm not losing money just stay and even kind of doing my thing like I said I'm not in a rush to put a lot of my work out there until very comfortable with it until I know that this is the best work I can put out there you know quality quality work I don't want you know and I'm okay being patient if that's what it takes but I think I'm just about getting very comfortable in my work and it's a vulnerable thing glassblowing you know all these people sitting around the table hi staring at something you made you know maybe judging that saw a limo I mean honestly I reached out to you because I feel that you are one of the underdogs I've seen a lot of your work on Instagram and even met you in person before and was really impressed with what you came up with and I do appreciate that I really really do so it's just you know it's all hard work here and like I said you don't need a big fancy setup or anything you know you just got to work hard you know find your inspiration where you find it know where you mess up I'm big on reflecting I think you learn just as much off the torch maybe as on the torch you know or think about why things are happening why this is happening learning about the material itself that's really what helped me advance a little faster I think is just picking it apart Kumail has been nice talking to you today where can we see more of your work and where can people reach you at I'm right now just Instagram really I got a few you know head shops around and have my work I'm gonna start really I think trying to get out there more I'll have a website something hopefully in the next you know Instagram I'm gonna try to start using more I don't use it a ton like I said I keep my head down I'm working I'll show awesome things that I'm proud of you know but that's gonna change you'll start seeing around and so hopefully we start seeing you a lot more around time you appreciate I'll try alright Larry was nice talking to you yeah my man I had a great time you know not be that you gotta come and see how it's done and I really appreciate you coming out nice well that's gonna be it for

Tobler great for anybody's collection so be sure to check it out", "DtYs1sXLe80": "hello senior stoner fans it's the real senior stoner back at you for an afternoon discussion on glass this is something i've really never talked about before but it struck me recently when i purchased another high-end bong it struck me the differences between different water percolating devices i don't want to use the term bong anymore so let's discuss from the right my right to my left from the right the least expensive to the left the most expensive and you're going to see why i didn't know why but i learned why and i'm going to share it with you let's talk first of all please don't pay attention to if there's dirt in some of these i haven't used one of these for a long time this is the one this is the least expensive glass device i could find of a nice size i bought it on dhgate.com which is a knockoff company in china that sells everything long story short i thought i had found the holy grail it wasn't the holy grail because as you can see the way it's constructed and designed it's very very hard to clean the inside piping and the design work the other thing i noted this was about 29 was that the glass was so light and thin this is extremely light and thin glass okay that's what you get for 29 got it well now we're going to move up further we're going to move up to another dhgate product but a 49 product now what a 49 product does is it gives you two different layers for percolation let me move these aside and show you what it does so what happens is that water then blends up through the top and would give you more water filtration the problem with both of these devices these two is they're both from china they're both cheap knock-offs and unfortunately in the world of glass it looks like you get what you pay for i have put them in the basement and haven't used them in a long time the challenge with this one is it's just designed poorly the challenge with this one is it's not good quality but once again you get what you pay for in this world let's pull them aside because i just wanted to use them as an example of inexpensive bonds and what you get if you remember i was in the mattress business just like bed if you pay 99 for a mattress good luck having it be any thicker than this okay you're not gonna get a jumbo pillow top unless you're spending fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars today so let's discuss glass the same way you want borrow skillet glass you want lab quality glass you want glass that's going to last glass that's going to be heavy in your hand now let's get to it this is a higher standard nine inch bubbler what this is designed for basically is to put any type of bowl if you will into it it is very versatile i put my g pen connect into it not just a bowl i put my honey badger into it not just a bowl very versatile piece made by higher standards this is a graph piece very similar you can see the graph piece and the higher standard piece are thicker thicker they're branded their companies are proud of their product and they have a very very nice weighted base both of them these are designed well they're designed well they're versatile i have both of them even though they're similar so now you understand what a bubbler is this is a 9-inch bubbler probably this is a 10-inch bubbler the design behind these is to allow you to put anything into the female mouthpiece anything you want and you can turn it into an email with a honey badger really really versatile devices great the challenge though with any bong nowadays you go on ebay you go on the internet and you look for a screen you know what you're gonna get this pardon that is black you're gonna get this it's a copper bordered already formed wire bowl about a half an inch wide and when you put it into a bowl like this it's a good fit but when you put it into some others it's not a good fit so what i don't understand about any of these devices frankly is why why a great product high quality product would want you to pull through a hole into the water all the residue i don't get it it's counterintuitive why they want you to dirty up your water peace water especially which is expensive does it make sense so that's a flaw in bongs in bubblers because you have to use a screen you have to you're going to say maybe some of you oh no that's what the hole is for you pull through well guess what you're going to see that there's some residue inside some of these bonds because of that but let's keep going well the session the newest one in the house i'm liking it mrs stoner is liking it the reason we like the session the reason we like the session is not just the quality now i will talk about the quality it's a really nice stand it's a really easy pull to pull up the bowl with its handle and the glass man this glass is thick okay i don't know how many millimeters it is but this is the thickest glass these two items you're going to see now are the thickest glass i've seen that's important okay the other part about the session this long that's really cool is it simple all you gotta do is inhale there's no holes there's no buttons there's no attachments you take your hit and clear it take your hit and clear it really simple so quality here meant simplicity it's also a versatile device but it is not the same opening size okay got to remember that it's a different opening size the session a wonderful device newest piece in the house i'm really liking it but let's move to the higher the hair agir this i don't even know how to describe it other than that it's a monster the hair or the higher is as i spoke before has a whole solid brass bowl believe it or not with a hole for you to put your weed in i'm not big on holes so even though that beautiful thing is there i end up sticking a screen in because i don't like pulling stuff through the bong water that's just me but one of the things that's great about this piece is the hit it gives the mouthpiece on this can you see the mouthpiece on this it's the size of a flamethrower i mean it's a monster check it out i mean you can hear it so what you've got here is you've got a tremendous assortment in the marketplace and what i hope i've done is shown you that there are really differences between glass pieces and the differences amount to price obviously which goes to performance okay and quality so you got to remember in this world you get what you pay for and what we want to do if we probably want to settle somewhere in the middle let's assume that we don't want to buy the cheapest thing on the market because it's not great and let's assume why should we buy the most expensive thing on the market because something else going to come out better so you buy the sweet spot that's where the action is in all types of things cars beds baseball mitts you name it these two okay and these two are the devices the grav and the higher standards happen to be the two devices that i use the most and here is why all the other devices really are designed for weed for flour these devices i bought specifically specifically because their female parts worked with my electronic attachments so what you can do in this world is you can spice things up quite a bit you can get a g pen connect you can get a honey badger you can get a go can torch there are a number of things out there on the market now that you can turn your bubbler your bong into an e-ring and that's what i did there hope you enjoyed this video comparing different glass pieces and their versatility this has been the real senior stoner if you enjoyed this video please subscribe and have a great day cheers", "gwhSzEl0Trs": "it's a few shadows here again with another episode of shadows we review now today on the episode we are going to be doing an unboxing of a legendary bomb you guys this one is a gold roar so let me show you we're gonna open it up right now now you know me I love roar cuz it's the best they started off as a decanter company out of Germany making the little glass decanters out of all of the glass bomb companies that are around right now they were the best and let me tell you why you put in a bull inside of any other stem like this one the bull there's gonna be a little jiggle a little jiggle and then when you put this into the bump W another little jiggle those jiggles lead to a loss you can solve it by showing wax in there or whatever but all that is whack if you want the right way you get a roller the roars have are the only ones that won't wear down over time because see all this is just like a coating it looks looks frosty that'll all wear off into smooth that over time putting it in and out and then I'll start getting stuck it's because you got the cheap one if you get the roar the roars is actually ground glass so when they go together it fits nice and smooth every time it locks complete there's no jiggle and we're gonna show you that right here with this new gold roar that we are opening up right now that is the difference between a good bone and cheap wah now there's nothing wrong with a cheap on when you need to get it done because everybody wants to get hot and I have no problem that I've smoked and plastic bongs and little homemade things that I've made apples I am not too good to smoke out of anything but what I'm saying is when you're going to buy the best bong and you finally got some real money and you want to do it the right way let me show you what to get right here so you guys have seen my three foot roller they don't make three foot rollers here in the United States they we make them in Germany now if you want to get them you gotta buy them in a batch of ten and they're $800 each they give you no price break so if you guys want to come in together we can do that together but what I did was I'm working on a deal with them to make some new shadows roars custom and I'm gonna buy them in a bulk package and see if you know work that out for you guys but this is the next best thing this is the this is what the best you can buy right now in the United States from roar from the best company so this is the best Ferrari from fry okay I'll check this out guys it's the biggest one they make by rule right now it's got gold ready see that and I paid for the real real gold so here we go brand-new it's got the roar official like when you buy a nice watch or anything like a real purse when you buy the real deal it comes with this real the real you know so here we go we got the real ball okay so this is how the roar pieces and when you hold one when you see one you will know the difference right away the quality and craftsmanship on the edges and everything is perfect it is perfect okay and all of their pieces even the Bulls have a roar imprinted in the glass so accept no imitations one especially we're spending a month so watch this as it goes in they remember that sound I was talking about that's how it'll never go away in a roar because they do it the right way not just a coating that will wear off a rub off the right way now look at do you hear any jiggle any direction no jiggle put your hand over it suck as hard as you can total suction that is perfect crap salutes you and when they give you a bowl when you buy a bump okay look at the bowl and or the stem see how the stem goes to the bottom corner of the bong that's vital you want it to go through as much water as possible or if not as much water be able to use as little water as possible so that you can get the biggest bong low as possible but either way it's the most important to get it the deeper in the water you want it to go to the bottom corner if it's in a straight shooter like this you want to get it all the way to the bottom corner and roar always sends you the right perfect depth so that there is no there is no problems some all these other bong companies are going halfway up the bull the stem is like halfway in the water so you got to fill it like halfway with water dude it's not made right did you got a look at a ruler and they will show you just look at how they do it look at the geometry all the way to the perfect bottom corner when you fill it with water it's gonna fill the right there you don't need a lot of water in there and you will get the fattest bong load I promise you try Roy you'll never go back let's pull out the bull they've figured out how making the long handle breaks it off it puts too much stress on this point they made this point wider where it connects right here there's even the roar imprint right there it is that the ground the ground glass right here it's not just sprayed on itching like this is the real deal nice thick and look at the bottom of the bowl you look at the bottom of the cone there's no Ridge before it goes into the hole that's important if you have that Ridge you get all the tar and everything stuck on there and then you gotta try and scrape it out all the time that's crap it should be a perfect cone into the hole if it's a perfect cone into the hole you can snap every bond low that you smoke if you have that Bowl in effect in that ledge in there then it always gets stuck on there and you never get the nice satisfying snap if you want to satisfying snap get a roar ball now check this out now that I've shown you all the benefits just the ball the downstem and the ball itself finishing the piece hear that sound listen that's that's a real deal and listen no jiggle none zero jiggle this is tight as a drum I'll watch ya put your hand over absolutely no air loss this is a the best-laid bond the best quality absolutely the best so let's give it a try you guys I'm gonna grab some water real quick grab your grab a bulb on a piece something we're gonna smoke this together right hmm sorry about that you guys keep in mind I don't do any editing or any of that stuff these are all just videos that I just do because I like to do this I'm tryna save some people some money and I just think it's fun to spread the knowledge I want everybody to get out so refreshing first bono now here's the other thing that aurora does for you they give you a water fill line now what I mean by water fill line is as you pour the water in here's the bottom bubble there's a two bubbles on here bottom bubble a little bit of bubble egde top bubble that's as high as you want to go you don't want to go above this top bubble but optimum bubble egde and optimum performance is water level right at the bottom bubble okay so you can go up to the top if you want you know you can go as high as you want but for optimum you for it to work the way they intended it put it right below that bottom one and this may not seem like a lot but look when you tilt it that piece this down stem goes all the way to the bottom corner so let's well in the water look it's rips hard now if you want to go all the way up to the top bubble this is as high as I would recommend going like that and go to the top of the bubbles then you get more bubbles if you like more bubbly but you don't need to go any more than that any more than that I mean if you want to but for optimal performance that's why those dots are there okay so we're gonna get that now we got the best bone around the United States the best one you can get my roller by the best company let's see what should we smoke out of here you guys I got some Creole G or dizzy Oh G what do you think can we do a blend of both both so I'll get the fattest knock out of each wanna pull the tip oh no G back on genetics [Music] let the best nag best tip of the best nag of the busy og this brand new golden roar you guys see that go already so it's tested oh yes every pieces a homeless duties damn that was good now usually I don't talk that much out of the three footer Ellen's really good yes oh man so if you get a chance you guys it is definitely worth the money you don't have to get the gold but just get a roar any roar okay I recommend the beaker or the straight shooter get it at least two feet long or longer huh I guarantee it'll be the best bomb that you've ever had promised pumped alright see you guys on the next one late", "ThcihuZNPo0": "good morning cannabis world this is Matt coming at ya from dr. greenthumb head shop well we're going to be looking at the roar bomb today another review

ball so how much [ __ ] is done", "h6p0YDldXVM": "it's literally taking everything out of me to not just grab this thing bust out with my grinder and just start packing this thing up I want to smoke this [ __ ] so bad what's going on guys so today is the day we're finally unboxing the Kanban this is the daily high club air con collaboration for February but we're unboxing it in April because I got this box hella late and I just kind of been sitting on it for a little bit I had that hippy Butler box I want to go ahead and unbox it we already did and that we're finally getting on to this like I really know what's in here for the most part but I've never actually seen it myself like in person personally so the box is actually a lot smaller than I thought it was gonna be it's slightly bigger than the old rollers club from a hippie Butler right here but you know good things come in small packages right all right there we go it's open what'd you guys get the first peek at this man majima I got [ __ ] falling you know what that is just not going to work so I'm pretty much is going to start from the top and work my way down right here first up we got a sticker says 420 on it's a daily high club sticker it's got Ben Franklin he's smoking a joint you know what it is it's a sticker you stick it on [ __ ] you got another sticker right here this is another daily high club sticker and it's got the roses on it I don't know if that's specifically for the Eric on with the tattoos and everything but it's a pretty cool sticker nonetheless I've got like a stockpile of stickers now oh cool we got some [ __ ] daily high club socks right here now this is actually the first time I've ever gotten any kind of clothing from any of these subscription boxes and I do like one thing you guys might not know about me I love like socks hats and sunglasses that's like my [ __ ] right there so that's pretty much what I collect so I can always use another pair of socks man and their white long socks like come on man moving on we got a raw umber door here is that what it is Emperor and bird door right there and this is pretty much just a big-ass [ __ ] raw cone and I believe there's just one in here yeah look at that manage ammo right there just a big [ __ ] joint and that's pretty much all this thing is get the spark that bad boy up when this quarantine is over I've been like conserving like hella hard lately so this is probably the last thing that I'm going to pack up right now but as soon as this quarantine shits over this is what we're gonna burn this bad boy down alright so moving on we got some true hemp brand sticky gelato flavoured hemp wraps right here give you guys a nice swindle of it right here never had anything from true hemp personally I don't think there's any I don't think there's any tips in here it's just the two hemp wraps and it's a gelato flavor hopefully it's really good I don't know I feel like gelato flavored wraps can either be like really really good or they're going to be like really really bad I'm gonna taste a little like funky and chemical leak we got a lot of actual flavored wraps to go through once I start doing these vlogs and everything like that so that'll be fun moving on we got a pack of raw black king sized papers right here now rub blacks are really good because they're like a really thin paper so this is this is the these are the papers you use or here if you have a really really good butt and you really want to taste your Terps and get that nice flavor do draw blacks or like the way to do it I love them and it's cool that I got these because I'm actually like running out of my uh king-sized roadblocks I got like the one in a quarters but still you know next up we got something really cool this is a raw Hydra stone right here and I've been wanting one of these for a little bit and they're relatively inexpensive but for some reason I just never really pick them up so this is made out of clay and what you do I believe is you take this bad way out right here there's a clay stone just like that it says we're all right there and you soak this in water for like five minutes and you take it out let it I think you let it sit for a second and then you go ahead and you put it with your bud and everything like that your stash and it's supposed to keep it nice and fresh this is what they used to use back on the ships when they were bringing tobacco into them when they were traveling long distances with tobacco and that would pretty much just keep everything nice and fresh and moist and stop everything from drying out and I've never actually used one of these personally but I've heard a lot of good things about them and we'll have to test this out I got actually HR right now it's getting a little a little crispy we're gonna go ahead and throw that in there see if we could like bring that [ __ ] back to life next up we got a clipper lighter right there it's a lighter you guys know what it is and it's actually a really cool design on this one yeah it's like a little skull going on there oh we got some more glass right here this is a daily high club one-hitter you see if you guys get a nice look at that right there this light is like hella bright so I like its Kathy it's got the Rasta color it's not really a big fan of the Rasta colors but I feel like it's kind of cliche on pieces but at the same time you know what it's a personal preference and it doesn't really take away from the functionality of this it seems like a pretty thick one-hitter it's nice and deep one-hitter as well I think this is more like consider like a taster bat more so than anything right there and it also comes in it's nice its own little do doop tube right here so it's a multi-purpose you could throw in there I'll throw that somewhere else so you just use it and throw that back in there if you don't want to break it if you're not careful about your [ __ ] like I am next let's move on to the grand finale I'm gonna open the bolt piece first because that's what I have in my hand and there it is it's a nice green Bowl piece right there it's I think it's a 14 millimeter stem the main attraction it's actually looks a lot smaller than I thought it was gonna be but I don't have a problem with that as you guys know I like me some small rings there it is the pecan bong right there the collab from the man himself that is so [ __ ] cool I see if you guys can see this you got the daily high club logo right here you got the money roses on the side got the big rose right here so right here you got the main piece you got a little tiny airflow hole right yeah it's gonna pump bring down just a little bit of smoke into the water and then you got a long stem right here that goes it's straight down and it's got a four cut perk on it we're in the Bob just a little guy right there it's like two slits on each side one two one two and that's pretty much it it's just a nice a little bubbler no if you want to call this a bomb I feel like this is would be just like a bubbler I mean it's pretty small not going to lie I thought it was gonna be a little bigger than that and also right there you got the signature the Huracan right there I thought it was gonna be a little bigger but I'm not even mad like this is [ __ ] cool I really like it a lot and honestly for the most part this is probably going to be sitting on a shelf somewhere I also like that it's a straight flat beaker as well not a rounded one like not that there's really any difference in them I just prefer the beaker ones over the round ones the detail put into this is really nice and the color just really pops on it I'm actually like I'm pretty impressed with it I like it a lot that's it that's the first that's the aircon collaboration this is actually my first daily high club box we got another box that's actually on the way right now it should be here in a couple days we got another hippy Butler box to unbox and then we got the other videos coming out with all that being said daily high club this was like I think this was $40 I bought it so long ago don't hold me to it I definitely think it's worth it I don't know if you could still get these I I know the box sold out for a little bit and then it had some problems with the virus and everything getting out to people I do know that people are getting replacement pieces if they're broken so they might have a stockpile of them or they might just be like just just have an X amount they're just helping people out that you know it broke I you might be able to still get it on their website I'm not posting any links or anything like that but you guys can go check it out for yourself daily high club and that's pretty much it if you enjoyed this video be sure to give it a thumbs up and I'll see you guys next time", "96OEwURYC-U": "this is your boss skinnet speaking on the scanner train to rainbow city sit back relax a joke put on your dancing shoes [Music]", "SCnCheMg3BI": "what's good YouTube welcome to the pyaar life's 30-second how-to video I'm Nick and today I'm going to be showing you how to make another bull piece for your bong if you haven't seen our previous videos check the links in the description check the links at the end of the video or just check out our page in general you'll find our videos there what you're gonna need for this build is some tape some scissors and depend now this pen is it's very key that this the end of this pen is metal if it's not no it's not gonna work you're gonna need a metal ended pen you know metal pen and to check this you'll just run your flame up against your pen and if it doesn't melt obviously it's metal it's good to go now and then last the last part of this is going to be some aluminum from a can now we've just cut this out a nice little rectangle a few inches by by a couple more inches is a good way to say it you know I don't know how exact it is because I didn't measure it you got to a you know measure for your bong don't make it too long or it's not gonna fit in there you're gonna have to roll it up a bunch of times don't make it too you know long this way or it's not gonna fit in your bong it's gonna be out here it's gonna be too short you know measure so it fits to your to your bone and now start it off you're just gonna roll it up into a tube it doesn't have to be super precise just make sure that it's gonna fit into your bong now obviously I have my bone right here no we're gonna have to tighten that up possibly even cut it down we're gonna kind of cone out one edge and see if that that'll get her done for us and it looks like it will so we're gonna tape her up and make sure you tape the end that isn't going to be against you know your your bowl which is obviously gonna be this end so there we go we got the the main down stem of it it's a little wide but it's gonna get the job done now you're gonna come in and you know we could maybe even cut this down actually just kind of take rigger let's let's let's bring it down a bit so it's not as high and it's okay if it gets a little bendy because obviously it's not going to be the most air tight in the world and we could go around this little ledge and make it a little bit more airtight I could already see we're a little little hole is and then we're gonna take the end off our pen like I've done I kind of did that without saying it sorry and you're basically gonna position it in there to where it's gonna work so I like to bend it until it's at a nice point and then kind of round the edges off you might be able to get it to sit in there but I'm gonna use a little bit of tape just to keep it in place which I don't recommend obviously this entire thing isn't gonna be healthy for you use it a couple times partial personal hard times and then you should be good to go so we'll put a bit of tape on this and hopefully that'll get the job done okay we'll get another piece going around this other edge try to keep the tape as low as possible obviously don't want it coming in contact with [ __ ] bend this down a bit we might even be good with it at the tape I think I got it BAM look at that that's what I was going for is it being in there like that and you're pretty much good to go we will throw a little bit around the bottom here just to give it a bit more air tightness we're good and we're good to go now that you got your nice nice little bull piece set up job easily isn't gonna be for the massive estas but you're just gonna pack a little bit in there and hit it up it was a nice little toke there you know what I'm saying and you could probably clear the way if not just use like a bob and pin2 Jim Jam through that [ __ ] is what I recommend like I said if if this is

this isn't cheeps one this is he keeps one I could have gotten one for I don't know I am hitting for the plastic second ya know third because second one got plugged up separating the counts because the bullet came with its crap did not come with a clip so you have to be careful with pulling out that down stem along with the pole at least it's not a shitty one piece I hate those okay other hand

profession, you just gotta work safe. I don't think that there are too many glassblowers who ever sit down behind the torch without indulging first. I've been blowing glass and advancing the cause of better bongs since 1981. most younger glass blowers are not of the impression that their inventions are worth protecting. When it became apparent to me that bongs are starting to incorporate a lot of fancy laboratory seals I got to be thinking 'hey, why try to make a bong look like it belongs in a laboratory? Why not take an actual piece of laboratory apparatus and turn it into a bong?' Since the 1940s the standard operating procedure in chemistry laboratories, if the object of the day is to scrub a gas with a liquid, has been to use a gas washing bottle which consists of a fritted disc. I took it upon myself to make some molds and make some fritted discs and when I created the first fritted disc and used it in April of 2011 I was genuinely surprised how well it worked. My eyes kinda rolled back in my head and I was like 'oh my god this is the best bong hit I've ever had' by like a whole quantum level and I'm like I need a patent attorney. Got my Rooster Apparatus Fritted disc perc It's so smooth. The paraphernalia industry has been the bulk of my income for the last 40 years, really. It was my first bong hit that set me down the course that I follow that was really what changed my life."}
