being said guys let's just go ahead and get this Grape Ape soda so I've been trying dying to try this one now my dumb ass should have looked up the percentages before I started but here it is guys you guys can see all the information there it's all plug and play is all the same just government warnings letting you know how think they are the ingredients and all that so there it is guys let's go ahead and take it out the box these boxes are a little hard to take off man he's got to squeeze the side and you push push just like that huh plug and play take it all the way out it's let's play okay if you guys haven't seen the back of the tank you guys like to rock it like this personally I'm not a fan of hats like this but it to each their own kill me right there just take this little baby out the box already oh we plug in play focus up focus up and let me touch my phone oh there's the focus there's our oil the higher quality sheesh y'all gonna start flipping your carts around that bubble

right off the bat great great flavors not even gonna lie reminds me of that great exotic car from year back wanna learn guys it's hot out here whoa let me know where you guys are it's burning up in LA right now after a lot of rain [ __ ] there's hot boys all right now for the medical patients review oh so right off the bad guys I'm stoned I'm high this gets you stoned as hell oh now what kind of stone is is I'm feeling like a hybrid I'm feeling like I'm feeling the hybrid because I am kind of relaxed but also like the colors have changed I'm outside the trees are [ __ ] greens hell the sky got blue I mean it was already blue but just high just like gives me that you know that GTA 5 when Franklin gets high in this life that's how I feel right now everything's just vivid and bright so it's probably a little bit of sativa but I'm also relaxed and just chillin right here Dan give another hit these pot systems activate fast I would recommend totally fine especially if you like [ __ ] hitting fat Dan this is perfect guys but if you're not into smoking a lot or if you can't handle a lot don't get a plug in play there are a super potent super powerful and super bummed that you're just gonna keep hitting it as far as like hitting this like you know public environment you probably will get scary high I'm not gonna lie but it's if you need to be somewhere important if you're just in public getting high you [ __ ] cares but let's keep hitting this oh [ __ ] sorry strong I said potent powerful vivid colorful details kind of a little bit euphoric you can say Dan it's nothing bad I can say about this overall plug-and-play besides that it's too strong for some people and that's the only bad thing is too strong for some people and it's too strong for me I don't think I could take a blinker I mean I could but oh my god hmm that means there guys it's Lear I didn't mean to make a long ass video there it is I'm done ight yeah great babe [ __ ] my showing it's 4/20 summer guys you guys take care I'll see you guys in the live stream in about five minutes peace guys", "LG_YIuQJsAA": "you do what up Instagram without we have D carved wax break their shatter a couple drops of this right here great ape from swag terpenes literally I'm going to put a couple drops make sure you shake very well to be honest with you I didn't use enough liquidizer these were super thick and it ended up with problems in the long run in seconds and I'll be right back straight up sorry [ __ ] was way too thick wouldn't come up through none of this so I had to literally just stick the end in there and that's what happens when you don't use enough liquidizer I made it way too thick that's why it is doing this you want to get high though don't you exactly never never never add some thick stuff all right in the garbage okay they came out with two nice-looking swag terpene cartridges nice and clear almost like an L or Clark oh I've never had this much problem though this average ever it's just when you make them so thick like got to just don't want to cooperate [Music] tastes extreme can't beat you guys Rock that wasn't paint an ass today but usually smart bling-bling [Music]", "uXXOZGYsvAk": "I know that they want to do other [ __ ] I've been doing but they cannot do it I went to my city my gang rollin with me no time to stop we keep what's good YouTube it is your man the ganja God ganja vape Hill once again we're a brand new video but for all my continued followers supporters and subscribers with that notification bill turned on y'all already knew that I hope you all are having a fantastic a great day beautiful day today yet again we will be checking out another smart card mainly because I'm trying to see if I can find something that comes close to these exotic editions that they had unfortunately I can't find anything that is closer to them oh well no matter today we are going to be looking at the indica that I've been trying to get for a while Grape Ape and the percentages are 88% TAC and 0.05 ghz s CB s-- 0.08 cbn for anyone who wants to know and here is the carped and look at that flower and this here is a full cart just like the exotics so what we'll test No all right I got it screwed on and as I said it is a full car so there's literally no bubble that I can do a test for and this is how I would like to see every car just full I mean everyone every card has a gram in it but just seeing that little bubble just makes you feel a little short you know it's like it's like buying a three bag 3.5 grams and you always get an extra nugget in there every time when you buy but then one time when you buy your one nugget short you're not gonna go back to the guy and say hey you shorted me an UGG because it weighs out 3.5 hell with that extra nugget you probably weighed out for but you're not going to go back and eggs for fries anyway enough about all of that let's do our last honorary of the double dream even though we can see it's a roach and still has some insight okay yeah see double dream double dream is a hybrid but it hits like a sativa it just hits like a sativa to me but yeah y'all not here for double dream y'all here for Grape Ape cheers a palm for stripping it tastes like purple punch mix with gorilla blue which is honestly what I was thinking eight normal oh great purple but yeah it has a nice taste I swear that purple and that gorilla will just complement each other so well like the flavors are literally fusing and mixing in my mouth over and over again it's kind of weird it's plain it's like it's like Goku Vegeta doing the fusion dance but because this like I could almost sort of kind of really feel them mixing and flowing it's that powerful dude it was 88 yeah and this double dream came out to be 86% and then the one I had before that I believe was glue keys but yeah give me a little bit on us and now we're back with an analysis I'm stumbling over my words give me a minute with this and I'll be back with an analysis so I said on this war bit if I have not said anything yet and you didn't read it for how much I had it on screen this is a indica if I can get it clear yeah this is an indica and it feels exactly like it I'm in a real chill mode don't necessarily feel sleepy but now I really start to feel that indica exploding over the back of my eyeballs just a real calming calming euphoric feeling I feel like maybe if I bumped a voltage up I might get a more desirable effect out of it but what I'm trying to do is be more conservative so I don't drink down so much in a day taste is consistent as I've said it taste like grape Gorilla Glue and poke lunch starting to get some bubbles it's a fund from the bottom and over time they'll evolve into one cap up here if I had to rate this I will rate this a seven because indicas as I've said hold together holding together excuse me because in the Kosovo as I've said before really only just puts you in a state of chill or sleep this one this one has put me in chill and I'm not against it I don't hate it I actually like it I just feel like it's lacking a little bit that might just be the CVD honestly because that's at a 0.05 but at the same time for double dream it's a point O three if it'll get it correctly there we go it's a point O 3 so if I had to rate these two side-by-side double dream was smack grape Apes underwater in my opinion that's just because double dream is a hybrid and it has some sativa in it but as I said guys it had me in a state of chill and right now I'm just getting the munchies out of this world literally just woke up said alright let's shoot this video I finally got great great I want to test it out did not know Grape Ape was an indica did not know was gonna give me the munchies this fast Grape Ape what have you done to me anyway let me know down in the comment section below how Grape Ape has made you feel and oh my shirt yeah it's a nice shirt I know I'm of course wearing my divine

effects relieving I get my relaxed feeling whatever and also those hybrids and it is intended for tunas whatever they're on point whatever yeah the Carver's with everything I sure wouldn't make a big cloud grab that circle do it like okay the flavor isn't overpowering on this one it definitely is very settled very smooth but if you take a big hit and you're here I want to say with these whatever you want to keep it at a medium to like lower not too high that's what I want to say be careful how you put down on these carpet because they're very big if you put it too high you're in the coffee your lungs out whatever it is smooth but you know to a certain point if you put it too hard it's gonna it's gonna make you coffee but yeah this is very very nice flavor you definitely get like a subtle great as a gorilla in the back of the great bait Wow Wow tastes really really good it's awesome yeah guys that definitely love this I love this company guys like they make I don't think I've checked our flour yet I probably have to do that too definitely very very nice our I mean very very nice cards whatever they're on my top three karts whatever may be one of my favorites for sure I

bit five dollars would be nice but it is what it is you guys [ __ ] rock like subscribe and leave a comment", "VF4S_uBSLx0": "what's up guys do me for 20 here today I'm not gonna be smoking the tree I do have some but I am in my bedroom and I don't want to skink up but I will be smoking on this heavy-hitters wax cartridge I got the Grape Ape this one was $50 but holding up sound there's $50 at the dispensary um I've a brass knuckles battery and usually for one gram of brass knuckles it's one gram per brass knuckles cartridge is $60 this one was fifty I didn't I didn't expect it I thought it was gonna be $60 also yeah let's open this up it says one gram high potency solvent 'less the [ __ ] that means for medical use only intended for intended for use by adults 21 and older okay I reach of children and animals yeah let's go ahead and open this somehow I just got this in the mail the manly mailman literally just came I actually um I bought it online at the dispensary he's like I didn't know you could do that like the one I have here you can't really just go online they don't didn't ask for a car they didn't ask for nothing they're me just they didn't ask for a [ __ ] thing all right so you first open it you have this little carrying thing that sits in like that right there's the cartridge on the bottom here you have a plastic cap that you got to pull off it's just hold it's just protects the threads well I can already taste that shape and then so that is a little bit quickly here yeah there's just a little booklet thing heavy-hitters I think it's just like some Facebook [ __ ] and it's just like that's pretty [ __ ] cool though oh all the strains it shows all the strings so you know what strength you can ask for a strain next time you go that's pretty sick you can buy them in one gram or 2.2 grams hundred bucks for 2.2 grams probably yeah that's pretty cool back in the box see I'm going to put that cartridge on my battery come on let you guys tell you guys what the flavor is I've never had grape eat before so I don't know what to expect [ __ ] this thing I'm keeping this though look yeah this is dope I'm not gonna put this back in the box if you skip throw this away I'm gonna do what I want this little heavy hitters it's just like flimsy as cardboard but I could probably make a crush out of that [ __ ] definitely gonna keep the packaging so I can talk to some button there sometime or something throw this [ __ ] in there alright so yeah let me put this on my battery heavy-hitters great eight it is indica go ahead and put this on my last cartridge you guys like loosen it before it to work yeah I see my last one wasn't like this I'll show you guys this one was the the blueberry and this is a brass Nichols this one was $60 this is the brass knuckles I don't know if you can see the logo on there little brass knuckles but this was the brass knuckles and when I got it it was about halfway full and a month later it ran out but this one if you can hear it's on all the way and goes you can hear that but for some reason with this one and I got it like this if you put it on all the way and it does not suck at all it's literally super hardest but you had to like twist it off a little bit and you're barely lucky if you can get any it's still [ __ ] kicked ass though oh yeah I'll put this one on and let the battery warm up a little bit click it five times turn on warm it up oh you hear that sizzle yeah that [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire oh whoa I can't take big dabs it hits my lungs before it hits anything else so it's really [ __ ] harsh and a [ __

orange is orange potentially manna tangerine is orange but it's a [ __ ] okay hey was that my plug play got a paper now this is much more than a baby pen this that grape soda can I hit it honestly bro you gotta crawl before you walk I don't know if you're ready for something like this it packs a big punch there stop playing oh man who'd have a plan before thank you for you can do this look man I told you you could handle it thing suit a max", "Vaeye7F_AHQ": "welcome to the show this is ice thought images coming at you with another vape cart review this one's from presto this one is zoodles so I can only assume that the sticker on the back that I'm gonna show you in a second is because of the vitamin e acetate recalls to where they had to recheck everything I'm trying to associate that with that otherwise I don't see any reason why there's like three to four stickers on this thing so I'm gonna read what it says on it but I as I tried to peel up some of the other stickers it just started ripping and peeling so I couldn't read what was underneath it um but lab taste the lab test date is two twenty four twenty production date is six 21 19 so you gotta figure this is eight months old it's eighty one point five nine percent it's got the transfer numbers as testers provide a mini acetate psi tabs labs tested past sorry jumbled up my words right there but I don't see if you can make that out but there's like four little pieces that go up you know so as I said I tried to feel to see what it said underneath there was some other batch test numbers I was trying to see if the THC number had changed like they decided to ramp it up but it says immediate effect lasts two to three hours 510 threads 3.7 volts THC distill it and curated turps tells you how to connect the battery wait 30 seconds between hits so I'm going to assume so you don't roast out the coils too quick but on the front of this it says happy and relaxing with flavours of sweet fruits and berries so happy and relaxing I'm going to assume that this is an indica dominant hybrid just I forget I've looked it up before I just can't remember I will put it in the description so that you guys can you guys can see that once again the open dog besides let the magic again and then you've got this enormous box for that tiny little thing right there there we go so same thing you got your heating element slash threat protection and then you basically got your mouthpiece condom sits out we're gonna dry hit it it's been a minute since I actually did this part because most of them don't seem like they're moving at all really got a big bubble but the bubble still not moving so it's a slightly darker oil not super dark but no darker then you know the live rosin that I had only by a couple shades just nothing like super drastic like this is almost pitch black why that one's like a nice golden like we're gonna crank on my own a pair uni pro we're gonna crank that out to the 3.7 that it's set on the box drag it and move on sweet berries for sure on the initial drive over okay I didn't even even have that on please so here we go very tasty I have to see how the effects and the high that I get from it but very tasty the flavor profile is exactly how maybe not exactly but how I prefer my weeds and [ __ ] throw them with a nice fruity berry flavor oh excuse me I'm gonna sneeze again tickle your nose so two for two I'm gonna say that this is good feel it through here initially maybe a tiny bit here but that's probably from the the sneezing and the sneezing I was gonna say coughing but I didn't really cause um yeah definitely digging it this is probably not my favorite cart that I've had recently I've been drawing a blank on which one it was you know you're really digging that one you know this is about presto just one of my favorite cards I'm not unfortunate but unfortunately for presto is through platinum vapes and then I got big gasp right here so trying to branch out try more companies my buddy's got some lore or one law or klore or some [ __ ] like that not claw clear I don't know Allah I'm gonna see if I get my hands on one of those maybe today or tomorrow just so I can at least try that brand even though I'm sitting on a couple cards right now just with all this coronavirus crap you know stock up get what you need and as I stated in a previous video if you're someone that uses this for strict medicine because you absolutely 100% need this [ __ ] get out there and get it I'll talk to your local guy and see if they can keep you supplied during this time because otherwise if they close down the dispos I hear that they're gonna allow kerbside so that you can get some delivery drivers to just curbside it to you but with that being said only time will tell with that but just free up if you can before any more madness happens to where the whole state is completely shut down there's nothing [ __ ] for you to do other than get gas and food I don't fully see that happening but I didn't foresee I mean this happening you know with h1n1 being [ __ ] sixty point eight million people had it and over I think it was close to thirteen thousand people died from it and that was during the Obama administration and not a single person bad at and I I'm sorry nobody closed anything down nobody gave a [ __ ] SARS was around people were just wearing masks but otherwise nobody gave a [ __ ] now all of a sudden and I don't I'm not trying to get into politics but obviously now Trump's in office people don't like Trump now all of a sudden is this gonna be a political move to where he gets to say uh you know we got the cure he comes out looking like a hero and boom he's in office for another four years I think he's getting in office regardless but is it something like that is it way deeper and a conspiracy aspect or are people just reading into this way too much and it's just to get people to panic by I don't know I'm just one person that has a mind that just tries to think of a lot of different possibilities but my mind typically moves towards the more negative outlook just so when the happy happens it's like [ __ ] yeah it's just that much sweeter but when the negative happens it's like yeah I figured that was gonna [ __ ] happen you know it's not the best way to live but it's not the worst way to leave you those happy moments are just that much more happy which is dope but that's just mourning ramblings littles presto Wittig I could sit around and smoke on this and so far I don't have a real hazy nauseous headachy sick feeling from hitting us like I got from the mitten extracts before the recall and all that [ __ ] so I don't know if there was some stuff in theirs or they were cutting corners or whatever I don't know I just did not like four different strains which is [ __ ] unheard of like if I buy four strains of something else I got four Presto's here and the odds on me hating all four you know it's obviously one in four but it's almost slim to none I'm gonna like one of them usually so I was actually disappointed that I didn't like a single one the flavors weren't good that but not with presto so some of your local dispose would be running these at four 400 you might get lucky and find four buy one for a penny or five for 100 you know any anything like that but they are running deals on press DOS I just hate presto I don't understand why you have such a big [ __ ] box but I'm not the marketing person and I'm not you know I'm not pushing your company I'm just saying from a perspective like this that's big enough boxes it is this is just thinner but super wide so you just got all this open space like you could you could turn around and sell these in a three to four to five pack deal so you go to the disco they've got this and it's an assorted pack so you're gonna get it you know you're gonna get these you're gonna get the Sour Diesel the Blue Dream the GG for the gelato you know and you can have them all in a flavor pack at a set price so you're running for 400 as it is say you throw all six in there okay six for 156 / 160 you know something like that I would prefer a round the 130 mark but I understand you still gotta make profit and blah blah blah like you're also you boom here's an all sorted so people are gonna buy the assorted packs you know you just got to figure out how deep your profit margin needs to run well but that being said presto thank you for some some quality products I did a video on Sour Diesel yesterday I just didn't put it up yet so by the time this one goes up that one should be up and get out there and get it zoodles it's really good any of the other information I will put in the description below so like hit my logo like right here sob hit the bell for future content and comment below and let's chitchat I don't know peace out enjoy the rest of your day and I'll catch you in the next one", "mow5rk0y6i8": "[Music] so what is going on everybody welcome back to the channel pines trees a 21 and over medical cannabis review channel out of the state of pennsylvania how's everybody doing today i know i say this a lot you guys are probably getting sick of it but got something crazy special on the table today uh diamonds and sauce i mean it's always a good day when diamonds and sauce comes across the table and it's especially a good day when moxie drops diamonds and sauce so we got a full gram tahoe oh g diamonds and sauce and oh my goodness this stuff terpy terpy terpy terpy it is slap city it it is crazy so tahoe og always has boasted um flavors of grape like grape throughout as far as like you know it's in it's in the description of the flower basically but like i've had plenty of the tahoe og in the past and like it's always real fire and it always tastes really great but i always like my personal like palette could never really pinpoint or find the grapeiness in like the sand or like the the batter you know so like it always tasted fire but i always i always lacked that that hint of grape that they always boast about in the description well let me tell you what the diamonds and sauce has the grape in it it's got that grapeiness it's freaking amazing and it's got that sweet o.g and it's just this one is really strong really really strong so let's get into it um we're gonna talk about it it looks super crazy good it had some boulders in it some sometimes you'll get diamonds and sauce and it'll be like more like sugar and sauce this stuff had literal freaking diamonds like rocks you could put in a ring you'll see it on the close-up this one is special i kept one of the rocks in it in full form so you guys could see like the biggest chunkiest chunkiness rock that came in it but like they were real formed diamonds really nice so let's get into it thc 4.0 percent thc a 81.38 cbga 1.02 percent cbg 0.5 percent and delta 8 thc 0.17 percent for a total cannabinoid profile of 87.37 87 doesn't sound crazy right it's like average you know high 80s low 90s this hit like it was high 90s or it does hit every time i've smoked it so far it has just slapped me like this stuff is strong so let's get into the look of it let's get into the smell smells amazing smells super sweet tiny super gassy it's like tiny gassy funky sweet sweet og like it smells awesome so we can't do much from here so you guys come on over here all right all right let's get into it so smell is amazing um i wouldn't say it's like florally although it is very piney so i guess that is kind of floral pines or trees so yeah it's kind of it's got that it's got a sweet sweet smell to it super pretty to look at check this out this stuff is just chirp heaven chirpy mcturp sauce oh look at it look at that giant look at that giant that thing is huge probably gonna crack that in half and smoke half of it in this video maybe even crack it in half do twos two rips smoke the whole thing i don't know if i can handle it though i'm gonna tell you something about this right so this is this is my story as far as the taco of g goes right pick this up two days ago at the dyspo i was like yeah diamonds and sauce i gotta get it i know i've done tahoe og before as far as review but diamonds and sauce always special always special so i had to pick it up so as i'm sure most of us know when we smoke right when you get nice and lit up you get the munchies you eat food after you eat food you come down right that's like order of operations everybody knows that order of operations smoke eat come down right so i got this stuff i i brought it home i ripped a fat dab right so i was like oh you know i want to try it out i want to get a feel for it flavor through the roof but not only flavor through the roof i was lit like lit right super just medicated zero pain could probably play the sax phone all day if i needed to this hand felt awesome uh so got the munchies right went and picked up tacos right got three tacos big big fat tacos with carnitas in it freaking like authentic like three brothers there's a spot i don't know if you're in this part of pa but you should look it up best tacos you'll ever get right so i ate these tacos right i i house these tacos right and i'm sitting there after like usually after i eat it's it's it's time to smoke again it's always how it goes i get stoned sit around for a little bit enjoy myself get the munchies come down sit around for 15 minutes it's time to smoke again right natural lord of operations i was still ripped off my ass after i ate these tacos i'm talking like three chunking big ass tacos just filled with meat and just you know just the works right the kind of thing that would make you eat your highway you know because that's what you do you eat your highway well this stuff you're not eating this highway i'm telling you right now i ate my ass off and i was still just as ripped after the meal as i was before the meal i like literally i sat down i was like all right i just ate a meal i'm gonna sit down and chill i was like it's it's time to smoke again and then i thought about it and i was like wait a minute i'm super ripped still like it it took me a second to even process the fact that like i was still super duper stoked so this stuff is strong it takes a lot to get me high to the point where i'm gonna stay stoned after i eat a huge meal so like i don't know if it's the terps in this one i don't know if it's like i don't know what it is i'm pretty sure it's the entourage effect of everything but this is a bad mama jama this one is one that i would highly recommend if you're looking for something strong it's gonna stick with you it's gonna like really just put a hurting on you because sometimes that's what you need you just need it to be like that strong strong medicine this is it i don't know if it's because of the sauce because it's diamonds and sauce i don't know if it's like super chirped out actually i do know it is super turfed out here's the here's the numbers terps we got nine point five zero percent so almost ten percent terps beta mars coming in at two point four uh limonene at one point one holy crap beta car 3.3 so like this stuff is packed full of terps so i don't know if it's just this particular combination of terps really made the effects last for me but it was some of the most long-lasting like most enjoyable stuff so if you get a chance pick this up this isn't even going to be like a regular review for me this is just we're talking about how good this is i don't even need to tell you this stuff is gonna be a 10 out of 10. if it gets you stoned to the point where you can eat a meal and still be stoned that is that is a winner [Music] so i don't know if this is on the menu as something that they're gonna continually like come out with tahoe g diamonds and sauce but like sign me up i'm on board for it every time you know what i'm not gonna break up that big boy i'm gonna leave the big boy and i'm just gonna i'm gonna scoop it's just a freaking wet chunk some of those terps if i go for that big one it's not going to be terpy enough like a nice even keeled terpy hit so we're going for the for the broken up stuff but yeah terps all day high in thc but the flavor and the amount of lasting of the effects is what really did it for me like we really set it apart from the rest so let's go cheers and let's get it [Music] [Music] uh iron lung in it we don't stop it's for all those west coast guys that don't know how to take big rips come and see me oh yeah so the flavor the flavor is just crazy like i said it's got it's piney it's got a little bit just a little hint with that limonene in there you get a little bit of a lemon lime flavor but you you get like you get this crazy grapey like awesome grape flavor i have no idea where it comes from but it is so good an unexpected [Music] oh so good let's let's read about it a little bit man it's so good like i wish i got two of these honestly hybrid og phenotype relaxing happy uplifting sedating unique due to its delicious aroma uh boasting champagne and mild grape scents see that's what i'm saying i've been reading this forever i have it literally on paper you know like i have the actual like straight from the facility notes and like i always was wondering like man it always says mild grape scents but like i thought maybe there was something wrong with like my palate because sometimes i don't i don't get some flavors like you know people are different everybody tastes different everybody feels a little different so like i thought maybe it was inside of my palette like my palette wasn't uh whatchamacallit uh wasn't refined enough right to taste it like my palate wasn't refined to the point where i was picking up the subtle flavor of the grape it's not subtle in this it's not subtle at all it's freaking delicious grape pine sweet citrus ah it is a good one it is a great one honestly it is a great one and strong effects uh it's a hybrid it says it's a hybrid but like i get i get heavy indica feels off of it especially due to the fact that it left me stoned after i ate like it it was it was real nice it's always fun to get surprised [Music] yeah this stuff is crazy good like so just oh yeah i know it's expensive i i know i know it's not the most expensive though so when y'all are talking about prices just remember it's not the most expensive in the market and in the market that we live in you pay for your quality and you're definitely buying top quality with this this is freaking just top shelf all day every day this is what i would say the definition of top shelf is it is so good i just you know going in for another [Music] so hit me down in the comments let me know what you guys are smoking on if you're smoking along with me let me know where you're from too i know not everybody is from pa i know got a couple people in cali who watch apparently i have a i have a an audience in russia so says my youtube analytics i have a decent crowd of viewers in russia shout out to russia not really sure why you would watch or who it is it's probably just like one person over there watching it shows up in my analytics but it is a region and or country in which my videos get played so whatever oh all right crazy let's talk about it [Music] man i'm about to sneeze all right i'm good so let's get into it uh the gram 100 bucks 100 bucks is steep for a gram if you're going to pay a hundred bucks for a grant or over 100 bucks for a gram some of these people are charging like 60 bucks for a half gram which is crazy um you want to you want to spend your hundred dollar on a gram that's it's worth it you wanna you wanna make sure your money's going towards something that you're not gonna regret buying in the long run and you're gonna feel like because it's literally costs more than gold per hour per ounce or whatever per gram like because of that you know you want to feel like you're getting a good return on your investment so that being said i feel like this one makes me feel like i got i got my money's worth i got i got what i paid definitely and it's top top shelf like good medicine like feel it in your eyes um feel it in the back your head feel it on the top of your head feel it in the places where you had pain that you do not have pain anymore and honestly you're gonna feel it for a good amount of time not just you know a short amount of time and honestly i think that's the difference between live and cured i feel like cured it's good tastes good sometimes and you know the effects are good but they're never as long lasting as the live stuff i always feel like the diamonds and sauce and stuff is just just a little bit better and for some reason dispatch tahoe og really just sticks around so [Music] that being said if you like the videos hit the thumbs up hit that subscribe i'm lit i'm gonna enjoy the rest of my day um big other big news i gotta i bought concentrates yesterday from a company that never had concentrates on the market and they were only 55 bucks a gram and it's really really good like like surprisingly good for the money the flavor is on point the terps are there you guys just get hype get excited the next one is gonna be something nobody's ever seen before i mean the company's been around but only had flour so like think of a company on the market that you've only seen half flour up until this point that you wish had concentrates well that's what the next video is going to be so be on the lookout i'm probably going to film that one tomorrow because you know i want to get a feel for it i'm going to smoke it it's real good um just it's cured and it's it's like a crumble which is always kind of disappointing in the flavor department but not this stuff the stuff has terps so i'm excited to share it with everybody and i'm excited to have you know a new option on the market uh it's always nice to have a cheaper option that way if you want to go heavy one day if you're like i just wanna dab a whole gram today i'm just gonna dab a gram who cares i'm gonna do like quarter gram dabs half gram dabs just gonna go in you wanna do that with something that's gonna be good but not expensive because you don't wanna you don't wanna smoke a hundred dollar gram in one day do you i mean we all want to i wanna smoke five of these in one day but it's not cost effective so sometimes you know you need that that cheap stuff when you want to really throw down and get like crazy with it so that's what the next one's all about so well see what it's what it is and who it is and uh yeah i will see you guys in the next one [Music] peace you", "_VykhQLid1Y": "hey everybody this is a review of the grape ape anp

smell though what about about the same though yeah not too strong on the kiwi probably look at the bubble test though that bubble is not moving at all we're going to see what stray thinks about it i mean that's a pretty good saucy first hit like i said not very strong on kiwi but maybe as just me going into it for the first time big guess i feel you it's not like super strong on the kiwi but i can tell it's different from the other two yes i can i can distinguish them apart like there is distinct differences in these like this one has like more of a bright fruity yeah kiwi almost hard to explain you know what i mean i haven't had kiwis a whole lot so it's kind of let me explain what they taste like the grape tasted very you know had a nice grape and uh what is this it's an indica hell yeah is it an indica man i guess i'm feeling that i'm pretty slumped right now kiwi swirl indica yes instantly got me a little low that's fire for real straight up shout out krt vapes you can go follow them okay our t vapes are pretty dope heck yes make sure and follow us too at the hotbox we're gonna leave it down below my only critique is not enough terps not enough flavor on these yeah if

sauce guys time for sure to get a second saucy it's getting hot in here caught the hotbox i think i'll give the the taste like like a six out of ten i'll give the highlight a good eight because it really smacks it's pretty strong the bubble test is kind of moving a little bit faster now if you can getting warmed up now let us know what kind of vapes you guys have had what flavors y'all had if

sip on some delta 88c lean i even got a like a h-town haircut for it went through all this youtube's still not gonna let us be on there but guys we won't ever start making content i'll be posting here on gp's free game we'll also have videos on legally lifted tx and delta 8 thc library as well as a website coming up so guys stay tuned for more cbd hemp library content appreciate you guys tuning in enjoy the video [Music] all right we are back here on another episode of cbd hemp library and it's another one i'm excited for hell yeah sometimes we get some some very unique products some things that we don't usually get to typically see and they're products that we're usually very excited to do reviews about so today that's we have one of those products absolutely whenever the sprite comes out on the set you know we're in for a special episode and on today's episode we have some more delta eight thc syrup and this is coming from activate company and it's active dash eight pretty dope uh pretty dope word play there no i do like it yeah and they come in these little bottles here that mix of activists and delta eight yeah yeah and what the has the syrup can thing on top to help you out which is a clutch a little measuring cup on top oh each bottle is 50 milligrams so what we're gonna do is we're gonna we have our little cups with ice here we're gonna split each flavor and get our total of 50 milligrams then we're going to chill for a bit we don't know how long we're gonna run some tiger woods pga tour 2011. i believe so i think that's today's selection yeah exactly so we will uh we'll definitely run that and we'll give it a taste test an effects test and um we hope it's fire last time we had the delta alien it was from a different company but it was also it hit yeah so we get two ounces right two fluid ounces two lines yeah i'm thinking two two full cups blinds boat is that what it's called yeah we're in the streets with it all right the seal they definitely kept it authentic hell yeah damn it smells like medicine medical cereal oh yeah like the uh [ __ ] you take when you got a cold oh it's that great flavor so yeah i got the cherry flavor and uh gp got the grape i don't know if i mentioned that i'm starting with cherry i also am ashamed guys don't have styrofoam cups don't have normal bottles but we are working with what we have i know we're probably going to get some comments in there some some judgment but it is what it is i put some of the syrup in there then put some sprite in there and then put some syrup on top because i want to make sure it doesn't also all settle and i have to drink a bunch of syrup you pour a little syrup in there to get the remnants off i mean a little sprite in the cap i'll do that smart i just didn't i just want to make sure it didn't settle all under my ice oh sure yeah mine is mine got trapped in the cup a little i don't know oh but chelsea helped a bit unless you and i are both gonna have to empty it out next i got the uh cherry delta eight thc syrup from activate i got the grape we got the mini sprite cans on deck because we figured we're gonna have to try to watch our calendar quickly and i am on a diet i died of strictly delta eight thc0 [Music] that's delicious that's some real i seem a purple drink that's purple stuff baby that's nice that's something you can really just chill and sip damn that's very nice i got the cherry but really i mean you get a very small hint of the oil being in it but barely grape you get none there's not even a hint of oil in my opinion you'll see when you get to it but that grape is nice and i would say the hint of oil is so minor that it i kind of feel forced even mentioning that it's there i got you but it is it is very very minor it is still there and i'm not even a huge fan of rape in my opinion like not in my opinion my personal preference and like drinks and things like that i never like grape soda but it's not too sweet i was honestly kind of scared that it was going to be too sweet and that's probably also has to do with we just mixed it with a pretty neutral soda we didn't mix it with a soda that has too much sweetener in it you know what i mean because before we mixed it with some like really sweet sodas and the sugar from this and the sugar from the soda combined and it was just way too much made the soda nice and nice pinkish hue mine's a pretty dark purple and i will say something that was uh kind of pointed out to me as i walked out the door today was um because i'm leaving and i tell my wife hey oh we're going to shoot some reviews you know the usual [ __ ] she's like oh are you shooting what are we reviewing today and i was like some delta eight lean she's like what do you mean it's like it's you put it in some sprite and you drink it and it gets you high and she's like yeah and no she was saying that it would be perfect for people who don't who want to go to a party participate in party activities but don't drink alcohol somebody who wants drinking games yeah exactly drinking games like beer pong you know people like my wife she doesn't drink she smokes a lot and he loves edibles loves delta eight so she's like [ __ ] that'll be perfect for me to play beer pong instead of having a drink when i lose drink delta eight i was like [ __ ] especially at this level where it's only about 50 milligrams in the bottle i would say it's fair we'd be playing stat cup and [ __ ] bro we might get cooked oh yeah we'd be cooked but i mean like that's the greatest alcohol too it's really the greatest night of sleep you know you're getting cooked no matter what substance you're drinking yeah yeah it's like perfect for people who don't want to drink alcohol and want to get very very rich [Music] yeah that's rough that's tough that's a that's a tough game to play to be honest i think it could be fun i would say it's a fair penalty in terms of if you're not going to drink there has to be some you have to put something on the line and i think that either like some sort of mixture of delta eight in a liquid would be a fair a fair replacement if i was going against somebody we might have to run some delta eight pong sometime yeah we'll hit up activate and see if that's something that they'd be interested in yeah sponsor some delta eight pong for those who don't drink but enjoy partaking in some thc oh yeah i do think some of mine did settle at the bottom oh no a lot of mine settled i'm starting to get to it right now i'm about to pour a little bit more sprite to be honest yeah but again i'm tasting how sweet it is and it's still not unbearable they did a good job on the taste in my opinion no yeah that tastes delicious i would say it's smooth it doesn't seem to be too much right oh there it is yeah definitely sweet i'm gonna get a little more spider on mine too and they do recommend a little more sprite than we use so or they say your favorite drink so seems to be rash rationed pretty perfectly and the 25 milligrams that is one serving correct yeah 25 and there's two servings in each bottle okay so 50 per bottle this shit's dope i like it it's a cool product and i like how they gave you this to be honest i agree just the added bonus authentic a little bit more authentic and actually easier like if you do want to dose it out because there are some people out there that like 15 milligrams of delta eight can do them like well can have them feeling good especially if it's like a pre-go to bed type of thing to where you just want to drink it and then go to sleep 15 milligrams will help them sleep or something to where you could split it up to even more than just two servings and i mean if you're gonna you're gonna make a whole product based on delta eight thc syrup keeping it at least looking somewhat cool and somewhat authentic it's dope yeah they did a very good job of that the whole all the branding on this is pretty epic i definitely would suggest guys when you get the soda though um do get it in bottle format so you can like mix it in the bottle if you're able to mix in the bottle you can get this perfect yeah get this mix like absolutely perfect the fact that we did in the cups was definitely not the most efficient way but that's just a suggestion for you at home i may try this so i got the vast majority of my cherry down and i will say there's some slight hints of oil throughout but it's never anything too overwhelming the sweetness is right on the money i mean it's pretty much just sugar thc and soda and that's what i would look for in a product like this i wouldn't want yeah because we've had other ones and sometimes they throw in who knows what and this and these are the little chemicals and stuff like that like the other things that to make people more sleepy or to feel melatonin exactly but yeah that was a lot of times with the cbd also because that cbd could give you the relaxation out of the lean but it wasn't going to give you the kick that people want from kind of sipping um so that delta 8 takes care of that for you for sure and something about the liquids hit different too like when it's in liquid form fast yeah i think i might have to clean my cup out yeah take a quick clean intermission we'll be right back all right so now we got the the second round of the d8 i got the grape i'm pulling this sprite in first this time yeah that might help we got these baby ass sprites that's what i'm saying there's some sort of sprite outage or something drought i went to a gas station and a cvs and the gas station was completely out the cvs only had these i guess we don't need the measuring cups yeah for like the second that was going to be way more than the first one yeah that uh got very purple look like pouring oil into the oh oh you heard that sauce walker well this [ __ ] smells like uh movie theater icees oh yeah for sure it's kind of what it tastes like too it's actually a good uh good description i'm not gonna lie i could already starting to i'm starting to feel a little bit from the first that liquid bro yeah the liquid something about the syrup or the however they get into liquid form it just seems to hit quicker go through your system a bit faster so you guys can hear that uh nah that's fire yes this actually is just like icy from the [ __ ] brings me back to the archaic day is when movie theaters existed they arcade archaic days when people would walk around with a club in their hand and dress exactly well that grape is on point too right now this cherry is delicious this grape tastes just like grape soda that's what i was telling you like no it's not even an oil i don't think there's an oil hit in the grape this cherry this is my [ __ ] i can already tell the cherry is my favorite of the two it's close for me i'm gonna have to see a few more sips in but i will i am willing to say that for a cherry profile and a grape profile they both hit the mark hit yeah like whatever your preference is like if you like write better if you like cherry better they both hit and the way i would compare them is it tastes like the popsicles i'd have when i was a kid and you had the cherry popsicle always one of the first grabs great more of a wild card but still hits when you get it yo i there were always just those few kids that fiend for grape that like i felt like took care of the grape yeah no i mean the grape issue i would settle for the grape popsicle but i wouldn't buy a grape i'd rather i'd rather be burning hot i mean i'm reaching blue first time every time i'm probably i'm reaching unless if blue's coconut don't give me that [ __ ] oh no but if blue's like blue raspberry or something like that i don't know what flavor it is but it's blue it's not coconut sometimes it's coconut yeah that's that's a trappist i like the uh like the lime that lime looking one whatever those lime lemon looking ones those are usually my popsicle ones but we got an off white they're like a yellowish whitish color or are you talking about the green ones i like the green ones a lot of the green ones are nice the green ones are okay we can get back to this though everybody's a little off shoot about popsicles but we might need to hit up sprite and tell them they need to get this in there repertoire coca-cola delta h sprite delta eight sprite delta eight cherry sprite we'll be a lot of [ __ ] up people in the street be a lot of high people in the street already are true i'm one of them but there's something nostalgic about grape soda for me and having that taste i think it automatically makes me a little biased to enjoy it a little more i think i might like the grape a little more because every time i take a sip it reminds me when i'll take my bike over to the old walgreens when they first built one near my neighborhood how old are you bro they first built walgreens the first walgreens i remember but i'm outside of my neighborhood there wasn't really much to do on my corner like everything else is a couple miles away and a couple miles here on a bike makes a huge difference when you're 11. so anytime yeah yeah so they were building for months you know constructing nobody really knew what it was and it ended up being a cvs actually not a walgreens so i'd always bike down there get skittled grape soda and whatever other pointless snack that i didn't need to eat so it brings me back to that with every sip of the delta a thc syrup i get a little closer to my 11 year old self riding my bike to go get skittles i got strangely close to another sad florida story did it i mean half of florida man's stories end pretty tragically but not not this one i i did end up getting that bike stolen we'll end it there i'm dead i would say all in all both products seem to be very well executed granted we still got to wait for the the official effects test which we will we'll drink these down let them settle a little bit more and then as far which flavor is your favorite i think i'm gonna go grape just barely but they're both to be honest and it's just because i prefer the grape profile in general i'm gonna go i'm gonna go cherry it tastes like if y'all want a flavor profile it really does taste like a cherry icy like i'm trying to go put this on the blender i see out of this oh that would be nice guys thc slushy i'm over here thinking yeah very nice so do we want to finish them both right now do you want to chug them down play a game of i don't want to chug them so we'll sip on them for a little bit off camera and we'll be back to give you guys the the official rotation did we want to give a taste number for each one i wasn't going to i just was going to say what we preferred because they're both good flavors yeah like they're both on the same level it's just subjective preference after that in my opinion i agree they're both exactly what you'd look for in a product like this yeah it's gonna it's hopefully it gets us as lifted as they feel like they should and um they taste delicious so but we'll let you guys know in about 30 minutes oh yeah well that the lean's starting to settle in a little bit i will say i'm chilling dude it is settling in a bit it isn't like delta 8 typically it doesn't find me anywhere near the overwhelming stage of high but yeah definitely relaxed i would say i would definitely say it's for the person in my opinion that 25 milligrams can get feeling right because of the amount of soda you're forced to drink if you're not a soda drinker or a juice drinker or something like that um the amount of sugar you're forced to drink if you do want to do the whole bottle at one time it is a lot it's a lot to if if you're not used to drinking that much sugar that much soda you get what i'm saying 100 yeah that's that would be my one the one drawback is that it is an exclusively niche product yeah like you're gonna do you're it's for uh every now and then type of occasion i do like the drinking games idea though yeah yeah definitely that's that's i think a great use case for it is you don't feel like getting drunk but you still want to be pretty lit it's a perfect in between and um they got the measuring cup on there and already so you could even keep track of how many milligrams you've had yeah for sure and i'm pretty sure if you take it as a shot it might it might not taste that great like alcohol it would even give you the uh maybe i guess the rhythm we're just taking a shot of and how this tastes for you but yeah overall i'm i'm pleased with the with the effects it definitely has that relaxed delta feeling like sergio was saying without being too overwhelming um it was a nice relaxing sip it would be something nice to chill watch a movie with your friends with your significant other whoever it is just sip on this and just kind of let your your night mellow away if you will yeah exactly it's that's actually a good a good use case for it too it'd be nice to throw in a soda when you're sitting and watching a movie maybe having some popcorn yeah it's just medicated for sure maybe the butter on the popcorn could be medicated too yeah it depends what you're getting into but yeah overall it is a very niche product i would say that's its only drawback maybe a little bit of the sugar as well but it's executed perfectly you know if you're getting this you know what you're getting right exactly you're getting some because even if you got the regular lean like that [ __ ] sweet that's been making it just fat for like 20 40 years at this point you know so um this stuff is it's a good product overall and if you're in the market for delta eight lean i wouldn't have any marks against it any job my one wish would be that it was a 100 milligrams per bottle 100 milligrams they might have it available right and that's just because i'm an edible fiend and i get a lot of these things so sure so that's just me personally yeah but very well executed if you're in the market for delta eight lean this definitely gets the cbd hemp library stamp of approval and they do have some dope ass cups in the shipping process they got dirty so we decided not to use them but they have some really cool activate um styrofoam cups as well dope logo on there oh yeah the whole setup is dope this is this is a very well executed delta athc lean right i feel great i'm not overwhelmed uh we're running the tiger woods pga tour 2011 and it's been a fierce competition thus far yeah we went back and forth on here each night each nine so more than anything we appreciate you are we giving overall graders it just i mean i think it's a stamp of approval for me because it's no comparison for real yeah exactly like the last lien we tried was nice this lien is very very nice um definitely a product that i would suggest to people um if they were looking for delta lean we get hit up about delta eight lean a lot actually so i'm excited to do this video to give you guys a second option absolutely so we got this delta lean we got check out our old content for the other videos definitely checked out check out activate delta 8 t8 syrup we got the grape and cherry flavor both get the

these chil all these chill brands uh so far that i found man all have the potency of about an 8.5 or nine compared to maybe uh if you put uh delta farms at a ten and that's usually what i'm comparing to until something you know moves them off the top uh the chill plus is probably about an eight foot five or nine and that's all their carts all the way across but here's the cool thing about these chill plus carts and i'll make sure i put a link for diamond cbd out on the bottom these carts are a little bit more expensive than vape hole supplies but if you're in it for like the flavor this is where it's at man i don't know what the deal is with these um with these cards that they have uh with maple i mean with um with diamond cbd and these chill plus but these have got to be other than the blue dream uh and that's possibly because i had such a huge um expectations for them high expectations for them um and that may be the case excuse me but every one of these uh cards man it's got the best flavor like you vape these carts and what happens is a lot of times you'll you'll vape them and then you put them down um and after a while you just don't get the flavor anymore it's not the case with these chill you know these chill brand cards now these children carts you get the same flavor every time this grape ape has got like a um like a great taste down in your throat really good pull um i haven't had two haven't had hardly any issues with their carts i had one or two issue uh with one or two of them they were kind of plugging up the middle you feel like it's restricting the air but not unplugged all in all the chill plus carts are really good um i haven't had any complaints about them other than like i said the blue dream not holding up to the other blue dreams previous to that because like i said canada river blue dream has been my favorite previous to that um so you know pleased to be getting you know gorilla glue from from delta farms but um uh these cards man they all have the best flavor out of all the carts that i've tried and i've tried a bunch um show brand has the best layer if you're in it for flavor i would imagine these these would probably appeal to females quite a bit because you know they they don't produce very much coughing and they're very smooth um very light height something you can work with all day long about like i said about an eight and a half to nine compared to they pull supplies delta farms but as far as flavor goes you can't beat chill plus man you guys check them out i'll put a link to them down at the bottom um it's

cartridge this is grape ate another indica last time I had two bubblegum cush which was [ __ ] amazing by the way it was a spectacular man the flavor the smell and the potency was was top-notch one thing though the like for instance what I've noticed so far between the brass knuckle cartridges the bloom cartridges and the high fly cartridges while the the wick versus the coil system I prefer the how can I say this not prefer the coil system the coil system is um seems to I say give you a better took you you can get a better toke off the coil system versus the wick system the bloom cartridges are still good I mean they're [ __ ] great the indicas are top notch you know it's just the it's just that difference between the the coil and the wick where it seems a lot looser it seems easier to pull the with the coil system it seems you get a better vape it seems with the coil system it seems the stronger vapors you know I'm more lucid me but uh whatever I mean I like them both you know but I would have to say I prefer this apparatus over the coil system I mean the UM the wick system so anyway back to the great thing now the great babe is fire the only drawback I see so far to to the high fly joints is they go kind of quickly you know the the concentrate seems to be the concentrate seems to be I don't know what like kind of running almost not as thick as the bloom or the the brass knuckle cartridges are but other than that I be you get a nice toe this Grape Ape it's very potent you know it uh it definitely gets the gag reflex jumping off but so far like I said I haven't found any drawbacks to the arm that the debate cartridges produced by high fly they hit just as well as the brass knuckle cartridges so stay tuned for on the channel for for me and my experimentation with other brands and other cartridges as well because there are plenty of them out there I've only barely scratched the surface but so far the three that I've tried I like but I like to I prefer the coil system over the wick system and that's about it the grape eight high fly is good so far without from what I've seen the high fly cartridges have the same strains as the brass knuckles I'm the great babe the UH the dough see dose the only ones I believe brass knuckle didn't have that I didn't see was the bubblegum coach cush which again I highly recommend that gelato gelato is it's [ __ ] amazing and what's the other one King do we can't do it it's [ __ ] good to go seek dose that's one bubblegum could gelato dough see dose all of the ones that I've had are good but those three are like the potin right into Grape Ape is right up there with them so you get a chance to uh get a vape in check it out at your local dispensary or a vape shop smoke shop wherever you get them from and I'll be seeing you guys leave in peace", "FLJwq8C7JnE": "[Music] welcome guys it's pumpkinheads vape reviews here welcome back we got a [ __ ] badass review today a set of uh carts today reviewing thc pods oh

stoned though check out their [ __ ] oil their bubbles in there don't [ __ ] move guys great oil pods hit great but i don't know that [ __ ] [ __ ] choked my lungs up good that tastes like perfume or something overpowering i've had other grape apes that tasted like grape really good like buddha bear his grape is really [ __ ] spot on this does not taste anything like that yeah it doesn't taste like an actual grape grape like i've had buddha bear that's badass but this is this doesn't taste like perfect damn not anything you want great babe would you rate this [ __ ] pumpkinhead it hits good

"gZu2DdLyVy8": "[Music] YouTube's cracking down so I wanted to put this disclaimer in the video and let everybody know that you have to be 18 or older to watch my videos and that everything in my videos are legal industrial hemp flour what's good smoker fam it's the homie smoked CBD coming back with another fire and flour review today guys I will be introducing the newest member of the smoked CBD hemp flour review lineup company goes by the name of hemp Iyer direct so far I have all the praise in the world for this company now I have a few of their strings is an ounce of their Hawaiian haze CBD hemp flour this is an ounce of their legendary og and flour and this is an indica so I'm really pumped about this one plus I've never had legendary OG so I'm really excited to try and review this for the smoker fam and then this is an ounce of their sour space candy smalls so these are like little popcorn small nuggets of their sour space candy I'm thinking about doing a giveaway with this ounce I'm not too sure yet as if I in order to do a giveaway I'm not gonna open it but I really want to try it because what I'm reviewing for you guys today has really caught my attention with Empire direct the strain is called Grape Ape y'all Grape Ape is an indica dominant flower i got an ounce of it and yeah if you go to their website you can find everything you need to know about all their strains so it's coming at sixteen point seven percent CBD and it says Grape Ape is known for its fruity sweet and pungent terpene the frosty dark colored knobs from Grape Ape carry a subtle purple tint to them the buds smell and taste like grapes and are very sweet with a hint of fuel burning this indica dominant which is 60% indica 40% sativa leaves a rubbery diesel flavor on the tongue this strain generates a killer body feeling though moderate you should leave the user clear-headed and functional it's great for treating anxiety some insomnia stress and mild pain and it's known to instill feelings of euphoria and relaxation and yeah man the great babe it was the first one I opened and tried from them because of the name I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with Grape Ape is a very popular THC marijuana strain very you know notable strain so you know first time getting great vape a hint flower I had to bust it right open and try it man are they ever write about the pungent terpene profile guys I wish you could just stick your nose in this bag with me because oh it smells so good it's so sweet it really does kinda like if you take a deep whiff you kind of get what I smell is like grape Pixy stick it's just like a sweet great powdered candy with a lot of fuel it says a hint of fuel this smells like this poured gasoline in this bag and man am I so happy that I got an ounce and guys make sure after this review to go check out empire direct I'll put a link down the comments pin it to the top and make sure to use my code guide yes you heard me correctly I have a discount code that I can offer to the smoker fam with this company the code is n-ath h25 I'll put it on the screen for you guys it'll be down in the pinned comment along with a link to their website

button for me join the family [Music] you guys see those dark notes of purple and even the greens are really dark the trichomes really Sparkle and man some of these buds have beautiful orange hairs

trim job you just you just never know when ordering in the high quantities like that and especially when you buy a cheaper ounce you don't expect top-quality and let me tell you this else is really cheap for hemp flour and it is top quality guys I am overly impressed by this Grape Ape Oh I mean some of these buds just you'd stay around them you catch yourself staring at them and miring the

such a gassy just sweet flavor yeah just that first hit you really get the UM you really get the sweetness and the fuel part that they talked about with the terpenes and it says it should leave the user clear-headed and functional and I will say when I smoked this earlier there was a euphoria and the relaxation to it but I was still like clear-headed I could still focus on anything I wanted to while getting the indica effects that I loved I think the 60/40 indica sativa blend and this hybrid is a great mix for any part any time of the day let's go for hit number two guys nice heavy smoke gives you that tight throat feeling and I mean I that's expected with me with potent strains that just means it's gonna be good most of the time and yeah man overall this great babe smokes tremendously the taste is 10 out of 10 the smell is 12 out of 10 and yeah Empire Direct they got something good going on over there make sure you use my code guys I promise they even they offer grams

"oh it's not above to make me change like a castaway you know you page that you bought the color today K you know what is going on everybody welcome back to another sick video by your boy semi g-man we're back at it with another cartridge you you man something that a lot of people have been asking me for lately and they barely released I believe this year I'm not a hundred percent sure if they release in January when they're released but I've been slacking man you guys know if you've been following my channel for a long time I have tried this brand specific but I have not tried their new pod system that they came out with alright guys so I thought the king of cartridges will do his thing and give you guys a cart review alright guys so today without further ado man we are gonna be reviewing the West Coast cure cure pod alright so right here I got a brand new batch of the Grape Ape half gram which is a hybrid this one sitting at a ninety point three percent THC man and the manufacturing date was 423 so it's fairly fairly new only a little bit less than two months right and I also got the battery right here which is the blue battery and this one's pretty sick man so we're gonna go ahead and unbox it's live this is the first time I've ever tried one held one seen one any of that good stuff so we're gonna unbox them in right here live on camera I like doing unboxings because man I don't know about you guys but it really it feels to me like like you know like you just get a new phone or a new electronic device or something cool that you've been wanting for so long and you know your parents finally went out of their way and they're like man you know Sebastian definitely deserves this today so we're gonna go ahead and buy it for him right so this is how I feel man I'm ecstatic so without further ado let's go ahead and open up the blue battery first boom you slide it down that's how it comes you get the user manual and then boom you get the braided USB cable along with the blue device alright so this thing so far this thing is sick I like the packaging so as you give you guys a little close-up as you guys can see right there it has a little crown right there on the top that's supposed to represent the West Coast cure and so far I like the design it's like kind of like a matte finish and no fingerprints on this you know this thing is a very very very clean device so next up we got the Grape Ape right here at the Grape Ape from West Coast gear specifically I loved it man I remember when I first tried it it was one of the first ever if not the first ever great cartridge that I ever bought in my life and it was phenomenal man there Grape Ape is one of the best strains that they have out on the market and I'm excited to try this man sitting at a 90 percent THC I have not seen anything you know hit that high in a while like not even raw Gardens be hitting that high and there they usually hit like around I want to say like 86% 87% it's very very rare that you get a 90 Plus THC pod so let's go ahead and open this thing up press a little button right here on the side boys and then boom all the little user Manning was in the way man they always give you use your man what do you need a user manual for a pod man I know how to use it all right so pulling it straight out the box boys show you guys a little close-up of the oil it is very very very light yellow and the pot itself though it kinda reminds me of a jewel pot it has that little connector all right there on the bottom so but it's very very sleek and very very nice man so we're gonna go ahead first time first time putting this inside all right so boom boom you see the little green light flash and you know it's ready to go boy think man but before we take a blinker man do everyone in here watch and do me one big favor smash that like button boys and once you're done man let me know in the comments below and let's go ahead and take this blinker choose what the heck I wasn't pulling right off the bat what the Frick I don't know if I'm doing this wrong I don't know I mean it connected you saw the light right there at the bottom right so I'm gonna go ahead and I don't think you're supposed to remove anything it doesn't really seem like it but let's go ahead and try a hit again damn dude [Music] the dude I'm freaking struggling I'm over here sucking like the living heck out of it it's not even pulling bro what's going on I'm gonna go ahead and charge this up real quick maybe I might be that it needs to be charged uh who knows but yeah give me one second guys so what it was it was already clogged and man that is a big no-no like literally this thing was already clogged all right that is a big downside the West Coast cure if you guys are watching this video do me a big favor and fix that issue because this is a brand-new pod if I'm already having this issue with this man and I've kept it up right since the moment I bought it from the dispensary that that's you know that's a bad sign that's definitely a bad sign that has something to say with the manufacturing itself you know carelessness definitely know are indeed checking if these things are good before they send them out to the dispensaries man but I now that we got it to work though man now we can finally take a little blinker so cheers guys do that first blinker I don't think that was a 10 second hit I'm more than positive it was like a seven second hit but it completely it completely decapitated my lungs right there like ah do that but the flavor I'm talking about the flavor profile this is actually there man like it hits you right away I don't know if it's because I took a blink or what but the flavor profile I'm still coughing man I'm still coughing the plan for the flavor profile is definitely taste oh not similar to the to the Grape Ape that I had first because the first ever Grape Ape that a hot pad is West Coast car used to make the sauces if you guys don't remember they had dissolute versions and they had sauce versions of the carts and I used to always get the sauces because you know that was a bit the big thing back then hey oh my gosh dude this one though this one is like a lot more Turkey if that makes sense it's a lot more like obviously it tastes like disel it but it's so good dude it's so good compared to any live resin that I've had it's just that I don't know I think I'm just more of a fan of distillate than I am a fan of live residue just because you know the Terps the flavor profile the high it's just so well conjunction together that when you smoke it on him in there's there's no there's like no downfall to it you know or as opposed to like a live resident pen you you probably will get a lot of flavor but you won't get a good high the TAC percentage is very low all that stuff so that's why I've been really liking a lot of dis lids lately dude off of that first rip this thing smacks without a doubt but let's go ahead and go in on a five-second hit to see if it's max as good as the blinker does man Cheers who dared the flavour I'm getting off of this putt I have not had a better cartridge so far in a long time this cartridge right now might be one of my new favorite dis lists like dude it has me dying like the high I feel it right away this is my first high of the day it's only about 11 and 11:30 and this high though is phenomenal it's not really really super rushed like most distillates are it's actually not subtle either it's actually like the perfect high and I don't know if it's because I took a blinker like the dosage has a lot to do with that also but man I'm telling you one blinker off of this guy that's probably all you need there like but to gather things all up man like the flavor profile on this like I was saying it tastes it tastes like grape not a super artificial grape but obviously doesn't taste like a natural grape but it's really really good it's very delicious exactly like a grape and the Terps on this is their there they're definitely definitely definitely there you have the grape Terps and I don't I'm not really getting too much of a earthiness we actually let me go ahead and take another mmm the Terps yeah it definitely has like a more greyish Terp to it so it's just great like grape on grape on grave guys in the flavor I'm not I'm not hater because I mean I'm not a big fan of grapes but this flavor right here - smacks for sure without a doubt like this might be like I was saying earlier one of my new favorite distillate cartridges let me know in the comments below if you guys have ever tried one of the new West Coast cure pods let me know what your favorite flavor is man let me know which one you guys want me to review next because I actually wouldn't mind reviewing one of these next so let's can continue the review man these this thing is just so enjoyable I'm glad that I picked this up I must say though in terms of the pull itself like when you're drawing it it has a very very very heavy pull like I'm talking about you literally have to inhale hard like this is for people with big lungs if you literally have to pull in order to make you light up like watch like right there I'm not getting any action because it's just barely getting any pope I have to go like literally inhale super hard like I was saying that would be the only downside that I have seen so far I'm not sure if maybe I should still have to bust in the cartridge or whatever the case is but other than that guys the battery design like I was saying is very very sleek I like it I've haven't liked it reminds me a lot of this dizzy but this one just seems a lot more like a lot more well built as you get if I can say so myself it it feels a lot more well built so like if they put a lot more you know creativity into it like the crown up top that's pretty sick I love that design the cure pod logo the the you know the blue on this it's just overall amazing quality and then you slap a pod like this I'm talking about this pod guys it might be ranking at a top 3 spot as now I have to try on more flavors I do not know based off with just one flavor but this pod system right here might be you know taking the taking the top 3 spot like I was saying like plug place dizzy you guys to be careful because these guys are doing their thing man well you guys know if you guys follow West Coast cure on Instagram you guys know that all they put are all they smoke is fire you know all the stuff they ever post is fire so you know that that makes me kind of like have like a sense of like okay they're they smoke fire so they're probably putting super gas in this whereas you know we've seen other companies we don't know what kind of flour they put into their [ __ ] so man this is so good I'm gonna go ahead and go in for like my fifth hit choose boys yep the grape is there I love it like it like if you're a fan of a grape this pot is probably going to be you know one of your top three favorites as of as it is for me now like this lit you know I have different categories I'd you know when it comes to live resin rosin dislike cartridges all that stuff I never really try to categorize all these different flavor profiles and specific you know types of waxes and just slap them under one category I always try to break it down because I feel like it's important to know you know to have different different like top threes in different categories and not just be stuck on just one specific brand and product so yeah that's a little that's a little tip for me so I'm starting to get really high Dida that's how you know I'm getting high when I start rambling about nonsense Duke so yeah this pot smacks the the flavor is there the Terps are there the highest definitely they're one of my favorite hyzer that I've had in a while and just the pot over itself like the only bad side like I was saying was in the beginning when I when it was already clogged that was a big issue and also yeah there like that was about it just the pot system and how hard you have to pull you know in order to get the drop but other than that guys it is a very very well-built pot system I do not regret buying this at all great babe one of the better flavors I'm let me know in the comments below let me know in the comments below well flavor you guys would like meets are trying next I'm always open to you know hearing you guys though so I'm gonna go ahead and out the video here guys if you enjoyed the video today do me one big favor and smash that like button hit that comment button and most importantly hit that subscribe button alright guys I'll catch you guys on the next one she's been we practicing keep punching on the ground bloody knuckles I've

voice but today we're looking at black market extracts and not just their normal normal cards because they they also make normal carts these are the soft cards now let's look at the THC contents 74% I've always thought this company is pretty legit like they don't they don't really they don't try to guess themselves they just they tell you straight up how it is and that's their Instagram right there black market the sauce carts I like them a lot a lot better than their normal carts their normal carts are good but nothing special you know this is this is a grape eight flavor indica now if we look at the cart you can see it's like housing on it you can see it's like not as clear as most most cart I think it's hot like some high-quality sauce just get a few more shots of this see it's like a weird color or a weird consistency rather but I like these a lot to be artists you could really taste the like you can tell it's not just normal Deb's it's it's sauce but yeah I prefer them they're definitely a good they're definitely better than a lot of no just normal carts you're comparing them to normal normal oils I definitely pick one of these up if you can they're usually a bit more expensive than normal carts but not too bad definitely definitely worth the few extra bucks I think the liquids a little not too not too thin at all you can see the bubble bellies going up there yeah you can see it's kind of going up thank you for watching and definitely caught these if you can't I think they're fire they have a lot of flavors this flavor is really good so I'm assuming the other ones are as well high quality south you should definitely cop thank you yourself", "Zzm3mOibfO0": "what is the deal y'all mr. money wanna facing and staying like loose friends you guys know this Sam

I just got super super happy to be showcasing too beautiful beautiful bug like Kayla was talking about this this piece that Kaelyn just picked up showcase this right off the bat you got it if that one's easy to showcase so right off the card we have some og slime that's surrounding it that makes it just yeah pop the [ __ ] out with the rest of all the green that that kind of gets in you see in the gray and the sauce cool thing about this green is that in different lights and UV light and in fluorescent lights it changes colors from almost being a blue to being a green and it's really nice with these huge light flares off here off the side fits really nice in your hand and the way it pulls with the with the shape of the pipe you're not afraid of getting like Scooby Snack so with the what I call them yeah or like little bits of chard but I don't know this Bend that the that the errors are pulling through it makes it it makes it feel safe like a lot of times I will choose not to smoke with the pipe because I'm weary of getting stuff in my mouth yeah but I'm not with this pop so it's really nice um and so let me let me show case this bud hell yeah and yeah so I got a 5 gram nug I brought a little bit of fallin off but this stuff is absolutely sticky as hell smellier than smellier than most other buds honestly this is lambsbread I've never had it I've had lambs breasts I I have also had lambs breath and it's usually really good this this huge nug here these fire or these little hairs on here can pull straight off and just literally literally pack bowls with just the hairs on this stuff it's absolutely great for killing picked off some of the bud and I was like hey can I eat that that's uh let's break this out yeah yeah I gave him a little pinch full just broke that off we'll look look at this top nug looks like it's got really really nice little popcorn nugs that just kind of fall off that are Oh super dense but really nice and caked a really nice natural but it looks like I'm super enjoying how many hairs there yeah holy hell let's get a shot on cameraman I don't know if you're I'm sure you remember we went to a shop called outliers collective in the war some stuff called walkie yeah yeah you called it dude and the hairs were absolutely gnarly and there they look just like that almost I think The Walking Dead were a little bit longer but wow this is up in the game yeah let's let's uh let's get a little I don't let's get some of this ground up a little so also to top it off yes with this video I stopped in at lucky greens today I got one of this one of these a kick-ass I believe it yet IV xx yeah I think it's like ix or something like that is how it's pronounced that is how she pronounced it as well one of their batteries super super nice to come up it's only $20 with yeah with this nice case and this nice battery also got a flavor X cartridge a Grape Ape indica one of the smelliest but like obviously in a good way like smells just like and tastes just like grape soda it's phenomenal so I'm gonna be chiefing on that in this video as well yeah can't wait to try that he was telling me about it because he had tried it and let me know that it was absolutely awesome so I'm I'm excited as hell if you want to grind that up and get it packing all try it out um flavor X great babe let's try this football do we have a lighter I do Wow offset assistance they behind clouds very fat cause it's a good battery the very base it's only a half gram - yeah Wow I thought it was gonna be a full gram they there's a lot of oil in here super super great taste tastes like honestly the best tasting a grape candy the best tasting flavor I structures not taste like a great whiskey Annie yeah yeah please do so lambsbread and some kickass glass Cheers the carpool sit and super super well great function honestly just I I have like a way as most people do with their pieces of holding this that's just perfect for me and I get that thumb like the little like players on the class literally taste like carbon needed grape so yeah it's it's it's very good it tastes like one of those um tastes like a grape candy or like like a like a great one of those hearty and delicious Jolly Ranchers yeah just kind of like that hey Mel yeah cameraman Kleiza given us toots review a lot the whole squad likes to fight Oh dope it's probably my favorite part by the hand type that I never hit just because it's mine honestly I have I have so much attachment to but just the way it looks is so beautiful and it it doesn't have that mean I don't have any fear of like scooby snax in my mouth or anything awesome absolutely great play the the cartridge reminds me a lot of as if I were to smoke the gray powder pop that's how I would imagine it everything great oh yeah like just any artificial grape flavoring that you guys have had that's what that tastes like except for the best kind like like you're getting high yeah from in so goddamn absolutely amazing shout out to a flavor and shout outside that's for sure very great prices on both of those can't even feel it in your lungs either yeah so clean suddenly a super great burn on that awesome well some are it some great bud you want to give a review on that yeah um this is gonna be our first review without a water pipe I just realized that without a bomb I mean this stuff for her look was absolutely fantastic that's good nothing wrong to the yeah he's gonna get a look at it definitely but uh um for her look honestly this stuff gets a nine and a half out of ten the hairs are absolutely fantastic I would like it to be a little more sparkly with trichomes but I can't I can't ask for more from that bud because it's absolutely beautiful you know I'm going to go with a 9.25 just because I'm so used to Southern California weed with a little bit more solidarity like a like a foamy but this is definitely a sativa this is for sure it's a really really nice light that's right it's but it's also pretty dense and it has a really nice healthy firm crack to it which is great super dense for us a team of those so I forgot to give it that film Asus finest make sure to hit them out if you guys are interested in this stuff great but all around and out of the hand pipe not of not a harsh burning and almost at all very clean very very nice lifting high that's definitely a sativa high I'm enjoying it a lot but yeah I borrow a five and I give it a nine point five so let's let's run it off let's just say nine point two five because I'm too hard to do the math in between I'm sure I'm sure it's quicker than nine point yeah yeah whatever there you go you guys enjoy it we definitely did for sure please leave a like in a comment that you guys did enjoy be sure to stick stay tuned the

I'm from\nLondon Ontario Canada and I love the OHM product. Currently, I'm a vaper always\njust because I like the on-the-go function. I really love how sleek the ohm\nis. Currently I don't have my cartridge on there just because I did receive a\nnew cartridge and I'm gonna open it with you guys right now. Always comes in very\nsleek packaging, you know, very simple discreet, not too much packaging either\nwhich is nice. Very simple here. Oh my gosh! So cute! Very different from the style I\nhave right now, and I did ask for the Grape Ape. I'm currently smoking on the\nblueberry OG Kush and I really like that flavour but you know I always like a\nchange, so let's try this one out it's going to load it up here. WOW! You've immediately taste the grape, I do like how, you know, it's got labelled. It's got grape ape right there, GA, and the thing I like to is I'm getting better vapour actually, compared to my first\ncartridge That's an awesome update you guys.\nDefinitely give OHM a try. I'm currently in Ontario and I got my cartridge in a\nday, two days. You know, so give the OHM try and #LiveBetter", "fJubPjBOSQc": "hi guys it's Jared and we're gonna be doing a strainer view on a string called Grape Ape today now this strain is supposedly a cross between skunk number one and an Afghani if you look it up on Leafly it says there's Mendo perps in there too I'm not 100% sure about that everyone I've talked to has never heard of the Mendo purpose being included maybe it says something and Leafly that it was propagated by apothecary genetics and Barney's farm they could have introduced amend Oh perps that I'm I don't know about not sure what this cut exactly is if it's just Afghani and skunk like I've normally heard or if it's got Mendo perps in there but whatever the case is it's really good I'm filming this video today in my car it's kind of rainy outside a little windy so the audio wasn't that great can't smoke inside not my house so we're just gonna do in my car so first up I'm gonna show it off I'll have somebody shot sup while I talk about it about the look but I can already say this is it by the way this is some very good looking but it's got some purple in it kind of goes along with the grape name but it's not throughout it's just kind of subtle hints of purple every now and again in the flowers it's not overly trimmed up the best it's got a tiny tiny little bit of some of the fan leaf still on it but that's completely fine by me cuz even the fan leaves are tricht out the buds are nice and dense there I was told that this was some light depot and I think it came out really well now before we start smoking I'm gonna get the smell test before I completely burn all the the smelling ability out of my nose Wow it's got an unbelievably strong smell it's kind of smelling up my car right now actually um super sweet like candy it's very berry I wouldn't say it's necessarily a grape like the name but more of like just a fruity candy kind of like like a strawberry I guess there's kind of a little grape it's also got a little bit of earthiness to it too we'll see if that comes through on the flavor too this is my gonna be my first smoke of the day so this is gonna be my clean impersonation of the high so your impression my impersonation I've always tried to do it that way just because I think it gives you to try a new strain at least it gives you a very clean representation of what the high actually feels like instead of already having some THC in your system but I'm gonna jump into some smoking we've already done the looks I showed you guys the looks we did the smell it's got a great snow and now we're gonna jump into the taste test so I have some quick here it is got some hemp wick and I also already have a little Bowl loaded up in this glass blunt and we're gonna get some hits off of it see if we can't get a flavor off of it cheers guys going in on some great bait well even boxing my car with the leftover hemp wig let's get that put out the taste is phenomenal the earthiness did come through on it but the sweetness just covers your mouth kind of just doesn't want to leave to just kind of envelops and your whole taste buds kind of more hit this again whoo the big one taste still the same very earthy but not in a bad way kind of like an OG kind of earthy earthiness to it but that's probably the Afghani to be honest it's where the earthiness is probably coming from but I can't get over the fruitiness of it just super candy like so far I'm gonna just finish this off with the lighter he already got a couple hits for the taste with the hemp wick whoo got a little Scooby Snack through their nose a little painful little hot ash in the back of the throat it's always the worst part about cleaning glass blunts is after they get a little resonated they stop Scooby Snack is hard but as soon as I clean this for this review pulls right through it's getting a little smoky in here clean that out set that aside so as far as taste goes super fruity comes through like an OG with a little bit of earthiness too and it's great it's a great earthiness it's not something that's harsh and it tastes like dirt because it was growing wrong it's that earthiness because of the genetics already starting to feel a little bit of a buzz starting to kick in already kind of not gonna judge the high yet I got a this tiny little car bubbler I don't have a bomb with me right now at my house that'll probably be featured in later strain reviews but this will have to do it's a pretty decent sized Bowl I weighed it out it's like a point three that I put in here and we're just gonna try and take it all it's not that big of a rip but the way this works is it's just a tiny little car bubbler makes you pull there's no way to clear it so you just have to keep pulling and it actually can get you pretty ripped because you can't really measure out your hits you just gotta put in just as much as you're gonna smoke so I'm gonna smoke or try it to smoke all of that point three and one hit really judge the high off of this great babe so cheers guys hope you guys have a better peace at home that you're using right now this isn't my everyday I kind of deal don't worry alright guys Cheers Wow box in my car basically the taste still comes through so much it's just super earthy super sweet got a nice fruitiness to it and that actually was a pretty decent sized rip head of that thing makes you like you can see in the video it kind of makes you draw for a long time in order to kill the cherry but it does get you ripped I'm gonna say my eyes have probably gotten a little bit lower since I started this I definitely want to talk that's the thing is this grape ape strain is supposed to be a heavy indica but it kind of what I've noticed so far is it starts off with kind of a burst of energy I just want to talk right now you probably can tell but over time it starts to settle into more of a body high and I'm gonna give it a little bit of time to really set in and I'll come back when it's really taking effect and I can say that I'm probably peaking that way I can give more of a better account of what it feels like all right guys see you in a little bit all right guys we're back it's been about five minutes I aired out my car ash my pieces walked around a little bit to get the blood flowing and the high is definitely set on that bolt of energy fades really quickly and settles into a nice body high but at the same time it's not necessarily making me want to go to sleep or just get couch locked per se I can tell that if you smoked more and more of this like if you smoked a couple bowls maybe three or even four or more then definitely I could see sleepiness being a definite characteristic one thing I can definitely say about this strain is that it's super mellow so it'd probably be really good for pain management just because it gives you that nice relaxation and numbness in the body it would probably also be a good strain for anxiety because it's very good to just relax kind of calms your mind down doesn't overly sedate you if you dose yourself but it just kind of slows you down so I get definitely seeing it being a good for anxiety you can probably tell talk a little bit slower but I still have stuff to do today and I'm gonna be fine to do it and I'm actually gonna rip another Bowl I already packed it up it's just a little bit smaller than last time but I'm just gonna rip it and get out of here hope you guys are having a good day if you're watching this is my first video that I'm gonna upload so I don't know where the channels gonna go from here but cheers guys hope you're smoking along definitely seats that smoke down in your lungs no coughs though not this time all right guys peace", "ok8p3wie6xk": "i'm ashley brennan founder of sabine
