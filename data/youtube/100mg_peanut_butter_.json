{"462zIfmmZIo": "[Music] well no eat skies we are talking t K o edibles again today this is the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and as I said we are talking the fine folks at t KO one of their hundred milligrams today the peanut butter and jelly crispy that's right the peanut butter and jelly crispy from TKO we've reviewed a variety of products from TKO and I think on the whole they're pretty good I've liked them all pretty much they all seem to be as potent as advertised and they usually taste at the bare minimum okay and sometimes even verging on good so I'm not actually sure what makes it a peanut butter and jelly crispy what what the jelly part is or the peanut butter in this don't know but looking forward to try it sounds good to me it sounds like flavorful and good it's a pretty affordable edible only cost me seven bucks in my dispensary as the packaging sort of indicates it's an affordable edible but in this case or than the previous TKO edibles does not mean it's they skimp out on the potency just means that you've got some less than fancy packaging which it's fine with me as long as you know they if they're saving that are passing the savings on to you that's great so let's go ahead and open this up and give you a little taste test then I'll finish it off and I will come back to you guys in two hours or two hours from me just a couple seconds from you guys just to let you know how I'm feeling so here we go open it up there you can smell the peanut butter smell to it for sure it smells a lot like peanut butter let's give it a taste mm I don't know how they do it there is a peanut butter and jelly taste to it what peanut better than jelly but there's definitely that fruity jelly sort of taste to it as well it's good I like it quite a bit this might be my second favorite tasting one behind the s'mores which I had but this one's pretty good I like the cereal like rice krispie treats and this one is not bad so guys I'm gonna finish this off and then I will come back to you in two hours to actually let you know how it's feeling and for you it'll just be right after this break thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you soon peace hungry YUM got me some munchies um welcome back sweets guys sorry about that it's been two hours since I had the TKO 100 milligram peanut butter and jelly krispies and I gotta say I like it a lot I'm gonna solid five five and a half somewhere like that which is a pretty good value for a seven dollar edible I'm about as high as I you know I'm happy with where I'm with my high and not really wish it was any higher I really like the taste of it too one of the better tasting TKOs just all around a good product for another winner from TKO certainly one of my favorites from them and a surprising potency from just a hundred milligram edible so if you see this one out of the dispensary near you and you're okay with the lower dose edibles do not hesitate to grab the peanut butter and jelly krispies I don't think you'll be upset that you did and guys I'm gonna eat some more of this food I'm really looking forward to that and I will see you on the next review thanks for watching peace", "lhSUQvO-bPs": "what is up ladies family it is Bobby back at the grocery store because you guys have been requesting a nut butter video and Wow I did a deep dive into research the last week or so and there's a lot to cover you think it'd be pretty easy right back growing up back in my day it was one thing you had peanut butter and that's it now we have peanut butter or almond butter coconut butter all these different kind of things and it really boils down to reading the ingredients because now more than ever they're sneaking so many low-quality bad ingredients in here in the form of palm oil sugar and Raja native oils we're also going to talk about Noster peanut butters and nut butters why is palm oil and everything the highest protein the lowest carb even jams and jellies we're gonna hook you up big time so before we start why don't you hook me up click that old subscribe button because we are rocking three videos every week two videos on the weekends and a live stream during the week so go ahead and click that Bell icon right below the video because you don't want to miss these live streams we're making a recipe from start to finish doing Q&A hanging out it is a really fun time all right let's start with the biggest offenders of all and unfortunately the kind of peanut butters that art and I grew up on Skippy jiff and Peter Pan right all you have to do you guys is look at the ingredients that is the peen of this video read the ingredients if it's not two ingredients nuts and salt put it back so we go to the back of the ingredients of Skippy and it has peanuts but then sugar hydrogenated that sugar the oil containing cotton and soybean and rapeseed oil cottonseed oil is one of the cheapest most agricultural oils you can get it's terrible for you it's highly processed with high high amount of chemicals then we go to the jiff and the jiff has peanuts and sugar fully hydrogenated vegetable oils once again and molasses and a bunch of added sugar here so really low quality oils and why do they put these oils in here including in the Peter Pan because they make it more shelf stable it'll last longer on the shelf and it makes it creamier it essentially makes it no stir and I know we all want know stir so when on Instagram said hey please tell me a good healthy no stir so I Got News for you if you ever see the words Noster on a label put it back immediately because what are peanuts butters and nut butters made from nuts that have fat so it's a hundred percent natural to see the separation of fat and the nuts because that's what happens when you grind nuts when you put palm oil and hydrogenated oils in here that makes it stir free you don't want that so that's a telltale sign that you want to put it back now I would much rather you guys buy organic peanut and organic almond butter because I've talked about this in the past peanuts or legumes they grow in the ground they're heavily sprayed with pesticides and chemicals in almond trees even though they're trees they spray the ground around the almond a lot because when they shake the almond trees they don't want any grass and shrubs there to impede the picking up process which leeches into the almond so I prefer you buy organic that being said it's very tricky with nut butters because if they add anything else to the butter I'd rather you not buy organic so this one here from Maranatha is organic but if you look at the label it's made with palm oil we're gonna talk about palm oil in a few minutes but I would stay away from that because it's a really bad oil and would rather you go to the conventional because I don't want you having anything besides the nuts and the salt so I would put this one back and instead there's a couple options here at Walmart this is a really cool brand crazy Richards so check it out if I show you the ingredients here there's one ingredient peanuts that's it so that's why I prefer this right there's no hydrogenated oils there's no sugar there's no palm oil I'd much rather train down to conventional versus organic if they don't add those ingredients that being said there's a couple really accessible options here at Walmart first of all Smuckers right Smuckers makes a natural peanut butter that only has peanuts and a little bit of salt very very good and Smuckers has the organic here which is just peanuts and salt two great options that I would totally have and then you can also get the organic Walmart brand - all it has is peanuts and salt now looking at the ingredient list the critic inside me says what kind of salt they may use when we're done with this video watch our salt review video I would much rather they use a can see salt when they don't say it like that specifically they're using a typical bleached agricultural salt which if you watch the video it's highly bleached and highly processed but it's a little bit of a too deep of a knife for this video I'm just happy they're not putting other stuff in here but I'll show you for example like these are nuts oh it's a premium nut butter and actually they have it at Costco for a much better price and look at the ingredients on the back here they're using Celtic sea salt and really clean ingredients here if your child has a peanut allergy or you have a peanut allergy you can't have this one but you can have them nuts so power fuel it's peanut free but it still does have tree nuts in there that being said that leads us to the best alternative if you have a tree nut or peanut allergy that would be right here it's gonna be sunflower seed butter but you don't want to get this brand because we look at the back here it's got sugar in here we don't need to add sugar to butters they have two sunflower seed butters at Trader Joe's one of them has sugar added them the other one doesn't if you're AIP and you have an autoimmune protocol diet you can't have any of that there's only two things you could have you could have coconut butter or Tiger nut butter which is actually a tuber those two are available online don't buy the coconut butter in the store I'm going to show you at the next one it's way too expensive right on Amazon I'll put the link down below and then there's something that even arch was not even impressed with Wow butter because even though it's approved for school and it's a nut free look at the ingredients it's whole toasted soy and press soy oil does it say anywhere yes it says this non-gmo certified so that's good then it has cane sugar and palm sugar the thing is I would not give this way to the kids because it can disrupt your hormone development and when you're kid that's really important so I would say no to this stick with the sunflower seed butter that has no additional palm oil or sugar and then that brings us to peanut butter powders now there's two this is the main brand PB 2 I'm gonna tell you to stay away from this one because look at the ingredients that has added sugar here if you're gonna get it you're much better off getting the walnut brand it's really cheap but it has the added sugar which bothers me the cool thing is there's a powdered almond butter here from Barney and while you'll see it the next grocery store I don't want you to buy the Barney almond butter because it has additional ingredients this one doesn't is just blanched almonds and it's the powder here so it is lower fat great for smoothies great for cooking and sauces now that brings us to one of the most common questions I got on Instagram about making this video which by the way if you're not following me on the place to do instagram stories get on that because i'm gonna make dinner every night on stories and it's a lot of fun people wanted to know what's the deal with palm oil look at the back of all of these different brands they're all have palm oil in here even like a premium Veronica Maranatha and I want you to run run Forrest run run for the hills from palm oil because it's annoying that is relatively cheap it's really bad for the environment but it's also really bad for your health okay it's not quite as bad as a partially hydrogenated fat or a fully hydrogenated fat but it's really really bad for your health the reason why these makers who love palm oil is because it's relatively inexpensive but it does two things it extends the shelf life for the peanut butter really far and it makes the texture really silky and creamy almost like that no stir because people don't want to see that separation here you don't see the separation you don't see the separation that's why brands like it that's why you have to stay away from it even the Sam's choice one from Walmart isn't no no okay I'm gonna talk about this now we might as well raw almond butter was a huge huge topic and he's here the price art why is the price of this 1548 whereas the other almond butter is 698 biggest farce maybe in this aisle is raw almond butter I did a deep dive about what it means to be raw smoke-and-mirrors my friends there's no such thing as raw almonds in the US that's not allowed to sell raw almonds so there's two ways to pasteurize almonds you can steam pasteurized them up to 165 degrees essentially cooking them or what most manufacturers are doing now is they're gassing them they're putting the almonds in a chamber and gassing them with propylene oxide or PPO that is a gas that pasteurizes them without warming them up too much propylene oxide is a chemical that's deemed by the whu-oh the rub Health Organisation is a carcinogen I have to do a much deeper dive to find out what brands are doing this and which ones aren't but going back to my original point where all almond butter is a joke because it's being passed tries what happens when you keep on you pasteurize a product while you killed the bad bacteria but you also kill all the good ones too maybe there's a few left over but is it worth paying an extra $10 per jar for no so do not buy raw almond butter I think it's one of the biggest jokes here and when you go to the next grocery store I've seen containers either bigger than this for higher prices total total waste of money all right some other really popular questions on Instagram stories was which nut butter has the highest protein that would be peanut butter peanut butter is the highest protein but it's followed right behind by almond butter we're talking like a 1 gram difference per serving which of the nut butters are the lowest carb once again almond butter right there are others low carb nut butters like macadamia nut and hazelnut and Brazil nut but they'll start to get really expensive so so I think we covered almost everything at this grocery store let's go to Whole Foods because they have some other brands that you might think are premium but once you start to read the labels it's shocking and I want to warn you before you waste your money before we head over there you guys on August 3rd I'm doing a cookbook party in Chicago it's gonna be huge we're serving recipes from the cookbook I'll be doing a cooking demo there too and we only have about 70 tickets left it's gonna be super fun I'm gonna put that link down in the description box if you live in the area or you feel I take on a road trip you can hang out with me art Dessie maybe my dad Johnny P it's gonna be a super fun time so I hope to see you there alright new store Whole Foods you might think there's gonna be a few more premium options here but you gotta read the ingredients because it's very deceiving starting with a brand called Barney butter they make almond butter and peanut butter looks clean looks premium it's $12.99 for this but look at the ingredients you guys almonds cane sugar palm fruit oil this is not even worth $2 I would not buy this and then another brand here is Justin's right they've been around for a long time peanuts and palm oil and it's ridiculous or charging this much and putting local hydrogenated style palm oil in here and look you can just tell visibly when there's no separation of the fat and the nut that means it's mixed with palm oil and stuff you don't want to have so Justin's all Justin's doesn't know this brand here but look at this prices are artists sauna or organic raw these prices are insulting $21 for a container this big no we know now that nothing is raw and that is just insulting then we go to something like RX RX and bars are making peanut butter now I'm mad at myself because I approved on the Bobby approved list the RX bars the Costco snack hall the other week I missed it they have natural flavoring so that's my bad thank you guys for leaving comments in the description box those are a hard no but we look at the butters here and they're using honey as a sweetener and natural flavorings again so this is a no 2 and here at Whole Foods they have the nut so but they have a chocolate brand and look at the ingredients even though it has a touch of sugar it's coconut sugar which is a better all-natural sweetener that's lower on the glycemic index and it only has 2 grams of sugar so this would actually be an OK chocolate one to give the kids they also make a version of nut so at Trader Joe's it's way cheaper and by the way all the peanut butters and almond butters from Trader Joe's are good to go the cashew butter has safflower oil which is a no and sunflower seed they have two one is good and one is bad a lot of you guys on Instagram are asking about these the nut grinding machines hurt all foods or your local grocery store yes use these because you know what goes in there one ingredient the nuts the price is pretty good and it's about as fresh as you can get going back to these sunflower butter in case you have a tree nut allergy this is interesting because the conventional style sunflower butter has sugar in here and the organic one of dozens who basically have to pay the organic price of $9.99 to get the sugar free version the conventional one is 666 99 so I don't know why they do that for just the organic version and then look down here really quick tahini this was requested on Instagram tahini is one of my favorite things I use it a lot in the keto meal prepping cookbook out right now and if you live in the Middle East this is your vision of peanut butter you're buying tahini make sure it's runny a loose and horrible for example the one at Trader Joe's is the worst it's very thick and it doesn't pour at all if it doesn't pour like a runny peanut butter don't buy it this is one of the best values the Whole Foods 365 and I'll put the other list down below but if you haven't experimented yet with tahini it's really really good for you it's made from sesame seeds and it's delicious okay before we talk about jams and jellies I brought in my outside groceries Costco has an amazing price on organic nuts and salt only peanut butter this is fantastic they used to have organic almond butter too if you still have it at your Costco scoop that the deal is amazing otherwise the Kirkland almond butter is just almonds and salt and tastic deal now very easy when it comes to jams and jellies you want to buy ones that are either no sugar added reduce sugar or sugar free completely so I look at something like this crafters there's no added sugar right it's grape juice Wow Moo berries pectin and citric acid that's it or something like this bio nature it's from Italy it has no added sugar it's just a sugar from the cherries apple juice concentrate and that's it I'm gonna put a list down below of all the reduced and sugar-free jams and jellies Trader Joe's has reduced sugar in strawberry and blueberry there's two sugar-free ones only available online there's one called good-good sweet Jam made with stevia that's a good one about the amazon link down below and one called nature's Hollow which is made with the xylitol which is not my favorite sweetener but I'll put that link down below too so that is it you guys I think we just covered all of the peanut and nut butters you could possibly want now I know there's a lot of information in this video I'm gonna put it all down in the description box the good the bad what to look for all that other stuff let me know what you want to see next right the grocery store is a big wild mysterious place and art and I are here to solve all your problems we got two more links to more videos going below us right now but art and I will see you very soon until then hashtag keep on cooking mad love and peace", "jM-ucR4lMlE": "- Which peanut butter's peanut better? - Let's talk about that. (alarm rings)\n(playful theme music) (fire blasts) Good Mythical Morning. - There comes a day in every man's life when he must put all the knowledge and experience he's\nacquired in his many years on this earth to good use and\nchallenging though it may be, it is a necessity that separates\nthe strong from the weak, for if a man can't apply\nthe lessons he's learned to a good greater than himself-- - I'm sorry, I've gotta interrupt you. I just can't wait any longer! It's time for, move aside wedding day\nand children's birthdays, today is the new best day of my life 'cause I'm eating all\nthe peanut butter, baby! Taste test. - Wow. You know, I didn't really\nknow where I was going with that anyway, so\nthanks for interrupting me. Okay yes, today we're\ngonna be tasting a lot of peanut butter while blindfolded to test our identification skills and to also determine the\nbest tasting peanut butter on the market.\n- Mhm. - And before you ask,\nall the peanut butters are gonna be creamy because you can't pit creamy versus crunchy. That's playing with fire! - Mhm, now whoever guesses\nthe most brands correctly will be crowned the lord of the nuts! (chuckles) And I really hope it's\nme 'cause I have built up this loving of peanut\nbutter thing for years. - If you lose, you should be very ashamed. That's all I gotta say.\n- I'm nervous. The peanut butters that\nwe're gonna be tasting are Jif.\n- Skippy. - Peter Pan.\n- Smucker's. - Walmart brand AKA Great\nValue peanut butter. - And Justin's Peanut Butter which is the most expensive option. Comes out at $4.50 a jar on Amazon. All right, let's butter them nuts. - [Rhett And Link] Round one. - As you can see, we can't. - And all the peanut butters\nwill be brought in to us on the patent pending\npeanut butter jar car. - [Link] Ooh. - [Rhett] Let's bring in the first one. - Boy, I hear some rolly rollies. - Oh, that's exciting. Oh! Oh oh there. Oh, hmm. - Oh yeah the sweet, sweet\ncreaminess of heaven. - Man. That's good.\n- Okay, I know this one. (chuckles) - [Stevie] That's all,\nyou have nothing to say but I know this one? - Yeah I don't wanna\ngive Rhett any advantages 'cause I wanna win this one so bad. This is a good peanut butter, am I right? - It's a very good peanut butter. I believe that I have a version\nof this brand that I enjoy but not this particular one. I think, I don't know. - Now I'm getting inside my own head. I'm changing my mind. - [Stevie] You ready? - Oh gosh, well we gotta\nsay, we're gonna rate them on a scale of one to 10? - Oh yeah oh yeah we gotta do that. It's good. (chuckles) It's real good. Can I just say good? Is that a number? - It's so creamy. It's like sailing on a\nsmooth sea of brownness. - Yeah it's got--\n- I'm gonna give it an eight. - You know what, I was\nthinking eight as well. Yeah it's got a nice consistency, it's definitely peanut butter. Yeah I'm going with eight. - All right, I'm actually, I\nthought I knew what it was, and now I'm changing my answer. - Are you changing it\nto what I'm gonna guess? - I don't know what you're gonna guess. But I'm ready to guess. - Man I think I just\ngave something to you. - [Stevie] Three, two one. - Jif.\n- Skippy. - Jif.\n- Oh! Oh!\n(Link chuckles erratically) Okay, I hope you're wrong. - [Rhett And Link] Round two. - Roll in the nuts! (Link moaning) - You know incidentally, this is how we enjoyed peanut\nbutter at my house growing up, we just put it on the top of the lid. - Oh this is a good one. Equally as creamy as the\nfirst but a tad bit sweeter, I would say.\n- Yeah a little sweeter. - Mhm.\n- Man. This is also really good. - Now as much as I love peanut butter, I have not tried all of the peanut butters that we're sampling today. I've not tried Smucker's, I don't know if I've tried Walmart brand. Maybe Justin's only once actually. - I've never had the Walmart brand. I've never had Justin's. Never had Smucker's. - If you like a sweeter, I don't know, I gave the last one an eight. - I had Peter Pan\ngrowing up in your house. - Peter Pan was my jam as a kid. A lot of Skippy in my house\nnow, but I don't discriminate if it's offered to me. I'm gonna give this one a, man. A nine, I actually like the\nsweetness a little bit more. - I really like it but I\ndon't think it's any better or worse than the first one,\nI'm gonna give it an eight. - Just a little different, right? - But what is it? Ugh! - Pretty sure about this one. - Okay. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Jif.\n- Peter Pan. - Okay well, I hope you're right, 'cause this was your jam growing up so. I don't know, I'm saying Jif. - [Rhett And Link] Round three. - All right, bring in the next one. \u266a Oh daddy \u266a This one's taller. Hm. - Oh. - What is going on here? - That's different. Again, it's not bad. - It's a classic taste. I mean it's, I can't be\ncritical of this peanut butter. It's just great. - Is all peanut butter good? - All peanut butter is good. All peanut butter's not\ncreated equal but so far, they're all great.\n- Mhm. - I'm giving it shoot, man. - All peanut butter is good,\nbut is all good peanut butter? (crew laughs) - I think I have to give this one, I'm between an eight and a nine again. I'm not gonna go decimals,\nthat's for losers. If I learned anything in math, it's that. - It has a little less oil in it. Did you notice that there\nwas a little bit of a, I don't know, there's a slightly\nmore natural feel to it. - I just noticed more nuttiness. And I'm gonna give it an eight. - There's something about\nthis I didn't like as much. Again, I still like it,\nI'm gonna give it a seven. I have absolutely no idea\nwhich one it is though. - I may have already, okay. I may have already guessed\nwhat I'm gonna guess. I've only guessed two and\nI've already forgotten. - Okay, all right. - [Stevie] Okay, three, two, one. - Smucker's! - Jif. I think this is Jif. - Hm. - Have I not already guessed Jif? - [Stevie] Yep. - Okay.\n(Rhett laughs) Well.\n- Yep. - I think this one's the Jif one. - Uh-oh. - [Rhett And Link] Round four. - Bring it in! Now Rhett, how often\ndo you dip a raw spoon into some peanut butter\nand just eat it straight? - Uh, three times a week. - Three times a week? - And then another two times a week, I take a dark chocolate\nbar and take a square and I dip that directly\ninto peanut butter. - I don't have that. - And then one time a\nweek, I take the spoon and I put it in the peanut butter and then I get chocolate chips and I decorate the peanut\nbutter with chocolate chips. That's every day of the week, my friend. - Mm, while you been\nyapping, I been tasting. And my answer, not that you asked, but-- - This is the moment I'm always\na little bit nervous about. - I do, I dip a raw spoon into\npeanut butter I would say .8 times a day. - Oh. - This one is very nutty. - Very nutty, like I\nactually, I felt the nuts. I literally felt the nuts in my mouth. - Even though it's smooth, it's\nlike, well is that crunchy? It's not smooth, but it's not crunchy. - There's nut particulates in there. - There's nut particulates. - I'm not particular\nabout my nut particulates. - Me neither, man.\n- There's some in there. - I don't know it's tough because-- - I don't like it when it's that nutty. - It's less processed so it's probably-- - I like it more processed.\n- A better. - I like it more processed. I haven't completely, you\nknow, there's a big part-- - It's oilier.\n- Of my heart that's still in the south. (chuckles) - But it's still peanut-- - North Carolina, I haven't\ncompletely converted yet. - I'm gonna give it a seven though. - I'm going all the way\ndown to a six on this one. - Whoa! - Yep, sorry! - Who is it?\n- I think I know. - Let's guess. - [Stevie] Okay three, two, one. - [Together] Justin's. - Yeah.\n- Gotta be, right? - It's gotta be.\n- Yeah. - Yep. - Yep!\n- Yep! - Yeah!\n- Yah! - Gotta be Justin's.\n- Yes, expensive! - Better be! - [Rhett And Link] Round five. - Bring it in. Yeah and as a family, we\neat so much peanut butter. I venture to say we may\neat more peanut butter than your family. We go through like--\n- Huh? - A large thing of peanut butter. Every single week. - Yeah I don't let anyone except me eat peanut butter in my house. It's all mine! - Oh. What? Oh gosh. - That is, it is some thick peanut butter. - That's nuttier than the last one. - It is and it, it's thicker too, man. - I'm afraid to go back\nin, it's too messy. - But I'll be honest, I can't-- - Be honest. - I can't tell if what\nI'm experience with like the oiliness and the thickness means that it's more expensive or less expensive. You know what I'm saying? It could go either way\nwhen it's not that like, straight down the line, ultra-creamy. - I don't know.\n- You remember whipped Peter Pan peanut butter? - I didn't get into that. - It had a lot of air in it, it was like they were\nbasically selling you half the peanut butter. - That felt like a sin to me. - That was fun. That was fun to eat for awhile. But what am I giving this? I'm not loving this,\nI'm giving this a four. - Yeah, this is even more\nnatural than the last one. I'm going all the way down to a five. - So you think it's more\nnatural, not more generic? - I could be trying to throw you off. - Could be. - Because I really wanna\nbe the lord of the nuts. - Mm. - [Stevie] You ready? - Yeah.\n- Three, two, one. - Smucker's.\n- Justin's. - Oh you doubling up on the Justin's? - Yeah I'm going double Justin. - That ain't Justin's, man. No way.\n- Really? - There's no way.\n- Okay. - [Rhett And Link] Round six. - And now to taste the\nfinal peanut butter. \u266a It's the final peanut butter \u266a (crew laughs) - I'm blindfolded, ma'am, so I cannot see who you are or were. - I have no idea who that was. The more I think about it,\nthe more confused I get. - It was definitely, it\nwas definitely Stevie. (Rhett chuckles) I don't know who it was, maybe\nit was Micah, I don't know. - Is it in there? - Bring it in! \u266a It's the final peanut butter \u266a - Mm.\n- Mm! That's good! - Mm. Wow. - See, this one's a little oilier. - That's real good. - But in terms of taste. - Oh, that's my favorite, that's a nine. Right off the bat. - I actually-- - Somebody's doing something right! - I think this one's a\nlittle loose for my taste. - A little loose? - It's a little oily and it\nkinda, it's overly spreadable. - (chuckles) I don't want\nit to be too spreadable. - I mean-- - I wanna work for this sandwich. - Don't get me wrong, it tastes great and I love basically all of them, but I'm gonna give it a seven. - Oh really, okay. - Yeah. Do I know what it is? No.\n- I have a guess. I have a guess. - Well, I don't know, maybe, hm. That was weird. - Don't screw it up, Link. - It's good but different. - I haven't guessed the Walmart brand yet. - Me neither. - [Stevie] Okay you ready? - I don't know if this is it or not. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Skippy.\n- Jif! - Skippy Skippy Skippy\nSkippy Skippy Skippy! - I went with Jif. - I don't think that was Jif. - I haven't had Jif in years, but-- - Okay, that's it, right,\ncan we remove the blinders? - [Stevie] Remove your blindfolds.

how peanut butter could be causing problems in your body notifications are going out as we are streaming live worldwide via YouTube and we're going to talk about what happens when you eat too much peanut butter hello raylene hello miss Linder so we're going to fill the chat rooms up but a great topic that many of us are going to find is quite amazing and what I'm going to do with you is I'm going to teach you something that's going to make miracles in your body you're going to say what and you're going to understand that once you understand the concept between peanut butter or any similar food that we're going to go into it I want to jump the done here that you're going to understand the the reason why peanut butter if not probably eaten can cause lots of inflammation peanut butter is an inflammatory food a lot of people who have chronic neck problems spinal problems arthritis arthritic problems rheumatoid problems immune problems or any kind of inflammatory problem it can be coming because of improper diet so let's go into it right now I'm sure you guys are excited to learn this because I love this particular topic it's a very simple topic and it's kind of can't give you a a really good understanding about the basis of peanut butter now I'm going to move through this quick and I will come back to some specific slides and pictures and I will present that to you after I discuss a little bit about the peanut butter part of it but we know that peanuts are very healthy they have lots of protein they have fiber there's a great snack the issue here the first thing I want to mention to everyone out there is they are omega-6 fatty acids now we're going to just remember omega-6 fatty acids too many of these omega-6 fatty acids we get in our diet which is inflammatory so let's just remember that omega-6 fatty acid acids for peanut butter now I'm going to come back to the why we develop inflammation and I'm going to let me just tell you briefly now and I'll actually hit it harder later it's because we have an imbalance of our omega-6 as compared to our omega-3s and I mean a serious imbalance and I'm going to explain this to you and I'm going to teach you something on how you can eat peanut butter and stay healthy and get rid of pain because I know as a fact that many of your conditions right now are related to diet diet meaning inflammatory we realize that the majority of our diet is entailed or composed of omega-6 fatty acids and I'll show you what these omega sixes are that you are eating that you may not realize it I'll go over that with you so understand I don't want to knock I don't want to knock omega-6 is because the negative sixes are molecules within our body that makes a important healing occur it affects our brain function or growth and development our skin our here our bone strength our metabolic balance or reproductive organs and understand we are never deficient in omega-6 we are never deficient although we are deficient in omega-3 now go over that in a second so we realize that the omega sixes are very very high in our diet it's typically 14 15 25 times higher than what it should be in comparison to omega-3 and understand that a diet correlated with increase heart disease cancer diabetes rheumatoid autoimmune has an effect on inflammation everything in our body has a direct effect on inflammation every disease known to man there's always inflammation chronic inflammation low omega-3s high omega sixes they've done studies they've seen thousands of people attributed to many different forms of diseases arthritis cancer because of high omega sixes and so what we're going to learn here we're going to learn that the close to the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 the healthier you're going to be and your inflammation is going to start to subside and you start to feel better I will guarantee that you will see changes if you get rid of inflammation now I want you to give you a little background that about peanut butter it it serves a very zesty amount of fat approximately a hundred gram serving of peanuts 560 calories 49 grams of fat 49 grams of fat 16 grams coming from omega-6 at peanuts claw contained basically that amount of omega-3 now peanuts also contain high amounts of protein which we know is healthy for you and there are great things that it does make a great snack so if you're going to ask me about peanut butter I would definitely recommend organic why there are many reasons why because you want to make sure that you don't have pesticides and and contamination and mold because a lot of peanuts are grown on the ground and when it's organic it's not going on the ground there are other ways that is stored and I'm not going to go into depth of that but organic peanut butter is healthier there's no question so I want you to understand there's a study here from the Harvard Medical School and they talk about the high proportion of fat in peanuts and it does help heart disease we do we know that because it's monounsaturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids lowers cholesterol helps heart disease and they are good fats so there are good things about peanuts and I don't want to knock them but I'm going to show you something very simple that's going to make this whole program worth it that you're going to understand if you just make a little change and that's my that's my mission today I think you're really going to have some great benefits from listening today so I'm not going to go into the studies because I don't want to waste the calories but women should consume about 1600 to 2,400 calories a day while men should need about 2,000 to 3,000 calories a day and this means that a serving of peanut butter consists of about 10 percent of your daily recommended intake and it's easy to consume a couple spoonfuls and you're on your way we know it gives you great energy so let's just briefly go into a couple of things let's talk about the omega sixes and let's get rid of this and look at these omega sixes these are the common things that you eat everyday or or cook with you look at your your palm kernel oil that's mixed with your foods you look at your sunflower your olive oil your your avocado oil your flaxseed oil your almond oil your peanut oil in other words if you're cooking you're using oils and these oils consume a very high amount of omega-6 and very little bit of omega-3 so we are obviously taking in tremendous amounts of omega-6 in our lifetime tremendous amounts and the ratio is from here to here we're not even close ideally you'll be nice to get two to one or three to one or four to one or even five to one but people are 25 to 130 to 140 to 150 to one ratio they have so much omega-6 in their body compared to the amount of mega three so you're going to be able to come back to this this particular chart as this will be posted on my channel let's go ahead ahead and look at the omega-3s common foods you have the flax seeds and navy beans the walnuts cold-pressed olive oil that has omega-3 more omega-3 in there leafy green vegetables salmon pecans now one of my favorite and I and I did make a separate slide for this if you really really want to stay healthy one of my favorite right here probably the best omega-3 is a chia seed and there are chia pudding that I'm going to start to make I just had one the other day and think about this it's five times more calcium than milk I mean five times more calcium than milk can you imagine that's a lot of calcium and we're talking about osteoporosis and a lot of our programs we see it worldwide there are seven times more vitamin C 3 times more spinach more iron than spinach twice potassium content of a banana now you think that bananas have all the potassium chia seeds have more now eight times more omega-3 than salmon now we teach people that salmon is the best thing for omega-3 but chia seeds are better it's healthier you don't smell like fish you can put it in your puddings you can let it sit overnight you can make all kinds of nice snacks you can go on Google Google it up and I'll it's great now look at the it helps build the immune system and helps in weight loss normalizes blood sugar for diabetics arthritic clamps cleans : so you have an anti-inflammatory it helps you sleep better remove toxins removes inflammations you can read this on itself you could sprinkle on your foods and your smoothies mix it in your smoothies a great thing let's look at this picture right here guys and ladies let's look at this picture Omega 3 now Omega 3 we need more okay obviously more of you can just see the difference of the flaxseed and actually you can add the chi in there which is not on there the cod liver oil the raw butter the shrimp olive oil and less of these sunflower oils the corn oils wheat germ soy burn soybean the sesame the soft flowers the margarine the canola and almonds now I know that these things are good for you they have great monounsaturated fats in here and they do help bring down cholesterol triglycerides they increase the high-density lipoproteins but you need to get this proportion in line so you're going to ask me how many or how much omega-3 should I be taking well that's a great question the question and the answer I can give you is how much omega-6 are you taking in if you're taking in lots of omega-6 and you want to eat more peanut butter guess what you need to increase the omega-3 and if you don't get it through foods you can take omega-3s they come a thousand milligrams you can get them a thousand milligrams a pill you can take 2/3 a day 3 grams if you up your omega-3s and you still up your omega sixes you're going to be a healthy individual ah I hope that really sets off a good mindset for you guys and ladies I really hope that this will help you because I know it will because there are so many people today who have so many problems of inflammation because of the high omega-6 levels in your body and I wanted to bring it out to show you just peanut butter which is one of my favorites organic crunchy peanut butter I love it but you have to up your omega-3s god bless everyone I hope you have a pleasant night if you are here in the USA and a pleasant day particularly I see people Malaysia Asia China Africa and I wish you will you and your family will catch up soon by the way Facebook motivational doc is the best way to communicate with me I get many many many many emails through YouTube and because you are here and I'm sure

"[Music] that's pretty good welcome to wheats guys the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today's review is a good old-fashioned classic because we were taking a look at edibles and a classic edible kind at that the cookie we're finally digging into big Pete's here I've heard actually a lot of really good thing about big Pete's so I am excited to give it a try but that's a lot of calories in here haha just look at the nutrition information [ __ ] um so this is the mini cookie model which seems to be the biggest model out there for edibles in California I'm gonna say pioneered by Korova I don't know if that's actually true um that's where I first saw the the first time used some to use that model was kirova so 10 cookies 10 milligrams of THC each because that is what the regulations are you can only have ten milligrams max per individual serving and then you can only have ten servings for a total of 100 milligrams for any legal edibles so this is a big heavy ass hunk in bag of cookies there's 700 calories in total we've got a really wonderful packaging here great information lab testing results right there on the back nutrition information ingredients dosing instructions everything we even have a little story there on the back which I won't bore you with I'm just gonna take a peek right right out of here now uh okay good for you big Pete not that interesting so uh if you've never tuned into ones before unfortunately I'm gonna eat this whole friggin bag of cookies um because that's the way we're our room edibles reviews work is I eat the whole product to review the whole product and let you know how I feel about it two hours after I finished the last one of these cookies really don't have to eat 100 calories worth of cookies right now but I do it for you guys so uh I actually figured out how to open the childproof baggy on this one goomy I'm learning smells in there ooh they smell really good actually they smell like really really good peanut butter cookies there is a little bit of cannabis odor but they smell great here we are we've got the little lattice work on the top for the peanut butter cookie it looks good god damn this is great there's maybe a little bit of canvas taste but this is a good peanut butter cookie it's a lot softer I mean it's not soft but it is a lot softer than the the other mini cookies there's ones have the more Chips Ahoy brittle II thing and this is a little brittle but it's suddenly a little chewier than the others and it's great it's got a great peanut butter flavor just the right amount of crunch whoops mmm well if I have to eat ten of these at least they taste pretty good right okay chewie on the taste front guys I can tell you these are great genuinely surprised I mean I've heard good things about him but that [ __ ] was unexpected how good that was um so big thumbs up there but really guys what we all want to know is anybody can go get a mazing bag of cookies for the 20 bucks with these costs you want to make sure that these [ __ ] expensive ass cookies are gonna get you really high and for that guys you look to stick around for just a second and I will be back to you guys Oh in about two hours or so after I finish off this whole bag see you then [Music] big Pete's welcome back to wheats guys it has been about two and a half hours since I first checked in with you and I am ready to check out because big Pete's is a big ol win and the potency column look at them eyeballs red as can be man I loved big Pete's guys the cookies tasted excellent this is on the top level of hundred milligram potencies I mean this is about as potent as it gets great packaging I mean look at this you know tons of information not and not terribly ostentatious do not feel like you're spending extra money on it big Pete's man this is a huge thumbs up I could not be more happy with this the only problem is I have not yet thought of a cherry on top so I have to sit here and think of one for a second cuz I can't leave you guys without a cherry on top with something this exciting right that would feel rude I got it I got it I got it I'm gonna share with you guys a novel that I share with a lot of people that I quite like that I think have good taste like you guys cuz I think you guys all have great excellent wonderful taste is the most successful book I've ever recommended to people in terms of like batting average of them loving it I met a hundred percent right now or a thousand batting a thousand try not to mix metaphors holy [ __ ] that's a lot of build-up for the book which is then we came to the end by Jonah no not Jonah Joshua Faris Joshua Faris I think that's his name if we're not I'm going to be embarrassed great novel it's a weird novel that's told in the first person plural meaning they say like we and us instead of I and him or her and it is about the dot-com collapse an office that's like an advertising firm for dot-com companies right at the end of the dot-com collapse it is hysterical is so funny it is very poignant and it is sort of has come around to being sort of relevant again today with the shape of the tech industry so again that was then we came to the end that was a really long cherry on top and I just plucked that one out the sky love that book love big Pete's and their indica cannabis infused peanut butter mini cookies 65 million thumbs up way up in the sky but-but-but-but boom guys oh love you big Pete's I'm not a crook oh I don't know what's going on I'll see you guys on the next review", "EGVXLWNtoFM": "- Which nut butter is the better butter? - Let's talk about that. (upbeat instrumental music) Good Mythical Morning. - Now you know we love peanut butter and we know that you know\nbecause we read your fan fiction. - Yeah and you also know that we have an unfair peanut butter biased. You pointed that out many times, especially during our\nice cream tournament. It's true. But today, we're not gonna\nreopen #peanutbuttergate. Instead, we're gonna open our minds. - And our mouths. Yeah, 'cause today we're\ntrying other butters made from other nut\nmothers to find the best. It's time for I Can't\nBelieve It's Nut Butter, Nut Butter Edition. - We're gonna be tasting\nsix different nut butters that are not peanut butter. They are pine nut butter. - Pistachio.\n- Brazil nut. - Pili nut.\n- Pecan. - And walnut. Or pecan if you're not us. - Yeah, whatever.\n- But we are us, pecan. We're gonna be scoring each\none to determine the best and we're also gonna be trying\nto guess which is which. The loser in the end\nwill get a nut stache. (laughs) Whatever that is. (upbeat instrumental music) As you can see, we can't. - Okay, every single nut butter\nis going to be brought to us by the patent pending Nut Butler. - Okay.\n- Which, I believe, is just a person with a glove on. - No, it's just the glove\nand the spoon itself. - Yeah, not the person. We can't patent a person. - I love some butters, let's get it in. Oh yeah. That's got some oil to it. - This is gonna get\nreally nasty on my side. - It's very almond--\n- A little bitter. - It's very almond butter like. You're right, but there's\na bitter aftertaste. - What's a pili nut? Is that a trick? - Yeah, y'all gotta tell us what is pili? - [Stevie] It's a nut. - It's a nut.\n- It's a nut. - This one kind of has\na sunflower aftertaste. Like a sunflower seed. - Man, okay, it's got a bitterness, which I know at least\none of the nuts in the, that we're talking about,\nhas a taste like this, but I don't know if it goes far enough to get to the nut that I'm thinking of. Is there a bridge to the\nnut that I'm thinking of that is this nut? - Yeah this is a weird, weird tasting nut. First of all, let's just\nsay how much we like it on a scale of one to 10.\n- Oh. It's like a five to me. It's like right down in the middle. It's not as sweet as I want it to be. - Yeah, once you factor\nin that aftertaste, it's got a little bitterness to it. I'm actually giving this a three. I don't see myself purchasing this off a shelf any time soon. - [Stevie] Ready to guess? - Oh yeah.\n- Okay. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Brazil nut.\n- Pecan. I think it's a pecan, which I say pecan. (upbeat instrumental music) Time for another one. - Nut us up, butlers. - Something's on my hand. Okay, there's plenty there. - Okay, all right. - Oh. - Does a Nut Butler hand out paper towels? Oh, he does. - That is an interesting taste. - Okay.\n- That-- - Now that is a specific nut. - Yeah.\n- Ha ha, I guess they all are technically. - I think we're thinking the same thing, if you're thinking what I'm thinking, then we are thinking-- - But sometimes I'm thinking\nthe thing that I'm thinking and I'm thinking exactly the\nwrong thing that I'm thinking. That's the weird thing\nabout having a blindfold on. Is you think things that you\nwouldn't otherwise think. - Yeah, 'cause you can't see.\n- You can't see. - You can only taste and\nfeel with your mouth. Are you liking this one? - No, because I don't like this nut. Three.\n- Oh dang. I like this pretty good. This one's bringing back memories for me. - What kind of memories? - Fond memories. - You got memories of nuts? Uh huh. I'm giving this, I mean it's not great. I mean, shoot man, it's at least a five. - Okay, well that's not that great. - [Stevie] Okay, three, two, one. - Walnut.\n- This is pecan, man. - You're right.\n- This is definitely pecan. (laughs) Why didn't you guess pecan? - I don't know, man. Are you sure? - There was, behind my nanny's\nhouse, there's a pecan tree and every year at that time, and if I'm not mistaken,\nsome every other year it would be like a full drop of pecans. I think that's what we\nlearned on this show. - There's a bitterness to a pecan that made me think it\nwas a, I don't know man. - I'm answering that for\nevery single one apparently. - Okay, all right. (upbeat instrumental music) - Butter me, butler. - Whoa. Man.\n- This one's-- This one's a different kind of creamy. - That's got some bite to it. It grabs your mouth like a glue. - Oh yeah, I can't get my mouth apart. And it tastes horrible. - No, it doesn't taste horrible. - Yeah, it tastes horrible.\n- No, no, no. I'm very fond of this.\n- Ew, really? - We got different nut tastes, man. - There's something rotten in it. No, no, seven.\n- What? - That's good, I like it. Two.\n- Oh Link, your situation is-- - What's happening? - [Stevie] There's nut butter everywhere. - [Rhett] You need to get a paper towel-- - Tell me what to do Stevie. - [Stevie] Okay, yeah,\nyou got it, you got it. Just, okay. - Just swallow.\n- Just swallow. - It's really hard to swallow. - If I'm wrong about this,\nmy nut tasting ability is, my nut compass is just way off. - Oh, you think you know what this is? - Yeah.\n- Okay. - But my nut compass\nwas off last time, so-- - I don't know what a pili is, that's the big wild card, right? - Yeah, yeah. Well it's a big nut. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Pistachio.\n- Oh crap, you're right. It's pistachio. - But you said pili.\n- I forgot. I said pili.\n- You said pili. That's pistachio, that's got to be. - I can taste that green-- - I love it, it's green. - Once I know what it is, I like it, but man, when you, there's-- - It caught you off guard, I know. - There's something nasty in a pistachio. - It's a sneaky nut.\n- Pisnastnio. (upbeat instrumental music) - Every quarter we release what we call a collectible item as part of the 3rd Degree Mythical Society Membership and this quarter that is\nthe I'm on Vacation LP. It's got an exclusive brand new song. - It's over there. - There.\n- Is that, over there. - That was my face. And also, a remix of\nthe I'm on Vacation song and the I'm on Vacation song itself. - And Why I Travel, brand new\nsong, only performed live, never released anywhere. Get it, mythicalsociety.com. Bring it in. Okay. This one got a little crunchiness. - What? That's got some vanilla in it. - No, no, no.\n- Or else that's what the nut tastes like.\n- That's a weird nut. - That's a nut that I'm not\nfamiliar with, I believe. - Very oily.\n- That's a nut I never met. - See I didn't know they made\npine nuts in the nut butter. I like a good pine nut on a salad. - Yeah, yeah.\n- You know? - Sometimes I'll just get\ninto a bowl of pine nuts and just go at it, just me and the nuts. - Oh yeah, just pour them into your hand. They're like little critters. - You know how easily\nyou can burn a pine nut? If you turn around, take a phone call, answer the door, meet the\nmailman, meet the milk man, you can burn a pine nut. - I've never met a milk man. - You never met a milk man? - Never met a milk man I didn't like. Ha ha, you didn't let me finish. (laughs) Ha ha ha, I got ya. - You ever met a nut\nman you couldn't milk? (laughs) - I'm not answering that. You know what, I am answering that. Yes, all of them. I couldn't milk any nut man that I've met. - I don't like this, four, four. - I like this okay. I like it a lot.\n- Our nut-- - Six.\n- Our nut compass is, totally different directions man. - I'm leaving room for\nsomething I actually like and that's why six is the best I can give to something that I don't\nreally like but wanna like. - Okay.\n- Three-- - I don't know what it is.\n- Two, one. - Pili.\n- Pine nuts. - It might be pine nut, but I'm not familiar with\nit, so I'm saying pili. (upbeat instrumental music) All right, hit us.\n- Here it is. Oh that's smooth. And odd. That doesn't taste good to me, which means you'll probably like it. - That did not sit well at first, (coughs) but as it settles in, I begin to understand it. I begin to connect with it. - It does get better the more you eat. - It's working it's way from\na three to a four to a five to a six to settles at six. - It's very buttery.\n- Yeah, yeah, so buttery. - It's like there's more fat in this. I haven't guessed walnut. I thought that walnut would be obvious. I should've guessed pistachio. I'm pretty sure you got that one right. That was the most obvious\none in retrospect. Dang.\n- Man, nut thoughts with Link. - I know what this is. - I feel confident in this answer. - I know without a shadow of a doubt. - All right, well let's guess. - [Stevie] Did you give it a score, Link? - He did not, I was hoping. - Now that I know what\nit is, I'm going higher. I'm gonna give it a seven. - [Stevie] Oh my, okay. Three, two, one. - [Both] Pine nut. - Definitely a pine nut.\n- Definitely a pine nut. - Yeah.\n- Yeah, from the pine state, North Carolina. - You dip out your salad\nwith pine nuts in it and then at the end, you\nstill got a lot of pine nuts that Plinkoed to the bottom and you just get to eat a handful. - You know how easy it\nis to burn a pine nut? - I know it's pretty\neasy, that's what I hear. - Right.\n- You ever milked a nut man? (laughs) (upbeats instrumental music) - Okay, last nut butter. - I feel like I'm not doing well. (groans) (laughing) - My Nut Butler go so aggressive with me. - All of these are oily. - This is awful. - Again, man, I like\nthis one, maybe the most. - This tastes, I can't even swallow it. - That's so weird 'cause I like the taste. What do you not like about it? - The texture, the taste, the feel, the emotions that it's causing me to have. - The texture is just normal nut butter, there's nothing weird about the texture. - No, it felt like a ball of\nrubber from the beginning. It's awful. - Yeah, but your problem is you don't\neat nut butter blindfolded and you're being thrown off. It's not bad at all. - I'm not a nut butter\nblindfolded eating boy. - Oh, the aftertaste on this one gets odd. - Man, it's not good. It tastes like something, like\na byproduct of nut butter. - Man, I haven't ranked anything above what I believe to pine nuts. - This is a one. - I really-- - This is as bad as nut butter can be. - I thought I would have\nsome nines, some tens and some eights. And I also thought I'd be better at this. I'm just disappointed all around. All right, I'm gonna give it a-- - Good gracious. - The longer I taste\nit, the worse it gets. But still, seven. - It's so unfamiliar too. - I don't know what it is. - I don't know. My instinct is telling\nme to, I don't know. - Just guess.\n- I'll try. - [Stevie] Three, two, one. - Brazil nut.\n- Walnut. Oh, you could be right. - You think this is the walnut? - You could be right, you could be right. Can we deblindfold?\n- You may deblindfold. - Yeah, I mean--\n- It's awful. - None of those had me excited. - The best next, the nest bex-- (laughing) - How did we do Stevie? - Peanut butter's the best-- - [Stevie] How do you think that you did? - Horrible.\n- I think I got three right. - Pistachio and pine nut-- - I got two or three right.\n- He beat me. - [Stevie] Link, you got two correct. - What's the second one I got-- - Rhett--\n- Correct besides pine nut? - Don't tell him yet.\n- Okay. - [Stevie] You got four correct. - Hey, nut butter boy. - [Stevie] And your favorite nut butter was the pine nut butter\nfollowed by the pili butter. - Pili butter, wild pine odors. You got an elephant making\npine nut butter on there. - Hold on, do they really use\nelephants for it because-- - All right, we're gonna investigate more. No, they don't.\n- Good. - We're gonna investigate more of this in Good Mythical More, but for\nnow I do want to remind you, if you want to help write an episode of Good Mythical Morning with\nthe Mythical Beast Takeover, today is the last day for you to apply.

familiar with peanut butters I feel like running oil doesn't jump out at you I'm now on a bomb on a peanut butter buzz now it looks the exact same it's the exact same pic of me getting brave taking more than I usually take this better not go wrong I think it's a nice one I think it might be the nicest one I didn't think I actually like it that is beautiful lovely mmm it just tastes like a big

ironic I said nobody's nobody's sitting down with for Jackson days do you never know you are a peanut butter convert enlightening that's what I found that's amazing I've never met like somebody so

your dispensary and today we are taking another edible review we are taking another edible review I believe we're doing another edible review we're taking none but we are taking a look at my best buddies over at Kanak oh I wish I knew some folks over I can't a co so I could give them a big ol hug and let them know that they do right by us so guys we are taking a look at another canna co-product another one of their 100 milligram 10 milligram or excuse me one of their 100 milligram edibles that are broken into 10 10 milligram pieces there we go we got that out correctly as you can see they have a sticker right there 10 10 milligrams squared pieces per package frankly it's a little ludicrous it's just a cookie with barely cut ten little pie shaped or you know pizza is shaped slices out of it it's it's absurd it's absurd it's just to know that they can say they're compliant with the new regulations but everybody knows the new regulations are horse manure and so this is the kind of stupid lengths that Kuster companies are gonna go to to get compliant even though it's helping nobody and it's just making everything a little bit more worse but anyways doesn't matter still really really excited for this product this is the candy coat peanut butter crunch cookie picked it up for $8 here in my Long Beach dispensary a pretty good deal for a hundred milligram edible and especially for one that if history repeats itself and the reason I am is speaking so graciously about canna Co is they've never failed me in the past they've always been both incredibly tasty for inedible and very very potent for the milligram each listed also love peanut butter cookies so got a very very high expectations for this one so this is as I said there are peanut butter crunch cookie with chewy delicious peanut butter chip cookie topped with crushed peanuts sprinkles sounds delicious to me Kanako's patented probably not actually patented but nice box there nice packaging it's got all the information you want ingredients nutrition facts if not unfortunately their actual I don't believe they have their lab testing on there but um other than that it's a great package um a nice nicely laid out nicely designed all that fun stuff and then the inside we have the actual edible right here let's go ahead and open it up and give it a taste and if this is the first time you have tuned into a wheats review before the most important thing to know is that I will be coming back to you guys in two hours actually it's gonna be closer to three hours this time cuz we got to go see a movie and after I get out of this movie I will be sure to let you know how this cookie is actually hitting me that's what you're really in it for not so much how it makes how much it tastes but more about how it makes you feel so this is the cookie that's broken into ten parts as you can see it's ten easily defined easy to break apart pieces not at all just trying to fake their way into compliance because you know why not you can see they doesn't even go all the way through to the bottom but hey who cares I literally prefer it this way so here we go here is the peanut butter crunch cookie it's good it's really good sorry I'd shoot for such a long time there but I always get people yelling at me for talking with my mouth full let you know sometimes you got to you you gotta get it out really like the taste of this cookie as it the title implies nice and crunchy rich peanut butter taste no cannabis taste really to speak of I didn't detect any if you like your peanut butter cookies crunchy you're gonna like this one men at least for the first half of this review of the first part the taste part can't code knocks it out of the park again but for the more important part how's it gonna make me feel well guys you're gonna have to wait a couple of seconds to find out me I'll let you know as soon as I get out of the movie exactly how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeks guys and I will see you in just a bit many hours since I checked in with you and my high has actually gone way down but that is not in any way to suggest and again I am sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you guys but that is in no way to suggest that there's anything wrong with this Kanaka peanut butter crunch cookie it is amazing this is another another winner from canna Co even these many many many many hours later I am still high as I said I picked this up for eight bucks it tasted delicious was a hell of a value what else needs to be said um at this point I think I'm largely sadly done with canna Co outside of two exceptions I am going to review their paleo bar because I know a lot of people want to know about edibles that are gluten-free or vegan or sugar-free or any of those things so I'm going to review their chocolate paleo bar which I'll have out at some point and then I still do have ambitions of finding one of their 1000 milligrams and reviewing that maybe maybe for our 4/20 special perhaps maybe maybe we'll do it for 4/20 or maybe our 2006 chrysler it's a great tasting cookie it's a potent edible it's affordable there is nothing else that I can really say about Kanaka at this point other than buy them buy it if you see it if you haven't yet what are you waiting for this is I mean I said it many times and I will say it again this is my favorite these are my favorite people who make edibles there are they they work magic that other people seem to not only not only not only not possess but are not even in the same universe of Kanako's great stuff if you see that peanut butter crunch cookie give it a shot if you see any Kanaka product give it a shot and that guys is gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "5vc0gJmrXgU": "what's up six-pack ABS calm its Thomas de Lauer your lead nutritionist and today kind of raining on your parade a little bit I'm gonna tell you all about peanut butter and I'm going to tell you that the peanut butter you've probably been eating is actually not too good for you and I'm not just talking about from an arterial side of things like with your arteries and with your veins and everything like that I'm talking about just in general but it could be slowing down your progress so the first woman I want to talk about it's just the general regular peanut butters when we have peanut butters I really like to break them down into three different classifications we've got the basic peanut butters the skips the jiffy's the main big stream mainstream ones okay then we've got the natural peanut butters okay the ones that call themselves natural but if you look at the ingredients they've got some things that I'm going to point out okay then we've got what I call the real peanut butters the peanut butters that quite honestly are just peanuts and salt okay that's it but let me break down the reasoning and we break down what you should be leaning towards and I also want to give you some alternatives okay so when we look at regular peanut butters basically they are containing something known as hydrogenated oils now to add insult to injury I'm going to explain the hydrogenation process but these are usually hydrogenated soybean oils okay and we're not talking about good-quality soy we're talking about low-quality soy that is an extremely extremely phytoestrogen ik property that's gonna cause you to have lower testosterone levels and higher estrogen levels which is going to make it so that's much much more difficult to burn fat it's gonna make it very very difficult for you so that's problem number one problem number two is the hydrogenation process in and of itself so hydrogenation looks something like this you have a fat molecule normally you have a few hydrogen atoms that are in a fat molecule to make a fat saturated it has to have a bunch of hydrogen molecules every single seat at the table every single hydrogen bond needs to be totally occupied with hydrogen so basically it becomes saturated well what ends up happening with the hydrogenation process is you end up having this artificial hydrogen that's added into the mix or it's a real hydrogen as its artificially added so I want you to think of it like this you have a dinner table in this dinner table has multiple seats at it okay and you have every single seat occupied with a hydrogen that means there's no room for anything else to get in it's just a saturated fat okay but if a fat doesn't naturally have those hydrogen seats occupied we're basically manufacturing it and adding them in that is my friends a definition of a trans fat and a trans fat is metabolized very poorly in the body so you might be thinking well I'm young I don't really care about trans fats because I don't care about my arteries right now well let me tell you something it has more of an impact than just that a regular fat takes about 18 days to completely start breaking down in terms of like a it's called a cyst fat C is basically if it's a regular diglyceride or even a monoglyceride it's gonna break down in that period of time but a trans fat is actually significantly slower to break down the body it takes 51 days for just half of that fat to break down in your body you see trans fats end up stopping enzymatic functions that allow us to break down fats we'll do the math that's not exactly good for fat loss right it's not just about the fact that it clogs up your arteries it's actually slowing things down so we've got the estrogen it properties plus we've got the trans fat hydrogenation properties just a no-go okay regular peanut butter it doesn't matter how much of a budget you're on spend a couple extra bucks and get the good stuff okay then we have the natural peanut butters here's the thing with the natural peanut butters they're better okay they don't contain the normal hydrogenated things but they still have a bunch of sugar and they still have palm oil palm oil by itself is not that bad but what ends up happening with palm oil is something pretty interesting when it's refined when it's refined it actually becomes a carcinogen which means it's causing cancer not a good thing we don't necessarily want Kat right yeah that's problem number one and you may not be worried too much about that one right now so let's talk about problem number two with the natural peanut butters okay when you combine this palm oil with the refinement process or anything like that you create something known as a glistening fatty acid ester these glistening fatty acid esters are what is called a GNote auxin a gino toxin is something that harms your basically your genetic code basically being able to write scribe DNA and RNA that may not sound like much but our DNA and our RNA dictates how much muscle we build or how much fat we burn so if you have something that is a toxin to that area of the body that can really mess things up and really screw you over okay but that's not the only problem natural ones they still have monoglycerides and they still have diglycerides now a monoglyceride is a fatty acid molecule that is bound to a glycerin a diglyceride is two fatty acid molecules that are bound to a glycerin now get this you ever hear of a triglyceride yeah we never want them elevated doing when we get our blood work done our doctors say your triglycerides are high bad things well guess what monoglyceride diglyceride only one step away from a triglyceride and guess what the FDA doesn't care if it has a mono or a diglyceride in it they don't have to call it a trans fat even though it's only one small step away from becoming a trans fat any scary stuff so you definitely want to be avoiding those two or at least make sure you're reading the label so when it comes down to it you're left with basically the organic peanut butters you're left with ones that on the label say they've got peanuts in them and they've got salt in them it doesn't matter what the other brands say if it has more than that in it you typically don't want it that is it you want the benefits from the legumes you want the benefits from the oils okay you're trying to get the right balance of fats omega-3 and omega-6 don't add the palm oil that's been refined don't add the soybean oil why it's just slowing you down and triggering inflammation so flat out if you want to be able to recover from your workouts you want to be able to get in good shape you need to just spend the extra dollar to get the organic stuff that just has the peanuts and just has the salt and if you're looking for alternatives almond butter is a great one just be cognizant of the almond butter and try to get one that's a smooth almond butter because the last thing that you want is to be ingesting chunks of almonds that are extremely hard to break down because the phytic acid which I've talked about in other

you in the next video [Music]", "A7tJR1A-ybc": "what is going on guys Joey Suggs here welcome to today's video and welcome to the very first 2-minute diet tip pretty self-explanatory here's how it's going to go I'm going to throw two minutes up on the clock and explain to you one diet tip that I found that's helped me and hopefully you can help you too if you guys like this idea and what we do more videos like this make sure if you press the like button down below and subscribe to the channel if you're new because I'm dropping content all the time and you need to be here see it alright so two minutes on the clock starting now let's get into it today I want to talk to you about powdered peanut butter quick background powder peeler is literally peanut butter that has been dehydrated and has no oils or water in it the ingredients are just peanuts and salt and all you have to do is mix it with some sort of liquid whether it be water I like almond milk and that's how you get your creamy peanut butter consistency from the powder so there are a bunch of benefits of powdered peanut butter I'm gonna go over a few of them with you right now the first one is calories there are 50 calories in two tablespoons of powdered peanut butter whereas if you're talking about peanut butter you're gonna be looking at around 200 to 210 calories in two tablespoons of peanut butter not to mention that you're getting about the same volume of both of these foods so a quarter of the calories for the same volume sounds like a win to me number two it is taste the taste of this stuff is pretty dang close to peanut butter I mean it's made from peanuts so you're still getting that super nutty delicious taste and a lot of people crave up next flavor options there are so many flavor options of powdered peanut butter maybe more than normal peanut butter you have things like chocolate normal almond almond butter ya have almond butter it's incredible so there's definitely a lot to choose from whenever you're picking out your powdered peanut butter and they're all around the same calories the next benefit is macros the macros of powdered peanut butter are 5 grams of carbs one and a half grams of fat in 5 grams of protein you really can't ask for better macros like I said and that makes up the 50 calories which is two tablespoons of this stuff also there's so many options not only in flavors but also in what you can mix this stuff in you can put it into protein shakes pancake mixes put it on top of yogurt put it with milk boy happier with your cereal put it in your oatmeal there's just so many options to use this to either enhance your food or anywhere that you would normally use peanut butter this would go great so there are just some of the benefits that go in with this powdered peanut butter right here now there are a couple downsides one being that does take a little bit of time to make so you have to get your tablespoon measure I just keep one in the container but you have to get a tablespoon measure measure out two tablespoons and then you have to measure out two tablespoons of some kind of liquid whether it be water on the whatever and then mix it together it takes a minute or so but the ease of use isn't quite as easy as typical peanut butter you get it out stick your finger in it whatever and there you go and another downside I don't know if this one's really that true but from what I've looked up you can't make a bunch of it and store it I can't make this entire thing and then just store the peanut butter in this thing I guess for some reason the peanuts start to ferment or something and it gets bad I don't really know but I've read on the internet that you can't make a bunch of it at once so I have it alright so that concludes my 2-minute diet tip did I stay within two minutes I don't know if I didn't go leave a comment down below and give me some hate if I did go leave a comment down below and give me some love either way drop a comment down

episode we are taking our second look at the kirova mini cookies that will soon be sweeping the edible nation we have already reviewed their saturday-morning many cookies and this time we are coming at you with the chocolate chip mini cookies available for 10 bucks at most dispensaries a pretty decent value another huge package if you watch my first review on this really my only complaint was the amount of stuff that you have to eat if you want to eat the whole package I know it's designed to be ten servings but let's be honest a lot of us are going to be eating the whole package and there are ten little mini cookies in here and it's a lot to get through fancy packaging really like the packaging outside of the [ __ ] child resistant zipper which is a practical impossibility for me to get open I'm just gonna cut these open with scissors and get right into it I really like the taste of the Saturday morning cookies the chocolate chip cookie I've had one of they're like regular chocolate chip cookies in the past it's not my favorite but it's not terrible by any stretch of the imagination so we'll see how the mini cookies fare let's go ahead and cut into them give them a taste here see how we're gonna like them again I would recommend have some scissors already if you're gonna get these bad boys so here we are here are their adorable little mini cookies they seem smaller than the sorry morning cookies but that could be just a mistake in my brain just pop it in the old mouth okay about what I remember be regular kirova chocolate-chip-cookie like hey les the cookie is way softer than the Saturday morning cookie way way softer and an ever so slight cannabis taste to it but not bad mostly just a okay chocolate chip cookie um I preferred the Saturday morning cookie to these in terms of taste but but these aren't bad so guys I'm gonna eat what eight more some two [ __ ] and I will see you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review process not how it tastes but how it makes you feel so guys I'll see you in two hours to let you know thanks for watching peace two hours have passed and I am back welcome to weed skies and we are talking kirova mini cookies chocolate chip cookies hundred milligrams ten servings each oh they're good they're good I'm at maybe a about a six now maybe five and a half somewhere in there so you know about what you would expect for a hundred milligram product it may be a little bit higher than the traditional hundred milligrams ten bucks pretty good value cases okay they weren't my favorite I again prefer the saturday-morning many cookies in that regard but I in this new edible future that we're all going to have of this hundred milligram limit here in California these are probably going to still be top tier I'm definitely looking forward to finding some more of the new generation of edibles to review I'm hoping and assuming that Korova will still be a quality brand in the future I like the way the packaging is designed except for the terrible child-resistant stuff it's just so difficult to open but i understand they have to do it again to keep up with the regulations but on that I think the packaging is still quite handsome and I do like the additional information on the back of having like ingredients and nutritional information and all that fun stuff didn't really have that before so good to see it on there so yeah that's gonna be another thumbs up for me of the new generation of Korova reviews or edibles excuse me still it is not as good as their current edibles that they have out there there are 150 s 250 s yada yada yada so on and so forth stock up on those because those are going to be better values for sure if your dispensary still carries those and these grab the original line first but you know if they only have these you know it'll it won't it won't kill you and that guys is gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you

way to prepare than a large amount of donuts in Reese's Peanut Butter Cup I've done a few Krispy Kreme challenges in my day and you know what I always do I try to get it does it down as fast as possible you've reached your desired destination diabetes aka Krispy Kreme donuts too and of finishing two minutes even that I have done a few contests since my last Krispy Kreme challenge I figured you know what let's do another no set time for this everybody I was hoping I survived without further ado everybody this is the peanut butter Krispy Kreme castle let's do this as soon as this hits 20 we start I am trying to beat two minutes here this two minutes is my time to be end up finishing two minutes let's do this [Music] [Music] damn 136 folks oh I'd say I'm proud of that time let me just say right now now we have to move on to that monstrosity I mean I couldn't figure out which one to start with so I figured you know what let's go with the new Reese's Peanut Butter Cup [Music] very

snapchat Twitter Instagram unit the drill thanks for watching the video everybody you go ahead", "96y9vctDktw": "hey guys Rebecca from elements of eternity so today I am working with cannabis again I am making a edible medicine I'm making chocolate peanut butter truffles these are actually going to be dipped in homemade organic chocolate so I already D carved my marijuana and medicine and today I am using sunset sherbert this strain is actually known as galette oh it's a indica dominant hybrid 85% indicus of 15% sativa strain it's very potent it tested about 29% it's mom and dad is Girl Scout cookie and pink panties actually so I was wanting to make an extra strength medicine here I wanted them to be about a hundred milligrams apiece by the time I'm done with them now for starters they recommend around 10 milligrams and see how it goes so to make my butter I used a organic here's my gonna be the mix I know it's cream but it tastes just like the inside of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup but I used an organic hormone-free churned butter cream like a butter and organic coconut oil is going to be for my chocolate and what I did was I usually it is about two ounces per pound of butters but I actually used three and I didn't use trim I actually use the buds I got this from the cultivation car farm the other day and I grind this up so I ground up the three ounces of this and to measure your THC when you're making edible guys it's always a rule of thumb that one gram of cannabis has a thousand milligrams of dry weight that means a strain house like say for instance 15 percent THC now this strain has 29 percent CHD their THC so it's higher but for instance the average medicine flower has 15 percent THC it'll have about a hundred and fifty milligrams of THC 15 percent of say a thousand milligrams equals 150 milligrams but sorry I got dizzy for a second but the average strain actually is only 10 percent anything over 15 or 20 percent in your strain is considered above average and high in THC and it's considered extremely potent and this strain here I'm using actually for edibles is really good with appetite stimulation it helps with pain restlessness and sleepiness the great thing about these is that it doesn't it does make you feel good and euphoric but it's not supposed to knock you out now if it does knock you out that means you took too much and since everybody handles edibles completely different it's highly recommended that if you're not used to edibles to start small like say for instance these are a hundred milligrams apiece to start out actually in a fourth now if you're you know used to this and all that you've got to eat the whole thing but yeah so what i'm doing here actually I need in my hands are sterile I need 50 of them if I have 50 of the these right here that's a hundred milligrams each now if I don't make it that far and get actually 50 of them then they're actually going to be more potent than that and I have my labels and ingredients in all that forum these are amazing alternative medicines for you know people that are really having a hard time with illness or cancer say nausea energy or whatever and I'm using the stainless steel ball is half of them because I want them all to be the same size and what I do is I dip them in powdered sugar so that they don't stick and kind of just pack it in there and knock off the excess so that and like I said they're going to be dipped in chocolate so they're going to be so they're going to be truffles chocolate peanut butter medicated truffles mm-hmm by the time I'm done with them and you know for people who are not familiar with edibles when they eat them they expect this high like you would smoking marijuana and it's actually nothing at the sort now you do get high and you do get intoxicated I'm not gonna lie about that but it's not the same you can be in a lot of pain and within a half an hour you'll start feeling your pain ease away or nausea or joint pain muscles it's great for arthritis hey guys I'm back along my camera father so I just did my chocolate oh and by the way I'm sorry my phone cut out I had to lower my resolution on my phone so I could finished the video so this half is going to be a little less better quality so I made my chocolate which is just organic coconut oil organic cocoa powder some honey and since it is summer months I want my product to hold up so I added a little bit of organic beeswax to the chocolates so that it holds up and I also crushed some Adeem a nuts which are kind of like a bean they kind of taste like a roasted peanut and I crushed them up it's gonna go on the tops and I set these in the freezer anything easier to to handle and for the chocolate to free zones or set up so we're going to do and let it drip off c6o and if you chop wits like this and you're wanting to add toppings you have to do it right from the get-go because once it cools um just like so so I'm gonna pause this and get more done and then I'll be back okay guys I'm back so I ended up getting them all done dipped in chocolate and they turned out really great I decided to only put the a dummy on some the Adame nuts and for packaging they actually go on one of these a little and they hardened up great so they go on one of these and in one of these boxes and plated with the ingredients and the sonim so yeah they turned out great I must say guys that I know they're at a hundred milligrams but I'll tell you what I test all my products so I um tooth like I don't know it was like a [ __ ] half a teaspoon of just the filling and let me tell you I'm I'm really feeling motion but I was really nauseous and hurtin and that's all gone a little loopy I honestly wouldn't drive that's for sure so yeah I'm really really happy with how they turned out and they turn nice and hard because I put the little bit of beeswax in it so yeah that's about it so I'll talk to you guys later bye", "tHkgxMw7eb0": "what's up guys this is mohammed bazaar from nutrilife today i'm going to review about american garden u.s peanut butter this is a creamy flavor there are different flavors but there is no much difference in terms of nutrition facts let's quickly go to check this ingredient label first i'll pause it first i'll just see ingredients first i'll talk about that it has dry roasted peanuts sugar so it has sugar fully hydrogenated vegetable oils the oils come from red seed oil and soya soybean and it has salt as well now what is hydrogenated vegetable oils hydrogenated vegetables and see first thing oils are in liquid form and fats are in solid form so hydrogenated vegetable oil means they are putting hydrogen over the oil with some catalyst and they become they make the liquid oil into some solid form so you know that is why the peanut butter is usually very thick and creamy that is the reason because they make the oil into little uh solid form so that is called hydrogenated vegetable oils and it has salt contain peanuts no refrigeration required okay that is okay now we jump towards the uh calorie see serving size uh serving size is 2 tbsp that is around 32 gram so the calorie per 2 tbsp is 180 which is okay because peanuts are high in calorie peanuts is a seed which is high in healthy fats and high protein okay so total fats is 15 gram per 2 tbsp uh saturated fat 3 grams so unhealthy fat is just 3 grams which is completely okay because 12 gram is healthy fats which is thumbs up cholesterol 0mg which is good sodium 125 mg which is okay as i told you in my earlier videos around 100 mg sodium or serving is completely okay so this is fine now let's move to a total carbohydrate which is 8 gram dietary fiber is 2 grams which is ok no problem with 2 tbsp of peanut butter total sugar 4 gram includes added sugar 2 gram the point is it has sugar in it now protein is 7 gram which is this is too good protein is seven gram per uh but two tablespoon is very good so my point is this product has two problems one is hydrogen hydrogenated vegetable oils second is it has a lot of sugar in it so what i i what we can do is if we want if you want to really want to consume this peanut butter i will not suggest you this product always go with the organic brand because organic brand doesn't have hydrogenated vegetable oils it has uh even lesser amount of sodium and uh zero sugar so that is how that is why it is the best one the organic brands of peanut butter any brand so if you really want to go with peanut butter you can do one more thing you can make it at home it's very easy just roast some peanuts put it in a jar and add some olive oil and just blend it until it it become very uh creamy and thick that's it and uh just sprinkle some salt that's it without any sugar you can make it at home and it's very easy another thing uh you can have just a row to uh 28 grams which is one ounce which is one serving of peanuts it will give you seven gram of protein so there is no use of going with a peanut butter brand you could just have a one serving of peanut butter which is one ounce 28 gram and still you will get seven gram of protein and the fats will be same there will be no oil extra no no sodium little pinch of sodium which is the salt is fine and no sugar at all so you can really switch to a raw peanuts which is uh which is the best so thank you so much guys uh

Peanuts are touted\u00a0\nto control blood sugars better than any other\u00a0\u00a0 food, and the fats are said to be quote unquote\u00a0\nheart healthy. First of all, are peanuts even real\u00a0\u00a0 nuts? Second what is really in the bottle\u00a0\nof peanut butter we've all been eating and\u00a0\u00a0 feeding our families? If there is a jar in your\u00a0\nhouse you're gonna want to watch this episode.\u00a0\u00a0 Peanut butter is not what you think it is.\u00a0\nWelcome to the Resilient Diabetic. This is the\u00a0\u00a0 channel we turn ordinary struggling diabetics into\u00a0\nextraordinary well control diabetics. If you are\u00a0\u00a0 brand new to this channel I welcome you.

And finally if you learned something\u00a0\nnew today I would love for you to smash that LIKE\u00a0\u00a0 button for me. As with all my videos, this should\u00a0\nnot be considered personal medical advice. This is\u00a0\u00a0 my interpretation of the latest research. If you\u00a0\nwant medical advice please always consult your\u00a0\u00a0 physician. As a Resilient Diabetic, you are\u00a0\nstarting to notice a couple of trends here.\u00a0\u00a0 You've realized that much if not most of what you\u00a0\nread when it comes to nutrition and your diabetic\u00a0\u00a0 health is tainted. Other financial interests come\u00a0\nfirst over your health. If we did a simple google\u00a0\u00a0 search on peanut butter what would we find? Unless\u00a0\nyou have the Resilient Diabetic by your side,\u00a0\u00a0 you would never be exposed to any of the truths.\u00a0\nIs peanut butter peanuts or even peanut oil\u00a0\u00a0 healthy for us diabetics let alone our loved\u00a0\nones? Let us start with what we've been told\u00a0\u00a0 or led to believe.  According to our experts, we\u00a0\nas diabetics need foods that can help manage our\u00a0\u00a0 blood sugars and our weight. So then peanuts, peanut\u00a0\nbutter can be that potentially powerful ally\u00a0\u00a0 to reaching success.  Peanuts and peanut butter\u00a0\nhave what's known as a low glycemic index. \u00a0\u00a0 What does that simply mean, when you eat it blood\u00a0\nsugar levels should not rise suddenly or too high. \u00a0\u00a0 We've been told that a diet high in magnesium\u00a0\nmay also offer protective benefits against the\u00a0\u00a0 development of diabetes.  Peanuts are a good\u00a0\nsource of magnesium. So what's not to like so\u00a0\u00a0 far and we haven't even gotten to the good\u00a0\nstuff yet. Our heart health about 80 percent\u00a0\u00a0 of the fats in peanut butter come from unsaturated\u00a0\nfats, which we've been told is a type of fat\u00a0\u00a0 that may lower the risk of heart disease.  Peanuts\u00a0\nthemselves also contain a number of nutrients\u00a0\u00a0 that also boost heart health including B vitamins\u00a0\nand antioxidants.  From the amazing taste of peanut\u00a0\u00a0 butter to what we've been theoretically come\u00a0\nto believe nutritionally, we would all love to\u00a0\u00a0 shake the hand of the person who invented peanut\u00a0\nbutter.  The peanut butter we are all familiar with\u00a0\u00a0 is credited to at least three men, one of which\u00a0\nwe just discussed in the episode Can Breakfast\u00a0\u00a0 Make Your Diabetes Worse, Dr John Harvey Kellogg\u00a0\nwho patent the process for making peanut butter\u00a0\u00a0 from raw peanuts in 1895. In that episode\u00a0\nwe uncovered and discussed the dirty truth\u00a0\u00a0 behind this cereal business.  And I'll put a link in\u00a0\nthe description box to that video if you've missed\u00a0\u00a0 it.  While peanuts sport the \"nut\" name, peanuts are\u00a0\nactually a legume.  That makes them a member of the\u00a0\u00a0 family of plant-based items that includes lentils,\u00a0\nbeans, and soybeans.  Fitting foods in the categories\u00a0\u00a0 is a tricky business.  Tomatoes and avocados\u00a0\ngrow like fruits but they taste like vegetables. \u00a0\u00a0 A watermelon is actually a berry and so is an\u00a0\neggplant.  And if that is not hard enough to swallow,\u00a0\u00a0 it turns out that most of the nuts we love, aren't\u00a0\nreally nuts.  True to the legume family, a peanut\u00a0\u00a0 is composed of an edible seed that grows inside a\u00a0\npod. One reason you may not associate peanuts with\u00a0\u00a0 legumes is that you don't eat the peanuts dry and\u00a0\nbrittle pod like we do many of the other legumes. \u00a0\u00a0 Another difference lies in where the\u00a0\nnuts grow.  You won't find peanuts growing\u00a0\u00a0 on a tree, as you would almonds or cashews.  Peanuts\u00a0\ngrow under the soil originating from a bush-like\u00a0\u00a0 creeping plant.  When they're ripe and ready to\u00a0\nharvest they are pulled up similar to a carrot\u00a0\u00a0 or potato.  Next we have to ask ourselves are these\u00a0\ncommercialized legumes, not nuts, healthy for us?\u00a0\u00a0 A store-bought peanut butter should only\u00a0\nhave two ingredients, peanuts and sometimes\u00a0\u00a0 a pinch of salt.  But today's manufacturers even\u00a0\nthe all natural brands advertise themselves as\u00a0\u00a0 healthy, pack their peanut butters with\u00a0\nadditives.  Today's peanut butters are\u00a0\u00a0 mostly processed with partially hydrogenated\u00a0\nvegetable oils, and tons of sugar, so make sure\u00a0\u00a0 you check the labels carefully.  These nuts or\u00a0\nshould I say legumes, do contain a bit of sugar\u00a0\u00a0 naturally but they do not need to add sugar to\u00a0\nthe mix.  If you see sugar on the ingredient list\u00a0\u00a0 pass on it.  And be alarmed when you see\u00a0\nmore than three grams of sugar per serving\u00a0\u00a0 on the label even if sugars are not added. \u00a0\nThese are some of the loopholes they will use. \u00a0\u00a0 But let me tell you that is the least of your\u00a0\nworries, as you will find out.  If you are subscribed,\u00a0\u00a0 and I know you are, then you've heard me talk a\u00a0\nlot about vegetable oils.  I've stated on record,\u00a0\u00a0 these oils are the secondary reason behind\u00a0\nthe explosion of diabetes around the world!\u00a0\u00a0 Does the oil from peanuts have common traits\u00a0\nwith other polyunsaturated vegetable oils like\u00a0\u00a0 soybean oil, safflower oil, and sunflower\u00a0\noil? Aside from being popular cooking oils\u00a0\u00a0 they are all touted by the American Heart\u00a0\nAssociation as being heart healthy options. \u00a0\u00a0 Yet current science does not support any\u00a0\nof these claims.  There is still an egregious\u00a0\u00a0 conflict of interest with the American Heart\u00a0\nAssociation and who directly funds them today. \u00a0\u00a0 And yes, they have been completely funded by the\u00a0\nvegetable oil industry amongst other packaged\u00a0\u00a0 food manufacturers.  The salaries for all the\u00a0\ndirectors on the board are paid by them.  History\u00a0\u00a0 has always been our friend. Back in 1948, Procter\u00a0\nAnd Gamble the makers of Crisco, shortening and\u00a0\u00a0 soon to be vegetable oils, raised 1.7 million\u00a0\ndollars for the American Heart Association which\u00a0\u00a0 then transformed them from a very small\u00a0\nunknown underfunded professional society\u00a0\u00a0 into the powerhouse it is today.  To put\u00a0\nit bluntly, the American Heart Association\u00a0\u00a0 is nothing more than a front or an echo\u00a0\nchamber for all these food based manufacturers. \u00a0\u00a0 One of the flawed main reasons they say peanut\u00a0\noil is healthy is because it contains vitamin\u00a0\u00a0 E.  Vitamin E actually is an antioxidant\u00a0\nthat helps battle free radicals and reduces\u00a0\u00a0 oxidative stress.  But there are a couple of\u00a0\nproblems with this popular oil that negates\u00a0\u00a0 its vitamin E content.  First the oil oxidizes when\u00a0\nyou heat it which creates even more free radicals. \u00a0\u00a0 Second it is rich in omega-6 fatty acids, which\u00a0\nthrows off your omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid\u00a0\u00a0 ratio.  Omega-6s are pro-inflammatory while\u00a0\nyour omega-3s are anti-inflammatory.  Of course\u00a0\u00a0 inflammation is essential for our survival.  Omega-6\u00a0\nfats are used to create biochemical signals\u00a0\u00a0 that promote inflammation.  It also helps\u00a0\nprotect your body from infection and injury. \u00a0\u00a0 But it also can cause severe damage and contribute\u00a0\nto diseases when it is chronic or excessive. \u00a0\u00a0 Anthropological evidence suggests the ratio we\u00a0\nhumans evolved was eating around a 1 to 1 ratio. \u00a0\u00a0 While the ratio today around the world is around\u00a0\n16 to 1. The standard American diet provides most\u00a0\u00a0 people with a ratio closer to, get this, 20 to 1.\u00a0\nAs a result of this ratio metabolic diseases have\u00a0\u00a0 skyrocketed that includes type 2 diabetes, high\u00a0\nblood pressure, heart disease, cancer, and yes now\u00a0\u00a0 even Alzheimer's.  And I will go as far as saying\u00a0\nthis is one of the reasons why Covid-19 virus\u00a0\u00a0 takes a hold of so many who do not have underlying\u00a0\nhealth issues.  They are chronically inflamed!\u00a0\u00a0 And what does this imbalance ratio mean for a\u00a0\ndiabetic, severe insulin resistance, plain and\u00a0\u00a0 simple.  Did you know the standard serving for a nut\u00a0\nbutter is just two tablespoons.  A 100 gram serving\u00a0\u00a0 of peanuts has more than 560 calories and 49\u00a0\ngrams of fat. Of that 49 grams 16 grams comes from\u00a0\u00a0 these deadly omega 6 fatty acids.  Peanuts contain\u00a0\nalmost none of the healthy omega-3 fatty acids,\u00a0\u00a0 having five thousand times more omega-6 than\u00a0\nomega-3s.  These two things omega-6 content\u00a0\u00a0 and the high rates of oxidation makes the fats\u00a0\nfrom peanuts high in free radicals which cause\u00a0\u00a0 oxidative stress and inflammation.  There is\u00a0\nstill outdated evidence that polyunsaturated\u00a0\u00a0 fats like peanut oil can lower LDL cholesterol.\u00a0\nOften mislabeled as the bad cholesterol. That is\u00a0\u00a0 one of the reasons polyunsaturated fatty acids are\u00a0\nfalsely touted to be heart healthy.  But there is a\u00a0\u00a0 problem with this conclusion.  LDL cholesterol is\u00a0\nno longer a predictor of cardiovascular disease\u00a0\u00a0 at all.  That test was used in the dark ages and\u00a0\nwas levered by our bought off and paid off experts\u00a0\u00a0 for the cover-up of the true killer,\u00a0\nexcessive carbohydrates.  LDL particle number,\u00a0\u00a0 and triglyceride to HDL ratio, are much better\u00a0\npredictors of cardiovascular disease.  Unfortunately\u00a0\u00a0 manufacturers are adding more and more of these\u00a0\ndeadly extremely cheap oils, which are hidden but\u00a0\u00a0 are actually in plain sight behind no stir labels\u00a0\non store shelves.  Oils like soybean, canola, and more\u00a0\u00a0 vegetable based oils are added to give it that\u00a0\ncreamy texture.  Peanuts do contain a high amounts\u00a0\u00a0 of protein, and that could be a good thing right?\u00a0\nSo the next question is. Is the peanuts a high\u00a0\u00a0 value digestible protein our bodies can benefit\u00a0\nfrom? We have discussed the Protein Digestibility\u00a0\u00a0 Corrected Amino Acid Score or the PDCAAS. The\u00a0\nhighest value that any protein can achieve\u00a0\u00a0 is a 100 percent.  Proteins with low scores are\u00a0\neither poorly digested or have limited essential\u00a0\u00a0 amino acids, or the worst quality proteins are both. \u00a0\nThis score makes a lot of sense for determining\u00a0\u00a0 the basic value of protein, meaning our human\u00a0\nneeds for growth and repair of our body systems. \u00a0\u00a0 This graph you're looking at compares some of the\u00a0\ncommon protein sources and ranges out there.  And\u00a0\u00a0 where do tree nuts and peanuts fall? Well they are\u00a0\na bit under 50 percent. And I want you to notice\u00a0\u00a0 wheat gluten from the cereals we eat which are\u00a0\nsignificantly lower.  And why do I mention this?\u00a0\u00a0 What do we feed our children for breakfast in the\u00a0\nmorning? Cereals made of wheat gluten along with\u00a0\u00a0 all that added sugar, equivalent to more than\u00a0\na can of soda. And then, we add insult to injury. \u00a0\u00a0 We give them store-bought peanut butter\u00a0\nwhich again is highly inflammatory and\u00a0\u00a0 poor in its protein content.  Can you see why\u00a0\nour society is sick from such an early age,\u00a0\u00a0 and getting sicker. We are straight out poisoning\u00a0\nour children.  Let me ask you this question. \u00a0\u00a0 What is hunger? Have you ever really thought about\u00a0\nthis? Hunger is defined as a condition in which a\u00a0\u00a0 person cannot eat sufficient food to meet his or\u00a0\nher nutritional needs.  But in our world of excess,\u00a0\u00a0 hunger is not really about getting enough\u00a0\ncalories.  Hunger and the desire to eat is\u00a0\u00a0 a consequence of the body not having the right\u00a0\nnutrients it needs to survive.  So it's asking you\u00a0\u00a0 to feed it more, hoping you will give it what\u00a0\nit requires.  And in here lies the problem with\u00a0\u00a0 peanut butter. I personally have never come across\u00a0\nany food item like this, that wants me to eat more\u00a0\u00a0 and more of it and then crave foods after just one\u00a0\nsmall serving.  I cannot have just one tablespoon\u00a0\u00a0 ever.  It creates a monster out of me wanting\u00a0\nto tear apart the refrigerator for more food\u00a0\u00a0 and anything sweet.  I have a saying, out\u00a0\nof sight out of mind.  If it's not at home\u00a0\u00a0 then I never desire it.  Why again do we crave more\u00a0\nfoods after eating peanut butter in particular.\u00a0\u00a0 Because it is void of any healthy nutrients.  From\u00a0\nthe very poor protein it provides to the unhealthy\u00a0\u00a0 fats, and the body knows that.  On a side note,\u00a0\nlet me give you some quick examples.  If you take\u00a0\u00a0 vitamin D supplement, have you ever looked at your\u00a0\nbottle's ingredient list.  Knowing what you know\u00a0\u00a0 now about polyunsaturated fatty acids, did you\u00a0\nknow the oil they used to suspend the vitamin D in\u00a0\u00a0 is the worst of them all, soybean\u00a0\noil.  If you look on your bottles list\u00a0\u00a0 and it is, I want you to throw it out\u00a0\nimmediately.  It must be MCT oil or nothing. \u00a0\u00a0 There are manufacturers out there of vitamin D\u00a0\nthat do use MCT oil, you have to do your homework\u00a0\u00a0 and find them.  Last month my wife brought home\u00a0\nthese amazingly delicious frozen salmon patties. \u00a0\u00a0 They were round, kind of like formed into hamburger\u00a0\npatties.  We would just throw them in the oven\u00a0\u00a0 to bake.  But something strange was happening.\u00a0\nMy blood sugars were not as well controlled\u00a0\u00a0 like eating a pure salmon steak, or even canned\u00a0\ntuna, and I could not figure out why.  My wife\u00a0\u00a0 does read the ingredient list before she brings\u00a0\nanything new home, and she knows what to avoid,\u00a0\u00a0 so I never really questioned it.  But after that\u00a0\nthird attempt with unusual blood sugars, I knew\u00a0\u00a0 something was wrong.  So I grabbed the bag out of\u00a0\nthe freezer for a closer look at the ingredient\u00a0\u00a0 list, and my heart sank.  They use soybean oil as\u00a0\nthe binder.  That just broke my heart and I do mean\u00a0\u00a0 literally.  Why would you take something so healthy\u00a0\nlike salmon, and add these poisonous oils to it. \u00a0\u00a0 The rest of that bag went immediately into the\u00a0\ntrash can.  Pay attention to details it will save\u00a0\u00a0 your life.  Or maybe that's why you have me instead. \u00a0\nI will set up a playlist for you on more on\u00a0\u00a0 the foods we eat.  Which ones will literally\u00a0\ndestroy and tear down our bodies over time?\u00a0\u00a0 And which foods will allow us to live that life\u00a0\nfree of complications?

Hello, ladies and gentlemen, I am Dr. Zyrowski\nand welcome back to the channel. If you are new to the channel, it is a pleasure\nto have you here. Be sure to subscribe, hit that bell notification,\njoin our notification community so I can help you excel your health and change your life. In this video, we are talking about the truth\nabout peanut butter. This is a really interesting topic because\nall the time when I am at the gym, I hear the trainer\u2019s telling their trainees to\nhave peanut butter and toast for breakfast and put peanut butter on a bagel, peanut butter\nand jelly sandwich, peanut butter, and apples, make sure that you are eating lots of peanut\nbutter. I always cringe when I hear this because there\nis a lot to know about peanut butter and if you don't know this you are probably putting\na lot of toxins in your body. Let's go ahead and talk about what you need\nto know about peanut butter and then some better options. So let's get started. The first thing that you need to know is sugar\nand really all of these things are related to the label. Paying attention to the label. Make sure you are reading the label on your\npeanut butter. So first here is sugar, we have to make sure\nthat we are avoiding peanut butter with sugar it. Much of it has that in there just for, first\nof all, to make it taste better, more appealing, but also to make it more addictive. We know that sugar is very addictive to the\nbrain so the brand with the most sugar in it is typically the brand that the average\nperson might like most. The other problem with sugar is that the sugar\nthat is in the peanut butter is typically in the way of corn syrups. We have to make sure that we are avoiding\nsugar all together and of course the ones with the really bad sources of sugar in it,\nwhich is corn syrup. Next here on our list is hydrogenated oils. When we look at these peanut butters, they\ntypically have very cheap oils in them. Like cottonseed oil or soybean oil and it\nis just to keep the price down but it is also to make it very creamy. People tend to like that more. But hydrogenated oils drag inflammation into\nour body and are very unhealthy for us. We want to make sure that it has no bad oils\nto it. Even organic brands typically have hydrogenated\noils added right in. Next here on our list is molasses. I have no idea why peanut butter needs molasses\nbut a lot of it does have it in it. And then next is aflatoxin, basically, aflatoxin\nis a mold that is grown on the peanuts, simply because the peanuts are growing on the ground. The peanuts that are growing on the ground\nhave these aflatoxins in them and it has been found to be linked to cancer. So we have to make sure that we are aware\nof that too. And then last here on our list is toxins. When we look at peanuts they are very highly\nsprayed during the growing process, they are covered with pesticides, herbicides and the\nglysophate, as well. We want to make sure that we are getting good\nquality peanut butter, typically the organic, at the very least so that we know they are\nnot covered in toxins throughout the cold growing process. Let's look at some better options. First of all, many people love peanut butter,\nbut there are other options besides peanut butter and the first here is almond butter. What I recommend is a nice, raw almond butter\nand I recommend raw because what that means is that it hasn't been roasted and that means\nthat the fats within the almonds have been denatured. Getting a raw almond butter is a great option. The next here is Valencia peanut butter. Valencia peanut butter is a better option\nbecause it is not grown on the ground. The peanuts are grown off the ground in more\nof like a bush and essentially it does not get the mold issue so it does not have the\naflatoxin issue. Valencia peanut butter is a great option. Typically you can find that at Trader Joe's\nand then the other great option is peanut butter that comes from jungle peanuts and\nthat is typically a little bit harder to find, but the Internet makes it a little bit easier\nif you want a jungle peanut, peanut butter. Last here is sunflower seed butter. Once again, if you don't like peanut butter\nor you have a sensitivity to almonds there is always a sunflower seed butter and that\nis great because it actually comes from the seed. It is loaded with vitamin E, magnesium, good\nquality fats, and even protein. When we look at sunflower seed butter it is\na great option, as well. I will try to find good resources for these\nright here and put it in the description below. If I find them. Be sure to give this video a thumbs up.

[Music] i'm licking my fingers wow pathetic but it's very like rich chocolate i didn't taste any weed as far as i know i just picked up a pack of peanut butter cups that were delicious tasted kind of gourmet like a gourmet reese's cup it's like fresh out of clear saffit's kitchen that's really good let's see the activation time okay directions go low and slow this says this i mean go low and slow a quarter of a cup contains 10 milligrams of our delta 9 thc consume one delicious gooey servant wait and don't repeat until you know your dose i know my dose i know myself i know me so i know 25 milligrams is perfect for kenzie whether she's had a long day or not long two days anyway i'll check back with you guys in about did i even do it hurry [Music] right on set i feel pretty high it feels like it's in me you know it feels like it tickles me a little more than the threshold um sometimes i feel like i get higher off of chocolate why am i doing this with my elbow i'm gonna tell you to be honest i was gonna get on here get on up here in front of all my fans i don't want to lie to you guys when i say you guys i specifically need my mom and my grandmother nana but i was gonna get on here like but guys i don't know if it's the edible or my terrible life choices but i don't want to give you an off review but i do feel like you know now i'm talking now i'm hearing myself like you're definitely high right like this [ __ ] [Music] hannah my wonderful beautiful lovely roommate got caramel apple lollipops i just noticed that and i didn't even think her [Music] i'm going to bed i'm going to bed but not before i read this edible because it did it's taking me high okay i wrote down my reviews beforehand just in case this happened where i wouldn't remember that and what do you know i don't where's the pa i need my notes thank you [Music] so this would be a really really good edible for somebody that has a lower tolerance not somebody with a higher tolerance i feel like if you're looking for an edible that packs a punch you know has more milligram in a smaller size this would probably not be the edible for you because just to eat 25 milligrams the chocolate it is so good so good but it is really like silky and rich and i only eat 25 milligrams i felt like maybe i could have eaten more but i would have not been able to eat more than one peanut butter cup which would get me high but if you're trying to get blend i would opt for something higher milligram and a smaller size this is great for people with a lower tolerance because you can eat a small little rich bit a nice little treat for yourself or whatever nice little treat for yourself or whatever it's like it's perfect it's rich it'll get you where you need to be you don't eat a lot of it the chocolate's rich so like you really don't get to eat a lot of it it's really good i will say no weed taste nothing and usually i can get like the tiniest [Music] little hint of weed nothing not a thing oh my gosh i was really shocked about that um i was really shocked about that it was really good chocolate it was kind of more like a not completely a dark chocolate but more dark chocolate than milk chocolate for sure it was a peanut butter cup but like peanut butter on the inside was white i couldn't really taste the peanut butter i wasn't mad about it but you know just say what it is a chocolate cup with like peanut dust okay the battery died i had to freaking and it kicked more and the more i was moving because i didn't take my own advice and i didn't get up and move around so i just did not want to but it's my threshold and with all my cookie card because i'll go wrong so you know where it is um we're gonna say i'm grating the edible okay here we go packaging one leaf out of one leaf why because it had a zip lock and they were individually wrapped and it was dosed off i wish i could give it more than one star but that's just kind of against my code as for trying this to milligram i think we can all agree milligram is true two out of two stars that brings me to taste taste was the chocolate good delicious and i don't usually like darker chocolate but it's really really good oh i hope i'm talking about enough the chocolate is delicious you couldn't taste the peanut butter i was hoping for like a creamy super yummy like peanut butter to kind of match the chocolate but because the chocolate was so thick on the outside it uh kind of overpowered the peanut butter on the inside but it was so delicious so i am going to give it two out of two stars this is my first five off accent stars this is my first five out of five weed leaf edibles so let's just solve for that i'm looking at all my plants right now they like it they're like watching me do things that i'm passionate about they're supportive and whatever congratulations i liked your edible i loved it it was very very delicious i would probably put my own personal peanut butter on it but omiyan's flying out soon and he's allergic to peanuts or whatever and i don't want him to die did you like it anyway i'm gonna sign off because i've got work tomorrow and i'm probably only gonna get about three to four hours of sleep but that's all every other day of the week no i didn't even rhyme did i get it i gotta get out of this chair oh you're a good listener you're a really good listener i'm having a great time i might just like stay up and just keep [Music] just keep talking that'll be my part too not signing off because i need to break down the set i need to i mean i need to the gaffers need to break down the set and uh the producer is like telling me to wrap up right now so annoying stop looking you know we gotta get the pa out of here so they can go back to their to their white bread and peanut butter we gotta let everyone on set go or like it's gonna go into overtime i know stop i'm signing off let me know okay thank you so much for joining me again on the edible fancy show i'm edible fancy join me next time where i will also be eating another other bowl but i might have a different opinion so i feel like i'll be okay i i feel like this might tickle my threshold if it's up to snuff if it's up to snuff or whatever [Music] okay we're done okay okay all right he's driving me home the pa", "F9LVcVeFH1Y": "[Music] everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make

believe it is a granola bar gluten free long lasting all-natural the Bushmaster bar on the back we've got our ingredients and our nutrition packs which I always love to see on edibles I like granola bars well I should say I like granola bars that are designed for you know like 10 year-olds kudos bars the things that are basically candy like kudos or Quaker Oatmeal granola bars so I'm hoping it's like that but we shall see I'm not as big of a fan of the granola bars that are actually healthy so this is the first time you've ever tuned in to wheats the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat some measure of this if it's not too big the whole thing in front of you and just don't want to bore you with eating the whole thing and I'll come back to you guys then in two hours to let you know how

it's a very nutty looking for an old bar mostly just peanuts no real marijuana odor to speak of you can see the peanut butter and chocolate there you've got some a lot of peanuts some almonds some other things not a big nut fan but I'll do it for you alright so this is the Kalli Bushmaster plant peanutbutter THC let's give it a taste well it's very cute it's gonna take me a while to do this I don't even like nuts but that's not terrible um and the peanut butter binds it together really well we've got a nice taste that chocolates wear on the top is good um yeah that's not bad at all um that's really surprising I don't like peanuts I don't like almonds I do not mind the taste of this and it's got wheat in it which is are usually somewhere it makes it taste terrible to begin with so on the taste front if you are a fan of nuts or granola bars definitely a positive for this one definitely on the plus side um well I'm hope they're not gonna just hold me in front of you because I'll

surprised with the taste I think this is an impressive little package Wow and I think it was rather affordable I think it was seven or eight dollars I can't remember the exact price but I thought it was tasty surprisingly potent my eyes are rather red for a hundred milligram edible guys I think this is a little hidden treasure I just happen to see these at a dispensary behind the counter hidden behind some other bigger products and I was like oh I'll try one of those and I think it's a real hidden in pleasure or a hidden treat III don't think it's that big of a brand maybe it is I don't know

Welcome back. In today's video, I just\nwant to share with you five nut-free alternatives to peanut butter or almond butter, all the nut butters that you see out in many of the recipes\nout there and in this channel. I have to be honest with you, I had to go to three grocery stores and also place an Amazon\norder for this video because the truth is is\nthat it's not that easy to find variety, or find options, in one single grocery store. An entire aisle of nut\nbutters and one option. I mean, how hard can it be? I am so glad that I'm\ndoing this video for you because I really want to show you some really delicious\noptions that you can use to make all of these recipes nut free. Yep, that was me at 7:00 a.m. this morning trying to find the very\nlast nut-free butter. So let me give you a quick\npeek of what we have today. We have sunflower seed\nbutter, granola butter, sesame butter, soy\nbutter, and cookie butter. What I want to do is go\nthrough each of these butters with you and to give you the spread test so you can see how you\ncan make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, except nut free, 'cause a lot of kids\ngo to nut-free schools, but also there's a lot of recipes, like bites and baked goods,\nthat call for peanut butter. But other things like coconut butter will actually not work. So these are great alternatives for many of the recipes\nthat you see out there. So first off is sunflower seed butter. We're gonna give this\na quick open for you. The sunflower seed butter comes, usually, in creamy and chunky. So let's take a look. This sunflower butter\nspreads really great. Ingredients wise, the sunflower butter has sunflower seeds. So it's got 220 calories, 20 grams of fat, five grams of carbs, two grams of fiber, one gram of sugar, and\nsix grams of protein. So this is a really great\noption for a nut-free sandwich. Taste test. It's definitely an earthier taste, which may be something to get used to. But I definitely think that\ninside a sunflower butter and jelly sandwich would go totally well or used in a no-bake recipe, for sure. So next up is our Kween granola butter. I discovered this, actually, on Instagram, and what it is is a little bit different than nut-free butters. It's granola butter. It's, like, ground-up granola. You definitely have to give it a stir in order to make it thicker consistency. And I have tried this to make\nthings like energy bites, and they come out really great. All right, so for the spread test, now place them on our sandwich. I'm being really messy. The granola butter, ingredients wise, we have gluten-free oats, flax, olive oil, coconut oil, maple\nsyrup, salt, and spices. What I really love about\nthe ingredients is that the sugar content is not\nas high as you might think compared to when you think granola, right? So calories 215, 12 grams of fat, 15 grams of carbs, four grams of fiber, three grams of sugar, and\nfour grams of protein. So this is also a really great option. This granola butter\nalso comes in chocolate. So if you've got Nutella fans, I've got to show it to you. It's honestly unbelievable. Ingredients wise, it's\ngot gluten-free oats, flax, olive oil, coconut oil, maple syrup, cocoa powder, cacao powder, salt, vanilla extract, and spices. What I really love about this\ngranola butter in chocolate is that compared to\nchocolate hazelnut spread, it only has three grams of sugars as opposed to 21 grams per serving. So this is definitely\na winner at my house. Next up is another great find, which is sesame butter. A friend of mine introduced\nme to this not too long ago, and I'm honestly obsessed, as well. It is made with sesame seeds. But it does not taste like tahini, which is what I use to make hummus. So it's got a really\ngood, thick consistency that is really easy to spread. The flavor is a little different than traditional peanut butter, but it really has a very\nrich and earthy flavor. And what I really love is the ingredients. Ingredients wise is sesame, date powder, palm oil, little rosemary extract, salt, and that's it. So you kinda really taste\nthat date powder through. Nutrition wise, we have 200 calories, 17 grams of fat, eight grams of carbs, one gram of fiber, four grams of sugars, but they're not added sugars,\nand six grams of proteins. Sesame butter comes in smooth and chunky. So the chunky, I just\ntried it for the first time a couple of days ago, and the chunks, I was wondering\nwhat the chunks would be. They're actually sunflower seeds. The flavor combo really works. It's also spreadable. But my favorite is definitely the smooth. Okay, so next up we have soy butter. Soy butter is also an\nalternative out there. Lookwise, it's very similar\nto traditional peanut butter. So this is really a great option for all those no-bake recipes, as well. Spread test. It's thick. It tastes pretty good, actually. The ingredients, toasted soy. So you definitely taste that\nlittle toastiness in there. Pressed soy oil, cane sugar,\npalm oil, and sea salt. Nutrition is 200\ncalories, 15 grams of fat, eight grams of carbs,\nthree grams of fiber, three grams of sugar,\nwhich two are added sugars, and seven grams of protein. So this is actually a pretty\nhigh in protein option for you. And last but not least,\nwe have cookie butter. I was kinda hesitant to\ninclude it, to be honest, because it's really more of a treat because it's essentially you take cookies and you make it into a butter. But a lot of you wanted to\nknow what it was all about. So it does have a spreadable consistency, and you can also use it as a substitute for all those no-bake recipes and bites and, I guess,\nsandwiches, as well. Ingredients wise, we have cookies, which made with wheat flour,\nsugar, vegetable oils, soy oil, sunflower oil,\ncanola oil, palm oil, soy flour, brown sugar\nsyrup, sodium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate and salt, cinnamon, canola oil,\nsugar, soy, and citric acid. So you're basically\neating a cookie on toast. Nutrition wise, it's got 170 calories, 11 grams of fat, 17 grams of carbs, 11 total sugars, which is all added sugar, one gram of protein. So I would consider this\nin the treat category, but it's delicious. Like I mentioned earlier,\nit wasn't the easiest to find all of these in one grocery store, and some of them are sold online. So make sure you check the\nlinks right below this video. Also, while you're down there, leave me a comment and let me know, what are some of your\nstruggles to find substitutes?

guest and that way we can give you more accurate it ratings what do you need me for now okay steps we know master with me gosh she made me fly all the way here just for that let's come all the way from Hong Kong believe or not yeah I have so excited let's get into this we need some kind of level of ranking so I have different spoons here the first one is you know if the FINA bar is kind of like yeah yeah kind of like an empty soul yeah I thought this was gonna be magical but it was just yeah okay got it then we've got the TSP which is kind of like a hmm yeah yeah I got it the next one is then we have the ultimate if the peanut butter is next level we then have steps peanut butter spoon to give the ultimate if this peanut butter absolutely blows our mind then it's just like that's like a sad whoo oh if it's the ultimate we hold this up because we have no words so that everyone knows these are legit I've not tried these before smells amazing I want to lick my finger but then that defeats the point oh that is really creamy okay let's let's do it ready that's right mmm I wish that was crunchy feel like it needs a crunch no I liked it you like everything smooth that's right hmm the only reason that I'm doing this is because I don't want to go too high just think case might have to revoke this pin because maybe the ones are worth so I'm also gonna hold up the hmm it's nice but I personally think it needs a crunch it's like I don't know the font Betty oh maybe we didn't kill this this  okay cinnamon toffee crunch peanut butter that is next-level creaminess I love that it's so good mmm we get stuck to the roof but I'm actually gonna go in and nobody move yeah that's nice really good it's product off me like isn't it it's not even like a little bit you can taste the toffee in between that and that but I just didn't want to give that one too soon yeah but I want to make sure that it gives yeah I just this is good yeah peanut butter fudge I'm trying not to lick my finger do something like but it's hard very liquidy like I don't know thinking can you see yes peanut bad fudge like chocolatey but I don't think I'll swear it smells good I don't get it's like a a slightly sweeter peanut butter smooth sweet peanut butter it's like a high-grade peanut butter laughs that is really good that's really good classic that is really good I'm gonna go hmm I really like it but you know what it was it was because I wanted chocolate in it yeah so you understand that is gonna be something else this I'm just gonna say that this is perfect for if you make pancakes and then you want to drizzle white chocolate peanut butter cup yeah let's see that I was so excited about this one it's thicker it's very creamy very quickly okay I need to change the battery it's not white chocolaty enough it's nice but it's not white chocolate to you battery died and we're back I'm just so underwhelmed with there I thought I was gonna be the best one I was thinking like we were gonna get like you know the Reese's white chocolate I mean about cars that's what we were gonna get in this tub but it smells better than it takes yeah I [Applause] was naked the thing is if this literally just said peanut butter then I would have given it a vest but I guess this because it's promising right we're not about that to cookie bits as well yeah it's not like fun Betty a whole party smell was a bit birthday cakey yeah and shall I like mix it so that we see you've gotta get in the bits in it yeah oh it's really thick this one yeah this is the thickest so far everything oh my god it actually has my mom is watering it has chunks in there what is it cookie chunks I think I'm good I'm trying to fish out a bit I'm just gonna put out there's not an even distribution of cookie chunks their tongue monster do peanut butter just need to make sure the edges are okay go in about that all right ready I really like that one go lies next level I'm gonna go oh yo because I think that I like the cinnamon talking laughter yeah I think I just like this just a little bit more than toffee one and so that's why yes this it's really good yeah how would you explain it though I don't know if I so much get a taste of cookie though you know it's just sweet and I like I like that one oh wow oh yeah but where's mine and if you just use mine there's like you know I can have nature all right go that's nice so this is the salted caramel hot almond butter and it looks like this what is it marshmallows what are those things I have no idea what is this one huh is this ready wow it smells very salty salt caramel oh I think I'm gonna like this one no see well those that what are those things Phillip I think this is so confused that's like a whole bunch of everything I think this is very confused this one is really not good there's too much there's too much going on like what was that I feel like I'm eating tea I learned what these bits are but I just think the combination of salted caramel chocolate and almonds doesn't work with the teeth yeah no double stuffed and blocked peanut butter I don't know if I just liked it it had a crunch but I just wasn't sure on the flavor gonna be a classic this is very creamy that was pretty yeah very creamy you having a chunk it's a classic I like that one the only thing is the teeth I really don't like these little bits no I like I don't like a little bit but I like the peanut butter there's no need for the bit just yeah I think they're just bits of sugar laughing they are yeah okay oh do we judge it with the bits all right ready hmm it's a shame though use of the bits I'm gonna give it a because of the bits like okay maybe like it's a look if you didn't have the bits I'd say that but with the bits it sir hmm yeah it's a once at home but it's sweet and I do like the texture - the won laughs birthday cake almond butter this doesn't have them oh it does it had bits as well I feel like almond butter is more liquidy night it does have a big picture I like hopefully this one's good I'm so thick though it's so thick I feel when you know you know it's quite Moorish Moorish that you just want more it's good isn't it like it's not peanut butter but it's good but it's I couldn't see myself speeding that no I'm giving it it's not as good at the cinnamon but it's worth it's a worth of silent yeah I can see why but I just personally could never rate almond butter above peanut butter you know I just couldn't do that oh let's do our overall summer here a mighty favorite that was the classic one that was good too but it had bit all right so to conclude favorites my favorite is cinnamon toffee my second favorite is birthday cake almond butter my favorites were the monster cookie and the peanut butter a punch this is so just like peanut butter taste testing I don't need the coolest people I don't know which one this is I think this might be with the peanut butter fudge one but now now there's no conservative for the camera now I can just I did just one say cheers for the taste testing peanut with me we like Rebecca no yeah yeah oh my god look at all this and I do just want to say massive shout out to all American butter actually have a discount I can give you guys so if you guys wanna save money on peanut butter but eat more peanut butter and then have more money whilst eating more peanut butter you can use my code I'm gonna put it down below and then you can we can only enjoy more peanut butter and more money in life the only two things mm-hmm oh dear this is what happens you know you always can't waste good peanut butter oh goodness I probably add more peanut butter now than I did a study I need a snack snack acquired don't mind me just struggling to record with one hand is it me or these getting smaller that's one bite best angle ever so yeah that was cute if only I could do this and then make another kind of nutty bar it says peanut so we're definitely on the right track here a couple of snacks before we go in for real nuttiness Oh comment down below are we team Snickers or team lion bar very small but can you focus on the bar figured some health had to be incorporated in the day so please enjoy this because we're not getting much more perfect ratio of peanut butter to Apple situation awkward never fear another one to go by the way I'm currently using this peanut butter tub as the tripod fresh tub feels however sorry but where's the rest of my peanut butter excuse me can someone tell me where the rest of my peanut butter is we need the essential peanut butter spoon for this let's see [Music] this is supposed to be crunchy and in my honest naughty opinion I do not believe there is in our peanuts it's not nutty enough I'd give this about six it sticks through the roof I know this video is already next level ethic I thought in order for this video to become that extra level of epic I'm gonna go to a peanut butter workshop no I also just want to say not gonna get into the whole the spinning like a flower hole of peanut butter test go Skippy if I want to do a bit of a drizzle out there for people not nuts and more mindful bite if I want more peanut buttery flavor in a shake I would go further my protein all not butter high pro not yet given the video thumbs up just out here chillin with BAE such a nutter no pun intended they look at the peanut butter dripping down oh my god heaven", "WL7WWPkZilU": "hello a couple people requested that i show how to use the deluxe cooking blender to make nut butter and the nut butter that i am going to make is going to be just plain old-fashioned peanut butter so i am using some salted nuts so there's only really one ingredient that's necessary and that is three cups of peanuts so what we're gonna do is we're gonna put the top on this is harder to do with one hand than i thought it would be then i'm going to turn on the blender i am going to move it down to grind so you'll see right here it says grind and then i'm going to hit the button in about two minutes and 20 seconds we should have some peanut butter now you can see that it's kind of struggling a little bit so i'm going to use my tamper here and i'm going to push this back towards the blade you're not supposed to do this for more than 30 seconds because it'll overheat so i'm just going to see what it does here a little bit and i might help again so and we're getting there so so so so and when it beeps you just hit the cancel button so what we're gonna do is you saw and i left it running the entire time because i didn't want it to look like i was adding anything after the fact but look at this peanut butter i'm gonna grab a spoon here so that we can just see how smooth this peanut butter is and this is warm it will harden up a little bit because you're going to store it in the refrigerator it says you can keep this in the refrigerator for four to six weeks so enjoy", "6uloKnrZxEs": "the weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we are looking at today another product from MILF and cookies those big freaking lips milk and cookies edibles we are looking at there 200 milligram peanut butter cookie if you've watched weeks before you know I've reviewed several milk and cookies edibles and found them mostly to be pretty disappointing across the board I do like their [ __ ] brownie it seems to be more potent than most most seem to be lower more lower potent than advertised and they're not the cheapest this 200 milligram peanut butter cookie I believe cost me $11 which is on the higher end for a 200 milligram edible that's just like a cookie so especially at my very affordable dispensary all right without further ado let's open it up and if this is your first time joining wheats what we do is I'm gonna eat some of this cookie in front of you I'm not gonna bore you by eating the whole thing Bowie I love this cookie let you know how it tastes Leggero it smells whether it's garbage or not and then the most important part is I take a break and I come back in two hours to let you guys know how it's feeling because that's the most important part of in your review all right so without further ado here's the cookie no weed smell very basic looking peanut butter cookie I'm a fan of peanut butter cookies looks nice smells nice let's see how it tastes tastes nice hmm that's a pretty good peanut butter um crumbly a little bit on the UM a less chewy a little bit firmer but good very good I really dig it but as we all know as I said way too many times by now it's not about how it tastes it's about how it makes you feel so in about two hours guys I'm going to come back to you and let you know how we're feeling and if this is another bust missus might be it for MILF and cookies for me um it's been nothing but disappointment so far but I am hoping that the paper cookie sort of turns it around with that guys thank you for watching weeks and we'll see you in two hours thanks it's been two hours here since I had the milk and cookies 200 milligram peanut butter cookie and you know I feel a little bit I it definitely has an effect on me um I think it's actually more potent than their cereal bars which I've had of the fruity licious and god I hate saying it cocoa Luth cereal bar so that's good um but still for $11 you know it's it's a little bit expensive for what it is and I'm not as high as I am as I would be with you know some other edibles that are 200 milligrams or even less um so you've got that to take into account it does taste great though the cookie was very good I really really enjoyed the cookie um in terms of a peanut butter cookie I would eat it just as a cookie so that's this pretty high praise I would put MILF and cookies sort of right in the middle of the road of edibles in terms of taste and quality if you see it at your dispensary and Oakland cookies are cheap there stick with the brownies and peanut butter cookie avoid the cereal bars and I think you'll do okay with that guys that's gonna do it here for weeks and we will check you out on the next review thanks for watching oh wait this was to throw this at the camera that's how we do it hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "uwIwBltyjR4": "[Music] bye [Music] so [Music] do [Music] do [Music] bye", "UfXchhtG5NY": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we help you decide what products are worth your hard-earned dollars at your dispensary and which ones are utter junk and today we are talking about one of my favorite companies when we haven't had a chance to review a product from in a while because they haven't had anything new coming out but now thanks to the new regulations here in California that make edibles be a hundred milligrams max and ten milligrams per serving Korova one of my all-time favorites has come out with a brand new line here they have the Korova Saturday morning mini cookies ten milligrams per cookie at it for a hundred milligrams total so ten cookies in here at ten milligrams each it's a huge package it's so much bigger than their normal packaging which is crazy its its massive and it was only ten bucks but then again that's a bit that's more expensive than their one hundred and fifty milligrams cookies that they used to have that were just single cookies but it's big packaging because it is holding ten little mini cookies in here I really like the packaging it's very handsome I really quite like it a lot it's got the new props on there keep refrigerated bla bla bla bla bla but shows you know it's compliant with them new regulations and then here on the back it's got it finally has nutrition information corroded before I don't believe actually had nutrition information on their packaging but they do now and it's got like the ingredients and all that fun stuff on there and now they have this child resistant packaging that is very tough to open because I've tried opening one of these before and they're quite difficult to open especially if you've not encountered it before I'm super excited to try these it actually I've been wanting to review them for a while they've taken me some time to find they're not in available and a lot of dispensaries yet which is odd because you know supposedly next month is when these regulations take effect although I believe you have until July to like get rid of your old stock of stuff but yeah I assume you'll start seeing these everywhere soon but I've been wanting to review these for some time because I assume they'll be as ubiquitous as kirova in no time so here's that obnoxious child-resistant packaging you have to place one thumb in the middle of the zipper and place one thumb into the back panel zipper and pull gently apart it's easier said than done you know what I'm just gonna cut into it because I hate it I hate the child-resistant label packaging I'm a child I'm too down for it dumb child here we go here are the mini cookies ooh they're handsome quite like them aesthetically they look a lot like the full-size versions don't have very much of a weeds odor chewy and kind of crunchy but good nice pretty good very little canvas ace if any at all I'd like it just as much maybe even a little bit more than their 150 milligrams Saturday morning cookie it's great it's got the rice krispies in there good cookie good cookie taste it's a little bit chewier and crunch here than I was expecting it to be but it's not bad it's not bad not a bad combination at all i I'm not dreading having to eat nine more of these so guys I'm going to finish the rest of this bag off I've got a lot more to get through and then I will be sure to let you know how I am feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review process I'm probably about two and a half three hours or something on my way to go see a movie and as soon as I get out of there I will let you know how I'm feeling thanks so much for watching wheats guys and I will see you in just a bit peace [Music] alright guys I am back it has been two hours since I had the kirova mini cookies medical cannabis Saturday morning cookies 100 milligrams THC 10 cookies and I am more than pleased to report that kauravas unrivaled potency is in still intact this is a strong hundred milligrams in these 10 cookies here in fact my only complaint about it is and it is a complaint well I guess my two complaints there the packaging sucks I don't like this child restraint and packaging because I'm I'm stupid I'll fully grot to that and you know I'm not I'm an intelligent person but it's annoying it's hard to open even trying to follow the directions it's not like the childproof pill bottles that are very easy to take off that's a minor complaint the big complaint is it's a lot to consume for one person I know these are designed for 10 servings and they really are because it's a lot to consume it's I mean you can see how big this packages and it's packed to the brim with those cookies it's for our calories of cookies which isn't a whole lot but at the same time ten of those little mini cookies it's not a insignificant amount it certainly feels like more than one of the normal size but still I'm gonna recommend it especially for this new wave of products that are coming in that are going to be these ten milligrams servings of ten servings each this is probably going to be really great III heartily recommend it if you cannot find if the any of the other Korova still lying around if your dispensary is only prop to 1/5 compliant grab these you'll be happy you did if not go ahead and stick with the original batch because that's gonna do you better but but these are a fine replacement it's not the end of the world for edibles but you know it's not it's not going to be the same same world we remember anyways guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching thank you so much and we will check you out on a later review peace that's okay", "jO2ZYbsdqhw": "so we've got pb2 peanut butter and company and Skippy and we can compare them you have these two brands which pb2 is basically like the household name and then the peanut butter and company is a new one that I just came across and if you're gonna compare them the serving size for each one is two tablespoons and there's fifteen servings in each one the calories both have 45 calories from fat pb2 has 13 and the peanut butter company has 10 okay so they both have the same total fat at 1.5 grams they both have the same saturated fat zero they both have the same trans fat zero cholesterol the peanut butter company has zero where P b2 has 0.01 milligrams so you know very very close okay sodium is higher in the peanut butter company than it is the P V 2 P b2 has ninety four milligrams peanut butter company has a hundred your kind of your close there as well alright total carbs in PB two is five whereas total carbs and peanut butter company is for the fiber is two in PB 2 and then one in peanut butter company they both have one gram of sugar protein is six grams and pita butter company where it's only five grams and PB 2 PB two has zero percent iron whereas peanut butter company has two percent iron now calcium peanut butter company has two percent calcium whereas P b2 has less than one percent calcium so peanut butter company has more protein and you've get less cholesterol and you have less carbs but you also have a little bit less fiber and you have a little bit more sodium than PB 2 if you look at a regular peanut butter you have 16 grams of fat and regular peanut butter where you have 1.5 grams and your or peanut butter you have saturated fat in your peanut regular peanut butter where you have none and your powdered peanut butter you have a hundred and forty milligrams of sodium where this one you only have a hundred nine grams of carbs and this peanut butter where you have four in the powdered peanut butter you are getting two grams of fiber and the regular peanut butter compared to the one and the powdered but you also have five grams of sugar and the regular and you only have one gram of sugar and the powdered yeah they had the exact same amount of protein so do the math so overall I peanut butter company is definitely worth checking out", "LA7Ps03pgmY": "hello folks welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy confusing place you call your local dispensary uh we got a big one here today guys we're reeling in a whopper uh this is a big ass bag of edibles and uh well it's it's a wheat's review so we're going to be doing all 20 of these cannabis infused peanut butter cups from emerald sky this has been sitting in the refrigerator for a while had to find the right moment um haven't eaten anything in a bit and it feels like the right time to try to eat 20 peanut butter cups in one go and not just any peanut butter cups well we're here on wheats so these are medicated peanut butter cups uh these are reese's with reefer um if you will uh but it's not a lot of uh weed for your weight i guess uh these 20 peanut butter cups contain the standard 100 milligrams of thc for california edibles each little peanut butter cup coming in at five milligrams each so uh i hope they're tasty um it looks like we've got ourselves about uh nearly half a pound of peanut butter cups in totality um and uh as i said these come from emerald sky look at this bear here he's got six arms he it's kind of a confused logo he's both a bear and a pot leaf and he's also kind of see-through um it's a strange logo to be honest uh these are their indica variety uh and they come with their purse uh emerald skies precision dosing technology don't know what that means um on the back we've got uh the story of the benevolent bear which is the weed bear that we see here um and i will not read it to you but uh you can be rest assured it is uh quite a tale um boy uh that is uh some interesting stuff to decide to put on your packaging i've been talking a lot i haven't been eating a lot of peanut butter cups and i have a lot to get to so let's go ahead and get to our peanut butter cups from emerald sky uh whose team has 25 years of candy making experience um all right so we got our thing open and here they are oh individually wrapped not very big smells like halloween with a little bit of weed in there smells like trick-or-treating candy individually wrapped peanut buttery confectionery goodness thankfully these seem to be manageable oh nobody said anything about sea salt these little peanut butter cups are covered in some kind of sea salt uh they look good they smell like peanut butter cups and salt and just a hint of weed so they are totally individually wrapped which is kind of nice i refrigerated these it's kind of warm in long beach easy to pop and share with friends which is i imagine what the original um goal of this product was not for somebody eat all 20. that's on me these are designed to pass around and individually wrapped that's kind of nice so let's shut up and try our five milligram emerald cup salty peanut buttery chocolatey looking for the weed hmm wow that is really good um i'm not sure if i think it's 20 of these little good but that is a quite good peanut butter cup and on attempt number one i don't think i have detected a hint of weed taste not not a single drop which is rare even for the best of edibles let's give another one a try here see if this one comes through so this is our second emerald sky one tenth salty peanut buttery chocolatey not weedsy wow mmm wow hello it's not such a totally miserable prospect of having 8 20 of these for this review um those are top tier edible uh in terms of taste those are truly truly outstanding wow i um i yes this these are these are delicious emerald sky you know how to make them taste good but the most important thing and the thing that's going to make all of this really worth it outside of the great taste oh and i forgot to mention uh the price so for these 20 peanut butter premium peanut butter cups uh these came to 22 bucks at a dispensary in long beach california which is not bad on average for edibles in california a little bit expensive for the dispensary that i go to a little bit of a premium over most of their standard edibles but it is a definitely a high-end um product it this i mean well half of the equation is good uh these taste great the most important thing and the thing that's going to make this really really um uh turn in emerald skies favor although they're already doing pretty well for themselves is if these things are as strong as i hope with all this fat and chocolate and wonderful goodness i'm hoping that these things are packing a punch that you cannot taste for that though it's gonna take a while and i have another 17 more of these to eat holy [ __ ] unfortunately not going to eat all 17 more in front of you i'm gonna go watch a movie hang out enjoy these over the next 90 minutes or so until i possibly can't stand it anymore and then two hours after i've had my last emerald sky cannabis infused peanut butter cup i'll come right back here and let you guys know exactly what i think of these guys but right now if you're looking for an edible that's gonna give you the munchies as well as satisfy them let's hope these are them oh these again delicious so um it may be a bit but i will be back for our final report on these emerald sky see you then [Music] so the legend goes that deep within the ancient forest just beyond the bend when the river runs high and a wind wisps through the emerald canopy a path widens as it arrives upon a place a valley full of sun and whispers of secrets there the heart of the universe resides great teacher benevolent bear gatherer of treasures the knowing one who goes by the name of cyrus he guides us to the way beyond through the harvest that reveals and enlightens and feeds us from within as we roam freely and enchanted curious and sublime toward a more blissful and beautiful world welcome back to wheat skies uh it has been close to four hours actually since i had my first emerald sky peanut butter cup uh reading the story of the benevolent bear there that makes a lot of sense right that's exactly the kind of story that goes with an edible for sure uh so a lot to talk about here guys first of all i failed i think i got five of these guys left uh i gotta i ate a bunch i i ate a bunch but i at some point i only had four left at some point my stomach was like don't you dare you can't not another that's not to say that they weren't tasty these really are one of the best tasting edibles i've ever had these are delicious um the benevolent bear knows how to make an edible uh not only that uh the reason i didn't finish them in addition to uh feeling like i've had just about enough chocolate and peanut butter for the day uh is well as as i was spreading them out uh by the time i got to this point i was like oh [ __ ] i'm already quite high uh so this would be what only 80 milligrams that i did instead of my customary 100 uh and it is a very strong 80 milligrams i feel very high uh and a pretty long lasting uh high as well as i said i started this nearly four hours ago uh and i still have 20 of this edible left uh not a bad deal and especially um this is one of the very few edibles that i would have i may have had my fill now but you know um if somebody had offered me these peanut butter cups to snack on and i did not know that they had weed in them i would gladly continue to eat them uh even without knowing that there was weed in them they're just that good they're really quite excellent so uh all in all actually quite happy with the emerald sky p pb cups uh it is not a product for me uh at the end of the day it's just too much uh it's actually quite affordably priced 22 bucks um it's a little bit higher price than some of the other edibles at that uh potency um but they are premium and they're nice edibles uh and it's not that much more and uh in terms of ingredients this is gonna cost a lot more than some gelatin um that most the gummies are so really i'm gonna give these a thumbs up uh one of the few things that i would say it's not for me but i have no problem recommending it for people uh that is the emerald sky pb cups and my boy the benevolent bear uh so anytime we have a review we like this much we want to give you a little cherry on top a little something extra you can enjoy with or without weed that isn't necessarily have anything to do with weed but you know just a little something extra fun for anybody sticking around to the end of this video uh and on this review i'm gonna give you a little video game and this one is a little video game and um much like uh emerald sky peanut butter cups will uh make you think it's light and airy and there's nothing to worry about but then three hours disappear and you've asked yourself what the hell has happened and that game is pick cross pick cross picross p cross heard it said a lot of different ways i'm gonna say pick cross uh pick cross it's a straight up uh could not be more puzzle puzzle game um vaguely sudoku-esque a big grid with uh numbers on it uh in which you are trying to use deduction to create a picture um in a big uh grid shape pattern by filling in individual squares all those squares will eventually make a picture it is a game that is impossible to describe well uh quickly or easily or compellingly it sounds very boring uh but it is a game that if you have that puzzle game itch uh watch out can be a dick as addictive as emerald sky peanut butter cups excuse me well guys that finn is gonna do it for our cherry on top that is pick cross so i forgot to tell you where you can get it you can get it on the switch i guess you can get on any really nintendo thing it's been around since the nes uh but i recommend it on the switch they have a bunch of collections they're all less than 10 bucks i think we have pick cross one through four or something is how they're arranged on the switch uh they're cheap they're great give them a shot uh these are moderately priced but they're also great and you should also give them a shot well guys then that is going to do it for everything emerald sky pit cross it's been a blast hanging out it's been a blast getting high with you until we see you on our next video whether it be a live stream review whatever the case may be stay high more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you then bye", "K7yHlnySM6g": "our new brand wideout offers delicious peanut butter cookies made with organic

We were like,\u00a0\u00a0 \"we can't waste this stuff let's make hash or\u00a0\nlet's make brownies let's do something different.\"\u00a0\u00a0 That year I made my first batch of brownies\u00a0\nand got the football team incredibly stoned.\u00a0\u00a0 We started our mission in 2010 and it was all\u00a0\nabout providing cookies for each and every person.\u00a0\u00a0 Really focusing on having a consistent, enjoyable\u00a0\nexperience from the taste to the quality to the\u00a0\u00a0 effects. Our plan is to remain in the baked\u00a0\ngood category because that's what we do best.\u00a0\u00a0 We sold our first cookies to the dispensaries in\u00a0\nSan Jose, South Bay Healing Center being one of\u00a0\u00a0 them, now Airfield Supply. We make Chocolate Chip,\u00a0\nCinnamon Sugar, Peanut Butter, Double Chocolate,\u00a0\u00a0 Peanut Butter Oatmeal Chocolate Chip and our\u00a0\nnewest flavor is the Birthday Cake cookie with sprinkles. We make all of our cookies out of\u00a0\ncannabutter. It's still kind of the old school\u00a0\u00a0 approach but we feel like it's the most quality\u00a0\nway to make edibles. The one thing we haven't\u00a0\u00a0 had to mess with over the 10 years is our cannabis\u00a0\nbutter. Big Pete perfected his extraction method\u00a0\u00a0 for our millions of cookies that we do now.\u00a0\nWe want to make you feel that every time you\u00a0\u00a0 take a bite out of a Big Pete's cookie you're\u00a0\ngetting that Santa Cruz feel. That hang loose,\u00a0\u00a0 relax, enjoy the vibe that our Santa Cruz\u00a0\ncommunity brings. What makes Big Pete's so special\u00a0\u00a0 is our ability to create this community and family\u00a0\nenvironment within our company. Every one of our\u00a0\u00a0 employees is excited to come to work and excited\u00a0\nto be a part of something that's been in the\u00a0\u00a0 cannabis industry for so long. We really bring\u00a0\na lot of pride and passion to what we do every\u00a0\u00a0 day. Over the past 10 years we've kind of worked\u00a0\nout all the bugs of making cookies and I feel like\u00a0\u00a0 the future of Big Pete's is making new products,\u00a0\nsome new flavors, vegan options and possibly down\u00a0\u00a0 the road making some cannabutter as a product.\u00a0\nWhether it's at a party, whether it's helping\u00a0\u00a0 them sleep at night, whether it's helping them\u00a0\nrecover from an injury our cookies have helped\u00a0\u00a0 so many different people in so many different\u00a0\nways, I just want to continue to help people.", "sLY9aibIMz4": "welcome to true buds tv it's your buddy jack with another cannabis edible review cannabis infused peanut butter cups from emerald sky you know i'm feeling emerald sky if you saw my licorice review videos if you didn't down below and in the info card you know what i'm saying these are delicious there's no doubt in my mind they're five milligrams a piece this is actually the second bag i purchased because i bought one bag i'm like i'm gonna do a review ate the whole thing then i figured i should have had some here's to kind of show you already had six yesterday a couple today and at first there's a little shaking in there it had me worried i'm like oh is the chocolate falling off but what they do and you probably can't see it all going for a close-up is they put some sugar on the outside which hit me just now is a good way probably to prevent that melting in the packaging when it wants to melt it will bind to the sugar that's just my first thoughts overall though these things if you like peanut butter cups things are on point potency is there however i say this with some edibles like this especially the lower dose of the five milligrams i kind of wish they were 10 milligrams because let's be real i need about 25 30 40 sometimes 50 milligrams to really get a nice high and let's just say it was you know 30 milligrams i got to eat six of these that's a lot especially if i'm trying to eat cleaner eat better but if i wanted just a good munchie edible this i mean it's really damn good if i gave this to somebody i would put my money on it that they wouldn't taste the weed in here emerald sky does it right my friends like i said i've done other videos maybe you've seen them i saw they came out with the peanut butter cups and i'm like let's go they deliver bottom line i'd say a couple of my favorite edible companies if you're just starting my content emerald sky is up there for the licorice and now these for a chocolate for other chocolate kiva uh the fancy is really great but once again it's a lot of chocolate you got to eat the chocolate's on point but i prefer the smallest dose possible that's why some of my go-to's are the level blends the pro tabs and absolute extracts uh gel caps i got another review coming for you too on some other pills i love tinctures too and i love doing the homemade ones i've been checking with the t-check 2 recently so check out all those homemade edible recipes and fun how-to's below as well and i just want to keep this one simple yes tastes great yes consistency is there only drawback is you got to eat a fair amount to get your dose unless you have a low tolerance and one of these can do it for you buy a bag and make it last you know what i'm saying thank you for hanging out today on another true buds cannabis edible review and i really do want to hear from you i want to make these reviews better i kind of was doing a lot before i was making tons of reviews and i kind of slowed off because i like doing the how to's comedy videos and the podcasts and stuff but i've had some more requests for more reviews what do you want to see me bring to the reviews i'm trying to bring in close-ups better shots talk to you a little more in depth i'm trying to bring it the best i can on these reviews but i know everybody's got their own thing that they want to hear or see so just let me know and i'll do my best to incorporate it into future reviews light one up this thing's got to be i'm going to light one up and i'll catch you on the next one you", "fxt_wDiY9QQ": "hey guys Eileen back with another recipe for you guys and this is a protein bar it's actually a peanut butter CBD protein bar so it's very delicious it's very nutritious and high CBD in it so you're getting all the health benefits of the CBD oil so what I do is they're already made by the way so in a food processor you're gonna want to put dates oats honey protein powder vanilla protein powder almonds if you like almonds you can use cashews peanuts macadamia nuts whatever nut you choose you can use I like almonds so I used almonds and peanut butter so it's pretty easy so you have all these ingredients and then I added two of our flavors at what your labs I added let's see here cappella cinnamon Danish swirl so I added a quarter teaspoon of that well I'll let you know the measurements I forgot to tell you I'm at home so filming this you know my kitchen right now so you're gonna hear my doggies in the background a little bit the hair like it's the slightest noise outside they go nuts so anyway back to the recipe that's crazy so okay so with our flavors I use two flavors but you can use whatever flavor you'd like you know I was thinking about cookies and cream those will be late a pumpkin even whatever flavor you like to add to your protein bar I'm sure it's gonna come out delicious you know it's just preference its preference and flavors so what I used was almond amaretto and then I cinnamon Danish swirls I'd love cinnamon flavor so so anyway once you have all your ingredients which measurements are and they're gonna be in you know below also so you can print it out like or whatever we have let's see peanut butter we have one cup of peanut butter drippy so you're gonna want to put it in the microwave for about 10 seconds so it's nice and gooey so it mixes well with the dry ingredients and then we're gonna throw in two cups I believe a both yes it is two cups of oats and then ten dates and then with the honey we're gonna go with I believe a half a cup of honey yeah some right half a cup of honey and with the protein powder you can get this at any local health food store it's really easy you know every place basically carries it now so we're gonna go with a half a cup of vanilla protein powder so you're gonna want to go with vanilla with this recipe because because it just complements the other ingredients so the milk protein powder and then with the almonds you're gonna want to go a quarter cup on the almonds you can go one more but I find it usually dries out the recipes so quarter cup is just enough and with my flavors which I use almond and right up by TFA I go a quarter of quarter teaspoon with this in with the capela cinnamon Danish twirl I go a quarter teaspoon also with this so I find it it's perfect no more no less depends what if you want it to be stronger it's off to you it's so easy once it's blended in in the food processor you could just add more you know I mean but you gotta watch out because you can't take away when to add more so you want to go with a quarter on each flavor first and if you like a little more add a little more so once all the ingredients that I went through yes two cups of oats ten dates one cup of peanut butter drippy in the half a cup honey one teaspoon well it says vanilla extract but I you know you can go with vanilla but I went with these these two flavors because I think the almond and amaretto definitely brought out the flavor in the almonds in the real almonds here so so once you have all that together oh and also a pinch of salt you know the big thing now is like salted caramel they salted caramel that so the salt brings out the flavor also so it's it's you know it's nice to just add a dash of salt so once that's all blended up in your food processor you then mold you take actually a quarter cup of you know the recipe and you loosely actually you loosely pack it into this cup because I made the mistake of packing it tightly and I came at home with nine bars instead of ten you should come out with ten bars not nine but if you loosely pack you know your cuff it you should easily come out with ten bars so that's just a little trick there so once you do that you have your molding your bar and this is the important part you're going to want to add because this is why it's a CBD protein bar you're gonna want to add five drops of CBD oil it's a 25 drops equals 25 milligrams of our CBD so you're getting a really good amount of CBD you're gonna get the benefits of it also so while you're molding it into the bar you know you're forming it you put the five drops in there and you got 25 you know 25 milligrams of CBD oil in each bar so Oh once that's done you're gonna want to throw this into the freezer for about I'd say half hour to an hour just so they firm up and this this is a great recipe because it makes a really great pre-workout snack after workout snack anytime snack it's just it's delicious and if you love peanut butter and I love peanut butter you're gonna love this let me know if you guys make this at home and you know let comment let me know if you you know if you liked it I don't even taste the CBD in it it's just all the other flavors are masking it but you're going to get the benefits of the CBD so try it try it out for yourself and let me know and that's it it's you know it's pretty easy it's a pretty basic recipe and it's very good for you so try it out thank you so much for watching and take care and I'll see you guys next time like comment and subscribe please thank you I", "qfdpEsrfu84": "[Music] give me a w w give me an e e give me an e e give me an A hey give me a t t give me an S s what does that spell wait sweet sweets hello everyone welcome to we it's the marijuana review show or we hope you guys make sense of your in dispensary classic classic review today we are taking a look at an edible and a brand I already know that I love quite a bit that is we are taking a look at our freshly legal review of Kiva Kiva their new 100 milligram a THC ginger dark chocolate bar with a hundred milligrams of CBD as well as you guys probably know if you tuned in often I'm not much of a CBD guy um but I am a THC guy so this one's a little bit more expensive than the standard Kiva because of the addition of the THC everything that cost me 25 bucks at night dispensary in Long Beach plus taxes so it's quite expensive but I hope it's going to taste as good as all other Eva products are and even most importantly I hope it's going to be as potent as Kiva has been now you can see the crazy packaging and has to go through this Kim in a sealed bag with a childproof seal and then this itself is in a childproof bag sealed and you always have to figure out how to open these and I can never figure out how to open them because I am NOT a smart person it's some point so we're gonna try to figure this out together you do this and that and then you pull away and then you say [ __ ] it and you get scissors that's how that's actually how it works you try what it says on the back and then used to get scissors and then surprise surprise on the inside is the exact same thing with all the pertinent information on it as well it's got lab tested results nutrition information all the good good stuff you want to see on it and that great Kiva minimalist card word packaging I really like their packaging design I'm outside of this unnecessary bag it's minimalist its well-designed and it does the job so I'm excited about this I like ginger like chocolate I'd loved every kiba flavor I've ever had and they've all got me a very very high so let's see if the tradition continues and here we go can't really smell anything just yet each piece contains five milligrams of THC so I guess this is gonna be twenty little squares or rectangles in there and there we are there are our 20 rectangles with some little design on it and oh it smells a lot like ginger that is a heavy ginger scent let's give it a taste it's like a symphony in my mouth and the conductor is weed it's good guys don't know matter that's what much else to tell you um except if you don't like ginger you are not gonna like this because this is heavy on the ginger flavor I happen to be pretty a fan ginger so I enjoyed this the chocolate itself is great quality there is a slight cannabis taste to it nothing overpowering nothing that's gonna make you throw up but if you hate the taste of cannabis maybe avoid but for me please punch mmm okay well I've been in there sixteen rectangles to get through but don't worry I'll finish off all of these and then once I finish off the last one I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling okay it'll probably be closer to three because I'm on my way to go see bad times at the El Royale is that the name the new Drew Goddard movie the guy did cabin in the woods excited about that so I'll cut you guys after the movie and I'll let you know how this kiba there are a lot of pieces of packaging here key the ginger dark chocolate bar is hitting thanks for watching weeds guys and I'll see you in just a bit and welcome back to weeds it has been about two hours 45 minutes and change since I last seen you guys and I come back to you surprisingly conflicted about the kiva ginger dark chocolate bar if you will look at my eyes they will tell you I am quite high and I do feel very relaxed very at ease very peaceful however I don't want to say I feel high per se I feel just sort of more easygoing and more relaxed and I might be confusing this I might this might just be a total placebo a factor I've sort of gotten into my own head and the confirmation bias type thing um I have heard however that's for some people CBD counter affects the psychoactive properties of THC and this can make you feel the CBD sort of effects and you know the more relaxing effects of THC as well but not this sort of more whoa man kind of high aspects and I think that might be what happened to me here ah for some people that's gonna be great that is going to be a jackpot that's gonna be exactly what they want for me it's not what I was looking for I was really hoping for more of a the classic head-high experience especially seeing the movie I just got out of Drew Goddard bad times at Hotel at the El Royale something like that I can't remember all those nouns so I was hoping to be really high for that movie because Drew Goddard likes to spend some crazy yarns and said I was just really chilled out and and you know I was a little disappointed unfortunately this is not gonna be the Kiva for me however I am NOT gonna give it a disapproval or I'm not gonna give it the thumbs down because I think for this a certain customer one who perforce prefers the more gist chilled out relaxed style of weed might really love this for me however it's just not exactly what I was looking for not what I was hoping for but that is not Kiva's fault I I knew that that was a possibility going in so just wanted to give you guys that heads-up that the CBD seems to be pretty effective in here so if you love CBD and THC maybe give this one a shot if you are like me and like the sort of Moorhead high this sort of more psychedelic sort of side of I wanna you'll want to stick with the traditional Kiva's which I have no problem recommending wholeheartedly so this one is a little bit mixed for me unfortunately but again that is not not an endorsement or not telling you to avoid it so I'm going to before I bounce here though guys I want to share with you a little cherry on top something that I do not have mixed feelings over and that is another Drew Goddard movie because I did have some similarly mixed feelings to this key lebar about bad times at hotel Royale something elroy out whatever the name of the movie is but his second movie I think cabin in the woods from 2012 is a fantastic movie I'm sure you've probably seen it and I'm sure somebody if you haven't has spoiled it for you but if not check it out it is an utter utter riot one of the most inventive movies and years just an absolute blast love that movie two thumbs up for Drew Goddard cabin in the woods one thumb up one kind of half cocked for the hotel Royale and about the sort of same for that keepa bar I think that sort of sums it all up I'm still pretty high just not the same high I wanted to be and that's gonna do it for real this time thank you so much for watching weeds guys and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "PuP-MO-4yF4": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and today we are talking Korova organic with a k' you can see that they're organic with a k' 300 milligrams I had a viewer request this one I think it was mr. Crocs so this one's for you mr. crux on the back ain't alarming note guys say no to 100 fight back against the 100 milligram THC potency caps we need to make sure we fight against this you're in California read this contact who you need to contact maybe we'll do a video about this and we'll get this taken care of but that's not what this video is about it is about the kirova organic chocolate peanut butter bar and his organic vegan gluten free and low in sugar many of those adjectives I find distasteful but maybe all together I will find them quite tasteful so let's go ahead and open this up give it a taste here I am a little nervous being a vegan brownie I don't even know how that's gonna work I think you have to have like milk eggs all kinds of things that are not organic or that are not vegan all right so this is what it looks like it's a little odd looking I guess that's to be expected it's got like a peanutty bottom and a very glossy chocolate top smells like peanut butter no we don't really to speak of alright it doesn't smell bad it's must be a buttery so this is the organic kirova organic with a k' chocolate peanut butter bar let's give it a taste I'm after two four six hours power you can see on the inside it's got like some puff rice in there maybe yep brown rice you it's not bad it's very very very very very chewy I am NOT looking forward to having to eat all this that's a lot it's very filling you do it so if you're a vegan or if you like yourself organ organic excuse me or gluten-free or low and sugar maybe give this a try if you're not gluten insensitive if you're not a celiac if you don't care about eating animals but I will finish this off I promise you guys I will finish this off and I will come back to you guys and actually probably closer to three hours to let you know how we're feeling because if you turn around right behind you they're about to go see Wonder Woman on opening night there at the Cinemark at the park and I will let you guys know in about three hours how Wonder Woman is and how this kirova organic is feeling thank you so much for watching weeds guys and we will see you soon peace it has been two hours two hours oh boy yeah it has definitely been over three hours since I last checked in after taking the kirova organic chocolate peanut butter bar and I gotta say I am thoroughly impressed with both it and Wonder Woman with mixed reservations on both impressed in that they were better than I thought either of them were going to be and with reservations in that they were better than I thought they were going to be but I'm still not sure I would recommend them totally I did not really like the taste of the chocolate peanut butter bar but then again I don't really like organic vegan or gluten-free things especially all three of those things combined usually I avoid that aisle the grocery store not that I have any prejudices against those foods I just have the diet of a 12 year old so that's why I that's no no no qualms against this it's unfortunately I have no control to judge it against to say whether or not this is a good tasting chocolate peanut butter bar that is organic vegan and gluten free because I've never had one of those to judge it against unlike a lot of the other Korova products which I've had both a Medicaid and an unmedicated version so but I assume because most of Carabas are great that this one is probably pretty comparable and good so and over these three hours later I am still pretty high I gotta say I'm really quite impressed with its potency just as potent as its non organic vegan gluten free brethren so boy yeah high regards and briefly about Wonder Woman it was funnier than I thought I was going to be it was a little bit longer than I wanted it to be and it was more stirring than I thought it was going to be on occasion and I had a lot of pacing issues but I still enjoyed it surprisingly so so yeah take that with you well thank you so much for two eats because we're checking on the next review peace oh no no 100 figured this out read this read this screen cap hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "hNNcotxEnew": "[Music] welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary I apologize still for the mayhem going on behind me here in the closet hopefully should have the construction wrapped up soon and something a little bit more visually appealing to see in the background so knock on wood so guys welcome to weeks as I said this is the first time you've tuned in to wheats the way our reviews work is I take the product I eat the entire thing of the product unless it's a special experiment or something I'm gonna eat or drink the entire thing and then I come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm actually feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review not necessarily just how it tastes I'm speaking about how things taste I think I'm probably picked up what is going to be the worst tasting edible I have ever had I have got a sneaking suspicion that this is going to be grotesque awful and might even make me gag so I'm really excited about it oh just give a pretty sneak preview there see this is another cannabis syrup I've reviewed one of their 200 milligrams before except I think I've reviewed a couple of their 200 milligrams before and really liked them found the taste to be a little hard to get through with their fruit ones and they've got a tons of fruit flavors all kinds of great cherry strawberry watermelon blackberries tangerine so on and so forth and those are all okay those are all doable but they do have something a little bit special a little bit something different a little bit something outside they're a fruity comfort zone and that's what I decided to go with oh and again this is a hundred milligram edible the first we've reviewed their 100 milligram line we've only looked at the 200 milligram before it cost me $10 or excuse me they cost $10 but I gotten a discount for just eight bucks to a pretty affordable price for this edible or this drinkable whatever you want to call it viscous liquid but the grotesque thing I picked up is the cannabis and it is going to be disgusting chocolate flavored syrup Oh God so this is a canvas chocolate flavored syrup 100 milligrams of THC in there they claim to be ten servings we're just going to do it all at once not going to chug it learn my lesson in the last time and if you look on the back there you can see I don't know how well it shows up but you can see this is actually rated by SC labs independent laboratory body that will determine how much tea is it C is in the product for real so you can feel pretty confident that this actually contains what it says it does all right guys I'm installing I've not been wanting to do this but it's time to it's time to go ahead man up and try this disgusting sounding cannabis chocolate syrup Oh oh boy I mean it smells like it smells kind of like Hershey's syrup it really does with weed and then like this other undefinable pungent something rather bottoms up oh my god it's so thick I wasn't think oh my god Wow excuse me it's like drinking wet cement um wow that is unpleasant it is just so dead there it goes again I'm burping again sorry I just sticks in your throat oh man this is they really taste it to be honest it just was like why does it feel like I put glue down my throat oh it's much much thicker than their other service which are already thick to begin with this is unbelievably thick oh my god here goes another little sip ah it does kind of taste like chocolate jorgito tastes like drinking nesquik mixed with a glue and weed oh well guys I'm gonna finish this off I think I'm about halfway through and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours if I haven't choked to death and let you know how we're feeling thank you so much for watching wheats guys I really appreciate it sorry been rambling here at the end but thanks for watching and I will see you in just a few seconds peace what guys I am back it has been 2 hours since I had the cannabis syrup chocolate oh boy and it was every bad every bit as disgusting and terrible as I had possibly conceived it to be it and that's only in terms of the taste let's let's get that right off the bat and actually it didn't even taste that bad it's just it has the consistency of bull semen so it's hard to get down I mean it's it's it's ridiculous you saw me literally choke on it there for a while so that being said it's great still I these hundred milligram canvases are yeah right at about to say half the strength of their 200 milligram brothers right where you would expect them to be good price eight bucks for this and yeah I'm pretty pleased with it I guess would say I'm pretty pleased with cannabis in general not so pleased with the chocolate syrup I would stick with the fruit flavored ones if I were you guys and I still haven't yet found that magic recipe to make it palatable I know I tried sprite in the past and that didn't sort of work out as well as I had hoped but I will find it because I'm gonna be reviewing some more of these cannabis syrups because I'm still intrigued by them so if I find that magical way out be sure to share it with you guys but otherwise that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you guys watching it as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "6SvgqtIN-oE": "yeah Ola gang and welcome again to ole nerd reviews I'm Tony I'm your ole nerd of the day and I try think so you don't have to today we're kicking it old-school no big setup no car thing just sitting here and gabbing with you the way friends are supposed to got a package sent to me from a company called verb energy let me go ahead and read you part of the email the three of us so obviously there's three founders or three people who work together in the company co-founded okay there you go co-founded verb energy out of our dorm rooms in college and I think you might really enjoy our verb bars each verb bar has 90 calories and as much caffeine as a shot of espresso from organic green tea so that's what we're trying today verb energy caffeine bars there's the Box got set three packages of them there's no packing slip there but we have verb energy Co caffeinated energy bars these are simply cacoa and a package of maple blueberry and finally a package of salted peanut butter on the old guy goggles so I can see each of these packages is a point seven eight ounce package and it contains 12 bytes in each one it says with caffeine from organic green tea so you don't get that jittery feeling each energy bite has as much caffeine as an espresso minimal ingredients you can pronounce great taste in 90 calories feel focused alive and ready for whatever ok overview of the stuff from the website what we're looking at says organic green tea caffeine we chose organic green tea because it has an amino acid called l-theanine which keeps your mind calm and relaxed while maintaining the focus and alertness that caffeine provides energy without the jitters not butter nut butters like almond butter and maple blueberry and simply cacoa and peanut butter and salted peanut butter are good sources of healthy monounsaturated fats which are great for heart health as well as protein healthy fats and clean protein source gluten-free oats and Queen Noah oats are a great source of fiber and both oats and quinella have more protein than most grains because of a soluble fiber called beta clue glucan I guess oats help to lower LDL cholesterol that's the bad kind good carbs for long lasting energy now you know okay let's start out with the last one the salted peanut butter ones how nice these packages are resealable ones too and they've got a little little thing that you pull just like that yeah they're resealable oh they're individually grabs also nice that's what they are twelve of those in each of the packages energy bars I mean usually natural bars and energy bars usually crack me up because they they they always end up well most of the time end up looking like they're Trail muffins leftover from a horse and you're going do I want to eat these and they're going no that's why we look like this we don't want to be eaten I rest my case that's what it looks like I mean it doesn't look too bad I guess I'm just having some fun anyway you can see the color there and that's a salted peanut butter so let's give it a shot it has the texture of a chewy granola bar it's not like one of the hard granola bars but a chewy granola bar as soon as you bite into it you get a nice peanut e peanut butter flavor and then it kicks in to something interesting this must be the green tea that's in here and it definitely does not have the flavor where you've eaten it you can you regret it later you're going why why did I do this why did I do this and you can see one right back up keep them all fresh take a drink of water and cleanse my palate next I'm gonna try the maple blueberry ones and kind of dealio there's the last ones these things are definitely filling too so um I think they would be pretty cool for like if you're hiking or you're going out camping or something like that that little bar and I only eat half of it it kind of fills you up I don't know maybe it's because I have a small stomach or something like that but build me up okay soon as I open this up I got a real strong smell of maple it's what that one looks like there you can see the glistening of the maple it makes you think of maple syrup and the blueberries in there it's it this smells really good I it makes me think I'm eating a stack of pancakes or a waffle or something french toast there you go french toast all right give it a shot hmm I like those better than the last one you have a sweet maple flavor and those blueberries those are real blueberries and kind of kind of chewing on one in my mouth right now and like the last one then you have that green tea flavor kicking in yeah so far that maple blueberry that's my favorite take another drink and finally these simply cacoa energy bars would you expect same thing there's a look at the simply kokoa nice dark chocolate looking bar smells like cocoa it smells like a powdered cocoa let's give it a shot I like the flavor of this one it's got a chocolaty flavor that is good but it's I don't know it's got little crunchy things in it but and you know I eat by texture a lot I'm not sure I I don't like to crunchy whatever that's in here it didn't say there's peanuts in here so I'm not sure what it's coming from but it does have a good flavor okay so out of the three the salted peanut the simply kokoa and the maple blueberry I think I prefer the maple blueberry the best I think that is the best tasting one then the KOA next even though I am NOT a fan of the texture whatever crunchy is going in there sorry about that and then the the solvent peanut if if I I wouldn't opt to get the salted peanut but you know that's just maybe they do on the website you can check them out at a verb Energy dot Co and I'll go ahead and leave that in the description I do see that those are the only three flavors they have presently I don't know if they're going to plan on coming out be coming out with more but those are the three that you can get so thank you Bennet I appreciate you sending me your verb energy bars all of those and I will be munching on them on a regular basis and all that all you guys know if I do get a nice little caffeine kick out of them but they're they're pretty good just for a little snacky bars there you go gang another review in the bag thanks so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't ready and remember I put out videos

talked about those flourish gummies okay first of all I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys I took them and as they went on I literally forgot that I even consumed the gummies that's out but I forgot that I consumed the gummies and during the whole day I didn't really obviously I didn't feel anything really because I forgot that I even took um basically I didn't feel really much of anything maybe it's because of what I ate maybe because my maybe I should have a after maybe I know I ate after a wild learned later on that day but my shirt but time on how long I waited to eat but I think probably I ate too soon and I didn't make the hi I'm gonna make me hi didn't I bring the high up all the way but um I don't know I like some down on me because maybe I ate or I don't know my tolerance is too high I'm not trying to say that these gummies will not work for anyone else they just didn't work for me my tolerance is really high from marijuana you know so I mean like the next person they probably will work for you but with these do not work for me didn't taste that great they weren't delicious you're trying to get us give us someone that doesn't want but just basically if he gives us someone they know they're consuming marijuana because it tastes like it like there's no there's no hiding the fact that it's not and that's I hope this video could help so it out peace out toodles and happy trust all my happy trailers and just another thing to just because it didn't work for me does not mean I have to say this again it doesn't this because I didn't work for me does not mean that it will not work for you okay think about your tolerance I haven't stigma to this I hate staring into the actual like lens because my eyes getting it cricket but this is because I didn't work for me does

the diverse landscapes of our wild and wonderful state let Camino transport you to a California state of mind our wild berry gummies pear calming indicator beans with notes of wild blackberry and fresh raspberries for a laid-back weekend vibe take a stroll through California's Pacific Northwest and relax a while so there are twenty gummies in here five milligrams each pretty standard affair for it the new edibles here in California with the new laws and you've got everything you want to see on it there are test results ingredients batch numbers all of that fun wonderful stuff and it comes in a beautiful package because it's Kiba keep it makes great packaging and it's not even that ostentatious there's not a whole lot you have to dig through or throw away it's just a bag but it looks really nice because it's keyed up and they make a nice packaging well let's shut up about how nice kiba's packaging is and talk about how good their gummies taste finger crossed and how high they're gonna give us double fingers cross if you're a long time wheats viewer you know that I love me my Kiva their chocolate I think it's maybe the second best edible chocolate out there behind defaults a delicious in potent AF that's a spot for that you see we don't know yeah I got open the child resistant packaging all by myself I'm a big big boy let's give it a sniff whoa smells good so there are our gummies in the bag let's take a couple of them out here they're a little bigger than I would have guessed much bigger than the plus size yummiest so here we are here are our Kamino Keva wild berry gummies a little cannabis e flavor but very fruity holy crap wow that is the best tasting canvas gonna be I've ever had it's so good it's so sweet it's so sweet it tastes like mmm god damn Kiba I'm legitimately not joking that's one of the best gummy candies I've ever eaten edible or otherwise holy [ __ ] [ __ ] Kiva man oh my god it's so sweet Wow mmm I'm not dreading I need all 20 of those gummies I'm dreading having the bag empty to be honest that is not hyperbole those are delicious those are delicious gummies but as we know we're gonna have to cross those fingers because gummies can be a little all over the map I found them to be getting better now that we're illegal world so I've got high hopes for these chemo gummies but like all our reviews guys I'm gonna eat all 20 of these sons of [ __ ] and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how these Kiva Comino are landing because that's what you're really in it for it so guys wish me luck I'm gonna enjoy eating this back and I will see you back here in about two hours thanks for watching wheats [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome back to wheats guys it has been two hours since I had the Camino the Kiva Camino cannabis infused gummies and we're really going with that cannabis infused gummies named with all these companies aren't weight cannabis infused that is and this seeming to be the new enclosure du jour for all gummies going forward uh first and foremost these are the best tasting gummies I've ever had edible gummies for sure possibly even just normal gummy candies these are excellent uh and they are pretty damn good too um I'd say they're maybe not quite as strong as the plus gummies that I've reviewed a couple of which I really really liked but these are not far behind at all and they taste so much better than the plus gummies which don't taste bad to begin with it's just that Keva they have some witchcraft they they have some witchcraft and they can keep that nasty cannabis taste at bay nothing all cannabis taste is nasty but it's usually really gross in the gummies but not here and so it's still pretty potent today got up to about a six or so for a hundred milligram edible not too bad not too bad at all so I definitely enjoyed my first experience with kiba's and Kamino line and I yeah maybe three or four flavors and I look forward to reviewing them all because my boys at Kaiba dog and that guys is gonna do it for this review really positive here so anytime we have one of those positive reviews we like to put a little cherry on top a little some extra that you can enjoy throughout your week that isn't necessarily weed related doesn't need weed to help you enjoy it on this week it's something a little bit different I don't often endorse food but this one is such a good deal that I thought I had to give it a shoutout and that is imitation gruel not so not real gruel real gruel is you know it's it's okay but you pay extra for it the imitation gruel is amazing it's got a very sludgy texture a kind of would you describe it as kind of an earthy may be a dirty taste a dirt dirt a posture or dirt - white kind of tastes you know it's it's great um and according to Krusty the Klown nine out of ten orphans can't tell the difference so we are talking Kiva wildberry Caminos super thumbs up and imitation gruel Krusty the Klown says nine out of ten orphans cannot tell the difference and this guy totally agrees imitation gruel check it out I don't think you can actually find it it's from The Simpsons so maybe that's what my actual cherry on top is The Simpsons the good Simpsons not the bad Simpsons so season 9 and then stop Wow that went a long ways for that but I appreciate you guys watching thanks you guys are wonderful just such good guests and wonderful conversationalist so we feel like we have a real dialogue here you and I the audience so thank you so much for watching weeds guys I will see you on the next review I

going to be doing another edible review i will be reviewing the chill chocolates bam now these guys are a traditional white chocolate with oreo i believe oreo cookies on the inside at first to be honest i didn't want to try this nothing about this packaging looks new or inventive or really appetizing the the gloss finish on these boxes is not helping it it looks it looks a bit cheap okay i don't want to be that person cheap edibles can be great sometimes but a lot of them are not so i didn't want to try them purely off just the way they looked and then the fact that they are pretty expensive where i found these these guys are 100 milligrams for 22. but i i tried them i did i said why not you know i need to try another new edible something i haven't seen before and these guys were those let me tell you yes it may not look like much but these edibles are delicious they are absolutely fantastic so they come in this small box in the box you will find this box and this box is actually super cool because this box can be used later like i can hold weed in it and stuff at least that was my original thought to do with this box but sadly i cannot open this box at all i'll try to open it right now and it has like a little thing right here to show you how to do it it should just be a squeeze on both sides here there's a little part where you know you put your fingers on and then you're supposed to lift this at the same time it all should pop off it should pop off easy it's for babies not to be able to get into but i'm guessing a lot of stoners can't get into this at all as well but in that box you will find this bag in this bag you will find your edibles these are the small milk chocolate edibles with cookie crunches inside a lot of the time chocolate edibles i do get a very strong marijuana taste to it these guys i did not at all so kudos to chill you guys made a great tasting chocolate i don't even like white chocolate i'm not someone who goes for white chocolate often it's not something i really enjoy usually it comes off too sweet but these are like fantastic and every one of these small little pieces is 10 milligrams and it comes with 10 of them i took 50 milligrams because i didn't think it would have much of effect to be honest i already was thinking down on this edible i said it doesn't look great it tastes almost a little bit too good i'm gonna eat a little more and 50 milligrams let me tell you this it was bomb if you bump into chilled chocolates buy them because they are bomb i mean usually 50 milligrams i wouldn't be like as blown as i honestly was and it was a good high it was good i wasn't sure what they used for um how to medicate these chocolates but it was very much a body high my body was super relaxed so if you if you suffer from a lot of body aches if you have a lot of back problems like i've been suffering with my back a lot lately these guys are great for that because they're also delicious they're delicious you don't need much of it and they work after my height went away i did get the sleepies though because it is such a heavy body high i do believe once these edibles kind of wear off your body now knows it's time to go to bed and that's what i did i fell asleep super early yesterday so each batch in the back it says is tested three times and let me tell you it is very accurate the milligrams on here was fantastic so if you're looking for something that's easy tasting something good to help you out with some back pains and it's something that's reliable with its strength go to your little dispensary and pick up some chilled chocolates man do it you will not regret it again my name is sarah b thank you so much for watching the haze your guide to a cannabis infused lifestyle and i will catch you guys on the flip side you", "6J9aM0Gh0iE": "[Music] and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's old-school today guys cuz we are taking a look at an edible just like good times good times I mean old times but the old times aren't necessarily good times anymore because here in California we are fully in the new recreational world which includes this ridiculous hundred milligram cap on edibles not just that but makes absolutely crazy packaging requirements for all edibles here in California so what edible are we talking about that is ridiculous today what we are gonna take our first look at Plus gummies that's right another gummy review I normally tell you to avoid the gummies but I have heard a lot of good things about Plus and I am a little curious I'm always hoping to find another gummy I like cushy punch or flourish or Tiki killers that's actually worth something so I'm definitely looking forward to reviewing these plus gummies first thing you're gonna notice is how crazy this packaging is so here it is here is our plus gummies I believe they are sour blueberry blue in case you don't know is objectively the best flavor of everything if there is a multitude of colors and blue is available always go with blue because blue is much like a like a law of thermodynamics or whatever the case may be blue is always the best fruit flavor even though I don't know of any naturally-occurring blue fruits other than blueberries and blue tasting foods are hardly ever blueberries usually blue raspberry or something it's always the best trust me on this though so we have a sealed bag with you know all these insane requirements on it batch number this that and the other I mean it's great because it has all of those wonderful serving sizes and ingredients and all the testing results all this stuff you know I like seeing but it's a bag and then a fancy 10 on the inside I think all edibles now have to be bagged in addition to whatever kind of thing holds the edibles they have to have these sealed maggots it's insane it just boosts up the cost because this uh 100 milligram 20 piece edibles so I believe it's 20 gummies each worth 5 milligrams of THC cost me 20 bucks at my dispensary which is outrageous of course but that is the world we now live in and we shall review it as if it's the world we want to live in who knows I don't know what I'm saying I know I'm sad I'm disappointed that the edible world has changed so much and so for such and in such a shitty direction over the past year but let's stop the bitching and get straight to the review of the plus gummies cannabis infused sour blue berry so we're gonna open up the first layer of the packaging here it looks like it's got a little tear thing nice Oh and then then we got our second layer the zip sealed bag on side of the tear bag and then we gotta figure out how to open this the childproofing I think you ground push down and that breaks the seal yes there we go so second layer of security through now we're finally to our chin on the inside and to the gummies in here ah so here are our blue raspberry or blueberry gummies whatever they call it blue flavored the best 20 gummies in there give it a smell oh definitely a cannabis e odor which is not a bad thing I I'd like to know that there's some cannabis in these but also a hefty flavor and aroma of blue but certainly in a cannabis aroma there as you can see just a bunch of little squares dropped one there and let's pluck it into our mouths but before we do in case this is your first week to review the way they work when we do edibles we reviewed the whole experience I'm gonna eat all 20 of these gummies and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling because it's you want to know how have it tasted like [ __ ] but you what you really want is it gonna get you [ __ ] up it's gonna get you high are you gonna get what you paid for it and that guy's is what you need to stick around for but first the taste test so here we go first cube in the mouth um very spongy gummies very very spongy almost hard to bite into because they're so Airy um a surprising cannabis taste them it's not awful but there is a 4 what is 5 milligrams of THC in these cubes definitely a cannabis taste to it but the blue the blue sciency flavor counter sex but if you don't like cannabis taste maybe you don't stick with these because you're gonna taste it again not terrible not overwhelming but it is surprisingly noticeable for what is just 5 milligrams of THC so guys I'm gonna eat me about what 16 more of these and I said I'm gonna eat me which is very back woodsy and folksy way of saying I'm gonna eat the rest of these so guys I'll see you in about two hours I'm gonna scarf these down and I'll let you know then if they're worth your money or not so thanks for staying tuned this far sticking around this far sorry guys this is really my second video back here on weeds and this will probably be another video between season 3 and between season 2 and season 3 so forgive my rustiness see you guys in two hours thanks for sticking around 2 hours since I have had the plus cannabis infused gummies looking at the camera for the first time now since coming back the fuse but I also see now I'm saying the word let's just start over one more time BAM I'm back guys it has been 2 hours since I had the plus cannabis infused gummies and I think there was an even yeah it says create on there as well there are a lot of nouns and adjectives and verbs on that packaging I'm really not even sure what it's called I'm just gonna call it plus gummies plus gummies uh guys I am genuinely pretty impressed uh for a gummy and for a hundred milligram edible this brought the heat um I'm not outrageously high but I am at like maybe a 6 somewhere in that range which is way higher than I expected it to be after a hundred milligrams and especially after a gummy I am pretty pleased with this now that is in the relative scale compared to you know this new world of edibles because this is a very expensive product you don't get a lot for your money here compared to the old world but in this new world this is a pretty good little solution um I found myself not maybe quite as high as if they were like akarova or a Kanaka mini cookie situation but for a gummy and for how much less you have to eat then which is very important to me you have to eat a [ __ ] ton of those cookies from like all you know Pete's and Korova and Kanaka all those ones you just mentioned you have to eat like 20 of those you know many cookies to get the hundred milligrams the gummies here were a hell of a lot more manageable that 10 was no problem to eat by myself I didn't didn't feel like a gluttonous badass after consuming that whole thing at all so really really pleased with that aspect um have a cannabis taste for sure but not awful um I didn't feel like retching after eating that not even close there was a cannabis taste but it was not the primary taste and again didn't have that just incredibly bitter kind of almost you know a cynic that Pacific we've tasted no no just the taste is there but then again for as potent as these came you know turned out to be you would expect that so guys this is a a nice win I think I'm I'm pretty impressed with Plus cannabis infused gummies and then also that were to create for some reason on there as well so I'm really happy with this I think I'll be reviewing some more stuff from plus in the future and if you see these in a dispensary near you and you guys want to eat all of something to get the hundred milligrams Jesus it's it's almost easier to recommend this then which is hard to say which is hard to believe actually then like the Kanak o or the kirova because it's just such it's so much easier to do and they're they're sort of equivalently priced you don't get quite as high but it's it's it's easier to it's easier to manage for sure so really surprised me on this one guys and what the [ __ ] let's just shoot the moon here guys I'm gonna throw a cherry on top - my little cherries on top here just little things I like to add that aren't necessarily we related something you can just do to enjoy throughout your week and I'm just gonna throw this one out because I am having an ever-loving blast playing spider-man on the ps4 from insomniac holy [ __ ] guys it's so great to see insomniac get this win I assume this game it's going to be an amazingly huge hit it seems to be it's only a couple days since it's been out but reception seems to be great and it seems to be doing really well sales wise I'm so happy for insomniac I love these guys since the ps1 days back in like Spyro loved them on the ps2 days Ratchet and Clank so my favorite you know 3d action platformers ever even love the resistance franchises back on the ps3 days and then they have been one of the greatest VR developers as well and I'm a big big fan of VR so you know what [ __ ] it I'm going to this endorsement is not for spider-man which is an awesome game I am having an utter blast with it it doesn't rewrite the rules anyway it's it's not a you know changing the genre it's just a hell of a good video game you know it's not rewriting anything but it's it's wonderful I'm having a blast with it but instead this cherry on top is just for insomniac in general they make great great games they've been making great great games for like 20 years I love them as a studio I'm so happy to see them having this huge success with spider-man so insomniac you'll never see this video but great job guys really proud of you and that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review what a great time we had great gummies that were so good here's an extra piece of packaging we had [ __ ] spider-man and insomniac on our cherry on top woohoo this guy's has been a [ __ ] good review let's just acknowledge the fact that everything went aces this time which doesn't often happen so great job plus great job insomniac and great job weed thank you so much for watching this review it's gone way too long and I will see you guys on the next one peace", "saNb3mEjFG8": "[Music] the morning i just opened these up their bike either apricot Tammy no catalyst infused gummies

out sick today so who better to talk about peanut butters and kids I have my two youngest kids ratley's eight and Reese is 12 and we're going to grade these peanut butters on a scale of one to ten we've got the labels all covered up so we don't know what we're eating these are all straight creamy peanut butter there's no chunky there's no honey nothing like that so it's a even base so let's get started this looks more like a Nutella ready wow that tastes like something awful a shoe wow that is am thanks barb I can letter to teach the cast about the farm how will you throw that and I'm giving that one kids did you know that in order for it to be considered a peanut butter it has to be made with 90% peanuts cool big scoop my last peanut butter nice and creamy no funky taste hmm and it's tickling are you that guy are you that 1/8 that's a good peanut butter I'll give it a 7 my life did whatever you fix is just icky that's because of all the protein that's in peanut butter takes the moisture out of your mouth it takes about 540 peanuts to make one jar of peanut butter isn't that awesome he's number three something has a little more texture than the last night Challenge de-allocate very very sticky tongue hmm not so solemn I'll give it now I know I'm peanut butter sandwiches 36% like strawberry jelly thing and only 31% like grape here's number four this one is a

we are talking about krispity krunch II no I'm just joshing with you we're not talking about Peter Barnes but I'm on camera one because they're good too because they're high in fat and three because we're actually reviewing a hundred million gummy bears what's correct we are reviewing the ED of your 100 milligram Getti gummy bears today looking at in another this is another in this series if that appeared that we're going to be reviewing smaller dose to the last time we took these if history is going to repeat them itself these will taste awful and won't get me that high I'm hoping against hope that both of those things aren't true but there are no guarantees so the peanut butter minims just that just bad to help me get some of this as the best part of this th e so that's why I'm eating news those are gonna taste so much better than these I have a feeling alright let's open it up here oh man I thought last time this packaging was easy to open but now it's not looking so good balls all right I'm gonna have to grow grab some scissors technical difficulties back that's a negative anytime you have to go for the scissors she'd never have to do that finally finally let's give it a sniff oh man Oh smells like gummy bears with weed here we go that is awful oh and it gets worse it's got that harsh aftertaste oh oh they're so bad oh why would you do this to yourself and get gummies guys why why candies and goes-- why I don't understand it I really don't but I'm willing to keep doing it for you guys just because you seem to like them I I I'm not sure I get it so the head of pure 100 milligram gummies guys I'm going to finish these bad boys off not looking forward to it and I will see you in two hours to let you know how they are feeling and let's hope against hope one last time that they are the exception to the rule and I am coming to you blazed in two hours but not too optimistic see you two hours peace it has been two hours since I had the head of your gummy bears 100 milligrams and nothing really I can't say nothing I little high it's sort of as equivalent if I had maybe smoked a small bowl recently so on about in line with what I thought not a good value proposition at ten dollars not at all they tasted awful tasted really really bad and I'm not very high there isn't really a lot to say about the etta pure gummy bears and then they taste terrible and they really don't get you that high I have a few more and appears to review and I hope things turn around for them and again I want to I do want to say that I think these are more potent than like the infused creations that I've had so take that as you will but you know just gummies and candies just don't do it for me they may do it for you edibles you know can everybody experiences them a little bit differently maybe they just don't seem to work but I'm willing to give ed up here a fair shake in the future reviews guys and I hope you will too should you stick around for future reviews and

what is their behavior and what's going to be important to your business whether you're a dispensary or a grower or a producer or a brand we look at two major data sources the first is our transactional data to the point-of-sale information which is helping us understand what's selling in the cannabis industry and we track the legal sales specifically and we do that by partnering with hundreds of dispensaries in dispensaries across the each of the states that we track we aggregate that data project it up to represent the full market and then what we give back to our retail partners and our brand clients is very very detailed information telling you exactly what's selling within the cannabis space so we can tell you what's selling by category by brand by individual product I'll be really understand how big is the market how fast is it growing which categories are growing faster than others and even more specifically which brands and products are winning within the space however the cannabis industry is unique because each market is so different in terms of the regulatory framework the way the stores are set up the products they're allowed to sell so we actually have to build up each of those markets individually and look at them state by state and sometimes even region by region we give you insight about what is selling in your dispensary down to the category product item level individual brands and all the rest of it but we also enable you to compare that data to the overall trends in your state as well so that you can see that concentrates are 28% of my sales but they average 26 percent in the state so I'm doing quite well with concentrates but with edibles you know I only have 12% of my sales in edibles and in fact the state average is 15% so then you can dive inside the edibles and try and find out what is it that I'm not carrying that's selling really well in the rest of the state that would boost my overall sales and increase my customer royalty specifically dispensaries can use the data to better assess the products that they that they sell in their stores so understanding what is selling across the entire market helps them be more educated in making sure they have the right product assortment so the right value tiers of products from budget to mainstream to luxury and premium type products but also across different categories what's on the shelves one of our products we just consider that a loss leader we were making it too you know it's sold which was fine wasn't massive selling and then when we got into GreenEDGE we realized it's the second best selling product in that category and we're like okay we need to ramp this up develop the product more make more varieties of it and it's just exploding since then so for dispensaries of course it's becoming competitive there's another store somewhere in your vicinity that is also carrying cannabis products you want to make sure that what you're carrying in your dispensary are the most popular products that most consumers are coming into your dispensary are going to say yes that's what I was looking for they're going to leave satisfied and they're going to be loyal they're going to come back again and again and they're going to become lifetime value customers worth thousands of dollars to you what you don't want is for them to come into the store looking for a particular product because they heard about it or a friend told them or something less or a little bit of advertising and then they don't find it and they're disappointed and then they leave in a nutshell it's category management right it's making the most of the real estate on your shelves so if there's you know one of the one of the best examples is say you know you right now in the cannabis industry at least in California everyone is just going with your standard 100% markup right especially for your senior packaged products what if you could charge five extra dollars for that product I mean that's five that's five dollars that you're leaving on the table for every item sale one of the things that we use GreenEDGE for determining what it marked a little bit on pricing so we come out with a new product well will the market bear what's a price that will make it competitive and and it moves off the shelves you know we take that information and use it smartly about the future and then we also create ourselves on the past you know how do we do consumer research is essentially understanding everything there is to know about the cannabis consumer and we like to look at it from a 360 degree perspective so we do that by looking at two main data sources the first is transactional point-of-sale data and when you look at that data long enough you start to ask yourself a couple of additional questions one of which is well who is that cannabis consumer and why are they making the purchases that they're making and that's where our second dataset comes in and that's our quantitative consumer research data and the quantitative consumer research data looks at the consumers from a very holistic perspective to understand who they are from a demographic from a psychographic their attitudes their behaviors and essentially why they're consuming cannabis in the consumer research that we do at BDS analytics we split the world into consumers and non consumers and how we do that is identify who is a past six-month consumer and then we identify those non consumers and split them between acceptors and rejecters and acceptors or people who are open to consuming but don't currently rejecters are not are not open to consuming nor do they consume currently and so thinking about that total pie and this is among adults 21 plus so again we're always talking about legal cannabis we can break out those three groups and really identify who those people are not only demographically but also attitudinally and behaviorally and that's really essential to get beyond just basic demographics so what we know about the current cannabis consumer is up there both male and female on their average age of about 42 and this is in the four core legal state markets so California Colorado Oregon and Washington we know they are employed full-time they enjoy the outdoors they're very social people they are willing to spend more for quality they like to try new products so all of a sudden when you get this in-depth data beyond just demographic again you start seeing who these people are you can start visualizing them and what that immediately does when we look at that profile of a consumer especially when we're out presenting this data outside of court legal markets all of a sudden it makes people think wow that's really who the cannabis consumer is because what people have in their mind is really what's portrayed in movies at least outside of our core legal markets they identify a cannabis consumer you know especially some of those in other states that think of it as the Wild West they think of 21 year old wearing a tie-dye living in their parents basement you know hi all day laying on the couch not living out a full life not being social not being a productive member of society and everything we're seeing about who a cannabis consumer is really debunks that belief and not understanding that that that stoner is who it is and really that stoner stereotype is truly the outlier as we think about cannabis consumers an interesting thought we observed here is that as they're it's an older consumer going into a dispensary these days typically the bartender's are young so can the bud tenders actually relate to the older consumer when the consumer says you know I haven't slept for a week or I've got terrible backache and I've had it for 20 years and can you help me with that chances are that budtender is probably not very well qualified to advise them I think there is some as some of the most sophisticated dispensaries and chains of dispensaries are thinking about the demographic of the budtender that they put in front of the consumer absolutely and they should be looking at the profile of the consumer not only who's coming in the door today but that we want to come into the door next year or the year after and then you think well then we need to train the right kind of demographic of budtender or train these younger people to be really good at relating to the geezers like me well it's really different about the cannabis industry especially the retail environment is that in most states you cannot just walk in shop around look around pick products up smell them open the box look at them it's much more of a controlled environment about 40 percent of current consumers and legal adult use and medical markets who shop at a dispensary site some sort of almost negative emotion before they go into a dispensary again that's 40 percent that doesn't mean all the time they feel that way but intimidated anxious concerned there's a lot of emotions there that people are feeling and some of those people are also feeling excited and that's a positive emotion the hurdle currently with the current dispensary model is for those consumers or those acceptors who aren't currently consuming but open to it there is a little bit of intimidation a little bit of fear of walking in that door and what's going to happen once I'm inside and then when I'm inside am I going to feel stupid am I not going to ask the right questions or understand enough and and what's really essential is making those people feel comfortable comfortable to ask questions and and comfortable in the environment cannabis is different from many other types of retail and in some ways it's also very similar to other types of retail I see a lot of similarities between retailers specialty retailers in the ski industry for example and specialty retailers in the cannabis industry for one thing they have a very similar stereotype customer base if you think of that young male what we like to call enthusiast consumer he looks very similar in the cannabis shop as he does in the ski shop and interestingly enough your average bud tender is very similar to your average ski shop employee in that they know how to speak that language they know how to talk to that fellow core enthusiasts who already knows about strain names and species names and types of products and delivery mechanisms and both of those two different industries have a similar challenge in reaching beyond that core consumer that core young male stereotype consumer and finding the rest of your consumer base what we like to call growing the pie and the challenge is making sure that you are training your staff and also understanding from a marketing and branding perspective to make sure that you're taking the effort to understand and reach out to those other consumer groups so quite frankly you're probably going to end up being a larger percentage of your overall consumer market", "EDjQLB0gNu8": "I gotta meets the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and if you look behind us here in beautiful Long Beach they've set up for the grand prix for this weekend really exciting stuff they're gonna Formula one cars racing around downtown Long Beach very very excited so I thought I'd come by and check it

bad boy for at a very affordable price 15 bucks for a 350 milligram edible is real nice it's got me a little worried but there's some things here on the back that I think have got me my fears a little bit quashed so fun facts medical marijuana it complies with Prop 12 to 15 made from scratch exclamation mark pho free made with top-shelf oil blah blah blah blah blah where's the last one we needed no SC labs tested that's the thing we want to see SC labs they say they are all lab tested by SC labs which is great for me I don't actually see the lab tested results on here but I hope I can find them on their website or something similar to that so let's go ahead and open this up and give this enjoy enjoyable edibles our taste test whoa it is very flat I was not expecting it this looks nothing like the picture here's the picture here's the product not really that similar but let's go ahead and give it a taste here it's not so bad very little to universities it's not a delicious brownie I mean it's no Kanaka or even a Korova but for a 350 milligram animal if it turns out to be a 350 ml or gram edible this is about as good as you can imagine or hope for yeah that's not bad again very little cannabis taste not a whole lot of peanut butter taste but for a 350 milligram an\u00edbal it's not bad so guys I'm gonna polish this guy off and I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to let you know exactly how it's feeling so be sure to stick to stick around for that guys and I will see you in just a bit peace welcome back guys it has been several hours since I had the enjoy enjoyable edibles peanut butter brownie 350 milligrams and I I like it I'm not sure that is 350 milligrams that seems like a lot for what I got but uh I'm rockin I like a 7 5 8 somewhere in there so not too bad feeling good it's more of a body hive and I'm used to sort of more pleasant body tingly feeling which is actually kind of nice the taste was not bad at all especially for an edible that potent there was really little cannabis taste it just wasn't a very good tasting brownie but for something that potent I certainly wasn't just pleased with the taste on the whole I'm pretty in happy with this enjoy enjoyable edibles 350 milligrams chocolate earth peanut butter brownie excuse me there it is the peanut butter brownie um so yeah I think I'm gonna recommend it especially if you can find it for that price that $15 price seems pretty good for it I do have some more enjoy enjoyable edibles to be reviewing in the future of that 350 milligrams strength so maybe stay tuned see how those ones go about see if maybe the whole line is good and pick your favorites from there but my first impression is going to be pretty Pleasant I think I think I liked it quite a bit uh and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat skies but before I bounce I'm gonna share with you a my little cherry on top something that isn't necessarily weed related that you can enjoy whenever with or without weed and for this cherry on top I thought I would do something a little bit more video game related again I think we've recommended offworld training company in splatoon too this time I think I'm going to recommend to you my favorite virtual reality game right now and that is a free one if you have the oculus rift headset you got to try Robo recalled I know this isn't going to obviously it's not going to be for everybody this endorsement or this cherry on top because if you got to have an expensive computer and then you have to have an oculus RIT we're oculus rift headset but if you get the opportunity to try an oculus make sure you play Robo recall or if you have an oculus and you haven't played Robo recall yet you must try it it is a goofy game I made by I believe epic the creators of the wildly popular fortnight a very different game this game you are ripping them apart robot you're tearing them limb from limb throwing missiles back it's really joyful exuberant experience one that I love quite a bit and I've played it uh I put it high in the past and that's a very intense experience and it's got great music - I love the music for Robo recalls so again my endorsement this week is not gonna be for everybody yeah you have to have a nice PC and you have to have an oculus rift headset but that is Robo recall it is worth tracking down if you know a buddy who has a VR headset it's worth going over their house and playing it just because it's that much fun again Robo recalled by the makers of fortnight Epic Games so guys that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "x1NeiktRNDY": "hi my name is California King with cannabis kitchen org you might know me by my online handle calli minused today I'm going to be teaching you a simple but effective single serving recipe cannabis peanut butter to complete this simple recipe you will need peanut butter I prepare to use high fructose corn syrup free um this is whipped peanut butter that's fine too you can use chunky regular whatever you like some cannabis oil now you can get that at the dispensary either corn oil which I do not prefer this is an olive oil and extra virgin olive oil that was prepared through my special preparation that you will learn that about in the cannabis kitchen book but you can use pretty much any type of oil preferably non-gmo because we like to be healthy so you're gonna start out with and this is for single serving is one and a half teaspoons of oil you could go up to two teaspoons for the amount of peanut butter I'm putting in this or you could take it down to one teaspoon that would be fine now this oil still has a little bit of the cannabis butt in it because I really do not mind the texture a lot of people do but when you strain it really well it won't necessarily be like that so I've got my teaspoon and a half of cannabis oil in a small mixing receptacle and now I'm going to want to take two tablespoons of peanut butter great start to the morning especially if you're in pain I find this peanut butter is a great way to manage Medicaid and the peanut butter does a great job camouflaging the cannabis flavor is really very very versatile sometimes I like to make my peanut butter marshmallow squares double medicated and if you find the consistency because this is whipped peanut butter so you can see the consistency is actually still pretty good I know a lot of times when you get peanut butter at the dispensary it's all greasy and slimy and it doesn't hold up the consistency very well but as you can see this peanut butter does very long since this has been you know but I was sitting in the cupboard you're gonna put this in the fridge for about half an hour before you spread it if you would like a thicker peanut butter so there we go cannabis peanut butter and this will definitely do a body good", "JShNLP2OWvk": "all right so this is the gear list I used for the 2014 rifle elk hunt I've got it posted down below and a link to the DIY sportsman Facebook page now this template I didn't come up with myself I actually got it from Soul adventure com this guy's got a ton of great information about preparing for archery elk hunting so I just took his basic template and just made changes based on the gear that I had and the fact that it would be a colder rifle season hunt rather than a warmer archery season hunt so starting off with the packs you can see I have two listed here the ideas that I wanted to set up a base camp when I first went in and then I wanted to take a smaller day packed actually hunt out of now there are packs on the market that would allow you to do both and they'd be lighter than just one of these packs you know packs like qu you I've really stacked mystery ranch all of these have those duels purpose packs where you can pack them down into day packs if you want but then they expand the haul meat and those are like the three to five hundred dollar packs this Alpes commander out outside doors commander pack was like 110 bucks on Amazon it's a cheap meat haulers what it is it got just rave reviews on the website I felt like it was really comfortable when I use it I've never really had any sore spots never had any troubles with it at all but it's not a pack that I would want to use as a day pack to hunt out of it's kind of noisy as little key rings at the pack attaches to the frame with and if you do want to attach the main pack off of the frame there's no straps to carry it on your back so it's kind of limited in that sense so I wanted to bring a second pack to use as a day pack and I just used the Mountain Hardwear a gamma pack it's the same one I used to carry my books in for college overall the system worked great I mean when I use that a gamma pack it was like nothing I was flying around the moans as if I wasn't carrying anything at all but in the future you know this is something that would be really easy to shave several pounds off of if I went with walls more expensive packs that was a dual purpose pack but it's really hard to justify that price you know that extra three $400 when what I had worked I'd only be saving maybe three to four pounds overall so what I think I might do here next year has used that same helps outdoors commander pack as my load my meat holler my Basecamp pack and then actually use an REI flash 18 which only weighs 10 ounces it's my day pack shelter and sleeping the re 1/4 dome t1 it's not a bad tent it's one of our eyes lighter tents within their brand name and now they've replaced it with just the re 1/4 dome one to drop the T off the name in their new line it's a little bit it's not ultra light it's light but you know I could definitely shave off a pound by going with a different brand if I really wanted to I would definitely would not absolutely would not go with a baby for this hunt at least that rifle hunt archery season yeah maybe but I mean just the fact that we got 8 inches of snow and one day with a baby I mean you'd be covered it just doesn't make any sense don't do it if you're thinking about it rifle hunt go with the tent the sleeping bag I really like this bag I'm pretty sure it's discontinued because I bought it from thrifty Outfitters which is the outlet section of Midwest mountaineering which is a local outdoor shop here in Minneapolis but this bag it's just under 3 pounds for a 15 degree bag 600 fill down I never once while I was sleeping got cold it got down to I would estimate 15 degrees the day that my boots and my pants froze and that night I was wearing base layers two pairs of socks a down vest and my sleeping bag and I was comfortable I mean outside of me the tent was full of condensation and dripping down frost I mean just just a mess in there but I never actually got cold sleeping pads therm-a-rest ridge run or sole small version so for the sleeping pads in my opinion you know a lot of other people's opinions if you use a full length sleeping pad it doesn't really make a lot of sense from a weight standpoint because from your knees down you don't really need to pad there anyway so just go with a small it's about four feet long covers all the portions of your body that are actually going to need the pad you can save on weight in space now this is a closed cell foam I did have an inflatable one and the main reason I didn't bring it was because I've had it leak in the past on the trip just a miserable messed I have to deal with so I wanted to be simple I wanted to be functional and I wanted it to be lightweight and this ridgerunner closed cell pad is super light at nine ounces I think my inflatable one was closer to like 25 ounces the only downside is it's not very compressible you just basically curl it up into a big roll and cinch it down underneath the pack but I mean it worked I don't really have any complaints if I was using a smaller pack that it wasn't as easy to attach that pad to the outside then yeah maybe it wasn't super comfortable I mean it's it's not that big so I would say maybe on average four or five times a night I would turn from my back to one side to the other side back to my back but it did the job all the stuff so far that I've gone through has been stuff that I've already had with the exception of the pack I bought that helps commander for this hunt I bought it back in the spring so I used for bear hunting use it for a couple of their camping trips but this was the main purpose that I bought it for everything else so far that have gone through I've already had all right cooking and drinking so I really like this system that I got and this is one of those things again where I can't take credit for it syntax 77 is a youtube channel where I got the idea for this Cook's that from and it's just really simple it's the chock full o'Nuts coffee can and then I can pack basically all the stuff that I need into that coffee can and it weighs pretty equivalent to what you would get with a titanium pot which can cost gosh $50 maybe so inside that chock full o'Nuts can I have my MSR pocket rocket stove a bic mini lighter a little thing of waterproof matches as a backup a piece of reflectix that i use to grab the pot to take it on and off the stove so I don't burn my hand and then I have my foldable spoon and I also kept a little GU tube full of camp suds to wash it out but then I realized that was kind of pointless because the only thing I was doing on this trip was heating up water so I never had to use it it was just a waste of space and a waste of weight I think that in the future with this thing what I could do is take that pocket rocket stove I would have the red case that it comes in and then use a 4 ounce fuel canister instead of the 8 ounce I think I could have got by just fine with the 4 ounce one and then maybe fit all that stuff into that pot with the insulation the other thing I want to do is get a new extendable spoon that one that I have it's more like a ladle it's kind of tough to eat out of but I need something long so that I can eat out of those big freeze-dried meal bags so I gotta figure something out for that water filter the Sawyer squeeze I love this thing so this water filter is incredibly easy to use it's way smaller and lighter than the pump style water filter and you don't have to wait like what you do with the iodine tablets tastes fine and it just comes with a little 34 ounce bag and the actual filter itself and then to carry my water I have two more of those little 34 ounce bags so then when they're empty they don't take up any space or weight in your pack you know it's like like an ounce I think I have written down for those empty platypus bladders I you know how do percent recommend this water filter I'll bring it along on every camping trip that I go on so easy to use so lightweight just have no complaints about it at all this was something I had before these are I'm the bear hunting trip he's on other camping trips packed clothes so you notice I have a packed clothes section and a gear that is worn or carried in section and these were kind of intermix I think I planned on wearing more clothes than I actually did I think I'm the hike in and out all I wore with my base layers and everything else got packed into the pack so that makes the total packet heavier than I have listed on here probably closer to 50 pounds but let's just go down the list merino wool socks times four I only use two and really I only used one pair of the entire time the only time I took out a second pair was that really cold night I put on a second pair of socks to have in the sleeping bag with me but the other two pairs I really had no need for at all the boots I used were absolutely great kept all the water out so I could definitely save some space space and wait there next time only bring two pairs of socks extra pair of boxers merino wool would be preferable I had marina wool boxers that I used for the ones that I wore for most of the trip and what's great about them is they're antimicrobial naturally so they don't get that nasty stink underarm base bottoms I mean Under Armor cold gear is Under Armour it's not as good as merino wool but it's stuff that I've had since high school football so it was really easy for me to just take that along a lot of the times when I went on hunting I was warm enough that I didn't need it I wore it mainly just when I was sleeping or to start out the day and then I would take it off at some point and put it in the pack this mountain hardwear 800 fill down vest it's a really nice vest 8.4 ounces is credibly lightweight incredibly packable I only wore it a couple times when I was actually hunting but it's a nice peace of mind thing to have with and I wore it a lot of times I'm a sleeping bag when I was sleeping great insulation layer and it's water-resistant so it can have a little bit of water on it and you don't worry about the down losing its insulation that's something also I should note about that sleeping bag that's here designs Ridge Runner that thing had water on it I mean wasn't soaked but it definitely had running water on it from the condensation in the tent and that water-resistant coating was enough to keep it dry on the inside blaze orange PVC poncho $10 on Amazon I got it because it was lightweight and that means a piece of junk threw it away already but it served the purpose I wore when I was snowing it's one of those one-time use pieces of gear and when I go out archery hunting this is probably something that I would look to invest in because those PVC poncho type things yeah they keep the rain out but they're really loud walking through the woods they're not breathable at all so this is something where I would probably want to spend on a little bit nicer piece of gear for the next time I go out beanie blaze orange heavyweight yeah so just a fleet farm beanie it's nothing special about it nice and warm I came a flattish neck gaiter this thing's awesome to have but it's windy I use a deer hunting I used it out there a couple times doesn't take up that much weight or space so just really easy just throw that one in the pack and then fleece 'lest hooded fleece hoodless sweatshirt again actually I don't think I use this at all this thing was more or less my pillow for the trip because with the other jackets and base layers that I have it was just one of those things where it provided me peace of mind but it was just extra weight extra 44 ounces in my pack that I didn't need to brush toothpaste baby Weiss backpack and towel all that stuff's pretty self-explanatory in the hygiene section safe teen essentials map I didn't go through the bother of waterproofing my map I just printed off some maps from Cal Top overlaid with the slope angle shading really nice to look at nashit up well with the GPS compass and whistle just real generic got to have it waterproof matches those were included in my cook kit didn't bring any backup lighters failure between the waterproof matches in the bic lighter that should be all I needed Camp soap like I said before that thing was kind of useless when all I was cooking was the freeze-dried meals duct tape fire tinder I never actually made a fire mat and Travis made a fire a couple nights and it was nice for trying out gear let me tell you when I was off of myself I didn't make a fire and it was definitely something that's nice to come back to first aid kit self-explanatory I like the one that I have never had to use it on the trip I've actually only had to use it once and that was when I was up in the Boundary Waters that big Pike that I caught my hand slipped up in the inside the gill and sliced my finger pretty good that's the only time I've ever had to use that first-aid kit but it's something that you just gotta have emergency space blanket might as well have it two ounces could save your life you never know especially up there if I would have you know fallen into a creek or something got wet somehow during that big snowstorm or gotten hurt that definitely would have been a very essential piece of gear to have hatchet I just decided I didn't want to bring the extra weight and I wasn't gonna make a fire so that was a pretty piece pretty easy piece of gear to leave behind say anything on the pen and notebook my camera is my pen and notebook that's what I take notes on hand warmers didn't need them hands did get cold I will say that I was wearing Primaloft gloves and I mean it's just something stuff to avoid if I would have brought hand warmers I would have needed to bring enough of them for every day and that's just adding a ton of weight to the pack it's easier just wait till your hands get cold and then pull the fingertips out and into the hand and make a fist you know just keep them warm as you go the emergency packs add a little bit of flavor to the water especially when it's cold like that I have a tendency not to drink as much water as I really need to so the emergency packs by adding flavor gives me that extra vitamin C to it's just nice to have Killick at the Havel on I love this knife I've used it now for a few years deer hunting and I will probably never go back to a normal knife for skinning and a super lightweight that thing plus extra blades is way less than a normal buck knife type of skinning knife so just no problems at all they're parachute cord that'd be nice for tying up the game bags be nice for hanging food which I didn't do I figured I'll risk it but parachute cord you never know when you're gonna need that it's all leave it in the pack tags and license self-explanatory I didn't bring flagging tape because they have a GPS gloves I don't know why I have nothing for gloves because I definitely brought gloves oh that's for the kill cake love's never mind yeah I just don't use the gloves when I got an animal out I haven't for years game bags so cotton pillowcases so you can go this route and the only reason I did this living in Minnesota is it's really hard to find game bags obviously unless they go to Cabela's and then you pay an arm and a leg but if you're gonna use pillowcases king sized and cotton over polyester because the cotton is more breathable so I paid I don't even I don't even know like 15 bucks or something like that for for big king-size cotton pillowcases at Walmart or Target or something around here and then I Drive out Colorado and Steamboat Springs as a Walmart and they got a whole shelf full of game bags let's helm ones they're nice and stretchable $10 I think they were so just picks them up I was like forget to the cotton pillowcases headlamp so I have a really nice headlamp and when I say nice I'm not talking about expensive it was like $15 it was one of those Amazon ones that comes from China and it uses the cree LED bulb which is unbelievably bright when it's powered with those 18 650 lithium-ion batteries the reason I brought or left it at home actually was because it's heavy takes up a little bit more space and I'd probably want to have spare batteries for and the spare 18 650 batteries are not cheap so I just used a little cheap headlamp from Home Depot was like a five dollar headlamp runs on triple-a batteries and I brought six extra because not only did this headlamp run on triple A's but my walkie talkies did as well and I got the lithium the ultimate lithium batteries from energizer those things last something like nine times as long as alkaline and looking at six of them weighs less than an ounce so definitely go with the lithium batteries cameras this was a tough decision deciding which ones to bring because I think my favorite camera right now for overall filming is the one that I'm filming this with right now the Sony nex-5r but to bring that camera I need to bring the camera memory card whatever lens is up gonna bring usually I wouldn't just want to bring one lens I'd want to bring more than one lens and the lenses are pretty heavy individually that I'd also need to bring a spare battery I need to bring a USB cord with my big external battery and that's a lot of weight it's a lot of space so I decided to leave it in the truck in favor of the Canon Vixia that I have that one it's a little bit lighter than all those accessories that I have to go with the NEX and it's got a way better zoom range so it just fit it doesn't have quite the low light capabilities but that's alright for this hunt I also decided not to bring the contour room just because they didn't want to have to deal with it hang it on my head all day so I figured just use that Canon Vixia and then if I get one down then I'll go back to the truck get the Sony NEX and film one of the other guys but unfortunately during that big snowstorm the Canon Vixia got a little bit too much moisture stopped working on me I've given me a memory card error so a lot of the stuff that I filmed was actually with my cell phone on that video believe it or not probably at least half of the footage which also explains the bad audio you know nice to have a walkie-talkie but I would not want to rely on this for safety these walkie-talkies were advertised to have a 24 mile range and when Matt and Travis or I around the same side usually the south side of a Ridge where it's just that open Aspen a couple miles away no problem getting a signal but we could be a half a mile apart on opposite ends of the ridge one of us is on the north side one on the south side no signal at all so I think that if you really wanted to have a safe survival type community form of communication I'd say probably want to rent a satellite phone giant squid laughs this is the lab mic that I'm using right now I really like the microphone and it's one of those microphones that requires phantom power it doesn't have its own battery source and so I brought that out there forgetting that my canon vixia it doesn't supply phantom power to the microphones and therefore I could not even use it it was just a waste of space on my back tripod self-explanatory audio recorder I actually did not bring that along the Garmin 62s loved this GPS and I know I'm well behind on doing a review on it I'm gonna get that out pretty soon I'll say within a week off that Garmin 62s review out extra triple-a batteries for the Garmin and I did not need to use all actually the entire trip only needed to switch batteries once on that Garmin I used it quite a bit cell phone was a good thing I had it along it's not much of an emergency communication device because I never had a bar of service the entire time but it did serve as a pretty good spare camera now on to the hunting gear a little bit more minimal here rangefinder use it a couple times it's kind of a nice thing to have out there even for rifle hunting because it's really really really easy to underestimate ranges out there sometimes I'll be looking at a tree and I'm like well you know that's maybe 300 yards and then I'd pull out the rangefinder and be like 800 whoa you know I'm close so until you're really used to driving distances out there and that open space definitely would recommend a rangefinder wind checker I was just using milkweed and a film canister it's what I use for deer hunting it's what I used out there got to have something with those thermals sometimes it's so soft that you can't really feel anything but that milkweed is still fly brought a couple calls never really needed to use them bugle didn't bring one along here I'd probably want to bring a bugle conjunction of the diaphragm calls if I want our tree hunting though 10 rifle shells I thought about bringing like five I was like I what the heck I'll bring five more boots I have Cabela's mindil uninsulated leather boots and those things are just awesome I never even really broke them in know where I'm from the Boundary Waters hunt and I wore them on this hunt and I probably put on twenty thirty miles I haven't gone through the GPS and actually looked at how many miles I put on how much elevation but never had blisters so comfortable just love these boots and then the bass top it's a quarter zip merino wool made by Cabela's they actually just redid their marina wool line and it's really expensive I actually got mine when it was the old line and the head and on clearance so I got a really good deal on it was like $70 but now they're like 130 which is probably similar or a little bit more than what you would pay for for a first light which is usually the go-to source for marina well base layers thought about bringing the softshell for the top and I just decided to leave it at home because it was extra weight extra space and was a good thing I left it at home because I wouldn't have used it Cabela's Berber fleece with wind shear great outer layer to have out there with the wind use that just about every day a lot of times all I wore was my base layer and that jacket it's a great camo pattern for out there to the softshell pants this is a native species as the sub brand I think it's a sub great that lock they don't sell them anymore but they're just great pants I really wish they still had those for sale liner socks these I did not have merino compression socks I just used one of the four pairs that I had packed they aren't compression but they were you know 60% or so of marina wool hiking sacks base bottom the Under Armour again cold gear I packed an additional pair and never used it I was fine using the ones that I had on a lot of times those ones are in the pack too so I definitely did not need two pairs fleece plays orange beanie this is a typo because I already had that listed in the packed gear I always wore this one and realistically it was a little bit too much weight for what I wanted to wear on a daily basis I usually had that thing just sitting up on the top of my head like a gangster just to let the heat escape I just used a blaze orange pheasant vest nothing special and for the amount of time that I spent hunting with a rifle that's really all I need gloves I really like these gloves they're made by Under Armour and they have preemie loft one insulation which is about the best warmth to weight ratio synthetic insulation that you can get my hands still got cold like I said earlier but apart from having like a three layer glove system or hand warmers there's really no way getting around that in my opinion binoculars tall by 50 is probably a little bit on the heavy side of what I would have wanted out there I think 8 by 42 is usually what's recommended as a good western pair of binoculars but I did have a really nice harness system for that I got on Amazon for about 15 bucks so it really wasn't an issue to have those savage axes great rifle great price sings attack driver for you know what you pay for it shooting the Nosler a Cuban bullets we're shootin just a hair over minute of angle and I think if I had a Caldwell blood sled or something shooting off the bench I probably could hit minute of angle that too much issue so that's all I have really the only things that I bought special for this trip were that helps out door commander pack and the rifle actually I bought the right before this trip other than that most of the stuff I already had beforehand things that I absolutely would not leave the house without on a second trip going out here a good tent a good sleeping bag a good stove and a GPS the tent just because the weather can be so unbelievably bad and so unbelievably good in the same day you gotta have something that can protect you from the elements that are yeah quarter dome that I had yeah I had some really bad issues with Frost I had some really bad issues with condensation because a lot of the times when that wind would died down there just wasn't enough circulation and the snow was caving in on the outside of the tent so that kind of removed the outside rim for circulation all I had was a little vent at the top and it just wasn't enough ton of condensation it was running down the sides of a mesh running down the insides of the rain fly but it kept me alive would have been nice to have a little bit more spacious tent a two-person tent instead of a one-person tent I think the ideal would be to have something that's like you know like one of those kuyou Mountain star two-person ones where you got a two-person tent so you got more room it's got a lot more stable tent structure will hold up to the elements a lot better and it's actually lighter than my one person tent but it's not quite that's like 500 bucks a sleeping bag again I like down but you do got to be careful that you don't get it soaked then the stove pocket racket I love it it did not do quite as well as the drebbel on the wind Travis had a jet boil I think that that one performed a little bit better use less fuel but the pocket rocket was lighter I think that even though they say you're not supposed to use a windscreen I think that I can probably use a piece of have you gauge aluminum foil and make something that's not gonna put the stove in risk of exploding but still be able to block something that wind and I'll probably post a video on that when I figure something out and then the GPS Matt and I both have the same GPS we both have the Garmin 62 s as we both had the Colorado topo maps loaded on from GPS file Depot Chavis didn't have a GPS and I don't know how he did it that's one thing to walk around during the day for the GPS you don't really need it you just look at the terrain you look at the map you can figure out where you are but at night if there's no snow and you can't follow your tracks back it's so easy to get turned around back there I just would not feel comfortable without a GPS at night so yeah that's about it there's not a whole lot I would have changed on here doing this again would have been nice to have a lighter pack overall that has the capabilities of both add a pack and an expanded load hauler it would have been nice to have a little bit more sturdy lighter weight tent but I mean those are minor things if I were to go back and do this at an archery hunt I want to bring less of the blocky clothes free up more space for camera gear I'd probably want to buy a set of dedicated ultra light breathable packable rain gear I'd probably want to use a little bit lighter pair of binoculars I think we're pretty easy to 3d print an adapter for did your bidding which is basically like digit scoping where you just take a either a cell phone or a video camera and you put it behind a binocular lens and it allows you to get that zoomed in footage and then one more thing that I want to touch on is hauling out meat we never had to haul out meat and talking to other people other people who are backpacking other people who used horses if you rent a horse on a trip like this we talked to a few guys that did this they said it absolutely is not worth the hassle I said the horses can only use a certain amount of weight and when you rent one of those horses you never know who's used them before how they've been treated what they're gonna act like and half of the horses weight that they can carry is taken up with the food that they need to pack in llamas there's other problems with llamas same through mules you don't need to bring in quite as much food but they can't haul as much and they're not quite as durable and the issue with hauling out your own meat is it's just a pain in the butt if you can definitely do it it's easier if you got several guys doing one animal but you still read a lot of stories where guys are like yeah I'm never good in that again so the ideal scenario would be to set up something with a packer beforehand where you have a mountain like a satellite fold speed dial or something and you know you can say hey here's my coordinates I need you to come pick up the animal some people can do that some people have done that and it sounds like it's kind of hard to set up but if you can get that set up I think I would definitely be ideal so the next time I go out I'm going to try and set something like that up beforehand", "H6cYs4ZcSv8": "[Music] revue show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I've got my Nutella here pancakes love Nutella and I love Nutella too so I've got my Nutella so you know what that means it means we are taking a look at another gummy that's right we are breaking the cardinal rule here on weeds don't be a dude don't be a dummy and buy a gummy we are taking a look at a very very popular gummy brand may be the second most popular gummy brand behind cushy punch and that is the gummy brand from Chiba choose themselves Green Hornet I had a lot of people asked me to review the Green Hornet's and we're finally gonna be doing it this is their 100 milligram indica variety love everything on the back it's got all the stuff you want to see the batch number from the lab testing nutrition information all that good stuff ingredients it's all they're so good on them for putting all the information on their Bravo to you Chiba chews now if you've seen my reviews in the past you know my Chiba chews I'm really feeling them to be sending my world on fire I found them to be good but not great more okay however I picked this one up for a very affordable price just 10 bucks for a hundred milligram edible which is a pretty good deal so it's a little bit cheaper than most of the Chiba juice and so I'm I'm more excited about this one and I'm an indica fan so let's uh let's give it a go I do have the uh oh looks like my dogs have come back from a walk welcome dogs welcome dogs low hello hello goodbye dogs farewell dogs sorry about that guys so yes back to the Green Hornet really excited about this one because it was more affordable and I've heard a lot of good things about the Green Hornet's now if you know as you know I'm not a big gummy fan really only flourish and tiki killers the only gummies that I've really really loved and cushy punches I find to be OH a so Green Hornet is fighting an uphill battle there but let's give them the benefit of the doubt open this bad boy up and give it a taste so if you've never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work it's very very simple I'm gonna eat this whole thing and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review so uh it tells us to cut the gummy into ten ten milligram servings there's it's little cut guide where of course not gonna be doing that I guess that's how they're gonna get compliant with the new regs whatever so here is the gummy The Green Hornet fruit punch flavored and again I picked this up for only ten bucks at my dispensary which is a very good price for these Green Hornet's so let's let's break off half here and give it a taste I forgot my I brought my Nutella to have some fat whoo wow that is woo that has a heavy heavy heavy cannabis taste but that is encouraging hopefully that means it's going to be as potent as advertised and seeing this lab tested results in the back gives me faith so let's add a little bit of chocolate to it here just to give ourselves the best chance of making sure we can get high mmm that Nutella makes that a lot easier to go down alright guys well that's gonna do it for this first half of this review for the second half and the most important part will it get me high I'll come back to you guys in two hours or for you just a couple of seconds through the magic of editing so I will see you guys in just a bit to let you know peace [Music] help I've been stung by a Green Hornet welcome back to wheat skies it's been two hours since I've had that Green Hornet and it's pretty good it's up there with good gummies like flourish I actually like it better than Sheba chews period I think it got me where I want to be some pink there I'd say I'm at a seven and a half somewhere in there not to put too fine a point on it uh yeah I I like The Green Hornet quite a bit uh the indica variety at least is muy bueno uh muy bueno bueno bueno way down yeah I'm really pleased with it pleasantly surprised I like it better than any of the other cheapo cheese I've tried so far a really a nice little edible nice discreet package it tasted like barf but that's to be expected for something that's so small and so potent so I don't really hold out it against it but it does taste terrible so if you're really sensitive as a taste no this one is this one's got a pretty intense weed flavor but on the whole if you can get it as cheap as I got it because I got it for ten bucks but I sometimes see these go as highs like seventeen or higher maybe I don't know the that's why I don't really screw that she would choose that much is there crazy expensive but if you can find this for around that price it's uh I'd say it's worth it I really had a good time with this one that's the Chiba choose Green Hornet's a fruit punch flavored one hundred milligrams indica give it a shot if you see the dispensary near you and before I go guys I want to share with you a little cherry on top something a little extra something that's not reviewing weed just something I like in my life that I want to share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related and on this review my little cherry on top is let's give it up for the air pod I hope there's not too much earwax on that because that'd be really embarrassing the air pods they're really good I hope I'm saying that right air pods that's the name of them the names dumb but they're actually really incredible little wireless headphones earphones I had a pair of Plantronics wireless over-the-air ones noise cancelling ones that I had for two years that I adored and have been using the air pods on and off for a while and and really come to appreciate them and they're discreteness in their ease of use and the just pull it out pauses the music all that good stuff really enjoy it if you have an Apple product if you have an Apple phone give the air prodigious shot if you haven't already I know they seem a little expensive but I think they're worth the the the Apple tax in this case so guys that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats that's gonna be a thumbs up for the Green Hornet thank you so much for sticking around at the very end of this review guys and we will catch you on the next one peace", "ZalkG1aF8qw": "reading the rest of it everything you're going to see is filmed in a legal state and if you're under the age of 21 [ __ ] off what's going on youtube as promised i'm going

let's get right into it but right now we are getting right into it and this is a review that I am super excited for because it is my favorite company my favorite edible company out there we are taking a look at one of their new products their hundred milligrams snickerdoodle and that's right it's by the fine fine fine folks at canna Co this is their updated 10 milligrams 1010 milligrams scored pieces I've reviewed one of these already they're chocolate chip cookie it was wonderful I loved it loved it loved it I thought that their solution to the California system of edibles where you could only have 10 every edible has to be 10 servings of 10 milligrams each it's pretty ludicrous the last one was just like barely cut into ten like a pie like ten slices of a pizza but really I just ate it as one thing and as I assume anybody will and I that's what I plan on doing here as well guys I'm gonna eat this whole cookie maybe not the whole thing in front of you because I don't want to bore you to death but I'll rest assured I will eat this whole snickerdoodle cookie and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling because that is what you are here for because I can already tell you this is gonna taste great because one it's a snickerdoodle into its can of coke so let's open it up let's talk a little bit about the packaging first wonderful incredible packaging from canna Co as always all the information you want to see nutrition information ingredients all that great stuff all their information on where to find them at Instagram at Facebook all that great stuff so perfect packaging nice and simple why don't we open it up on the inside and we've got the actual product in here and it is in a different color bag normally it comes in a color-coordinated bag but I guess if they're only doing 100 milligram edibles at this point they don't really need multiple colors they can do with just one so begin this is the snickerdoodle I'm a big fan of snickerdoodle cookies and I'm a big fan of canonical products so I gotta say my expectations for this one are pretty damn high here is the snickerdoodle cookie just as ludicrously cut into 10 pieces you can barely even see those score marks on it if they don't reflect through to the other side insane that that is a 10 10 milligram pieces but I don't personally care I would much this is actually much preferable to me then the Korova solution of 10 mini cookies give me one cookie give me one thing to eat and I too much time explaining these rules they're terrible that's all you need to know here's the cookie Kanako's snickerdoodle let's give it a bite it's got more bun almost a lemonade quality than most snickerdoodles I've had less cinnamon tea it's good I mean it's a good cookie I think in terms of taste I prefer their chocolate chip cookie to the snickerdoodle um but you're not gonna eat this and hate it I've had a really bad snickerdoodle I a with the TKO snickerdoodle cookie it was dry crumbly just in the tasted film this tastes good I mean legitimately I'm happy even it's the magic of candy coat well guys I'm gonna finish off this cookie I'm gonna break it into little triangle sized pieces here and then eat them in ten different ways yeah right I'm gonna eat the whole thing because I'm not a lunatic and guys I will see you in two hours to let you know the effects thanks for watching wheats and I'll see you in just a bit [Music] hi guys I'm back it's been two hours since I last checked in welcome back to weeds pardon the green-screen they're in the back I'm just a little spoiler alert a little too damn high to move it or to care to move it that is that's because canna Co worked it's magic again this is a hundred milligram dream this wasn't my favorite tasting Kanak oh but that Kanaka I'm starting to convince be convinced is can I can can I do no wrong is that yeah that's how that pun is supposed to what I was supposed to say is can I do no wrong but I messed it up and that's okay because everything's feeling great I love these guys I love their products this is just another winner I don't know why I mean you can tell how much I love them because how many of their reviews I do it's because I'm always excited to see them and I'm always excited to get a chance to try a new one and share it with you guys at this point there's no real beneficial reason for me to do these because we just know they're gonna be great but it's an excuse for me to have you know a great time myself so I'm gonna be a little indulgent a little self-serving and and do these reviews every now and then still so another winner from Kanak Oh again it's not my favorite tasting of theirs it's uh if you're going with a hundred milligram line I actually really like the chocolate chip cookie I thought was really good and that lemon drop or whatever it's called lemon sugar cookie that one's pretty good too but it's you know it's not bad it's far from the it's it's it's it's in good tier it's in a good it's it's in the good tasting tier for one hundred milligram edible so it's just not the their best anyways that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats sorry for the delay back with my cherry on top for the week and that is something that I have found myself surprisingly getting back into months after it has come out and months after it's sort of heyday and that is splatoon - on the switch I have played so much of it in the past two weeks more than I ever did when it first came out big reason being my partner picked up pretty switch and also got a copy of it so we have been playing it together and I used to I always enjoyed the game I always thought always a really well-designed game and certainly a novel interesting and what would you describe it optimistic design aesthetic something you know very different something that isn't about just killing other people but still captures that shooter feel I always liked it but I never I would get sort of bored out of it out of there a couple of games or I'd want to move on to something else but after finding it you know with my partner playing I can just play it over and over again and really really enjoy it and I actually stream that over at my other twitch channel or a youtube channel which is who be arted who we are did well you can figure it out H oh wait wait how you spell that WH o PR t he D ooh boy that Kanaka is still having great but yes I've been really enjoying splatoon too and if you guys have a switch you've got to give it a shot feel free to play with me and even if you don't have a switch it might be good enough or that Plus Zelda and Mario might be good enough to warrant picking one up if you have any any passing interest in any of those they're all spectacular but that's gonna do it for this cherry on top guys thank you so much for listening and we will catch you on our next review peace", "sKYcQWHqA74": "[Music] all right this product review is for the pet in your life these are CBD dog treats but what makes them unique and even more effective is that each dog treat is infused with glucosamine 15 milligrams of the glucosamine to lubricate their joints and to help them be more comfortable along with all the benefits that they're going to get from the CBD what I love about this product is that you know everything is human grade all of the ingredients the bananas the peanut butter all the oils and the coconut etc so this is a fantastic thing that you can feel good about giving to your pet because they're going to absolutely love it [Music]", "1xfLiNY4Tvw": "hi Jimmy here at the Dan curry that are talking about locals full-spectrum chocolate line they have a variety of different options here you have some 25 milligram chocalate drops they offer 50 milligram chokolate hearts and they have a hundred milligram chokolate cups so they actually make it with RSL boil put your Rick Simpson oil so that actually rich since it can actually give you more of a pain relief more body high than a psychoactive high so it's very good for beginners people kind of get in that entry level into edibles I don't want to get all freaked out or have that intense psychoactive high kids I think we always keep the full line of local products so if you want to try some news out come see you at the daiquiri [Music]", "ks2Cc1fykuE": "[Music] that wasn't that good welcome to wheats guys the marijuana review show will be help you make sense of your dispensary today's review is one I am particularly excited to share with you guys it is one of the most popular brands out there for edibles and that is cushy punch and today we are taking a look at their brand new flavor and now compliant with the new edible regulations here in California we are taking a look at their Private Reserve that's right it is a hybrid blend so this goes up there with their other hybrid they're indicated sativa and now they have a private reserve it is about one to two dollars more expensive depending on affability dispensary you can pick it up from and I am not sure what makes it Private Reserve I don't know what that even means maybe it's the fact that it's made with full-spectrum cannabis oil whatever that means or maybe the fact that it's not a food product means it's what it's a the Private Reserve I don't think so but we're gonna eat it the whole thing just like normal so this is as they say it is sixteen by sixteen 6.25 milligram doses which is compliant with the regulations and you can see on the back it's got all the information you want to see it shows the dosage ml 10 pieces wait 60 minutes ingredients nutrition facts and on the side here we've got gluten free dairy free fat free peanut free and non-gmo I was really hoping there was gonna be some gluten in there I'm a big guy peanuts can take I'm sorry if you do have a peanut allergy though I must make your life really [ __ ] so here we go here is the package on the inside like the old cushy punch it is divided and like the four squares but then they say you should divide those four squares into four squares of six point two five milligrams each I'm gonna guess nobody ever does that now I just have to figure out how to get this little foil little off here I don't see an open here anywhere oh I think I got it I think I got it guys just delicate easy and there we go oh yeah it is it is very easy to pull out twenty-five different little individual slices no it's not it's just one big glob yeah I'm sure somebody's gonna take the time to take a little knife and cut this up into twenty-five little squares and not do what I'm about to do right now and just plop this whole thing in my mouth actually I'm gonna eat about half of it right now and then plop the other half in in about half an hour come on out no come on daddy's hungry [Music] my camera person just laughed at me I'm gonna get fired for that nothing this is a paying job god damn all right we have our gummy it is for squares they're mean you can really taste the Private Reserve that actually does have I equal considerably less weed flavor than in the normal cushy there is a wee taste especially in the aftertaste it's not as strong as the other cookie punches it has a bit somewhat present like kind of fruity punch taste to it oh it's not bad it does again it does have a strong cannabis aftertaste but far from the worst in terms of gummies it's not pleasant but it's small enough and easy enough to chew down POC down that I'm not looking not dreading having to eat the whole thing so I'm gonna eat this other little half in probably about half an hour and I will see you guys two hours after that to let you know how this cushy punch ride that reserve is Landon thanks for watching wheats guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace [Music] johner matey [Music] yo jerks welcome back two weeks it's been about four hours since I checked in with you talking cannabis in ears cushy punch Private Reserve and it's only been four hours four not any particular reason largely just because I am lazy but I am happy to tell you that the cushy punch Private Reserve is at least as good as the normal cushy punch I'm not sure we declare it any better it seems to taste about the same maybe slightly better and I'm about as high as I am a hundred milligram cushy punch which is pretty good and high for a hundred milligram edible so I'm altum Utley quite pleased with this I picked it up for a cheaper price I believe only $12 which is a very cheap price I assume you're gonna have to pay if you're paying full price plus tax on this closer to 28 places and for that price I mean it's right in line with the other gummies it's probably worth it I'm not sure it's worth a premium over the normal cushy punch but if you're feeling fancy and you want to donate an extra dollar to the fine folks at cushy punch go for it I think I'll just stick with the regular ones from now on and that guys is gonna do it for this review thumbs up for me but before I go I want to share with you a little cherry on top something that can be enjoyed with or without weed something you could just watch and enjoy throughout your week and this one guys I do definitely definitely recommend that you have weed because you're probably not going to make it through without it and that is my favorite music video of all time and that is Corey Shores crying for America it's a bit hard to find I'm not gonna lie it's not easy son but I will be sure to include a link in the description so that you guys can check out this music video and feel inspired and maybe for the first time in three or four years believe in America I'm actually tearing up just thinking about it Wow again um this review is cushy punch Private Reserve it's pretty good but my cherry on top is [Music] I'm praying [Music] Cory you know what's gonna have trouble with this it's Cory shores crying for America and Wow Wow thanks for watching weeds guys we'll see on the next review", "ziGBxX3OPz4": "a review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking another look at an edible one from kirova we are taking a look at their third in their line of ten milligram ten mini cookies today we are taking a look at their ginger chew 100 milligrams in total 10 cookies 10 milligrams each this is our third look at Carrabba's mini cookie line I believe I think we've looked at their Saturday morning cookies in their chocolate chip ones so today we are taking a look at the ginger chew probably my favorite of all the kirova products so I'm super pumped for this one it's in their same very big packaging that they've got for their other mini cookies and on the back it's got all the stuff you need it's got the nutrition information how to open this packaging f-that though I brought my scissors because this is hard to open son oh we've got our ingredients there on the front everything you need to know and it says proudly packaged by Korova in Oakland at California so as I said this is our third time looking at these cookies I've had the same qualms every time I've looked at them in the past it's just a lot to eat it's a lot to ask of any person to eat in one sitting now granted it's designed to be 410 servings but I know a lot of us out there gonna eat the whole bag that's 400 calories a lot of cookies a lot to get through to get to get your edible dosage in for the day I'm going to attempt to open this childproof packaging but I assume I'm going to fail at it and eventually just going to have to open it the old-fashioned way with scissors but I'm gonna give it a go I'm gonna see if I finally can figure it out and the answer is looking pretty much like a know screwed straight to the scissors strike against you chromophore these nearly impossible open childproof packaging alright so here are our mini cookies they're in the bag all ten glory cookies whoops one escaped the bag that'll be our first one to go down there is the mini cookie they're dipped in cinnamon sugar mmm smells delicious smells just like a molasses or ginger cookie let's take a bite hmm now that's very different than their original ginger tube this is much more like your standard ginger snap and I like it it's very crunchy it's very crispy cooking it's not as chewy as their full-size ginger to cookies it's much more got that snap that crunch to it like your standard um molasses or ginger cookie really like it no cannabis taste whatsoever but in here very crunchy hmm I do like it though Wow these are good I wish I didn't have to eat ten of these you get a good high but you you know you have to accept it as it comes so guys in terms of taste Wow Kovu knocks it out of the park again but try not to talk with my mouth full this mic prime but as we all know guys it's not about how it tastes it's not about how it's packaged it's not about how it looks it's about how this product makes you feel and for that guys I'm gonna come back to you in two hours or for you it's just gonna be a couple of seconds and I'll meet you guys on the other side unless you know exactly how we're feeling after we've given this Korova ginger too many cookies the two hours it needs to fully hit so guys I will see you in just a bit to let you know how it's hittin thanks so much for watching weights and I'll see you soon peace [Music] sumos welcome back tweets it has been several hours since I last checked in with you and we got ourselves another grand slam home run slam dunk knock out of the park [ __ ] gold mixed metaphor sports metaphor wind metaphor for kirova and their mini cookies with their ginger chew oh my god I love this one uh this might be my favorite tasting Korova product yet I love the the I well I'm a big fan of ginger snaps molasses cookies and this one tastes actually even better than their 150 milligrams ones they're crispy crunchy exactly what I want no cannabis tastes the only problems with this package again it's not necessarily Carabas fault is how much you have to eat and how hard it is to open outside of those two things I mean this is a home run for kirova I am and all those mixed metaphors I used earlier love the taste love the texture the cookies love how high it got me got me up to the eight and a half level for a hundred milligram product this is utterly ridiculous it's really amazing absolutely love this if you see this at your dispensary and you're not afraid of eating a lot of cookies or or if your tolerance is lower and you just want to eat three or four cookies this is the way to go for sure this is another great product I've loved all their many cookies this is my favorite one by far though the ginger chew but it's really just gonna come down to your preference and cookies as I said love those molasses cookies love those ginger snaps and this is one this one is for me and it is a love pick it up if you see it and guys before I bounce here I want to share with you a little bit of a cherry on top we've been doing these more and more recently so I want to share with you another graphic novel I I'm not sure if the video had come out first I share with you why the last man I'm going to share with you my favorite graphic novel series of all time and it is also a show on AMC that I have not watch and that is preacher now preacher is only it's written by a man by the name of Garth eNOS it's not for the faint of heart it is incredibly violent it really puts the graphic in graphic novel I believe there are ten of them in total and it is an incredible story it is of the story about a the eponymous preacher who wants to go confront God and ask God why he has abandoned man basically and it is an incredible story start to finish and it goes to really unexpected places really wild places and has similarly to Y the last man one of the best conclusions in all of fiction ever one of the most perfect buttoned up absolutely pitch perfect conclusions I've ever read you've got to give it a shot again that is preacher by Garth eNOS it's a graphic novel if you're a little afraid of spending all the money it would cost to get it all up front go check your local library see if they've got preacher and give that first one a shot I think if you read that first one you're gonna be in for the rest so guys that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "7U_ET0_HVOw": "oh hi guys just enjoying some splatoon too but that's not what we're here about we're not here to talk about splatoon - as fun as the game may be we're here to talk about marijuana edibles welcome to wheats guys the marijuana edible review show the one where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's late at night and I'm ready for bed but I can't go to sleep so that's why I've got my cushy punch hundred milligrams here indica variety right here you know Ben so I'm hoping this is going to do the trick this is the second time of reviewed cushy punch I reviewed their TKO formula before 200 milligrams and found it to be pretty disappointing to be honest it did not do much for me since that time I have had several several people come up to me and say and I come up to me I mean comment online that's what I mean by that I've had simple people comment to me online saying give Chris you budget another chance sometimes that their formulation isn't as strong as others but when it hits it really hits so I decided to give it another chance and this seems to be the perfect opportunity when you're ready for some sleep with the indica variety so let's go ahead and open it up give it a taste and I'll come back to you guys in just about two hours after this and hopefully be ready for bedtime so let's find out if that's going to be the case or not okay so we've got our little jar here it looks like a little butter Pat actually a little pad of butter that you would get at our restaurant it's a hundred milligrams of THC in here I said before so let's go ahead and open her up and slope her to him and hopefully get ready for bed in the there we go there's our corner and there she has one big gummy pop her out for little rivulets they're not gonna care just gonna plump the whole thing I'm not it's not super great it's better than the like confused creations or those kind of edibles I've done as good as the flourish it sort of tastes more like a flourish type edible than the infused creations or at a pure or any of those two so it's better than those but it's not as good as the flourish company's in terms of taste so from here guys I'm just going to wait it out and hopefully in two hours I'll be ready for bed so I will see you guys then I'll see you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that's the way the wheats reviews work for you it's just going to be a couple of seconds so I'll see you on the other side of the break and for me it'll be two hours and I'll let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeds guys and I'll see you soon peace mission accomplished I think and a slight redemption for cushy punch I am ready to go to bed quite sleepy at this point looking forward to hitting that pillow and I feel pleasantly buzzed for one hundred and milligram edible this cost me eight dollars at my dispensary all-in with all the discounts so you know pretty affordable 400 milligram edible and I do feel about about a six maybe five and a half or so so you know I'm not super super high by any means but you know definitely high noticeably high and ready to hit the sack so I'm ready to give cushy punch another chance try another one there edibles because they earned their Redemption with this one I just there 200 milligram did not see you know any stronger than this for sure maybe it's just as people have told me their potency seems to fluctuate up and down so maybe this was just a stronger batch but we'll review some more could you punch in a few to see if my opinion changes but for now this was a pleasant surprise and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat skies and we will check you out on a future review peace", "l5SplV_jSiM": "[Music] hi friends welcome awaits the marijuana review show we help you determine which products are worth your money and which ones should be left on the trash pile of history we're not necessarily history I don't think any of these products are gonna make history but if there is one product out there that is guaranteed to make history it's the one that I've got in my hand we're going to be doing another edible review today and my heart of hearts my favorite of favorites Kanak oh that's right guys we're back with another Kanaka review we are reviewing their chocolate chip cookie today and I'm really delighted to see that these have are already compliant with the new regulations they've got this little sticker on here saying ten the ten milligrams scored pieces per package so that means they're good to go with the regs theoretically so that hopefully that means they'll be in more areas soon hopefully that means that you guys can find can't go play in your dispensaries and start enjoying the products as well now um if you've never seen a can't go review before I heart them I love them they're my favorite edible manufacturer in the world I've got no doubt some thinking this one's gonna be great this one here is a hundred milligram variety as you can see from the sticker on the top lovely packaging as always from Kanak oh nice box nutrition information on the back just great great stuff to see love it as always so let's go ahead and open it up and give it a taste here it is in their traditional sort of teal greeny packaging for their 100 milligram varieties and I'm interested to see how its scored to be ten different ten milligram pieces of course this is wheat so we're eating the whole thing not just a single piece oh wow yeah this is uh this is their idea of look it's ten different it's ten different pieces because it has ten different little cut marks on it fine by me fine by me better than Corollas mini cookies which you have to eat so many of I'd rather just have one big cookie that's sort of haphazardly scored into ten different pieces scored let's go ahead and get a taste it smells great oh my god it smells so good let's give it taste here it's great oh my god no cannabis tastes really good cookie I'm most vibing eating this quickly I'm gonna enjoy I'm really truly a.m. Wow they're miracle workers I don't know what else to say I didn't know what else to say I do actually matters it's not about how it tastes it's about how it makes you feel and if I have any guess it's gonna make me feel pretty good but you guys will have to wait a couple of hours well actually you guys just have to wait us a couple of seconds I have to wait a couple of hours to find out but through the magic and Wizardry of editing you guys will know in just a couple of seconds whether on highest buck or not thank you for watching weeds and I will see you guys in just a few please deuces it has been Oh two and a half hours since I completed that wonderful wonderful can of coke and guys it lives up to Kanako's reputation I was gonna tell you about where I am and what I'm doing what I just saw oh I just saw I Tania and woo I'm not sure what to say about that but here's why I am sure I want to say Jericho's chocolate-chip cookie while it's ridiculous they're split into 10 pieces strategy is the little preposterous it's still as amazing as it ever was and hopefully always will be because even at 100 milligrams I'm I'm like a seven five maybe and it tasted delicious couldn't recommend it more highly and I picked it up my dispensary at a discount I believe for an average of nine bucks I say average because I got two for a discount see that's how good Kanaka is is I'm trying to explain my math of purchasing to you all you need to know is buy it if you see it you're really gonna like it just don't split it into tenths just eat the whole thing you'll be happy ok thank you so much for watching guys you're wonderful and and thanks thanks so much deuces", "qaufnL2w7WE": "[Music] hey homies welcome back to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking another look at an edible product we're back to the edibles today and today we are taking our second look at a product from moon cannabis infused moon intergalactic milligram ajmer ajmer image we're taking a look at their spearmint mint hybrid chocolate bar today it is compliant with the new regulations in his 10 10 milligram pieces the packaging is pretty cheap it's just stickers on this little childproof ziplock baggie here so it's just like a little ziploc bag with a moon sticker on the front and then on the back it's got all the nutrition information all of the allergy information yadda yadda yadda so on and so forth and then it shows you the 10 milligram edge breakdown for the bar there on the back which you can see we're going to ignore that and just eat the whole bar because that's the way we do it here on wheats so as I said I've reviewed moon once before and I thought the product was pretty good the first time I tried it this is the second opportunity of I have had I found this at my dispensary here in Long Beach for 10 bucks so a little bit expensive for a about in range for a hundred milligram edible but it is a pretty in substantially sized product which I actually kind of like there's not a lot to it it's very light product there's actually only a hundred calories in whole on this whole thing so a lot better I don't have any ten Grove and Minnie cookies in that regard but yeah it doesn't feel like a very big hefty value for your money but that's can be deceiving now I got this new childproof Ziploc packaging here and I got to figure out how to open it because it's not very simple it might be scissors time boy I might be too stupid for childproof packaging guys I would say it's definitely scissors time as I just destroyed it I'll be right back guys gotta go run and grab some scissors see in just second points against you moon I'm back and it hasn't even been two hours let's just cut through this [ __ ] packaging I really really really dislike this packaging holy crap okay I did manage to cut through it thick stuff hmm and here is our spearmint Bart I like it the way it looks it's got some green sort of Jackson Pollock II hate splashy looking things on it with some some kind of interesting shapes they're etched in it I can't really tell what those are but it's cool smells great smells like mint chocolate and it is as I said very in substantial feeling which I like in my eyes I don't like I meet a whole lot of something so this is 100 milligrams seems pretty good to me so let's stop with the yep and get with the tasting hmm it's like if you've ever had an Andes mint before the little pinch that little mints that they leave on your pillows sometimes it like hotels or after-dinner mints the little green foil-wrapped tiny little trapezoidal shape mints that's exactly what this tastes like perhaps not quite as good as an Andes mint it's so good no real canvas taste to it maybe slightly more than happy to eat this whole thing um no problem actually vaguely enjoyable so and the taste front very happy with the moon intergalactic milligrams basement bar cut as we always know here on weeks it's not about how it tastes it's not about how it's packaged it's not about the way it looks it's about how it makes you feel and for that guys you're gonna have to wait just a couple of seconds me however I'm gonna wait two hours see how it hits and I'll come back to you guys and let you know for sure thanks for watching weeks and I'll see you guys in just a bit peace welcome back to wheats we are here to talk about my thoughts on the moon intergalactic milligram \u00e4j-- space mint hybrid chocolate bar and this guy's is gonna get a love from me but I do have to apologize can I am NOT coming back to you two hours later I am coming back to you many hours later this little guy here it caused me to take a nap a wonderful wonderful restful blissful map I really like this one guys um it got me up to the sort of eight level of Highness tasted great a nice small discreet edible and that you didn't have to eat a lot to get high and it didn't have any kind of cannabis taste I actually liked the way it looked with that green speckles in it packagings not my favorite packaging but that really is about the worst thing I say about it um I'm really quite happy with the mood inter-galactic milligram pigeon I will definitely trying some more stuff from moon I know they've got a lot of products and a lot of very different sounding products and it's not just you know cookies and brownies they've got a lot of different things so I am looking forward to trying some more moon and again guys sorry it might get into Sydney hi because I passed out I fell asleep gonna pass out I fell asleep and I'm coming back to you just a little bit later than normal to let you know my thoughts here on the moon spaceman hybrid chocolate bar this guy's is a big thumbs up for me if you see this one at your dispensary and you like the mint flavored things give it a try I think you're gonna be happy with it and that guys is gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on our next review peace", "OMOZw8ZbT3g": "hi there buds in my last video i showed you guys how to decarboxylate cannabis using the magical d card box so if you need to know how to decarboxylate cannabis click up here and i'll show you how in today's video we are going to actually use that decarboxylated cannabis to make canna butter and i'm going to be using the magical butter 2.0 this video is sponsored by magical thank you so much magicalbutter for sponsoring this video and you guys can use code buds and beards to save 20 off at magicalbutter.com now 10 20 so it's a pretty big savings use the code check out magical butter i love this thing you guys know that i use it every single time that i make edibles it makes everything just so much easier making peanut butter is super easy and simple with this it's pretty much automated you throw in the ingredients it's like a crock pot you set it forget it come back to it and you've got peanut butter so i'm gonna show you guys the new magical butter machine along with some accessories that they sent over today they sent over their new butter trays as well as some lecithin it's an emulsifier that just helps all of the ingredients combined together mixed together well so that you don't end up with a can of butter that has like it can get separated it can just get messy lecithin just makes it mix together well and make a nice solid uniform stick of candy butter anyways let's get into the magical butter 2.0 so this is what the packaging looked like i complimented the packaging last time because i really liked how it did not look weedy this looks even less weedy something about like it not having anything green on it just makes it look even cleaner i absolutely love the new logo i just think this looks so much sharper it's the exact same box though the packaging is like literally same dimensions and the product is exactly the same too like the magical butter machine this one is not revamped like it doesn't have any new features it doesn't do anything different than the old one this is literally just an updated refreshed version with newer graphics just a little bit cleaner looking magical butter machine and i think this one has the magical butter logo like engraved on the magical butter which i just thought looked a little bit sharper anyways let's open this up once you open up the box you'll see the magical butter sitting inside there along with some accessories this is the new magical butter machine as you guys can see it has the new logo on it and the blue buttons the old one used to have let me see here the old one just has the old logo on it and the buttons were white but like literally exactly the same exactly the same looking machine just a little bit cleaner looking on top a little bit more updated and i was right if you guys can see right there there's the magical butter logo engraved on the front of it you also get a power cable for your magical butter machine along with a heat resistant silicone magical glove this is used for straining your can of butter it comes with an owner's manual along with a owner's cookbook as well which is really nice it just has a couple of recipes that you can use in your magical butter machine hot dogs is this magical hot dogs no it's magical ketchup oh i want to make magical ketchup like there's so many different things in here that'll give you guys some ideas on how to use your magic butter machine because like i'm kind of boring i kind of stick to like the same few recipes you guys know i love desserts i need to get into making more savory dishes i did make soup one time that was really good but like it's nice to have this little booklet to go with it just to keep you inspired you know and the last thing in the box is a strainer so that you can strain the cannabis from your butter leaving just your magical butter let's get into making some magical butter all right you guys let's plug in the new magical butter machine and it will be telling you that it is on and red lights will flash on the top of the magical butter machine all right let's get into using some butter today i'm gonna be infusing this two and a half ounces of shake with four cups of unsalted butter magical butter's website says to infuse peanut butter that you can do it at 160 degrees at for two hours i'm gonna do mine for 160 degrees for eight hours i've never infused for eight hours before i think the max i've done is four maybe i have done an eight hour one before i might even run it twice at eight hours just because i'm genuinely curious if i infuse it for longer will it be even more infused i've heard that the longer you let your peanut butter go for the better so we're going to try it out today we're going to do this for at least eight hours and i might run it for 16. i'll update you guys and let you guys know anyways in order to make magical butter all you have to do is take the lid off of your magical butter machine this will make up to five cups of can of butter at a time so we have four cups this should be perfect i already have it softened go ahead and put your softened butter into your magical butter machine now we're going to add the two and a half ounces of shake that we've already decarboxylated there's still a lot of teeth in here i'm actually going to grab a brush and brush this into the magical butter machine as well just to ensure that we get all of this goodness into the butter now that we got most of the keith out the last thing that we're going to add to this peanut butter is the sunflower lecithin that magical butter scent over i'm going to add one tablespoon of this for every cup of butter that we're making since we did four cups of butter we'll add four tablespoons of lecithin to this now we have to do is replace the lid and set it now that the lid is on all we're gonna do is hit 160 degrees and we're gonna do eight hours you can do two hours but i'm doing eight and it will light up and start running i thought i would answer some frequently asked questions about the magical butter machine number one i get asked a lot does it smell while you're infusing and i'll say pretty much no like unless you're sitting right up over and you're like you may be able to smell a little bit of a faint smell but honestly it does not smell much at all particularly compared to creating it on the stove top like this really you really have to be right up on it to really get a good whiff the only time when you really do get a big smell when you're making anything with the magic butter machine is when you open up the unit after it's been infusing it will smell up a room when you're pouring that can of butter into a mold but actually while you're infusing it really does cut the smell down a lot another question i get asked about the magic butter machine is how loud is it honestly it sounds like a blender going off about every five to seven minutes it's not super duper loud um i will say that you're probably not going to want to just sit in the room while it's going on it does make enough noise to where it is kind of like disturbing that particular room's noise but honestly i'll just make peanut butter in here i'll shut my door or even leave the door open and you really can't hear it throughout the house it's not that loud of a noise so it doesn't have too much noise it just sounds a bit like a blender going off about every like five to seven minutes in a room next time that it actually cycles and goes off i'll make sure to include a little bit of noise so that you guys can hear it and the last thing i think i get asked about is how do i clean it and does it hold up yes the magical butter machine or at least my magical butter machine has held up i've had mine for over a year now and i use mine a lot like every single time i make edibles i use it and i make edibles probably once every two months so probably six times a year i'm making edibles so i do pull this out quite often and it has held up very well i don't notice any difference between its functioning now than when i first got it and how do i keep it clean i had a drop of dish soap to the match blender machine along with water i fill it to the fill line on the magical butter machine and then i hit the clean button and then it'll just kind of like car wash clean the match clutter machine you will still have to wipe it down and um particularly in certain spots i noticed that it doesn't get it like 100 clean but it does get it pretty clean and that's a pretty easy way to clean your mashed water machine just a little soap and water make sure you don't put the top part of it in the dishwasher or the bottom part of it in the dishwasher to be 100 honest because do keep in mind that this is an electronic device it does plug into the wall it does use electricity so through submerging this in water is not going to be its best friend but all you're going to have to do is really clean out the interior the outside doesn't really get that dirty it does attract fingerprints but you can wipe that down with just some water it's a fairly easy device to keep clean i think that's all of the frequently asked questions that i have about this i'm gonna let this infuse and i'll be back in eight hours or so and we'll be pouring this into the butter molds and see how our peanut butter turns out [Music] all right you guys it's about 16 hours later literally i had this going for eight hours and then by the time it actually was done it was so late that i was like i don't feel like filming an update right now and so i just went ahead and pressed another eight hours on it and went to bed and then i woke up this morning and probably put it on another four hours i think so it's been probably about 20 hours in here so let's open it up and strain it out and then put it in the butter molds and then we'll put it in the refrigerator to solidify normally that takes about an hour and we should have can of butter one thing i will say i noticed between this one and the old one is the old one had rainbow lights on it and this one only has white lights on it i wish it still had the rainbow the white kind of looks cleaner it makes it look like less i don't know kitty but that's what it looks like in there i just splattered a little bit on my desk no it looks so dark wow let's strain this a few times to get all of the sediment out of it and impurities and then we'll put it into the new molds [Music] do [Music] this honestly looks like baby it does not look good at all i mean it never does it doesn't look good until it gets in the refrigerator and solidifies before then it just looks like now we put on our magical glove and we will strain it out [Music] i'm actually gonna stop trying to squeeze this bag every time i squeeze it i keep like spilling some out and i'm afraid i'm gonna end up like getting it inside of my peanut butter which is the last thing i want um so i'm just gonna like set this up on something so that it will strain out slowly it's gonna take some time for this to strain out um i think it's because i use shape like [Music] there was just so many little particles in there so it's just gonna take a long time for this to strain out [Music] okay that's gonna take a while so we're gonna go ahead and just pour what we already strained out into these new moments plus i don't want this to solidify in here because it will solidify it is better after all [Applause] oh my gosh i hit my desk and the rupaul shade button went off that's underneath all right that already made two sticks of butter we're gonna go ahead and close the butter mold and then i'm going to go place this in the fridge i love this new butter mold the fact that like it has a lid where it keeps it secured you can actually move this around that's amazing so i ended up leaving the filter in a picture and leaving that on the warming center of my oven just to ensure that it stays warm and it stripped out quite a bit more peanut butter i've already made four sticks from what i've gotten out so far let's pour this a little bit see how many sticks it makes we'll freeze it and then i guess i'll end out this video [Music] looks like we got another one and maybe a quarter sticks of can of butter and here are our five sticks of peanut butter we actually got all the butter out that we put in so that's really good um i thought that by straining it that way i wasn't sure if i would actually get it all out but i think we got a really good yield from this i mean what else can i ask for i put five six in and i have five sticks out thank you guys so much for watching if you like this video give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below let me know what you think i should make with my can of butter i honestly haven't decided yet i haven't picked out a recipe yet whatever the best comment is i'll probably just pick that and make a video out of it so leave some creative comments down in the um comment section on what you want me to do with this can of butter and thank you guys so much for watching i'll see you guys around for whatever sony activity or video i come up with for next time and don't forget you can use cup buds and beards to save 20 off of anything at magicalbutter.com and thank you magical for sponsoring this video bye guys", "eSw1S_tEOLo": "what's up YouTube it's a boy stuff we preview Channel Denver coming back at you with another weed review we review number 10 today I'm doing something a little bit different we're going to do an edible review it is Incredibles indica Fruit Chews it's a hundred milligrams each one of these is ten milligrams and there's ten of them in there so each one of these right here is ten milligrams so I'm gonna go ahead and give those a try I'm gonna pause the video wait till I start feeling the effects and then I'll start the video back up again and we'll see where we go from there are these it's been about 20 minutes and yeah they're pretty effective you can feel it right off the bat I'm sure as time goes on as time progresses they get stronger and stronger but about 20-25 minutes in boom you can definitely feel that they're definitely there it's you know I mean it's definitely very very very effective no indica I don't know how you're going to feel the difference between indica and sativa when you're eating when you're eating edibles I don't know because it affects your body so much I don't know how you would be able to feel the difference between an indica and a sativa but these are in different shoes so yeah I don't know you know I'll be able to tell but um yeah these are pretty effective the price point for these ten of these gummies which equals a little over a hundred milligrams cost $17 they were on special for $17 I think they were normally like $19 or $18 so they weren't special for $70 I think it's well worth it for seventeen dollars you get blasted out in your brain basically 100 milligrams is pretty good thousand milligrams is insane so yeah we just keep trucking with that once again it's your boy Seth we would do Channel Denver coming to you with another weed review and a mouthpiece you", "gyRC7ek0Dlw": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheat sweets on vacation this is a wheats mini-review and we are coming to you from Denver Colorado today our first trip out of Southern California and we are gonna look at some of the edibles here available in Colorado but first a mini rant Colorado I'm afraid in comparison to Southern California you do not hold a candle when it comes to edibles so for example I've got the Dutch girl caramel waffles I believe those are a stroopwafel this is a hundred milligrams of THC and it cost me $23 so roughly if you go milligram two dollar ratio about 300-400 percent more expensive than what you get in Southern California but I don't want to judge too harshly this also is Dutch girl stroopwafels promises to have feel it faster with n.ex.t technology whatever the hell that means they say nano extraction technology and that you fill these edibles faster than traditional edibles now if you guys have seen weeks before you know we traditionally do 30 60 120 pip updates not gonna be the case on these sweets vacation review I'm just gonna eat these bad boys come back to you guys in about two hours and let you know if we're feeling anything at all so here we go without further ado here is the product open up here and it's a little waffle cookie a little stroopwafel if you ever seen these German type cookies this is what they look like mmm smells delicious smells like a caramelized little Stroup cookie stroopwafel cookie but let's give it a taste no problems on the taste phone I apologize in that regard Colorado but for $23 is this gonna get me [ __ ] up I'll let you know guys in two hours thanks so much for watching we'll catch you back on weeds welcome back to wheats wheats on vacation here I'm back talking about the Dutch girl caramel waffles the stroopwafel it's been just a little bit over two hours and I just wanted to come back and tell you guys how we're feeling so for one hundred milligram edible I'm feeling a little high not especially high but for for something it's 100 milligrams probably right about on target but for the price I am not familiar with the Colorado market as well as I am the California market but I'm gonna guess that's probably right in the wheelhouse of an average price but these things are delicious so wheats on vacation if you find yourself in Colorado looking for an edible and you've got some money to spend and you like the way things taste you like your caramel waffles don't be afraid to pick up the Dutch girl it's good it's just not gonna put you in the hospital which is also good because you don't want to be in the hospital either but it's also not gonna put you in your bed so with that being said thank you so much for watching wheats guys and we'll check you guys on the next review hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "h-6YwrWLcZc": "[Music] hi friends welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review I'm gonna be a basic [ __ ] in two different ways I'm gonna be your basic [ __ ] because I'm reviewing your most basic of edibles your Chiba choose that's right your Chiba choose I believe this is their deco dose 100 milligram edible and it's America's favorite edible according to High Times on the back is certainly not my favorite edible this is the second time I reviewed a Chiba Choo I found them to be too expensive for what you get the first time I reviewed them I didn't find to be terrible I found it to be good tasting and it got me a little high but overpriced and I assume this is also going to be overpriced for a hundred milligram edible I do like seeing on the back the lab results and I do like seeing the nutrition information the ingredients you can see all that on the back there which is really nice and in the second way that this makes me a basic [ __ ] in addition to getting the most basic edibles is its PSL flavor that's right guys this is the pumpkin spice latte hybrid hundred milligram at th C Chiba two so when you compare this with your favorite Starbucks latte or take it on its own which is what we're gonna do I've never actually had a pumpkin spice latte I'm not sure I actually like pumpkin spice anything but you know we'll give it a go I assume Chiba choose are gonna be one of the casualties in the New Age of edibles that are coming out soon because they're not dosed in the 10 milligram variety so there it is that's all you get for your money in this little tiny rectangle right here this pathetic little rectangle is your full of your monies every cent of it goes in there and let's see if we can actually get this caramel out out losing any of it there it goes there it goes so here is our dose PSL flavored pumpkin spice latte Chiba choo we'll pop it the whole thing in hmmm very basic no it's good it does have a slight weed taste to it um but the sort of cinnamony taste of the pumpkin spice helps mask it but there is a weed taste to it it's not overwhelming but there it is there just to let you guys know but overall it's my kind of edible small discreet I think it weighs 0.3 four ounces and it only has 44 calories in total so kind of like that that's great small and discreet but guys the most important part of the edible review it's not about how it tastes it's not about what kind of packaging it's in it's not about any of that kind of stuff it's all about how it makes you feel and for that guys you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer for me I'm gonna come back to you after I see the death of Stalin so I'll be back to you guys in about two two-and-a-half hours to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching wheats it I'll see you guys soon peace guys [Music] it has been well more than two hours since I last checked in with you talking Chiba choose here and I gotta say I enjoyed the movie way more than I enjoyed the Chiba choo not that I didn't that I find some value in this pumpkin spiced caramel hundred milligram from Chiba choo it's just I didn't find as much value as I do from a Kanaka or akarova or any number of other edibles out there it's I'd say it was 100 milligrams yeah I felt like it didn't feel that strong I say again to beat a dead horse here as a can of Quahog milligram err but it felt pretty strong it's just for that price I could have gotten to Kanaka cookies easily for the same price as this and while this is nice and discreet I really like the fact that I don't have to eat as much that I do getting to you know or I can't go cookie it didn't taste incredible there was a cannabis taste to it still so it wasn't like it had this amazing flavor either for me this is going to probably be a pass going forward with Chiba choose this is our second hundred milligram of that we've reviewed from them and the second time I found them to be okay at best so I think I'm gonna tell you to skip the Chiba choose going forward unless you really really really want something small and discreet and even then there are other options out there like punch bar that are gonna get the job done but one thing that I am going to recommend and I'm gonna use it as our cherry on top for this review here is the movie I just got out of and that is the death of Stalin by [ __ ] Armando Iannucci anoche something the guy who created veep is what you need to know his brand new movie starring sexual creep Jeffrey Tambor looks like a sexual creep Steve Buscemi and just about creepy people so go check it out it's hysterical and also very very disturbing that is the death of Stalin playing in some theaters near you I hope go see it I laugh my ass off and I was also very very disturbed which is my favorite experience in a movie theater thank you so much for watching guys and thanks for sticking around the end of this cherry on top and we will see you on the next review peace", "Qqm0eS5nKmw": "okay so in my current attempt to worry less and experiment more I'm coming out of a sixteen and a half hour fast into this is a candy bar with a hundred milligrams of THC see how it is okay so when you finally wrestle with the childproof packaging which is also micro proof you get this it's a pretty little gold bar it's pretty being that this is the first carbs I've had in a few days it's actually really good you actually don't get a hint about cannabis flavor and who raped you oh no how far hundred milligrams are gonna take me cuz I believe I have a pretty high dollar okay so it has been one hour since I had my candy bar and while I wouldn't say that I feel high I I feel good there's definitely an edge gone a little bit of a body low I'm very uh positive okay now it has been to two hours since I ate my candy bar and now yeah I'm high I'm very tingly and they calm my body weighs a lot it turns out that 100 milligrams just write him out for me okay it has now been three hours since I ate my candy bar now I'm feeling just absolutely fantastic you'll notice the we're on the road because we've had to go buy 20 cheeseburgers I love you okay so 100 milligram bar we're probably five six hours now when I lost count awesome I really think I could even help my dosage coolest thing about all this is just the availability of something like this it was $25 at the dispensary the fact that something like that exists at the dispensary that you can go to the store and buy weed is just a mind-boggling world I'm glad we live in it until next time", "zFO27gijkMk": "hello good morning to everybody i just got done eating breakfast um [ __ ] spicy sausage breakfast burrito they do [ __ ] burritos down here in colorado better than anywhere else man [ __ ] breakfast burrito has replaced the bacon egg and cheese biscuit for me because i'm from the south that's all we have bacon egg and cheese bacon egg and cheese your sausage gravy biscuits which is good i miss them actually i miss the biscuits but um i love the burritos here man they're good they put a little bit of a south of the border touch on them some uh green chilies in there it's [ __ ] wonderful but uh anyway today we're gonna be reviewing peanut butter and jelly cup another sweet grass product um i'm not gonna eat this whole thing in front of you or anything because i've already eaten many of these and they uh are very they're very tasty um i can tell you a little bit about them um they use strawberry jam in these and not like grape jelly as it kind of implies here yeah strawberry jam um i'm a big fan of grape jelly i don't really like i like uh how the the consistency of the jam better and i'm just kind of [ __ ] rambling on here about nothing but i do i it makes a big difference to me they put strawberry jam in this it's [ __ ] wonderful so let's open it up also another thing about this is they only use can of butter can of butter is better as they say and um i think peanut butter is better than distillate um seems like all the edibles that are coming out now are distilled distilled distillates and everything because people don't want to taste the [ __ ] weed and me i like a hashy taste to my edibles i want to know i'm eating wheat man if i wanted to eat a [ __ ] gummy bear that tastes like a gummy bear i'd go and buy some of those hair bows or whatever the [ __ ] they're called uh you know i'm talking about the little the big gummy bear company so anyway let's crack this thing open and take a look this is just a little [ __ ] this is just me setting my phone up on a water bottle and making videos because i want to get a following well all right now now again you come to colorado and you don't have a medical license you're not going to be able to buy this exact um cup i believe they make 10 milligram cups uh for the wreck users they come in a little 30 milligram package but once you get your med card you can just bypass all of that [ __ ] and buy one big cake that's either gonna have 75 or 100 milligrams or we're going to do a video shooting on the decado shivachu that's 175 milligrams in a little tootsie roll so that's the strongest edible i've seen around here as as it goes with size and whatnot um so check this out it's pretty awesome right you know i see something cool boom thc edible thc sticker on the back and it's got two little holes filled with the strawberry jam it's actually pretty good stuff", "G70-Bp6kHGU": "is it just pure pain now that's what you hate to hear goodness gravy I've got a story for you guys today listen in the pursuit of life sometimes we run into bumps along the road the bumps vary in size and severity sometimes it's a little tiny pebble in the road and sometimes it's a giant [ __ ] boulder like for instance if you were hiking and you got hit by a giant [ __ ] boulder we're doing our best alright and sometimes things don't work out the way we would we would prefer today is one of those little interesting conundrums that we run into every now and then in our lives and it happened to me I ran into a bit of an issue so sit back relax and let's talk about how I once accidentally drugged myself with the largest edible I've ever eaten last February for all the coronavirus garbage happened I traveled to Los Angeles for spring break and one of the things that I had to do was I had to sign a [ __ ] ton of posters for u2's there was probably more than three thousand posters that I had to sign and the posters were being kept at the house at The Misfits YouTube group were staying at in LA Carson was there Schlacht was there Cooper's there we were all just trying to like sign all of these posters as fast as we could because there's so many of them and it was take us it was taking us literally hours to do at this point there was maybe about five or six people in the house at this time and that's because at that point the whole main misfits crew had gone out to dinner somewhere I don't know if you know this about the misfits in general but they smoked a lot of weed every trip they do they probably spent a couple thousand dollars on weed okay they smoked the mary-jane they do the weed in order to make the process of signing these posters go a little bit smoother I had smoked like half a joint of weed so I was already decently high because I hadn't smoked in a while either sign in a way crossing my eyes Dodd might ease however my personal reaction to weed is that I get the munchies I get the munchies pretty hard I smoked a little bit of the mare Lona and then I say oh I'm gonna eat an entire sleeve of club crackers with no cheese because gluttony I originally planned to go to dinner with my girlfriend and her father so I was trying to wean off of the hi and just kind of sign the posters and wait until it kind of wore off and then I would go and do that one of the things that they had at this house was they had a giant counter in which a bunch of snacks were all laid out there was chips there was more chips there was I think pizza I don't [ __ ] remember as I look across this horizon of bountiful snacks I see a nerds rope and my monkey brain is like oh and I'm thinking to myself man I remember nerds rope I haven't had nerds rope and [ __ ] forever dude I'm thinking back to my childhood where we would go to a campground in Maine and I would wattle on down to the snack shack and grab myself a nerds rub and before eating it considering its potential applications as nunchucks or trying to tie a knot with it but then realizing I'm a kid I don't know how to tie knots and my prefrontal lobe won't even be done cooking for another 20 years so what's even the point give me a slush puppy give me a Game Boy SP let's [ __ ] it up but lord have mercy did I learn in this moment I no longer was a child but a man a man who experiences consequence in the worst way possible so I'm signing more posters you know I'm cruisin I'm having a great time all right nerds rope tastes a bit strange but that could also be my perception that I have of being already high and it's kind of you've ever been high before it kind of messes with your perception of taste a little bit it was like drinking a diet coke versus a normal coke where there's like you know there's something there there's something there but I don't fully process why it tastes different so I finished the Nerds rope and then I go to have another nerds rope because I'm high and have the munchies as I'm biting into the next nerds rope one of the misfits guys says Ted don't eat those those are edibles hmm sorry I said I'm back I must uh I must have heard you wrong um scusi yeah Ted that's inedible so I say no [ __ ] way how much was it he says I think I think it might be like 60 milligrams what 60 milligrams to give you context the largest edible I'd had up until this point in my life was 20 milligrams so of course I asked are you sure one of the guys walks over to the counter and picks up the package of the Nerds rope and with the most you are [ __ ] face I've ever seen in a person he says it's actually 400 milligrams now remember I've already freaked out when I heard that it was a 50 milligram edible and I've just been told that it is actually eight times that amount so you may be asking yourself Ted how the [ __ ] did you not know that that was inedible and that's a good question let's start with the packaging that's the packaging it uses the same packaging as the actual branded Nerds rope it's got a thing that says Terran share as if it's just a normal candy in hindsight that's very much so implying for a good reason that you really should be sharing it and not eating it entirely on your own if you're not really paying attention and it's been like eight years since you had a nerds rope this is pretty easy to mistake for a nerds rope in addition to that there was a very specific and deceptive way that everything was laid out as snacks in the misfits house and I'll just let swagger CIL's explain that for me there was a very reasonable way like we set it up because the Nerds rope was inedible it's a 400 milligram edible and he didn't read the packaging but we have on that bench it's a big-ass bench it's snacks and food chips Pringles gummy bears all that [ __ ] munchies and then there's weed food which is edibles in between that and the weed which makes sense like a spectrum dangerous that's the thing is that it would make more sense to kind of put the weed food away so that you don't confuse confuse you've ever been in a car crash even if it's not your fault there's a certain feeling after it immediately happens it's this mind racing feeling when you have absolutely no idea what to do but you also know that something has to be done or you're [ __ ] aka panic so at this point I begin to freak for three reasons first of all I didn't know if I was personally prepared mentally to get as high as I was about to get second of all I had made plans for dinner with my girlfriend and her father that night and I definitely won't be making it and I'm pretty sure she's gonna be a little bit pissed and the third reason I hadn't smoked weed in two months which meant that my tolerance was rock-bottom I like to explain this with what I like to call the skyscraper analogy right here we have the tolerant skyscraper which represents my tolerance to marijuana let's just say that whenever I smoke weed I started the ground floor in the lobby if my taunts were higher then maybe I'd go a couple stories up to the mid-level apartments that's where all the stoner kids from high school hang out and they're all pretty high up there but it's nothing really to be worried about you're probably couch locked but you'll be fine with my tolerance at zero though I knew in my heart and my soul that I was going all the way up to cheech and Chong's [ __ ] penthouse as an unwilling and unexpected guest for an undetermined amount of time as things stand right now I don't even live in the building I'm from out of town and I sometimes commute into the city oh it's a Friday night oh we should go we should go get drinks in the city that's the that's what I'm operating on I know that I'm on a timer most edibles take about 45 minutes to an hour before they kick in but I know that I've taken this edible about 10 to 15 minutes prior which means math I've got about 45 minutes before this edible hits me and I died although other things can affect this such as being on an empty stomach which I was my first thought was that I need to make myself throw up because if I can get rid of as much of this edible as possible I could potentially mitigate the level of inebriation that I was about to experience so I stumble over to the bathroom and I start to gag and I'm trying to make myself throw up but I've never made myself throw up before I don't know how to do it so the next step is that I got Carson on his phone looking up how to's on wikiHow on how to make myself throw up and then Cooper's in the kitchen and he's making cups of saltwater for me to chug because apparently if you chug saltwater it helps with the throwing up process I'm not sure how true that was it just ended up with me just throwing up a bunch of pinkish salt water so I can't speak for its effectiveness but there you go and I'm pretty sure since the Nerds rope was sort of a candy sugar based food it was really easy for my stomach to digest it really fast so I'm pretty sure if I hadn't thrown it up within maybe five minutes there really wasn't that much that I could do from there so by the time I was done throwing up some food that we had ordered earlier arrived and Cooper basically advised me that the best thing that I could really do for myself would be to just fill my now completely empty stomach from this point on all I could really do was buckle up strap in and get ready for the [ __ ] high of a lifetime god bless my soul [Music] so I'm gonna give you guys a walkthrough of what this high was like it wasn't fun I also have some video footage that Cooper took so link to his channel in the in the description once I kind of came to terms with the fact that I was gonna have to ride out this high no matter what I decided to give myself a home base just somewhere where I could ground myself and not really need to worry about moving around or anything I found myself a nice armchair and I sat myself down there and prepared for the ride of a lifetime the first thing that happening was a classic weed symptom which is cottonmouth which is when your mouth gets really really dry so I was pretty much just constantly drinking water I remember starting to get colder and The Misfits they had a room where they just had a bunch of extra merch laid out where they could just give that to friends and stuff while they were in LA and I kind of just walked in there and just threw on one of the sweatshirts and then just went back to my home base and sat down and I was wondering for myself if that cold symptom that I was experiencing was real I did research on the symptoms that I was experiencing and this was something that actually happens informally it's referred to as weed chills the THC literally lowered my internal body temperature so I actually was getting cold another thing that happened and I think this also might have been a symptom of being cold but I started getting shaky and it's really funny the way that I described that when I was high and I actually have video footage of that right here welcome back it's gotten worse friends we are it's been about 45 minutes since last and bad okay I think you need another stick of butter I feel like my entire body feels like rubber bands pretty much after that point was when things started to get um they started to get bad the shaking was also the reason why in the video you can see me clasping my hands together because I was literally like shaking so much that I had to hold my hands together really tightly and keep my body really tight and close so I could be in like a comfortable state and then I get into what is called the painful zone or the first level of weed hell pretty much any position that I was sitting in felt painful don't do too much weed I was in the pain hotel and I was its only guest any surface that I touched whether it be the arms of my chair putting my hands on my knees anything like that just felt bad and what I think I would attribute that to is just being so high my sense of touch was just so elevated that my brain was just overloaded or something most of the time I was just trying to like breathe deeply and kind of maintain my composure but whenever Cooper would turn the camera on me and he would start recording I would sort of like try to elevate my attitude and try to seem as cheery as possible because I didn't really want to seem like an idiot hi stoner on camera you know at a certain point I had to move my home base because it was too disorienting to be sitting straight up I had to go and get [ __ ] horizontal baby I pretty much had to make a mental agreement with myself just to survive is it just pure pain now that's what you hate to hear it was during this time of unbearable dizziness that my good friend Schleck decided to use a [ __ ] handheld massager on me I'm just getting the lactic acid fun I just want to get the juices I just want to get the juices flowing if you please organism do you see my attitude there I wonder why I wouldn't like that a rapidly moving massager if you want a lesson on what not to do to someone when they're high that really takes the cake eventually the fateful moment happens I had a weed barf I honestly think it was really just because of how dizzy I was getting from being high and luckily for me I had a whole sandwich about an hour ago I literally had to run across the entire room and just run into the bathroom and throw up after I threw up though that's pretty much where the high took the downturn now it was cleansing I had it was a cleansing barf yeah it was uh it was detoxifying I went to go eat some skittles but without even knowing I was on camera I went around to people and not trusting my own ability to determine this I asked them if the skittles were edibles or not I ate the Edible at about 6:30 p.m. that day and I stayed awake all the way until about 4:00 a.m. that night I woke up at about 9:00 a.m. and I was still very high but I was definitely a manageable amount of hi what struck me though was I was high for the entire next day I went to bed that night hi so in total after eating a 400 milligram edible I was high for about you know 26 hours if there's one thing you guys shouldn't take away from this is like any anti weed sentiment from this video I think weed is a perfectly healthy drug to use recreationally but we'd like everything else follows the rule that too much of anything is definitely a bad thing obviously only consume weed in a state in which it's legal and if you're of age I hope you guys enjoyed this video let me know if you want more stories from my life I don't really know how many stories I have to tell this is like the second one I've ever told on this channel but I hope you learned a thing or two and if there's one thing you should take away from this it's this weed is for sinners and I'm going to help [Music] ped accidentally took 400 milligrams of edible", "BOOLG1NPYiU": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and today we are looking at a product that we have kind of sort of looked at before but in a smaller form factor we are taking a look at another product from canna Co their PB&J blondie again but this time instead of the 250 milligram we're gonna take a look at the 100 milligram to see how that hits to see if it hits relatively as strongly as the 250 s and 500 s that we've looked at before I thought it was probably good to make sure that we've got the entire gamut of Kanako's products covered so I went ahead and picked up a hundred milligram err as well now I already know how this bad boys gonna taste I'm pretty sure I know how it's gonna taste it's gonna taste excellent and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get pretty high still even though it's only 100 milligrams that's just sort of the magic of a can of coke so here we go oh you can see the hundred milligrams come in this sort of baby blueish color they all have a different color corresponding to their potency we hunt 100 milligram is this nice blue here alright well I'm gonna go and open it up eat her up and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the way our reviews work and that is also the most important part of the review process so here we go it's a handsome product there that peanut butter swirl on top the jelly oh my god the blondie let's give a bite as advertised that really is blondie batter swirl with peanut butter chips and raspberry jam topped with peanut butter frosting and peanut butter chips all those things are true taste very good but guys how is this bad boy can make me feel for that I'm gonna have to wait two hours and you're gonna have to wait a couple of seconds and I will see you on the other side of this break to let you know how we're feeling thank you so much for watching wheats guys and I will see you soon peace okay guys I am back it has been two hours since I had the Kanak OPB NJ blondie and I am extremely happy to confirm it is as potent as I was hoping it was gonna be this is the most hundred potent hundred milligram edible I've ever had for sure in terms of just 100 milligram edible this thing hits like a hammer tastes great man I know I've already had the 250 milligram variety but even the 100 milligrams variety here is is almost does the trick for me I'd be a tough to decide between which to pick for me but it's great if you see this at your dispensary near you grab one you'll be happy you did you'll be you'll be quite high for quite some time and you'll enjoy the taste as well well guys that's gonna do it for this review here on week's happy to have another homerun here from Kanak oh and we will see you on a future review that will hope is just as

"8BgZz-nALEo": "what's up guys Wiki back here again I have a review today for you guys we have peanut butter caramel x' baked with love by hashtag so these are coming out of Northern California humble area and distributed out of Sacramento those of you in the Sacramento area in northern Cali area can obviously get all of them and if not you can get ahold of me and I could point you in the right direction so these are the peanut butter caramels and I spoke with the Baker which goes by Maria Jane Maria Jane and they're made with peanut oil so the peanut butter cookies are made with peanut oil oh [ __ ] I don't think I'm supposed to tell everybody that it's out its out the bag now so first taste and by the way they're 60 milligram dosage and they're made from extract and not a can of butter not from plant material that's right hmm that's good you can still clearly chase the countess mm-hmm but the peanut butter and the caramel ran Jane said that she makes the caramel in-house she makes it herself so I honestly think that's the best part of the cookie that's for you oh it's very different it doesn't have that salt very clear that she's using she's not using butter she's in the peanut oil if she said so it gives it this I don't want to say nutty because it's it's peanut right but it's giving it yeah like an almond but I go just an off note apart from the peanut butter cookie taste it's it's enjoyable I like it what it's a touch dry touch scribe but you're not drive to where it's a hard cookie or a cracker consistency it's not like that it's still soft it's still moist I like it so 60 mill around 60 she told me the only one but I want to get three and by the way the name is so cool I gave her props like genius name for your edible company hashtag ah cuz she makes it all with pho anyway let's make another one because I'm gonna G and I can do that ooh definitely gonna drink hold still I'll be right back beverage I got coffee but what are you gonna do tomorrow what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put another review up this is just a flavor review any cuz this is your review tomorrow I'm going to we'll see how I do tonight probably gonna stream later on twitch play some games or whatever but uh we're sure tomorrow Manny 4:00 in the morning and uh make a video at the one hour mark maybe the one and a half hour mark see how I see where I'm at and you know I'll either have a grin from ear to ear or I won't but I have a feeling I will", "lFM3c7sMmDY": "welcome to 5-minute school in today's video we're going to be talking about vitamin b6 now when we're referring to vitamin b6 we're actually talking about these three compounds here which are basically precursors of the active form of vitamin b6 so these three compounds are paradox in pyridoxal and pyridoxamine and the main difference between these three compounds is the functional group which is attached onto this aromatic ring which you can see here so the functional groups attached are going to be slightly different and these three compounds here are precursors of something which is known as pyridoxal phosphate the pyridoxal phosphate is the active form of vitamin b6 and this act as a coenzyme or a cofactor for many enzymes in the human body so without this pyridoxal phosphate these enzymes which catalyze certain reactions they wouldn't be able to function so it's especially common in reactions involving amino acids and I've made a note here that paradox seen and paradox so you'll find them in animal products and pyridoxamine you'll find from plant products so let's talk about the functions of this pyridoxal phosphate so a variety of enzymes known as transaminases they require PRP to transfer amine groups between amino acids so without this you wouldn't be able to convert certain amino acids into different amino acids pyridoxal phosphate is involved in the biosynthesis of five neurotransmitters and those are serotonin dopamine epinephrine norepinephrine and gaba PRP is also involved in the synthesis of histamine and the enzyme which breaks down glycogen which is known as glycogen phosphorylase that requires pyridoxal phosphate to function pyridoxal phosphate is also required for the enzymes which synthesize and break down sphingolipids which is a type of lipid or fat and the pyridoxal phosphate binds on - - sites on hemoglobin to enhance the oxygen binding of hemoglobin now these are just a few of the functions there are a lot more but I've just focused on these six ones here so let's talk about these sources of vitamin b6 it's a high amounts in beef pork turkey bananas potatoes and chickpeas and the recommended daily amount for vitamin b6 is 1.3 milligrams per day and that's for adults between 19 to 50 years old so some symptoms of the deficiency of vitamin b6 it's a seborrhoeic dermatitis which is this diagram here you can see these rashes on the skin it also can contribute to angular colitis which is you can see on the corner of the of the mouth there's some inflammation here this image is actually a very mild case of angular colitis but it is a contributing factor to this inflammatory disease here it also contributes to chronic conjunctivitis which you can see from this diagram here and it also is involved in a trophic glossitis with ulceration so that's inflammation of the tongue another symptom of the deficiency of vitamin b6 rushes on the skin and some neurological symptoms you can find from a deficiency of vitamin b6 are symptoms such as drowsiness confusion and nerve damage", "kjWKarTcMuk": "[Music] well hello friends welcome to weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we are YouTube's preeminent marijuana edible review ship again only because we are the only edible review show on YouTube so today we are taking a look at another product from TKO edibles we are taking a look at their s'mores krispies I've been reviewing a lot of krispies recently this one looks pretty good from the outside a lot of marshmallow a lot of chocolate a lot of crispy a lot of um so um this is I think the fourth or fifth thing we've reviewed from TK edibles this is my first hundred milligram er I've never quite liked the taste from any of them but I've always found them to be rather potent so I am hoping that this one tastes better it looks better than any of the others but we shall find out good and open her up and give it a taste here that is better tasting than any of the other TKO animals it's not great incredibly thick incredibly chewy well Arviat room it's not bad I actually kind of liked the taste of it very little we taste whatsoever I'm not bad at all thick and chewy if you can imagine it's like almost like graham cracker in there which I guess it makes sense for s'mores brownie or s'mores crispy and then the chocolate and marshmallow I like it quite a bit but guys as we always know it's known about how it tastes it's about how it makes you feel and for that I want to see you guys in two hours to let you know how this bad boys heading [Music] [Music] well guys it has been 2 hours welcome back two weeks has been two hours since I had the TK oh hundred milligram s'mores Krispy here and I got to say for a hundred milligram edible I feel pretty high I feel pretty pleased with it as in edible the best tasting TKO edible I've had so far and for 100 milligram ER as I said I am feeling rather high I mean not outrageously high by any stretch but higher than it was expecting - for a hundred milligram edible it doesn't feel that much different than their 160 milligrams to be honest so yeah I'm pretty positive on the s'mores crispy from TK oh maybe my new favorite product from their sin terms of taste and potency and they're pretty cheap - I think this cost me six bucks at my dispensary so this is a pretty worthwhile purchase I think so if you see the TKO s'mores crispy at a dispensary near you and you're looking for something that's not gonna get you send you to the moon something a little bit more low dose feel free to pick one up it's pretty good and with that guys I'm gonna sign off here thank you so much for watching this review here on wheats we will check you out on the next one peace pretty good hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "p6oKnG_sEwc": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you stopped by and for the rest of you guys welcome back thank you so much so somebody asked me a few weeks ago if I could do nerds ropes and to be perfectly honest had no idea what those work so I googled those little puppies and found out that they're a gummy candy covered in nerds who sew off my kitchen I went a little experimented little tickety-boo and look at what up I can make your it's ropes so I am going to bring this recipe to you so without any more in further babbling here let's jump right into those ingredients what we're going to need and then let's get these guys made alright so the ingredients that we're gonna need for our nerd candies so this recipe is basically my W candy recipe with the cooked syrup and the reason that we're using the Kochs syrup is is going to help with those candies to stick better than just using the gelatin one so with that set you're gonna need about three or four boxes of the large nerds or about seven or eight of those small ones that are the two flavored ones you're gonna want one to two boxes of cornstarch and don't worry you can reuse it we just sift it up and you can reuse it over and over and it doesn't go bad so not a problem plus it's not expensive you're going to want two boxes of the small gelatin the three amps or the 85 grams two of those want three tablespoons of unflavored gelatin or three or three packages of the Knox a quarter teaspoon of kaurav cannabutter and we're going to melt this 1/2 a cup of either kanna syrup corn syrup or you can use inverted syrup if you don't like invert sugar if you don't like corn syrup and we're going to split that quarter in our gelatin part quarter in our candy syrup we're going to need 1/2 a cup of we're going to need 1/2 a cup of liquid so I like to use the kool-aid jammers or the kool-aid waters ones because it gives it extra flavor than just using water and it's pretty much like using water so you don't have to worry about things going bad so these are great to use so I'm going to use use a half a cup of this to bloom our gelatin and a half a cup for our mixture then for additional flavoring I know I feel I know these could be a little bit difficult to get is I use two tablespoons of drink crystals so I get these at the bulk barn Jurek from spring onwards they have me during spring in the summer during the winter they don't carry them or other box stores the stores may carry them otherwise you can just use the Lorena's oils if you want to add some additional flavoring but it's not really required because of all the nerds on it so it's not that big of a deal and that's everything that we need for the gelatin part for our cooked syrup we need 1 K 1 cup of sugar and again if you've got candace sugar you can divide that up a quarter cup of can of sugar to three quarters of a cup of regular sugar as long as you equal one cup of sugar it doesn't matter a quarter cup of water and a quarter cup of our corn syrup and or kit canister that's it for our syrup oops sorry and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid goes into our cooked syrup as well then for the glue that they that they used to stick on top technically they're nerds the Nerds use confection confectioners glaze unfortunately being in Canada wasn't the easiest for me to get but an alternative for an edible glue and glaze is to use tylose tylose powder and water so I'm going to show you how to do that and this is what you're going to need to this stuff a day before but it's super easy it just happens that time to do whatever it needs to do but it works great if you can't get the confectioner's late and for and then to make our clear to make our edible glue we're also going to need one cup of water that is all the ingredients that we are going to need let's get into that equipment there so there's a little bit of equipment this time so let's get into that equipment and then let's get these made alright so the equipment that we're going to need is a double boiler if you don't have a quote double boiler you can always just use a metal bowl that will fit securely into the pot and has enough room on the bottom for water without touching you're gonna need another small or saucepan a small medium saucepan for our syrup point you need a candy thermometer digital or the one that you hang on doesn't matter a couple of spatulas gonna need you're gonna need a pastry brush and I'm gonna use a funnel for putting it into our molds you can get these candy funnels or if your pot has the little specks on it and that will work as well or you can always put it into a measuring cup or something with a spout anything to make it easier to pour cause we gotta pour into some skinny guys offset spatula is something to be able to smooth out our corn starch and you're going to want to get some dowels so I got these at the dollar store in the craft section they're 12-inch by just slightly under a half inch size dowel so you want about half inch sized dowel by about 12 inches as I said dollar store craft stores usually how these pre-cut like so otherwise you cannot just buy one of those read it on once and cut up your own so we need basically one if you can is many has many dowels as you want to make ropes now this recipe probably makes around 10 to 12 I'm only going to do part of that today and the rest of the stuff I'm just gonna make regular gummies and I'll explain why when we get to making them all so if you want a bunch of those dowels a cookie sheet or doing them on and you want to line it with parchment paper another pan that we can use to press down the cornstarch with or something flat that's that's kind of heavy a drying rack and then another pan or something that you can use and we're going to put Phillip put the skittles in to cover them up later on once we get the glue on them so it makes it easy if you've got some kind of pan like that so basically all our equipment you know me I always forget something but let's jump right in and let's get these made so if you go and I'm using the tylose powder as your glues your edible glue what you're going to want to do is to bring one cup of water to a boil once it's come to a boil turn the heat off and then we're going to add in three-quarters of a teaspoon into into our boil water you're gonna whisk that around and you're gonna see it's gonna lump up and it's not all gonna dissolve it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for it to fully dissolve all right so my water's come to a boil I'm going to turn off the heat gonna remove that oh remember that thing that I always tell you I forget yeah it was the whisk one whit so we're gonna add in three-quarters of a teaspoon these are quarter teaspoons you want to kind of story sprinkle it around like so and then you're gonna whisk it and it's gonna stay lumpy a little bluffing like that for a while and every couple every two three minutes you're gonna come back and whisk it around and you'll notice every time you come back more and more will be dissolved and as I said it takes about 15-20 minutes for it to fully dissolve once it has you're going to put it into the refrigerator sorry you're gonna let it cool first then put it into the refrigerator overnight and the next day you're good to go and it lasts for up to six months so you can use this over and over not as well as for your any other projects edible food products projects that you have that you need glue fork so I'm just gonna continue to do that to stir that I'll show you once it is clear and next we're gonna make up our starch molds alright so here's my tylose my edible glue all clear now and dissolved so just gonna pour it into a jar and once that's cool I'm gonna cover that up put it in the fridge overnight alright so now we're gonna make our starch folds and starch molds are what they use in candy manufacturing so there's not a whole bunch of people on the line pop and they've silicone molds they use these huge place with corn starch they stamp in the pattern fill up the molds once they set the plate opens all the candies fall in Iraq all the corn starch falls to the bottom and they reuse it so we're going to make our own makeshift version at home so as I said you need about one to two boxes depending how large betray your you see because you do want it almost look for sickness of your cookie sheet whatever lip on that so carefully pour it into your pan and you want to do it on parchment paper because it's going to make it a lot easier when you need to put this back into the box as well as to get it thin too sifting and again you want to be very careful otherwise it's going to look like Scarface's come through your kitchen this stuff it gets messy again you want to carefully move it an offset spatula works really well so that you can move it and spread it out around your pan evenly so I'm just moving it around here so that is all trying to get it relatively all even so that our moles will all be about the same size and you want to have enough room as I said to be able to make them a little bit deeper there and you don't want to be going all the way to the bottom so once you've got it relatively smooth out gonna Mimi and stuff everywhere so what we want to do is to take another little piece of parchment paper and you want it to be able to fit over top doesn't all stick to our pan place it down on top and then use your pan to press down don't press down too firmly but a little bit just to get that compressed and the parchment will stop of the cornstarch from sticking to the bottom of your pan in defeating the purpose of trying to make a flat surface carefully pick this up so we're good like that there so now you want to take your dowels and that's why I said you want to try and have as many as you as you were going to make because your we're gonna press it down so you take the one with a your dowel and you press one down and rock it back and forth so that it makes a little bit of a wider crevice here or so it makes a little wider it up a little bit wider of a trench and then just leave it and then use your next one just go over a little bit button in half an inch or an inch and again you're gonna do the same thing gently press and work it down so the reason you say you want to use multiple dowels is if I go and I take this out if I took it out and push the next one in it pushes some of the cornstarch into the one that we just made so the multiple dowels will help you from avoiding that problem so I'm just gonna pull the camera in over top here so you can actually see it up close all right so it's that you just go over a little bit here from the other one about an inch is good and just gently roll it into place now if you don't have as many inch you're going to like you can see like I'd oh I'm now gonna take my first one so grab it from end to end with your fingers like so so that you don't interrupt your Bowl and now I can move that one there without interrupting that one and then the same thing carefully take this one and here how're we gonna get one of our box the Nerds I've just put them into a bowl or something for you to make it easy we're gonna fill up our little trenches here with our nerd on here a bowl here no jar from a bowl today and just grab some with your fingers and gently drop them fill out the trench chair you just gonna drop them along the bottom don't fully fill it up we just want to line the bottom of it and then anywhere where there's naked spots that we miss don't worry cuz we're gonna glue glue bunch on afterwards so going along do that my trenches removing the dowels grab them use your fingertips in the end to gently pull them up then once you're done filling up your molds there with nerds you're going to carefully place the tray into your freezer so we're gonna make our mold nice and cold nice and cold so when we drop our candy syrup it's gonna start to solidify and grab onto those candies really quickly but you want to be very very gentle because it'll fall easily and yeah you don't want to do this all over again so first case scenario you make a mess him if you have to redo it just to sift out your cornstarch and your nerds and just redo the process so the first thing that we want to do is bloom our gelatin so I've got 1/2 cup of and this has got to be cold but liquid needs to be called 1/2 cup of our I use the kool-aid jammer and then you're gonna sprinkle evenly on your gelatin all over the top and this is to prevent clumping and then you want to mix it in until it's all dissolved and while you're mixing it'll start to bloom and it should call right automatically kind of go to the texture of applesauce if it doesn't your gelatin is not is not very good it's lost its Jo so you don't want to add a little more or get new stuff so we're just gonna set that off the side until we need it God needs about five at least five ten minutes to bloom so the next step is going to be our gelatin side that we're gonna do you're gonna turn your heat on to medium low you're gonna boil a half a cup of your liquid so I used a half a cup of the cooling water pour that in and you're gonna stir to dissolve your jello and then just note for your double boiler don't forget to put your water in and also you your water should never touch the bottom of your pot so I said you just gonna stir this up until that just starts to dissolve and if you're using flavor drink crystals I this is where all added in as well so it can dissolve at the same time I add about two tablespoons as I said if not you can use the Lorraine's oil and you add that more at the end so we just stir this until it's all dissolved until it until it starts to dissolve then I'm gonna add in our corn syrup and our citric acid now that my syrup is mostly the sugars not have mostly melted I'm gonna add in 1/4 cup of my can of syrup or as I said you can use corn syrup or inverted sugar and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid and the citric acid and the syrup they are both for preventing crystallization well the can of syrups add a little extra but regularly corn syrup or the inverted sugar is to help prevent crystallization so again I'm gonna mix that stir that well until it's all combined and everything's melted together in the meantime make sure your can of butter is melted and you're going to get your hand blender ready to so we're gonna need that shortly and you're gorg um so now that our syrup our gelatin and that everything's dissolved now it's time to add in our can of butter and our corn gum so you're gonna take your melted can of butter throw her in mix that around just a little bit then we're going to use each ordered teaspoon of fargo and you're going to spread gently sprinkle it try and do sprinkle it evenly over the top please let it sit for just a moment get your hand blender and we're going to blender up [Music] so you're gonna let that blend that up for about probably about two minutes you want to make sure it's something it's a really wild ball supply then once you're done just let it sit for a couple of minutes for about a minute or two and see if any oil comes to the top raises to the surface and you'll be able to tell that the air the bubbles will start to dissipate and if there's any oil if it's not fully emulsified the oil will come up to the top and you will notice kind of little oil slicks if you do see any kind of little oil slicks just add a little bit more Gorica no more than about an eighth of a teaspoon and re blended with the hand blender until that's gone so you should have one uniform texture and then just turn off the heat on your gelatin mixture here there is enough warm water in in your pot here to keep your mixture liquefied now on to the candy side the candy syrup side so for our cooked syrup you're going to add in your one cup of sugar or I said or your mixture of sugar and can of sugar get add in a quarter cup of our can of syrup or corn syrup as I said use that inverted sugar and our quarter cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of citric acid mix those together and you can turn your heat on to high heat so you're just going to continue to mix stir this until it begins to boil once it starts to boil you're gonna stop stirring that and we're gonna cook it till two hundred and eighty degrees so now that it started boiling just do it's just start it just around the sides here I'm gonna stop stirring at this point and then I'm just gonna check my temperatures every once in a while till we hit two hundred and eighty degrees so I'm gonna need to check it right now because obviously we're not going to be there I'm gonna let it boil for a couple of minutes and then I'll check its temperature so I start my syrup has been boiling for a couple of minutes so I just want to see where it's sitting right now because we only use a quarter cup of water and we're cooking a high temperature it will get to the 280 very quickly so already at 270 almost there just after 2-3 minutes 280 once it hits your temperature pull it off and allow it to cool for until it hits about 240 so why I like to set it on a stone on natural stone like granite or any natural stone it helps to pull the heat out thicker or if you've got a trivet that helps as well so said just let that sit until it hits 240 all right so my temperature my syrup now is at the correct temperature it's down below just below 240 so now I'm going to and the reason you want to do that is if it's higher it's going to break your gelatin so we don't want to do that so now we are going to pour our gelatin syrup into our candy syrup if that well mixed well together and if you found that your candy syrup has solidified on the bottom or along the sides you can put it on to low heat just to melt that so you're just going to mix this for about a minute or two till they're both combined and make sure to get right on the sides it does like to harden up there see and once everything is all nice together and all melted well together we're going to treat our unflavored gelatin and I recommend kind of break it up into smaller pieces if you can plop her in there see this way again your syrup is not going to be too hot to break your gelatin and this way we get the gelatin all through everything kind of binds there both of those together so you're just going to gently stir that until the gelatin is completely melted so now here's a way that you can kind of give a kind of little pretest to know if your syrup is going to gel up well because on gummies were okay because we can always read about those but these a little harder having all the Nerds stuck to them so we want to get it right the first time just take your syrup take your spoon and allow it to drip off if it starts to solidify in midstream like it'll start to solidify and gel right up while it's dripping you're good to go if it continues to drip like mine is it's going to need more gelatin so what I'm going to do to make sure that that's going to work is I'm going to add another tablespoon of blooms gelatin so I'm just going to go bloom another tablespoon of gelatin in a quarter cup of liquid let that bloom and then add that in and that will take care of that problem there all right so I added one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin to a quarter cup of my cooling water and I bloom that for about five minutes and added it in and now you can see how much it's thicker and how it'll start to solidify find a mid stream and it'll it'll hold there that's how you should that's a kind of a quick test for you to be able to see if it's going to gel up correctly in your moles before you actually cast them so now we wait to pour it into my little funnel here well shoot and then just line up with your trench and you're just gonna fill up the trench I have to say this funnel makes it really really easy well I needs you then try to free pour it let's go just go along you fill up all your little trenches little cavities and then you take your Nerds actually found it's easier to pour and break from the box so don't bother putting them in a bowl it's just easier to pour them from the box just take off a little lip there so it doesn't get your way and just kind of squeeze it together so you have a little bit of control it'll all come flying out and then you just fill up the box alone and you just want to be gentle with it go easy because otherwise they'll come flying out and don't worry about all the excess that goes off into the cornstarch there we're gonna sift the cornstarch when we're done and we'll be able to retrieve all those I just give it a very very gentle pat you don't look like literally just feather touch it down there you go so we've got our ropes like that so you're gonna put them into the fridge for them to set up anywhere from about a half hour to two hours it can take for your gelatin to set now that our candies have set you're just gonna take them out of the starch mold here and just lay them on to a harsh line drying rack parchment paper drying rack and you're gonna set those out to dry overnight and I'm putting the start my topside is good with the amount of candies and stuff that are on it so I'm gonna I lay them with the starch side up and that's the main side that I'm gonna add any additional candies to that they need you the sec so I'm gonna let those set stay out overnight for them to dry before we apply our glaze all right so now why are candies for setting so you don't want to waste all that cornstarch and all those nerds that are stuck in there so you grab your um your corn starts with your parchment paper inches pull it up like so take a strainer take a strainer and pour it in a little neater than that and you're gonna slip your parchment paper paper back underneath and sift it back onto the parchment once you got all that all the cornstarch sifted through just drop your candies off into a hole here and then you can get your cornstarch box add your parchment again or back in the box and you're cute most of it and once your candies are dry take them off and just slip your parchment paper underneath it's just gonna catch the excess gonna catch the excess glaze so I've done this recipe a couple times using the tylose so I would recommend out of the two I would recommend going with the glaze and the reason is the tylose because we use water it makes them very well make sure candies very wet it does dry completely and that's not a problem but they are very wet they're very sly mean it makes them difficult to kind of work with and sticking the extra candies on so I think the glaze would be a lot better this you can definitely use if you can't get the glaze but I think they set the glaze would be better so a little bit so what you can do is you're going to grab your pastry brush dip her in and just kind of take off a bit of that access and you're going to go along and you're gonna dab it on your candies on your rope and you want to dab it you don't really want to brush because it will take the color off of the nerves their wallet water soluble so I think again using the glaze would help that with that issue once you get it get it blazed on you can fill in the little spots that are miss then just gently put them on and don't try and bustle it too much because I said it'll just kind of slip and slide off but just leave them like so and again we're just gonna dab that on and you don't get one they're wet you don't want to move them because if your ropes can fall apart they can break apart so but I said once they're dry they're really they're good so I know before I said okay we could use a pan to roll them in I found that method didn't work so well because I said after one or two it gets really wet and it makes it difficult to roll in so I found just pouring the freight from the box but is not the best method once you're happy with that that me and again you're gonna let those dry probably about 12 hours to overnight once they're dry they're good to go do not store your candies in ziplock baggies if it's especially for gummies it's not good you either want to store them in glass jars or in cell bags or the miler Ziploc bags those work really well so instead I'm gonna let those puppies dry overnight and I'll show you the finished product and here's our finished product so check them out look I hope they look just like the real things as I said we don't have live here so I don't hundred percent sure but looks like it from the pictures it looks like a lot of fun alright guys so I hope you enjoyed that recipe if you have any other questions or comments please don't hesitate to put them you know where and thank you so much for joining me today you have an awesome rest of your day [Music]",

"00ArNfhqkLg": "hey what's that boy girls welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at one of my favorite things out there and that is edible chocolate love the chocolate bars and we're taking a look at a huge brand today one of only reviewed one of their products foreign have found it to be not so good so we'll be interested to see if their chocolate does any better and that is flavor ex-flame rx Flav prescription I'm just gonna go flavor X I don't want to say it they're 100 milligram toffee bar Oh made by Kanak oh I had not seen that there that's exciting that hopefully makes me optimistic I didn't know this was made by Kanak oh the flavor X bars I have only tried their fruit bars before exiting back there they're they're gummy snacks and did not really enjoy them but chocolate is usually a much better vector for THC and this is a pretty huge brand I see them everywhere everywhere this is the new regulations size 10 milligram pieces 100 milligram total although it says it actually has not yet been a lab tested there again you can see Hanako so we are gonna be optimistic and hope that it is as good as the other Kanaka products and better than the Flav Rx products I've already reviewed so here we are here is our flavor X bar inside its packaging oh and this cost me 20 bucks at my Long Beach dispensary so I'm out in line with the 100 milligram edible now which is a bit unfortunate it let's dig it out and there we go pretty simple ten pieces very small pieces of chocolate I guess they're only ten milligrams and again it is toffee flavored so let's give it a try well there's some good quality chocolate mmm no cannabis tasters because I don't really taste anything but hmm good rich milk chocolate top you provide is a nice little crunch the flavor front could not be more happy with it but guys as you all know it's not about how it tastes I mean you wanted to taste good but what you really wanted to do is to get you high and for that guys like all our reviews I'm gonna finish off this flavor X bar over the next couple of minutes here and then once I finish it I'll come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling is that's the most important part of any animal review so wish me luck I know I've got my fingers crossed I hope this one's gonna be a winner and I'll see you guys in just a bit I'm back and has actually been more than two hours since I checked in with you with the flavor rx bar I got a little ahead of myself in my activities but I am happy to tell you this is a good product um I did not like flavor X cartridges and I did not like their candy but I quite like this chocolate bar I tasted really really good on the upper end of the chocolate it's not the best of the best I've had but really pretty damn good and it's quite potent for a hundred milligram edible this really did the trick for me um I'm hoping or suspecting that the made by Cana Co is why that this one did the trick so this Flav rx chocolate bar is actually gonna get a big thumbs up from me it's not a plus tier like your Kiva or your de francais but it is close it is tasty it's pretty affordable in this new world um and uh it'll get you high so flavor X toffee 100 milligram bar that's gonna be a thumbs up for me give it a chance if you see it at your dispensary think you'll be happy you did and that guys is gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you guys on our next row deuces", "tIVQ7Lwq5-s": "what's up youtube welcome reefer ross here and uh today got a little bit of a different video for you guys i don't normally make videos like this um but today since i had no weed to smoke and no dabs or nothing like that i figured uh why not make a nice little uh edible video for you guys so as you can see there two chocolate cookies um 200 milligrams thc in total so they're 100 milligrams thc each hybrid um but yeah so i figured why not since i don't got anything to smoke it's been a while since i've made a video too it's been about two weeks now because i've just just had a lot going on recently and um been trying to secure funding for my uh glass blowing because i needed to upgrade my equipment unfortunately because the torch i got is just it's good to make like small little like dabbers and beadwork and stuff like that but unfortunately for making like bongs and rigs which is what whenever i go into smoke shops that's all they want is mostly just bongs and rigs and spoon pipes um but my torch isn't big enough to handle that yet unfortunately so i got to upgrade my torch which the torch i need is like 1200 bucks so i'm trying to secure funding for that uh but yeah so i figured why not in the meantime since i don't have any uh weed to smoke and i couldn't go and buy more weed um i had some edibles so why not get get an edible going for you guys and show you guys what that what's that yeah what that is like oh it smells super chocolatey it smells like a brownie actually so we got one little cookie there nice looking little cookie it smells good it kind of smells like a chocolate mint cookie a little bit like a mint oreo or something but i guess let's take a bite here definitely has a bit of a weedy taste to it not too strong though actually tastes pretty good it's actually a really good cookie so i'm not usually one for edibles i usually prefer getting high um smoking but i figured for you guys on the channel today why not try out an edible of course it's got a cat hair on it already perks of having cats but i have one cat but he sheds like enough for three cats i swear always cat hair plus i just picked them up so i probably have cat around my hands it's got a bit of a weak taste to it but as someone who likes that wheat taste in their edibles it's pretty good i know some people don't like that taste like my cousin she hates that weed edible like the weed taste in the edibles but me i like it but i've also eaten a lot of edibles all right cheers guys i'm gonna save the other one though i'm just gonna eat the one for now because 100 milligrams that's pretty good so that'll probably get me pretty baked but so i'll probably end up pausing it stopping the recording and i'll come back in a few hours when it's like really hit me and settled in when i'm nice and baked um so i hate the edibles around 11 15 ish in the morning and it's now just about two i am definitely feeling nice and stoned i'm feeling good i'm just vibing you know chilling and uh yeah and i ended up looking around and i ended up managing to find the last little bit of shatter so i i was gonna take it off camera and i was like oh [ __ ] yeah dad and i was about to take it and i was like you know what i gotta take it on camera for you guys because i was like i'm gonna hop back on camera in like 20 minutes anyway so i'll just save it right and so i had it and i saved it up for you guys but yeah so off that edible right now like i haven't had anything to smoke i'm just feeling good i'm vibing i'm feeling nice and chill uh i feel like my eyes are a little bit more more closed you know a little more shut uh a little lower um but yeah other than that i'm feeling pretty good feeling feeling definitely like there's some thc in my system off that last one but uh let's get into a dab here guys so i'm gonna heat up the torque nail here all right so we got the nail nice and heated up here and uh or the banger i should say it's not a nail it's uh i'm using a quartz bank but yeah just a quick little video for you guys here today nothing uh too special just ate a little cookie there and uh now i'm gonna take this little dab so cheers guys so that that i definitely feel too that hit me nice and hard um all right but yeah so like i said not not a long video here for you guys because i don't got no weed to smoke and that was the last my dabs right there i was lucky enough to find one more for you guys but um yeah so i promise as soon as i get more weed and as soon as i get more dabs um i will definitely be coming at you guys with more videos don't even trip um i'm just right now just a little more focused on trying to get together my business and get glass blowing so um but yeah because i gotta secure some funding for my uh so i can upgrade my equipment so i can start make actually making money but so yeah i'm gonna get up on out of here hopefully i'll have another video coming out for you guys soon um i'll try and get one out as soon as i can as soon as i buy some more weed uh but yeah so i'm gonna get up on out of here i hope you guys enjoyed this one hopefully you're nice and baked and remember to do something positive i say it and i try to say it in all my videos at the end but like something something little is holding the door for someone like i know right now it's a little harder with social distancing to kind of help people out and whatnot but um just i don't know even like a little small smile or a nice little compliment can be something tiny and minuscule for you that you forget um in 20 minutes but it could change someone's entire life around you really don't know so um yeah remember to spread that positivity guys and just you know be kind smile uh but yeah i'ma get up on out of here hopefully you guys enjoyed this one reefer ross peace out", "lSD37qU4tKw": "[Music] stoners pot heads lend me your ears for is a new episode of wheats thank you so much guys for coming back and joining us here on wheats the marijuana edibles Rob you show where we help you make sense of you our dispensary if this is the first time you are joining us here on wheats our goal is to help you make sense of your dispensary helped you understand that giant wall of edibles at your dispensary lets you know which of those products are worth your hard-earned dollars today we are looking at another drink from habit habit based out of San Diego California this is their sparkling grape drink 200 or 100 milligrams of THC promises rapid onset which I like faster apparently then your typical edibles it's got some real fruit in there or so it says 71 calories 2 servings it's a fancy looking bottle serve cold lay open slowly let's follow those directions and give her a taste so on weights the way it works guys if you've never seen this before is I'm gonna sample this product I might finish it depending how long it takes but I will finish the whole thing before before too much longer and I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how this edible or in this case this drinkable is doing so without further ado let's open her up open slowly I can see why fizzy fizzy fizzy slow slow slow slow it down still fizzy still too fizzy of this sparkling grape there we go it smells like grape juice no discernible weed out or whatsoever it smells a little bit like wine I suppose that's not too unexpected being sparkling grape juice let's give her a taste YUM no we taste space like sparkling grape juice and pretty good sparkling grape juice at that well I would drink this now again this is a little bit on the expensive site at $12 but I really like the habit I had before I really found that the rapid onset to be true and I found that uh the high lasted quite a while but that was the Kiwi flavour so we'll see if the sparkling grape is just as potent as the Kiwi YUM I gotta say on taste especially in comparison to dozers which I've had before this wins hands down let's taste legitimately good well guys I'm gonna finish off this habit sparkling grape here and I will see you in two hours to let you know how we're feeling thank you so much for watching weeks guys we'll see you soon peace it's been about two hours since I had the there we go the habit sparkling grape 100 milligrams beverage here and I like it quite a bit and I believe their claim that it does have rapid onset I was feeling it uh probably about five to 10 minutes in maybe I don't know maybe a little maybe a little more and then it was a pretty consistent hi there uh I do I I feel like starting to come down already it's maybe peaked at around the 90 minute mark but for a hundred milligram consumable it was pretty potent it still was a little bit on the expensive side at $12 but this is a drink that I have no problem recommending as you are comfortable with the expense and don't mind uh trying something a little unorthodox again that's the habit sparkling grape made there in San Diego California if you see it a dispensary near you feel free to give it a shot thank you so much for watching wheat skies and we will check you out on the next review beasts I guess I can't throw this one at you because that would be dangerous just buddy hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "KKKNFBc2bz8": "hey guys it's Danny and today I'm sharing four more overnight boat recipe ideas with you guys now the first two are my protein packed options I've got some creamy banana pudding protein oats and then my favorite the decadent chocolate peanut butter protein oats followed by my green matcha overnight oats and some seriously delicious carrot cake overnight oats now if you're wanting more than four options make sure you check out my original overnight oats video where I share for more flavor so in total you will have 8 - so you can find that up in the cards or down in the description box below now what makes these recipes very easy is that you're gonna take one base and then use that for all of the different flavors so into an 8 ounce mason jar I am combining 1/2 a cup of rolled oats with 1 teaspoon of chia seeds and then 1/2 a cup plus 2 tablespoons of an unsweetened almond milk and you can of course use any type of milk that you like prefer or have on hand they all work so super easy this is going to be the base for all four recipes so first up I have my banana pudding protein oats super creamy super delicious so to the base I'm adding 10 grams of a vanilla protein powder and you can use any type of protein powder you like I will link to the ones I like down in the description box below but I really like to use protein powders as a supplement to my meals sometimes because it's an easy way to boost the protein in your meal and I think it tastes really good too so this is especially ideal to me if I'm eating it like before or after a workout then to that I'm adding a third of a banana that I've chopped up and a couple dashes of cinnamon give that a good mix get all the ingredients well incorporated then pop on the lid and put this in the fridge now normally I'll do these at night and let them sit overnight but really they just need about three hours or so to set up and be ready to go then when they're ready to go you'll see that it gels up and there really rich and creamy and then you can top them with whatever you fancy I like a little extra chapped up banana some walnuts and then a little cinnamon over the top and just an FYI if you like nuts in your oatmeal with the overnight oats always add it at the end because if you mix it in and then leave it to set and they will get soft and you're gonna lose that crunch next up I have my decadent chocolate peanut butter protein oats so again we've got the same base and to that I'm adding 10 grams of chocolate protein powder so the same as before pick what you like I will link to my favorites down in the description box below and then one tablespoon of peanut butter can be creamy can be crunchy you just want to look for an all-natural peanut butter and then a few more dashes of cinnamon give that a good mix and just take your time work that peanut butter in get it all incorporated then you pop on your lid and into the fridge it goes now when these oats come out and they're ready to go I love this with some type of fresh berry over the top I've got strawberries here today and a little extra peanut butter in my mine is kind of like a peanut butter and jelly in oatmeal form now just a little side note too if you are not a protein powder kind of gal or guy no big deal you could skip it for both of those maybe add a little bit of stevia or whatever type of sweetener you prefer and you can roll it up from there so these recipes will work with or without the protein powder just so you know moving right along I've got my green matcha coconut overnight oats so into our base we are adding one teaspoon of matcha powder remember guys all matcha is is a green tea powder it's super rich in antioxidants so it brings all type of goodness to the body I am a big fan of the matcha reserve they have lots of different flavors and if you purchase from their website using code Danny matcha you will save 15% off your purchases so I will leave that down in the description box below then I've got two teaspoons of shredded coconut love the combo of matcha and coconut and a few drops of stevia now I like the stevia because it's an all-natural sweetener but it doesn't have any calories and it doesn't affect blood sugar levels by all means use whatever sweetener turns you on all of them get the job done it's important that you like what you're using then stir that all together pop on the lid into the fridge it goes then when it's time to enjoy this I'm serving mine with some fresh chopped up blackberries a few chopped up gooseberries which are like a really tart ripe fruit and then a little extra coconut mmm so good and then last but certainly not least are my carrot cake overnight oats so into our base recipe I am adding 3 tablespoons of shredded carrots and I shred this on the smallest hole of a box grater so you can get them nice and fine then we have a few spices 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon a little pinch of nutmeg and a pinch of ginger 1 tablespoon of raisins and then a few drops of stevia okay give those stir get it all incorporated you know the routine pop on the lid into the fridge it goes when it's time to enjoy this combo I do a few extra carrots over the top some chopped up pecans and a few extra raisins but again have fun with the toppings and make them your own these overnight oats are a really fun breakfast they're super convenient and if you have some fun with the flavors it's a great way to work some of your favorite indulgences into your oatmeal which is an easy way to curb some of your cravings or at least I find

here we're recording it guerilla style we have damned a man buying a camera now I want to show you guys what I have going here come I have weed whose disabilities I have this isn't sake I have weed graham crackers and foil I'll bring it back up to me if you know oh no you're not even oh here you go ready the final most important ingredient peanut butter if you know you know what am i making tonight folks I'm making the fire now back up a little bit basically what I'm making tonight is called the fire cracker now I have made this in college before we didn't call the fire cracker we just called it a way to take a small amount of lead and get as [ __ ] up as possible basically this is like the world's easiest quickest and most dangerous edible all you need is like a graham cracker peanut butter and weed and foil in an oven and you're gonna be able to make this edible and get so high you're gonna see ghosts I did this in college ones when I was really sick and I couldn't smoke weed and she said I was like I'll make this very very very powerful edible I ended up getting so high I called my sister crying she came to pick me up from college in a blizzard I had to take in completes in all of my classes because I couldn't finish the semester and I actually was almost dying I had pneumonia and like had to get on to steroids and [ __ ] but the point is this is not for [ __ ] children okay I haven't done it since then and I'm pretty sure Jackie did this once and she actually hallucinate it so here we go I'm gonna do it now dan one of these is just for you cuz I figured you'd want one they're very good like you don't know a good graham cracker these are good okay so the average dose is a gram but that's like if you want to like see ghosts so I do want to see ghosts I would like to see my father tonight I'm just getting ready but I got scared as I was doing this because I weighed out of Graham and I was like [ __ ] it and I turned a little bit out so it's probably closer to 0.7 so really all you do I'm hesitant to turn because my profile so just follow my hands okay all you're doing is taking these okay then you just slather slather slather the most important the most important part is to cover both crackers with peanut butter because you need the peanut butter and the weed to be touching on both sides because the fat in the peanut butter is what is gonna activate the THC in the oven so the THC the weed is like D carbon in the oven but it's d carving into the peanut butter bonding to the fat and bonding to your [ __ ] skull and that is why you get so [ __ ] up feel like I'm watching Bill Nye the Science Guy a weed girl okay sprinkle it sprinkle it now you can put as much weed as you want on here you know you can you can put Keefe on here is that enough do I need to have more feel like it's a lot you know I gotta be honest even the smell of this is bringing back memories that I don't want to have brought back and then I'm just gonna kind of do you have this do you have this so then I just go through and they need to kind of bond each side almost like you're cocking that your cockpit day in your life I'm not haven't cocked ringing up but I'm cocked mm-hmm and when you feel that you've sealed it and bonded it you just you know it's a peanut butter cracker but you don't want to send this off - can you record me it's not a [ __ ] interesting if you just record the phone the whole time am I in the shot these are like peanut butter crackers but you don't want to set them with little giant to school okay this ain't no lunchable now you want to pre-heat your oven to 325 degrees and once it's fully preheated you're gonna put this in for 25 to 30 I'm gonna do 25 because our oven runs kind of hot right and I'm gonna show you me eating it afterward so that you don't think I'm lying and then I'll show you the aftermath but yeah firecracker and it goes come on follow me the oven here we go wish me luck all right guys it's 25 minutes later and this baby is out of the oven and nice weed aroma is coming from it and now it's our moment of truth yeah so I just spent like five [ __ ] full minutes trying to focus the inside of this cracker but it's not focusing so all you need to know is that it looks like we've inside focus I don't know I'm sweating tits in this vest I can't explain the backstory in this video well alright no no eat this I'll let you know what happens who's ooh okay we're back so this edible what I forgot about this edible was that not only does it make you so [ __ ] high which yes it also makes you pretty nauseous left I forgot everybody very nauseous it's like a very well the ride of nausea but I was on the phone my friend getting so high and what he knew you know but it was good that I was talking to him because it forced me to breathe through the nausea and the highness and didn't know you're fine and otherwise I would apologize like passed out on the couch so I am very high I was way higher before and it was crazy I mean it definitely he it definitely launched me the Firecracker launched me into another to another place so I would say you definitely try it at home try it at home use lots of weaves if you want Okaloosa name alright thanks for watching some severe until sightings show see you next time bye hello we're back it's hours later I don't know if you can tell so you're

marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we really help you determine which products there and your dispensaries vast library of edibles is actually worth your money which ones are a bunch of [ __ ] and which ones are actually gonna get you high so today we're taking all our second look at a product from Miss Mary Jane's edibles we're gonna review our second cakepop from them if you missed my first review I quite liked it it got me pretty high not outrageously height but it tasted amazing so I really quite enjoyed it so yeah we for the first time reviewed the cookies and cream today we are taking a look at Miss Mary Jane's chocolate turtle cake pop so you can see right here 100 milligrams as rated by the fine folks at SC labs which I can always love to see on my packaging anytime I see that lab verification I feel a little bit more encouraged that it's going to be as potent as advertised um I love the packaging on this the nice little box here packaging nice it's got all the great information right it's got nutrition information ingredients everything you could want on the packaging and as for price ten bucks there at the bottom but I bought these two for 15 which is a pretty good value for a hundred milligram edible especially for one that tastes so goddamn good so I'm gonna shut up now I'm gonna open up this cake pop I give it a taste let you guys know how it tastes how it smells all that fun stuff and then like all our weeks reviews I'll come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the Edward with you alright so just like the other one packaging a little bag in there can be a little tough to open but we'll get it maybe uh-huh uh-oh party foul my cake pop is no longer a cake pop it is now just a little candy ball so there it is sans pop sans stick but a little ball of cake with some peanuts at top or not peanuts what kind of walnuts right that's what's on turtle let's give it a taste very cool very [ __ ] well well that's good there's just as good as the just as good as the cookies and cream cake pop really like the taste really like oh man delicious no cannabis taste whatsoever so in terms of taste we got two for two here for the cake pops now we just have to wait two hours to see if it's gonna get me just as high so guys that's gonna do it for this first half of this week's review I'll see you in two hours peace in two hours since I had the chocolate turtle cake pop from Miss Mary Jane's edibles and just like the cookies and cream cake pop I like it quite a bit this is two for two both in terms of taste and and potency again it's not an overwhelmingly potent edible it's a hundred milligrams and sort of right at that hundred milligram line for sure so if you like them a little bit lower dose store if you're looking for something a little bit more mellow this is a great thing to try again it tastes so good I can't emphasize enough how I mean there's just I I detected no cannabis taste on either one I mean again how sort of pleasantly buzzed they got me these are a good value especially if you can find out at the two for fifteen price that's a pretty good value I think it don't think you're gonna be disappointed with that with that price and the taste and results from them so I was pretty pleased with my little detour and to Miss Mary Jane Miss Mary Jane's edibles I hope Miss Mary Jane's sticks around after the an apocalypse here and comes back with some good products in the future because these these are winners I think and guys that is gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a later review peace okay", "vOZQqYB52Lk": "[Music] what's up fun wolf and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show we help you make sense of your dispensary cocoa cocoa classic episode today and that means edible my favorite of all cannabis products we are taking a look at ed abou and I believe our second product may be third from Moon Moon Moon intergalactic milligram each intergalactic milligram each milligrams milligrams so this is a 100 milligrams of they're a rocket fudge sounds good I've had their spaceman mint bar before also 100 milligrams and I found it to be excellent so I'm coming up this one with some pretty high expectations we've got some pretty standard packaging but nice you know it's got everything you want to see on it including the lab testing results right there on the front from SC Labs which is great and then on the back you've got your nutrition information your ingredients and then right there whoops on that side mirrors are reversed it shows you your different ten milligrams serving size suggestions I think they're supposed to have discrete different little things but they don't but who cares and I picked this up from a brand new dispensary in Long Beach opened just yesterday called the lift and I picked it up for 20 bucks which is pretty expensive but not that expensive for a Long Beach okay oh wow and then look at this we've got even more packaging there on the inside with the childproof zipper thingy I think I figured out this one boy I have seen probably probably five that seems about right five different childproof mechanisms these modern child proofing packages I've seen and they're all different and they all are infuriating in their own little ways like this one I can see what I'm supposed to do but the mechanism isn't lining up right let's hope they get this [ __ ] ironed out soon because it sucks not to have that all right oh here we go here are the moon bars there are half of them there all right no there are six so there should be four remaining in here oops and there we go there the other four they say THC on them and this is the rocket fudge let's shut up and stick it in my mouth hall and of course guys I'm gonna be eating the whole thing not just the one ten milligram piece um that eat the whole hundred milligrams and then come back to you guys at the end of the review to let you know how all this is hitting so two hours later I'll come back to you guys mmm yuck as far as chocolate goes that's one of those cannabis tea tasting chocolates I've ever had um this chocolate doesn't mask the cannabis flavor really at all but that could be a great thing I've got my fingers crossed that that means this is potent as hell and they've got a lot of strong THC and vibed weed in there but if taste is important to you stick to your kiba's stick to your defenses cuz this does not taste good I'm actually surprised by how bad it tastes mmm well it does have me optimistic that this thing is gonna rock my world when when we come back so again taste ooh not so great especially for chocolate but it's all about that potency and so guys I'm gonna eat the last remaining six of these and then I'll come back to you guys two hours after I finish the last one to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching to this point and I'll see you guys very soon boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom moon moon moon moon moon if I want to get banned from it YouTube I'd show you my ass right now guys it's been about three hours since I actually had moon that's because I was feeling so nice and so relaxed and so high that I wanted to just keep on with that bus and three hours later I am still quite high this is another real win for moon it tastes bad it's one of the worst tasting chocolates I've ever had but but but it is only a hundred grams or sorry grams calories which is so much better than like the Korova mini cookies I know I just had like the Pete's mini cookies and they had 700 calories you had to eat a [ __ ] it tastes really bad to be honest but you have to only eat so little that little chocolate bars only like that big you know that wide so you just you know you can eat it in three bites and be done with it it's not gonna be pleasant but you are gonna get really stoned and you're not gonna have to eat a whole lot if you want to just grab something to split between three buddies pop it in your mouth man this will get three pretty people probably pretty feeling pretty high before like a show movie whatever moon has been surprisingly man for a smaller edible company or seemingly smaller I don't see them a lot of places I have really enjoyed my time with them this is a big big thumbs up for me guys so if you see moon in their rocket fudge or I think I reviewed their spaceman mint before go for it man they're great and guys right before I balance here I'm going to share with you something that is weed related as a cherry on top I knew I normally try to share something without you or share something with you that is not weed related but I want to go ahead and share with you something that you can definitely use I've had this bad way for a year now although it's oddly gross on the top this grinder is amazing Black Tie grinders used it every time I have flour don't really have to clean it very often it's just a very very sharp very very handy grinder I think it cost me 20 something dollars on Amazon you know upgraded from like the two dollar pieces of plastic [ __ ] to something really nice and the Black Tie grinders is quite as as nice as their logo implies so that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review both great products wholeheartedly endorse both thank you so much for watching to the end you big jerks and by jerks I mean Best Buddies thanks again and we will see you guys on the next review doses", "KbUMtCGsZUo": "it's hardly a new year I can hardly believe it but this is a time where a lot of people will make new goals for themselves and I am no different my goal is to try to put as much lean body mass on without gaining too much fat now this is a very popular goal and we wanted to make this video because we've heard the question many times before and that's why I wouldn't kind of lay out what to do what not to do and some of the things to keep in mind if this is your particular goal typically when you're on a bulking program what you're gonna do is jump on a scale to see your weight and then as you see that weight progress you know you're doing something right but if you're trying to stay as lean as you can while building that muscle mass you're gonna have to know something more than just what it says on the scale you're gonna have to know your body composition there's a few ways to do this one is the skinful test which is using the calipers and although that might not be precise it's a pretty good and cheap way to check your body fat percentages relatively easily but if you want really cheap and really easy while circumference measurements can be a good way and also some pictures too so that way you see your progression from day one - let's say day thirty and the circumference measurements are really going to tell you where you're putting on that size whether your shoulders your arms your legs or maybe your waist so tracking your progress is very important so we got the measurements now what well next we need to find out how many calories you need to make sure you're putting on that lean body mass now you can do your BMR which is your basal metabolic rate and that's essentially describing how many calories your body needs while at rest but since you're not going to be arrests you need to find out how many calories you burn throughout the day and that's the tdee calculator the total daily energy expenditure although it's not precise it's a pretty good way to start to understand how many calories you need for maintenance and of course if you're trying to gain weight you're gonna have to go above maintenance usually we'll say about 500 calories a day above maintenance which we'll bring you in the 3,500 calories in the total week which will bring about a pound of body weight gain per week now that you have your total calories you need to eat per day you're gonna have to figure out your macronutrient ratio macro-nutrients are fats carbs and proteins in the percentages are gonna fit within your total calories now this can be a little bit of a trial and error but making sure you track what you eat and the percentages you have are really going to tell what works best for you but another issue can be sometimes is a little hard hitting your total calories and your macronutrients throughout the day a girlfriend actually has the goal of putting on as much lean body mass as possible while staying lean and she has a hard time hitting her macros and calories throughout the day so along with your breakfast lunch and dinner you're gonna need to supplement on snacks in between those meals to make sure you're feeding your body as much nutrition as possible thankfully our friends over at perfect keto sent over these bars they have great ingredients they have good fats full of fiber and protein to make sure we're always hitting not only a macro nutrients but also our calories too so all that being said I think it's time to grab some food so we just made it to the grocery store we should be shopping eating some bare essentials really talking about some of the foods that are mainstay and my bulking eating plan and also some of the things you keep in mind too so it's pretty packed in here as you can see but we're gonna be making our way through and get some goodies your macronutrient intake is gonna really dictate what food you buy and what food you eat obviously if you have a higher percentage of fat in your macronutrient split you don't want higher fattier foods so let's say steak and salmon avocados you can be introducing that a lot throughout the day but if you're backing off a little bit in fat then what you want to do is get a little bit more lean meats like chicken turkey and things of that nature so I do about a 40 40 20 split which is 40% protein 40% carbs and 20% fat so my fat contents a bit lower but if you change your carbs into a lower percentage your fats and a high percentage obviously you're going to be having a little bit higher fatty foods throughout the day rather than just only a couple times so you want to really make sure you shop accordingly to your not only calories but also your macronutrient breakdown and ratios to the sweet potatoes excellent source of complex carbohydrates and of course you have this along with your meats and also some more vegetables to make a complete meal formicola natural healthy ingredients and you can't forget greens packed full of fiber but also calcium iron potassium things that they get some fruit it is packed full of antioxidants micronutrients and also fiber and it's a nice treat every once in a while have something a little sugary but also natural too we are in the meat section here and as you can see there's a lot available you have ground beef you have steak or chicken turkey you know and you have to really choose what works for you what you like but protease is an excellent way to help prepare your muscles has a lot of amino acids and it has creatine and it has nature so it's one that you want to really include if you're really trying to put a lot of size on it's going to be in conjunction with your dreams and of course your start GF cards committed to the eggs and eggs are an excellent source of protein but also fats too you can use them in many different recipes many different ways and you just cook them up and eat them in heart oil um and sometimes I like to just crack them in raw right in the protein shake just get a little bit of extra calories protein fats I mean I love these guys can't forget about milk there's many ways to use it I love it protein shakes you can do whole milk that has higher fats a lot of calories so if you're really trying to pack on the pounds and have those extra calories whole milk can definitely be an easy way of doing that for you do fat free so lessens the fat of course the sugar in the milk from the lactose and if you're lactose intolerant there's always a good substitute of almond milk but I love milk I don't have a problem with it so I've always included to get those extra calories that deliciousness and approach so also talking about milk products there is cottage cheese an excellent source of casein protein which is a slower digesting protein I usually like to have this at night right before bed that way my body is supplied with amino acids as I sleep and it is just delicious love this stuff always include this you might even program for sure turkey bacon very low in fat but very high in protein so if you're trying to watch your fat content of your protein content this is a good way of doing it of course you have a lot of fat from your whole eggs so decrease the fat a little bit you can go ahead and go turkey bacon while increasing your protein but if you're keeping your fat high then regular bacon is fine now a good rule of thumb is to keep it simple and some of the simplicity that we like to stick with carbohydrates is oats rice potatoes or sweet potatoes and also greens too that way you're getting that complex carbohydrates simple carbohydrates and very fibrous carbohydrates from the greens and really just all-around meals on every meal and that's gonna be very important because when you're eating that much you want to make sure to keep it not only simple but healthy as well I remember stepping into a store similar to this when I first wanted to gain weight and the first thing I went to was the ice cream aisle because I thought to myself the more calories the better doesn't matter where you so I bought some ice cream and I would have a couple bars at night and I started putting on weight and I was like well hell yeah this is working but one morning I woke up and I didn't like what I saw in the mirror so I start to think myself well maybe not all calories are built the same so I started doing cardio and then I adjusted my eating from there and my workouts and that's when I started seeing the most out of it it's actually cared about what I was eating so calories are important but you want to make sure you're getting in them from the right places I mean there you go you have protein complex carbohydrates constantly getting that influx of foods and that's really when you get the most out of your foods when you really do it yourself and yes it takes a little bit more time but it's worth it in the end [Music] now much like food having a strategy when you're working out is a very important thing you need to have a reason why you're going to the gym and one thing to remember is that compound exercises are really the best bang for your buck so if you're increasing the amount of calories you're having the protein the carbs the fats you're having all that fuel into your body you're gonna need to workout and to use that to make sure the body is actually putting it to good use and that's why compound movements are very important to include in your workout program I remember coming to this very same gym in my early teens with the hopes of gaining as much muscle mass as possible I would come in here day after day just rolled me around doing bicep curls or leg extensions pretty much anything I could do that felt good to me and that I thought was gonna give me results at the time I didn't know what compound or isolation movements were or really the benefits of either one now I know compounds take priority over isolations especially if you're trying to gain that quality muscle size and strength only after that you can supplement on isolation exercises in movements I would recommend if you're a beginner to start with big compound movements full body three days a week much like a 5x5 program as you progress and get more experience you can move on to splitting up the body groups and starting to introduce isolation exercises into your program as you become more experienced you can start introducing or take into your training you can either split up the body group throughout the week Chesson tries back and buys legs things of that nature and start introducing more techniques like pyramiding drop setting super setting you have to think yourself you're eating so much food you want to make sure you're putting that food and nutrition to good use if you go to the gym hit it as hard as you can keep doing your cardio there's no reason for you to be bulking and then back off on in training you want to increase your training intensity as you bulk that's gonna make sure you put on that quality muscle size and to keep the fat off now it's time for recovery you put in all the work and now it's time to rest and as you know you don't grow during your workouts you grow during your rest and recovery sometimes you'll want to introduce some myofascial release some foam rolling to really try to massage out those tough spots and those sore spots to make sure you're getting the proper blood flow and nutrients inside the muscles so they can repair properly stretching can come into play as well also hydration is very very important and of course sleep and that's exactly what I'm gonna be doing I just want to say huge thank you to perfect keto for making this video possible and also you guys too for always tuning in and supporting us if you did like this video let us know in the comments below and as always stay off [Music] you", "SccbNpjH0kY": "[Music] hey hey this is Lindsay from fitting fabulous and today I'm

like this in the future as well is I want to show you guys and basically share my free 5 day meal plan so be sure to click the link above and then you guys can actually download that for absolute free so let's get started with our very first recipe [Music] so for our very first recipe we are going to be using some quick oats so oats is great to use and protein balls because it has a really great fiber in there it's like that really good healthy carbs so in this recipe we are gonna be using one cup of quick oats next we're gonna be using some peanut butter so this is just all-natural a regular peanut butter which literally means it's just smooshed peanuts is all it is some of the other peanut butters you can buy in the store actually have icing sugar and all that extra crap in it but we just want like all natural just like regular peanut butter so we're gonna be using a half a cup of peanut butter in this recipe next we're gonna be using some honey so this is just some regular honey that you can just buy your like local grocery store so in this recipe we are going to be using 1/3 of a cup of honey [Music] next we need some protein so I like to use lady bus lean a vanilla cake flavor I love it because it is gluten free and grass-fed whey this protein powder tastes amazing and it only has a hundred calories which is fantastic it has 15 grams of protein and so many vitamins minerals it's great for weight loss immunity support craving control and digestive health so that's why I like to use it so in this recipe we are going to be using the 2 scoops of the lady bus lean vanilla cake flavor and then you want to mix that bad boy up so we're just going to mix it up as much as we can [Music] and I always like to add a few chocolate chips so these are semi-sweet chocolate chips is just like mini chocolate chips so I just like to add this it just adds a little bit of extra sweetness and who doesn't love chocolate chips and up protein balls so in this recipe I'm gonna add about two tablespoons in there now if you want to you don't have to add the chocolate chips but I like to have them in there so that's why I like to add them and so of course when I mix that up again [Music] mix it up as much as you can it does kind of get a little bit messy but it's totally worth it and then you want to grab a plate and this recipe is gonna make about 12 protein balls so then I always like to break up the dough so it's kind of like in half and then in half and then in half again basically trying to like get 12 of the same size protein balls [Music] and then you can put them in the fridge for like 10-15 minutes to let them cool and then I always like to put them in a little container as well so and voila there we have it those are our original peanut butter protein balls and they are so good [Music] next we're gonna be making our chocolate truffle peanut butter balls so again we're gonna need a bowl and so for this recipe we're gonna start with some protein so it's some lady Vaseline vanilla cake flavor of course because again it is my favorite protein now if you guys don't have the lady bustling and that's okay just as long as vanilla cake flavor so you want to add three scoops of this protein just as long as it's vanilla cake flavor so three scoops of the protein powder so next we're going to be using some swerve now this is basically like the icing sugar type swerve so this it's kind of like the finer version now if you have the other type of swerve it's totally fine as well I love to use swerve just because it is zero calories it is a really great sugar replacement because it is made with your breath route also it actually doesn't like spike your blood sugar which is great especially when you're trying to lose weight so in this recipe we are going to be using three tablespoons of swirl next we're going to be using some coconut flour so you can just find this at your local grocery store so we are going to be using it two tablespoons of coconut flour in this recipe [Music] next we need some peanut butter again this is just all-natural regular peanut butter smooth so we are going to be using three quarters of a cup of peanut butter in this recipe [Music] next we're gonna be using some coconut oil so this is just virgin coconut oil just you know from your local grocery store so we are gonna be using two tablespoons of coconut oil in this recipe and then we want to grab a spoon and we want to stir all of that goodness up so we're just gonna stir stir stir stir stir stir and stir it off [Music] and you want to grab a plate and you want to measure out 12 protein balls [Music] then we're gonna take those protein balls and we are actually gonna put them in the fridge now it's best if you actually put them in the fridge overnight just because then they tend to like harden that much better especially when you're trying to put the chocolate in so if you want to put them in there for at least a couple hours if not overnight so after you've done that then what you want to do is you want to take some chocolate chips now these are just dark chocolate chips you want to take about one cup of those and you want to put that in the microwave and melt that so it's nice and liquidy that's why you want to make sure that you have the protein balls and put them in the fridge so they're nice and hard then you put them in the warm chocolate it doesn't actually kind of like melt them too much and then what you want to do is you want to take the protein balls and just dip it into the chocolate now it's I found it easiest if you use a fork but whatever you find is easier you want to take them one by one dip them in the chocolate put them back on the plate and then what I usually do is I just put them in the freezer for like 10-15 minutes to let the chocolate harden up a little bit more and voila that's what they look like so then you can take them off the plate and you can put them into a bowl now you can serve them as is right now or if you want to save them you can always just store them in the fridge and then just have like one or two every day so that's what they look like and they are delicious [Music] so I hope you guys enjoyed those recipes because they are super good and super super delicious they are so honestly like super easy to make like I can't even get over how easy they are to make and they were so good so if you guys have any questions at all let me know in the comment section down below let me know if you guys actually are going to make these whether you have made them in the past or maybe you've made like a like made them with just maybe like a few different like ingredients or whatever um yeah let me know in the comment section down below I love communicating with you guys in the comments section so I hope you guys have an amazing day and I will take care love you [Music]", "txZvghp1mmE": "[Music] Rick with the best of everything let's take a look at the better than coffee energy bars just came in see if their energy bars or envelopes better than coffee this contained chicory ba and ma guano and maca or South American herbs the energy bars labeled was

make a nice little countertop dispenser put it in the cabinet anyway and our energy bar this one is twenty five point seven six grams so the Burano that contains about double the caffeine as coffee in Brazil South American stand very common to see Verona suckers velocity little chewy bar looking thing it smells very much like coffee of course the flavor on this is French Roast so it does also contain coffee powder smells pretty good your chewy bite and it's a bitter so that will be the maka we choked er there's dark chocolate  a maca root war uh no taste that coconut fiber and taste that

[Music]", "H5f073sUB6k": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to week two the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on this review we are talking my favorite company on the planet we're talking canna Co another one of their 100 milligram erse one that I've never reviewed any of their this this one on any level before but I'm excited to do it because I love these kind of things and that's Kanako's 100 milligram lemon bar that's right 100 milligram lemon bar from canna Co super super excited I've loved every single can of coke product I've reviewed I've loved every milligram egde I've reviewed from them 100 250 and 500 although the 500s are definitely too strong for me to do in one go but I've done it before watch the video yeah so I'm super excited about this as I said I love love lemon bars too so I'm really looking forward to this one let's a look at the back of the box here I've already opened it up just a little bit to make this a little bit easier on me as we've got our back of the package here 440 calories for the whole thing the pure experience and lemon bar says on the front here delicious sugar cookie crust layered with lemon filling topped with vanilla icing and finished with refreshing lemon zest sounds awesome let's go ahead and get right into it here just a second and here we go here is the lemon bar a handsome product if I've ever seen one there's the sugar cookie crust the lemon filling and that baller-ass looking vanilla icing it's big it's very big much bigger than I thought it was going to be it weighs quite a bit it feels quite heavy let's go ahead and give it a bite there's a quality lemon bar mmm good crust get billing good icing no real cannabis taste what to me to speak up at all almost completely devoid of cannabis taste just a good lemon bar um all right guys well I'm gonna enjoy polishing this off and I will see you in two hours or actually I'll see you guys in just a couple of seconds but I'll be back in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching Wheaton I'll see you in just a bit peace hi guys it's been Oh actually a little bit longer than two hours I must confess I accidentally took a nap in between this review which might have tested the power of the product of the Kanak Oh a lemon bar 100 milligram that I felt it necessary to take a nap in between the the review there I enjoyed the product quite a bit I loved how it tasted absolutely left how it tasted and it got me up to like a solid six half maybe from a hundred milligram at a bull which is just I mean it's just ridiculous it's incredible as all kind of coat products seem to be I love them all this is definitely no exception for me I love love love the lemon bar 100 milligrams even at 100 milligrams it got me really really high so I'm completely pleased with it oh I believe it cost me ten bucks at my dispensary so an utterly affordable edible as well if you see one at a dispensary and you like the lemon bars do not hesitate to grab one you will certainly be happy you did that is again the Kanak Oh lemon bar 100 milligrams thank you so much for watching wheats guys and we will check you out on the next review peace I'm not gonna throw that at this camera", "WDgDnNerFqY": "welcome to diy or die today i want to talk about cloning this is the third episode in the cloning series today we're going to get into some actual mixing something that i know you've been looking forward to so here we have jam monsters pb and j strawberry and we're gonna try and get as close as possible we can to this e-liquid now in this episode we're going to break down batching and what batching is is essentially the first process of configuring your recipe to get to a point that puts you on the right direction now if you haven't watched the last two episodes i implore you to watch the last two episodes because they are imperative to understanding the next process that is batching if you don't know what defining characteristics are if you don't understand how to properly look and evaluate your e-liquid that you're trying to emulate then this process is not really going to help you so make sure you go back and you watch the first two videos now batching to put it more simply is just making different batches of the same profile the purpose of this is you can narrow down your recipe hunt you can narrow down your development to get to a point that puts you on the right path so in this particular case we have jam monsters pb j strawberry here we have identified our defining characteristic which is that combination between the strawberry and peanut butter that really makes that tick it's sort of like a jammy strawberry it's a little sticky it's sweet and then you get you know a pretty vibrant peanut butter uh on the finish so now that we know what the defining characteristic is we can take that and batch it out so we can try to really hone in which path to go down where we're going forward we're going to start to add in our accents and finish the recipe so here we're basically trying to figure out what pair of flavorings or what combination of flavorings gives us that defining characteristic and obviously you can't do this in just one go you're not gonna be able to vape something and then immediately go oh it's this flavoring in this flavoring you're going to need to do some batching where you're gonna take the recipe and just split it up across a spectrum of profiles that are within the realm of your defining characteristic so here we have the strawberry and peanut butter defining characteristic and here i have three different types of batches that will that i think are gonna get us to that defining characteristic they're all across the spectrum though so for instance this first batch we have tf is dx peanut butter we have flavor arts juicy strawberry and we also have capella's sweet strawberry so what i was trying to do with this particular batch is get like the most basic generic strawberry peanut butter blend right capella sweet strawberry with flavor art strawberry is a common strawberry blend here i wanted to add that with the most common peanut butter which is the dx peanut butter and what makes sense about this particular batch is that you know commercial companies they want reliability they want flavor houses that are going to always be in stock that have a really good distribution network that are just always reliable and also have good prices so that's why you always want to kind of look at the main flavoring companies when you're going with your batching or your recipe development now here in batching we want like a wide spectrum so we can kind of pick and choose where to go and really refine down the recipe and that's the first batch now the second batch we have one-on-ones strawberry jam chem nevadex strawberry and we also have tfa peanut butter the nandy version just regular tfa peanut butter and in this particular instance i'm utilizing two sort of left-field strawberries right one-on-one strawberry jam you don't really see it in many recipes because it's not the most popular strawberry but it does have like a jammy deep strawberry flavor so i kind of want to see if it's close to anything that is in the original and the same kind of goes with the chemnovatic it's kind of got a stickier jammier flavor though it is brighter than the one on one strawberry jam and then the tfa peanut butter uh mainly because it's just like the standard peanut butter so it would either be that or the tfa dx peanut butter in this case i just wanted to choose the different peanut butter the difference between the two is the dx version is a little bit thinner but it's still just as textured it's still just as flavorful and the reason you choose dx over the over the non-dx is that it lasts a little bit longer and then our last batch here we have wonder flavors strawberry baked and we also have flavora peanut butter yes flavor peanut butter which is a little bit more of a natural peanut butter and just a little bit more uh has kind of like an earthier note to it so i want to say when you're going about your batching you're probably going to do many more batches than this i'm just doing three just for the sake of the video but you would probably do along the lines of like i don't know a thousand two thousand batches like this is a long arduous process this is the most difficult aspect right once you have a defining characteristic translating that into flavorings is very very tough and that's where it's going to take a really long time so we have the more sort of mainstream strawberry peanut butter blend we have one with a few different strawberries and then the other one we kind of have one completely left field right so we're covering that spectrum all right so let's get mixing here let's do our mixing we have dx peanut butter at four percent and remember this is mainly to give it a little bit more longevity as opposed to the original tfa peanut butter which is arguably better in flavor but not necessarily in vapor experience and then that simple strawberry base blend that we have where juicy strawberry at two percent um which is gonna help give it some brightness and then we have capela's sweet strawberry here at four percent to just fill out the rest of the profile the rest of that strawberry easily one of my favorite strawberries to use i i always have like six of these little 30 mils now when you're doing batching and you're doing testing i always get asked should i add super sweet i think you should because it's going to just if you're going to put it in your final recipe well then you might as well put it in your tester so you can understand how the sweetener or the sucralose reacts with your recipe and with your bases especially with your defining characteristic which is what you want to be really accurate right now someone also asks i always get this should i add nicotine to my final or to my testing batches and i would say yes to that as well mainly because without it there is a slight difference in the way that the vapor feels you know it's not necessarily the flavor that gets affected but you'll notice a pretty big difference in saturation and vape experience without even one percent which is what i use in my testing it's what i use here now something also to keep into consideration is steeping right so when you're steeping your batches you want to make sure you're keeping note of that sometimes what i'll do is i'll make a bunch of batches and i'll forget to write down the date that i mix them at so when i try them later i'm like oh man how many days have it has it steeped because sometimes that steeping does matter should you always steep your batches you know it really depends on the profile with custards and tobaccos probably you know when you're going for your defining characteristics but with other fruit blends or if you're more of an experienced mixer and you can tell how a steep is going or you can tell how a profile is going you probably don't really need to steep it that long now we have our second batch here which is tfa peanut butter at five percent and this is um going to really give us all the peanut butter flavor we need you really kind of want to push your peanut butters a little higher especially tfa peanut butter mainly because it does fade a little bit again that's why i was using the dx the other one with this one we're going to go five percent because it might fade over time the chemist strawberry here at four percent so it's a higher percentage um base here and um this is a newer flavoring right this is not a flavoring that you're gonna see in a lot of recipes but that's why it's good to batch it you wanna know where it's at you want to know me hey maybe they did maybe they had some sort of secret contract or something you know we have our strawberry jam at two percent which gives us a little bit of that sticky strawberry flavor and now we have our last batch here which utilizes flavor peanut butter at two percent which i don't necessarily think it's gonna be close but again you want you want to batch you want to cover all your bases just in case maybe something pops up something special or something uh unique and that's kind of where you're going to find that defining characteristic you just never know you also want to know how far off you are you know you want to know how how far off is this batch maybe we'll you know take something uh from it and here we have the strawberry baked at four percent also try to get your percentages spot on you know um try not to be a little over or a little under you really want to this is the most important part so you really want to uh to maintain a lot of accuracy and don't trying to rush through it like i'm doing here all right we have all three of our batches mixed up and before we start to test them let's just go back to our desktop here and let's just make notes right let's just make sure we put down what type of notes we need okay we're going to go down to our recipe notes we have to make the date here right so november 19th 2020 and then we're going to put whatever it is our notes are for the first batch maybe you didn't have tfa dx peanut butter and you used a different one that was something that i don't know you didn't expect to be in there it's just good to know like writing tfa dxpb was not yet available but could be useful stuff like that you know just mark everything down stay organized make sure you're dating everything make sure you're just being completely uh detailed with all of your processes with all of your tasting notes and with just the the entire thing you know it's only going to help you and what's great is that after years and years of your mixing you're gonna have this library of notes and library of experiences and just just a gigantic encyclopedia of mixing knowledge that you can constantly go back and reference to and you don't have to keep that all mentally all right here we go we're going to do our testing i do want to make a note uh it's a sort of you know do as i say not as i do type thing but when you're going about your batching it's a good idea to swap your cotton out you don't want to really keep the same cotton when you're testing between flavors sometimes you do though sometimes you do but for the most part you might want to have three different builds or be ready to to wick a few times because sometimes those subtle differences start to blend and it's really hard to tell what recipe is giving you what um but again in this case uh do as i say not as i do i'm just you know trying to speed this up for the sake of the video so here's our first batch to me this is already pretty much right on the mark of what the original tastes like which is a good start right because that's going to allow us to understand oh [ __ ] we're on the right path we are on the right path we've made the correct decision in identifying the defining characteristic and now all of it is a matter of refinement and balance and making sure we get the right ingredients to do the job and we hit the right percentages so in terms of the first batch with the sweet strawberry and the uh flavor art strawberry we're pretty dang close already like it's pretty nice already now it's always a good idea to to always get a little reference so going back to the original and just testing the original against your batches so there's something a little bit deeper about the original something a little bit more saturated less bright it's just kind of a little bit lower on the palette so let's go and let's test the third batch which is the flavor peanut butter with wonder flavor strawberry here strawberry baked and let's just see where this one falls in line and we'll see how close or how far away we are with this specific blend and this one is just too deep right it's bringing it too far down the peanut butter is a little too prominent the strawberry is just a little too deep and not quite as sticky and sweet and bright as it is in the original so we've kind of went too far on the other end of the spectrum now we're gonna have to pull ourselves back and go towards the more of the center now we're gonna try our second batch here and our second batch in my opinion is the closest one i'd say it's between the first and second batch where the the original profile sort of resides and what that means to me is that all we really need to do is figure out the rest of the recipe the rest of the accents and try to just enhance what that defining characteristic is to push it towards whatever is uh is giving this the flavor that it's giving it we figured it out right we've got our defining characteristic we've did our batches we've landed on uh kind of where we need to go and what we need to kind of do to get us to the promised land the next step is putting in the accents the next step is building out the full recipe and putting pretty much filling in the spots that are lacking from what the original is giving so hopefully this helped you out hopefully this helped you in your batching processes and remember that the batching process is the longest process this is what's going to take a really long time it's also going to take a lot of resources buying all the different ingredients that are available testing them pairing them all up is a very intensive process so just be ready for that but just know that this is where like that 70 to 80 of your is going to come from it's going to come from this specific part the rest of it you know that an extra 20 to 30 percent that's going to come from finalizing the recipes finalizing those percentages and finalizing those accents and that'll be the next step putting in the accents building the rest of the recipe out and the step after that will be finalizing it making sure everything is refined and that'll conclude the cloning series hopefully you enjoyed this video if you did please leave a like and also subscribe if you haven't and you want

original and it is a 100 milligrams full spectrum CBD that is the best thing to full spectrum yes now I was kind of skeptical this is off it's a 14 gram protein bar and if anyone's ever had protein it

smooth Jesus I'm gonna do not bad you're not you get a little bit of the protein taste but it tastes more like granola like it's hot it tastes like a granola bar I guess that's the honey in it and the nuts yeah it's not bad you know I'm eating the whole thing yeah you're gonna see how it feel you're taking a little bit of the CBD a little bit that's not not bad cuz everything the balance is really nice but you do take this even you know it's there but you're gonna have like a granola type kind of you know granola bar but are you good on you you get that protein in there but everything else is helping to you know keep that grittiness away you gonna see what happen so usually like sometimes some edible and stuff it would say have it then like give it a some minutes or hours to have to take effect you don't have any instructions on how long so we won't see him what's done 7:16 I'm gonna come back at 7:30 yo I've turned off the camera look what time it is I turned the camera is about to get up to go wash the dishes I was like oh wait a minute I think it's kicking in a little bit again okay I mean it has how much pieces they say yeah one square two squares for container okay so - so you can tie them I mean cuz it's yeah it's effective it's a it's a relaxation I'm feeling nice kind of it's a little buzz but it's good okay come to Papa edibles yeah it's like over my head if I thought CBD you know usually affects me this is really nice I'm glad that again it wasn't really protein eh tasting I made it it wasn't protein eh tasted and yes it tastes like a granola bar it taste this the chocolates dinner but you know it's a good bread this is the night this is a good product I was actually recommended and I was like the $20 the leg little girl all right shot I began to drink a pone and proper edibles we'll put the link down below check them out oh let's see it again for washing dishes and I'm out", "xxeBSEeb1u4": "[Music] of your dispensary today we are to you look at our second product from the folks over at dedicated medicated first we looked at their cinnamon sin toast crunch I think it's what they called it 100 milligrams today we're continuing on with their breakfast cereal line and we are looking at Applejack Applejack my guess is they're actually Apple Jacks and just like the dedicated medicated we looked at last time basically this is just a cereal bar I like a rice krispies treat but instead of rice krispies Apple Jacks if you watch our last video you know that I did not particularly think the dedicated medicated was a good investment it may mean I did not get high at all but again it was only four bucks but you know four dollars for nothing is still four hours for nothing so uh you know precedent suggests that this is not going to be a good animal okay it smells like Apple Jacks and marshmallow fluff as one might expect comes apart nicely well unfortunately Applejack's are just not a good serial to have as the rice krispies treat or a whatever Krispie Treat in kind of marshmallow conglomerate they're just too chewy or too crispy this doesn't really work choo-choo any amount they're too big it doesn't even have the benefit of tasting good butter but it might so give me high right maybe right it's not terrible Asian it's just why would you want to Rice Krispies dream with Apple Jacks they're just rice krispies but it's all rice krispie treats it's I care what it means J tempered and marshmallow that being said if you ever seen weeks before what we're going to do is I'm going to come back to you guys in two hours don't you know our feeling is it it's not really about how it tastes right it's how about it's about how it makes you feel that's the most important part and then with that I will see you guys in two hours to let you know thanks for watching [Music] welcome back to weeks guys [Music] terrible terrible terrible another day and then it allows the edible dedicated medicated Applejack mmm no thanks no thank you it doesn't taste good don't feel anything total Pass hard hard pass and a stinky stinky wet part of a product if you see the dedicated medicated at and dispensary near you just pass just passed go for something else spend a little bit more money and actually get to feel hi and with that guys thank you for watching this review and we'll catch you next week thanks hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "Jsr_LEOd_xI": "everyone and welcome to weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are talking about dedicated to medicated and I realize I've been saying that wrong the entire time I just now noticed the two there and the dedicated it's not just dedicated medicated it's dedicated to medicated which I'm not sure why it's not dedicated to medication but whatever I know that that doesn't quite run anyways here's what we're looking at today the dedicated to medicated Reese's treat 100 milligram edible here so we've got a little warning on it at the bottom we've got our ingredients which is curious because if you look there it says ingredients marshmallow cannabis oil dry cereal and ellipsis what does that ellipsis who knows well anyways guys if you've never seen wheats before the way this works is I'm gonna eat this open up this bad boy eat a good bit of it here in front of you guys let you know how it's tasting let you know how it smells all that good stuff and then I'm gonna come back in two hours to let you know how the edible is actually hitting so without any further ado I'm gonna open up this packaging munch give it a little munch here see how it's tasting and I'm gonna finish it off off camera you come back to you guys in just a little bit okay so we're not further ado let's do this okay hi guys sorry I'm using a gimbal right now that's making this very difficult alright we are back with our Reese's treat Reese's treat here a hundred milligram bar cereal bar let's give it a taste first give it a smell smells exactly like Reese's treat cereal Reese's puffs of cereal mixed with the marshmallow fluff how does it taste like a Castelli version of what you're measuring um the Reese's puffs cereal is not a good medium for crispy treat they're too puffy did you dick they're too hard to chew so okay I mean I like rice krispies treats and I like recent puff cereal but it's just not the best of those combinations so I'm gonna finish this off here because it's gonna take me a while to this whole hung down and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how we're feeling if it's anything like many of the other dedicated to medicated it's gonna be a little disappointing I've reviewed a couple of their products in the past and film them all little underwhelming but I'm hoping to be surprised with that guys thanks for watching I'll see you in two hours bye [Music] hello everyone welcome back two weeks it's been two hours here since I had the dedicated to medicated racy Street and this makes the triumvirate three four three dedicated medicated that are not so good this hundred milligram editable excuse me has no effect whatsoever don't feel anything or I don't think I feel anything total total bust but as they only cost four dollars it's hard to be super super disappointed but you'd hope even for four dollars that you'd feel something anything but that that makes the third dedicated to medicated in a row that has been more than disappointing so I'll review one or two more see if they get any better and if not that's gonna be that's gonna be it it's gonna be curtains with a dedicated to medicated line for me you'd think three strikes and you're out but I'm a little bit more persistent than that okay guys and with that that'll be it for this episode of wheats we will check you out on the next review thank you so much for watching see you next time hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "llW6jtgvzCw": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] my name is Willie Christie and I'm here today at the cannery West in Los Angeles today we're talking about edibles and specifically cookies they make all types of cookies there's red velvet cookies vegan oatmeal cookies peanut butter cookies chocolate chip double chocolate chip triple chocolate chip fudge dipped cookies any cookie you can add weed to it so first up we've got the classic chocolate chip cookie this one's from big Pete's based out of Santa Cruz awesome company they do a 10 milligram per cookie six pack so you're actually getting 60 milligrams in this which just makes it a little more affordable instead of drop in 25 bucks one thing I like about these guys it is full spectrum oil so there will be a slight cannabis taste and that full spectrum effect is better than distillate in my opinion that trade CBD and all that trace other cannabinoids is just gonna increase the overall effect next on the list canna Co cinnamon sugar cookies classic twist on the chocolate chip you've got cinnamon and sugar no chocolate chips so if you're allergic to chocolate or you don't like chocolate or you're just trying to mix it up cinnamon sugar is a good option Kanako's been around for a while they do a lot of paleo vegan gluten-free friendly edibles as well so this package is your hundred milligram package 10 cookies 10 milligrams apiece that's about a dose to two doses for your average consumer keep in mind that these are baked goods they have butter sugar eggs you know it's a pretty natural recipe so either store them properly fridge freezer or have a couple friends to share it with so this is the vegan oatmeal cookie from Korova it's a good vegan option for those of you that are used to only getting butter here's something for the vegans out there one thing I like about Korova they've been putting this guy on the back of their package for years this is the warning don't be this guy don't eat the whole package if you don't know just as a rule of thumb know your dose take your dose and wait up to two hours to feel the effects and then once you've eaten it it's gonna be a total experience of four to six hours of or being high next up we've got the CBD THC one-to-one vanilla bean cookie from Korova this is a nice option for edibles because we haven't really seen CBD and edibles up until the last couple years this is something to try if you've been wanting to try THC and CBD if you get too paranoid with THC having some CBD with that edible will help moderate any anxiety that you get from THC also the one-to-one ratio is the most potent ratio for killing pain so if you have some type of you know body pain or chronic pain a CBD and THC cookie or edible is going to do a lot more than just the CBD edible or just the THC edible finally we've got dr. norms CBD vegan peanut butter chocolate chip cookies so this is non psychoactive or rather non-intoxicating you can eat the whole bag and you you're not going to get high but what you're gonna notice is just a little bit of chillness anti-anxiety and certainly some anti e inflammation if you have any swelling or soreness or arthritis chances are the CBD is gonna help out with that without getting in your head [Music] so those are some of the cookies that we have here at the cannery West don't forget 10 milligrams of THC and a cookie is the same as 10 milligrams of THC in a gummy it just comes down to your preference or your dietary needs you know if you need sugar free this or vegan gluten-free that it's gonna be the same find your dose of THC and you can explore any type of different edible for you [Music]", "Xgy3kqcjkRM": "hey what's up this is Don kill some time good fitness helping all of you with your Fitness related queries so again I will arrange the size the same which I always do for people who argue what I do why this channel is I try to answer all your queries which could be regarding health fitness diet supplementation anything and everything around Fitness so this particular video blog is not a Q&A session this is something that I want to talk about actually I want you to talk about this you know last week but since I was getting too many questions from each one of you so I thought you know let me just kind of you know push it for a week after that so here I am so what exactly am I going to talk about I want to talk about you get it right did you see do you see peanut butter now I'm a Winstead and I'm sure that a lot many vegetarians out there you know who are struggling to find the right protein sources like I can understand you know non least Aryans have it easy you know they can power play you know you know get the protein sources from chicken fish meat you know leave meat anything and everything but for people like us you know who are vegetarians for us to actually get anything which has protein in it is seldom difficult so proof but but peanut butter something that I found out and I've been using it for over years now recently only about couple of years back when it started you know easily available in India now there is no place to struggle get the right one and so I remember people used to be in the states I used to tell them can you please you know get me a Skippy peanut butter you know you know half a liter or what you know a 1 liter box a jar the Shack is probably when I'm lucky now with with stores like llama are so supermarket you know it's easily available so what I want to talk about peanut butter if it's a vegetarian delight - it has great benefits so what are those benefits and why should you be taking it let me just tell you let me just share with you madam so Pilbara you know probably this is the only butter which I can say is healthy you know when I say healthy you know unlike your other butter along Dogbot and I know one name any brands here they have a lot of trans fat and you know which may not be good for your heart but we know scientifically has been shown to kind of help you with your heart conditions as well so it's actually good food this is one of those butter who's actually very good for your heart and fair overall pudding and I said it's an excellent source of protein you know if you if I were to see this I use Sundrop peanut butter because that is very very cost effective so about 460 grams the jar you get for about 250 rupees which is not a bad deal I like it creamy ironic crunchy if I really want to have crunchy I would probably just take some Kleenex with it so 2 tablespoon of this gives you about 7 to 8 grams of protein which i think is it's a pretty decent amount and you know you really don't can I say 7 to 8 grams you really don't have to caution this a I need to meet my protein requirement so let me take you know 6 to 8 tablespoons know you typically take about 2 to maximum 3 tablespoon in it take when to take it and also tell you that probably before your workout so I have a different slide for that so it's a great source of protein too it's loaded with potassium now if you were to see the kind of diet that are not talking about the directors here I'm talking about people regular people you know who eat pretty much anything that comes their way that food is pretty heavy on sodium you know obviously you don't expect you to eat foods without salt or sodium so what period part does is it it it has it's loaded with potassium and potassium and you know it go a long way towards conflict the dangers of sodium it balances or it kind of calmed is it so it's pretty good for you so that water retention that you may develop through sodium potassium kind of balances balance is eight so if you are struggling with water retention here you may want up your production through peanut butter but just just check adding the label that it doesn't have too much of sodium here about two tablespoons should not have more than 70 to 100 mg of sodium not more than so you may want to try that if you're struggling with water retention 3 as I said it's healthy fat it has more unsaturated fat than saturated fat a healthy body needs a good supply and defend and like olive oil avocado pear and butter is a friendly fat food you know I have said this in the past and I will say this again that you should not be afraid to eat fat if your goal is to lose fat on the contrary you should be having more fat to lose fat because I understand it has about lying and then grab a bottle hurry but if you were to look at it you really need that fat it because what fat does is it makes you feel fuller so you know those extra cravings that you may have you know for other food it kind of minimizes it so it makes you feel fuller so that's why it's always important to have good healthy fat in your diet because fat is very very despair it's very very important in a core component for your distortion levels too especially if you are if you remain it really helps you with your sex drive with your growth everything so you cannot eliminate fat from your diet so you've got to be fat and a fat like peanut butter is amazing it can do wonders believe it or not oh this this butter helps you with fat loss because of it zero protein in fiber content and when you eat peanut butter you actually feel full for longer it's nothing that you know when you take a one or two tablespoon of peanut butter makes you feel fuller probably for a couple of hours so you don't call in other things that aren't there so and I'm I'll tell you something that that I experienced after taking peanut butter so when I follow a very strict diet I ensure that I do take peanut butter because it helps you the bowel movement to don't usually when you're not eating much you know your fibers are missing you have problems with your stomach so peanut butter can actually help you come to that so if you're a dieter you know who's been falling over extrait that add a tablespoon or two in your diet and you see you know your bowel movement will be amazing and your stomach will just behave absolutely fine a must for people who are also into dieting so it will not derail you from your meal plan so when to take it the best time to take the inverter is pre-workout you know it because it's its fact person you can you know I've seen an hour a lot of people take some bread you know brown bread you know Maynard n is a brown bread thick multi blend multigrain bread from the bakery do not buy the regular bread because you know I've seen that you know that ground bread is nothing but a white bread they just caramelize it to make it look Brown so don't follow that she'll you've got to have a multigrain bread that's the best one you can have if you if you think you're having a regular bread which is brown nature trust me it's meta avoid it go to a bakery tell the guy that I want multigrain bread made with gotta have that plus you can have a one or two slices of bread with some peanut butter on top and cluster also sugar-free jellies a petticoat like like a jam that you know the PVG is what it's called in North America peanut butter jelly it's a great combination before working out you can have that you can also have it in your lunch you know probably somewhere on to do 30 depending on your goal what your fitness goal is and what exactly you try to achieve so these are some of the things and you can actually incorporate you know peanut butter is one into your diet plan if you want stiffen it and if you're looking at meeting your daily protein requirement as a vegetarian to so it has helped me I hope it helps you too for anyone of you who have any questions for me feel free to reach out and I'm happy to answer those questions for you so you can reach out either on youtube channel or are there on my Facebook page and I'll be happy to answer it by a video blog of mine and hey by the way I never said this vinegars it is again if you really like my content I want to just subscribe and like you know it's it's kind of encouraging you know once in a while I'm going to push it because I really don't do that so if you like it do that so till we meet again see you", "xtj3v5cex8w": "[Music] and we won't [Music] hey

you", "M67_89eFmyE": "welcome back to steam room everyone where we take the guesswork out of DIY and today we're going to mix peanut butter custard milkshake but first I think I'm going to start a new ceremony and that's a ceremonial vape to begin the video I am vaping on some months old huckleberry cheesecake and this recipe is almost also up on the channel if you guys want to go check it out it is fan-fucking-tastic so anyway before we get started with the peanut butter custard milkshake I kind of wanted to cover another subject yesterday I put up a vlog announcing the news the big news that we have another child on the way which is weird because we had marina had that's the keyword had marina the doctor said it mysteriously disappeared no idea how that happened but I do apologize for the people that did not like it um I just kind of wanted to share people share with people the news that we had going on in our life you have to understand that YouTube not only is vaping but YouTube is also a hobby of mine and I enjoy doing this in fact if I didn't enjoy doing this I probably would not be doing this you get what I'm saying so it's kind of a give and take I know vlogs are not for everyone believe me I know I've seen a few that kind of made me grimace and wonder why am i subscribed to this channel but I felt it was worthy of you know sharing with you guys so for those of you that congratulated me thank you and now let's just move on to the mixing I just wanted to put that in there real quick I'll bury cheesecake is cloud on two men you haven't mixed it up check it out unique so today we're going to start with capella custard I know everyone's like man this is in everything seriously if you don't have this flavor and it's not in your arsenal I feel bad for you so that's what this is vanilla custard is very rich I've had flavor arts custard but to me it's got kind of a citrus sort of a texture to or a citrus back note and for me it doesn't really mix well with a lot of desserts flavor arts custard works great for Lemon vapes and things of that nature in fact the lemon sugar cookie that I posted a while back probably could benefit might new or revised the version but for now let's start with vanilla custard we have point seven five milliliters next up we've got flavor art caramel and this is going to add a little bit more texture or complexity to our peanut butter and we've got flavor our caramel at point two two you're going to need a 1 milliliter syringe to do this next up we've got creme fraiche this is also another flavor that you have to have in your DIY arsenal and for creme fraiche we have 0.45 this this flavor can actually work great for ice creams for parfaits for anything really that you need to add a creamy note to this is one of the kings if you mix this with Vienna cream or bavarian cream really doesn't matter it's gonna add a lot of mouth feel and texture to your vape flavor our meringue is next absolutely love this flavor we're going to be mixing this one at where is this one point two two milliliters you've ever mixed any kind of cereal vape you know what this flavor does for your recipe next we've got colada and this is going to be optional this is the one flavour in here that is going to be optional this is only to add like a cool a cooling effect if you don't like menthol get cool on it because it doesn't give you a menthol taste it just gives you a cool thing but you really need to watch your levels on this one so this is going to be at a low point one you're looking at merely drops now we've got TFA bavarian cream and bavarian cream is going to be at point three and this is from TFA there we have it point three next we've got TFA's cheesecake Graham crust this is another one that you just buy the big bottle name just buy the big bottle you're not going to regret it I regret closing the top so tight yeah we had some technical difficulties with this bottle what if you guys ever ran into that problem but some of these damn bottles do not open huh now that we're back on track we have cheesecake Graham crust from TFA TFA fix your damn bottle tops man and this is going to be mixed at hmm this is going to be mixed at point three milliliters not closing that one all the way this time the next one is going to be one of my favorite flavors and a lot of people don't use this and I don't know why because it actually creates a great multi milkshake and this is TFA's malted milk I do recommend picking this up it's very handy be careful with the percentages though it is deliverable just destroy everything else it will take over the entire mix so we're going to using this at 0.45 milliliters letting out my syringe here so we're going to be using this at 0.45 milliliters for that purpose we don't want it to take over the mix but we do want that multitexture 0.45 milliliters I find it does just add now pretty much every company on the market that sells concentrates have a peanut butter you've got flora you've got capella you've got TFA or TPA depending on how you look at it but they're both the same company pretty much every company out there has a peanut butter now my my opinion on this is pretty much if you're a jiffy fan or a Skippy fan or whatever it may be this is a sweeter kind of vape to me it's not as dry I've had florals I've had Capello's both to me seem a little bit more peanut II and they don't have as much sweetness to it TFA's has a prominent brown sugar flavor it's kind of devoid on the vanilla which is why we're using vanilla custard and vanilla swirl which is about to come up next it kind of pulls out those complexities inside of this this peanut butter so at the percentage it's at right now I really find that it's kind of that it does what it needs to do in this recipe so TFA's peanut butter is going to be mixed at one point eight milliliters let's get the first milliliter out of there that may seem like a lot of peanut butter but to get the full complexity and to get the full effect of this peanut butter you're gonna want to mix it at a higher percentage so the last flavor in this mix is going to be vanilla swirl and this is going to pull those complexities out of TFA's peanut butter and just give it a more rounded kind of peanut butter texture or flavor so this is going to be at point three milliliters again this is for a 30 milliliter and that's it that's your mix all done I hope you guys enjoy I found that this is best in a ratio of like 25 75 25 percent PG 75 percent VG just because the VG kind of lends a little more sweetness to the mix and if you enjoy those savoury I hate that word savoury because it usually means bacon or some kind of food so let's not use that that's gonna this is going to be a rich dessert and I think you're really going to enjoy is it an all-day thing it is if you have a really sweet tooth it's not if you don't I'll put it down but it's a very delectable vape that you're going to enjoy so I think you should try it out oh yeah it's a very peanut buttery mix so I recommend about a week steep time for this juice because it's got custard in it it's got a couple of other savory type ingredients in here I mixed in at 75253 milligrams it's totally up to you what you like as far as a ratio goes if you're into that thicker heavier stuff then 80/20 is no problem here 75 25 is my sweet spot that's why I prefer it but if you want to tank it drop in to 70/30 and put your Nick in there you're gonna be fine you're going to really enjoy this it's a very peanut buttery vape the multi milkshake enos comes out about a week into it also you'll notice that the peanut butter kind of settles a little bit and the creams fluff up quite a bit but other than that the recipe is over stay tuned for butterscotch custard that's coming up soon I'm hoping in the next day or two and till then guys keep it cloudy let's do the ceremonial blow it cloudy outro I guess is what you would

peanut butter is right here it's a Scott PhD in it I got it from the world-famous can about cannabis cafe or whatever God's kind of sweet on me so I get really good deals anyway I'm going to get I'm going to eat this and it's gonna be good", "95kOYN2LZEQ": "hey guys Julia here today we have a taste testing video I want to be tasting different nut butters stores these days they got lots of different nut butters and and I've not really had any of them I mean I've had a lot of nut butter in my life it's a little different mostly peanut variety digging myself in a deep hole here just try to get out uh how were you thinking I mean it is but that's I'm sorry that's not what I'm talking about a lot of these nut butters I've never had before and I'm gonna be tasting them to see what they taste like which one I think is the best and which you might like to try it all right nut butter number one good old-fashioned craft now this is just a regular smooth peanut butter all full of sugar and salt I've just got them on clean pieces of white bread that's gonna be my control hmm gosh just brush like a baby's bottom that's not that analogy so this has ninety calories per tablespoon we're looking at one gram of sugar three grams of protein all in all I mean yeah it's peanut butter it's not the healthiest thing in the world for you it especially the kind that's not natural but hey it's also not the worst thing the world for you tastes great love that taste can't replicate it in my mind but today we're gonna see if they can so let's move on to the next one so this is an almond butter I picked up it says raw it's one of this like fancy brands in a real glass jar so we're looking at per two tablespoons a hundred and ninety calories so that is ten calories more than the peanut butter which is not that significant it's pretty comparable I'd say how's it taste though smells just like almonds I'm surprised okay this one's a little more stick to your teeth I think that has to do with that oh natural yeah very almond d very almond forward stodgy a little it's a hard comparison I'll be honest because they had one had sugar and I like sugar but I think that this one offers like kind of a depth of flavor I think they're interchangeable to be honest okay I had this one big jar what am I made of money this is cashew 180 calories we've got 15 grams of fat we got no grams of sugar really all comparable and I imagine the ingredients are dry roasted cashews and sunflower oil may contain cashews no oh no it says contains cashews may contain peanuts oh whoa oh now we're cooking with gas this is fun oh this one's got a lot of flavor this is considerably less stodgy than the almond one much smoother still with like little pieces of actual cashew oh I like this flavor it's very deep it tastes it tastes like cashews and I really enjoy cashews this in like a quote-unquote PB&J sandwich would be spectacular one on ice cream for some reason peanut butter has been overdone I'm just gonna come out and say it I think it's old old news let's be let's be bringing in these new nut butters can't get enough nut butter that's my motto I have that dessert tattoo on my lower back I don't but wouldn't that be something special gosh I've got another big one god damn you guys these jars are not cheap I think it was like 12 or $13 per free gets sack this is sunflower seed butter dry roasted Canadian sunflower seeds sunflower oil in the ingredients 170 calories for two tablespoons it's all roughly the same at the end of the day it's all the same this is a little darker in color a little more of a kind of a baby poop Brown as opposed to the kind of lighter cat poop brown mmm-hmm I forgot what sunflower seeds tasted like for a sec and then and then it hit me and then I was like I don't I don't know that I like that oh I bought a big jar awesome it's gonna be so great to have around the house I don't like this one I'm gonna flat out say it they must have a machine that like cracks all those sunflower seeds open cuz if they had some guy just like like putting a minute smells and spitting them out I mean that that's a full-time job that's a big gig that guy's got alright the next one is a pumpkin seed butter I am really really excited about this one because one of my favorite things in the autumn to do is to empty out of pumpkin roast the seeds and just Monge like putting a little bit of seasoning salt on them so good so this one's a darkest in color and that makes sense because pumpkin seeds are kind of green yeah I guess we just go for it Wow oh well if you like pumpkin seeds this is that but on steroids these seed ones have this like bitterness to them this like overwhelming like just like cloying feeling in your mouth and then that like bitter seed taste it's too much I didn't ask for that much you know I don't want that I just wanted a little bit and you hate me with a freaking uppercut your pumpkin let's not let's not get our spirits down though cuz the last one I'm most excited for they're calling this one wow it is wow butter comes like a standard plastic container get this peanut and tree nut free Noster total bonus gluten free there shouldn't be including in there in the first place whole toasted soy press soy oil cane sugar and modified palm oil sea salt we've got hundred calories per tablespoon very similar to grams of sugars this one does have a little shaky shaking it yeah I'm pumped so then this is a soybean well now that that's an interesting thing happening it does taste so ye but not not in an overwhelming way I think this one's I think this one's nice you had a really strong flavor of soy come through but then there's like a sweetness under it and it's nice and creamy I think I like this oh that's a nice little snap I'm gonna eat that whole thing Wow Wow that's what it's called all right so what do I think my frontrunner my number-one is cashew then it goes to the peanut butter then it goes to the Wow then almond dense pumpkin then sunflower that is the order that I am choosing what do you guys think do you normally have these different kinds of nut butters is there one that I missed that I should try for next time thank you for watching I think this was a wonderful nut butter experiment I enjoy nut butters I hope you enjoyed that butters as much as I do put them in your mouth get them in your mouth have a safe flight home everybody", "zcGyJlpRJQ0": "what's up YouTube your Boise man back at it with another video and I'm just just a follow-up on the CBD froggy let's see CBD frog give it a

hundred milligrams of THC it's just a different flavor than the other ones but I have to try it out there it is a whole bunch of little squares all stuck together Wow for for not a whole bunch each 25 milligrams of THC I'm tasting THC um I'm not tasting green apple at all there a little bit of sweetness but not not green apple I would say just like taste like maybe like a corn syrup or Oh like little sugary you may have some people I would say just ignore it so well this has been here because it takes usually like an hourish you start to feel it but I have another right and I'm gonna smoke now wait for this to kick it by the time this takes in this will be all do you like doing its job I should have maybe broke these up because it's like cuz they're in the way like a look right there anyways let's get this lit [Music] still under under the tree where nobody could see so I'm gonna smoke this but time I'm done this those will be dissolved go jump in the shower because I probably won't want to feel like taking one later and come back and let you guys know what how I'm feeling now so with a package again you get them at can abysmal what we back up this kicks in probably not out here but I'll be back okay so it's been an hour and a half and as you can tell these have kicked in my eyes feel so heavy and like I just feel really relaxed and you don't feel like doing too much like you know thank God I did everything earlier cuz I would not do anything like that on this I your whole body like it just makes you feel relaxed I like this is like an oh my [ __ ] like that's my rating of it it's it's very good um yeah you get like a little bit thirsty but you also get like hungry so I got try them these are my favorite um like for a licorice I like I like this one I don't like the one that it's all twisty it's like a little bit tough and it has like a weird taste to it I don't really like that one I like the nibs or the you know how you can get the licorice that's all Brown you could probably watch a movie on this um more like hmm more like like those action suspense drama ones my son is bright um yeah it's uh just like the Owens is good I didn't taste the green apple though but it doesn't matter because it feels good like you feel good you don't feel like doing much but you feel good like read watching TV movie not cleaning or laundry or anything like that this is the stuff that makes you feel like you know after you shower and like you know everything's done so and you're you feel like like sleep is gonna be really good but it even feels better when you have like wash sheets and stuff on the bed well I checked that this is what that makes you feel like like we wanted to get into a nice clean bed and just ah watch TV here just lay there and think I wouldn't recommend reading a book because I don't think you would get very far well that Sun is bright yes good eye you know what Lola's hard candies from campus know they're really good like they like I've tried other ones from a different dispensary and they weren't good at all the ones I can abysmal there uh mm-hmm you just go there and get them like it's it's good stuff [Music] and by like can I do that Sun is really bothering it's really bothering me down d'arnot all okay there I don't know that'll have to do um was I talking about them mmm I don't remember well with the can of the Canada's no like they never let me down they just a face cell is it was very good so you should go there I don't understand why like people are so against feeling like this you don't there's nothing wrong with what you're feeling you don't you know what's going on and stuff I mean I don't understand that so like what you know think it's Saturday why I like smoke a joint and do edibles like what's wrong with that it gives you like you know time just to relax that's what I think it just you know that's what it does for me and if you didn't want to do the animals and you know there's the other there's other ways of doing it but I feel really well like I feel like you want to get comfy I'm in the chair with the I watched all the the what do they called the throw blankets today and like we have quite a bit so but those are like there's always soft and stuffed you know and you hang them outside and they have that outside smell and I just I think that's what I will be doing after is getting one in or two of those blankets and just watching something TV or something and covering up with the pie cake I'm just just chilling I should have brought something else other than these nibs I can't get the munchies do I feel paranoid yes yes as in I wouldn't answer the door at all continue doing whatever it was I was doing stuff feels really good good like [Music] I don't know how to describe it I really don't I feel like um I'm just really good like um not like good like yeah I'm not be but good like as in relaxed and I guess at peace like just really like you're enjoying stuff like you have time to enjoy stuff that's how I felt also any aches and pains and it helps with that it helps Brooke like everything I can can't think of a thing that it wouldn't help with subjects we were sad you'd be happy after if you were when I was a kid okay so the way I'm sitting on the bed I'm one legs just dangling down and I'm ever like when I was a kid I used to always think there was something something under the bed that hurt you know I grabbed my knees my feet probably for my ankle I remember him I remember like I go I got so bad that at my parents house the hallway and off to the right there was the bathroom and then there was my room at the very end of the hallway was a closet and on the left side was my parents room and my brother's room and everybody it you know had to go get a drink of water or something and my bed was never close to the light switch so I don't have to shop the light go like at the beginning of the hallway run as fast as I can and just get like step into my room and you'll leap across onto my bed because I thought there was something under that was gonna grab my feet and then I get that I you know it's probably like I know it's nothing but I still get that feeling sometimes and it happened while I was doing that so that's why I told you I don't remember I was talking about before this and it's probably not gonna come back to me either but hate when that happens [Music] that's good I would like I highly recommend it it was like I took it I 530 so he's hired at 5:30 I kicked in like seven ish maybe a little bit after not much and it's oh I can't hang on okay and it's going on 7:30 right now so like you're gonna feel like this for a while so which is good that's what you want you don't want to like this just to go away cuz I would kind of sock right now it just uh makes you enjoy stuff like TV I'm getting comfy and you can get come because you're not a lot you're not even like pain if you have pain my eyelids feel so bad over my eyelids feel so heavy like they just you just feel my eyelids feel tired and even when they look tired right I think that they look happy you're loving they're loving it my eyes are loving this if they're tired and they're just I think people did this like if you really look at yourself I think you can maybe like and some people see what kind of person they are when they were work to be on this maybe not though I don't know I'm just I'm just thinking of stuff and say you know to you guys [Music] I'm not very comfortable sitting the way I am but I don't want to put my foot down there yet so the marinated hard candies cannabis bomb well worth it highly recommend it I didn't taste green apple but um you taste like I tasted the THC and like something a little bit sweet here and there really just makes you feel relaxed and a little bit thirsty and like a little bit hungry but not bad like you don't know you're not gonna like eat meat eat just like something here and there my rating of this is an oh my [ __ ] um you just feel like relax and you don't feel like um doing anything like like physically you don't feel like doing anything watching a movie yeah things like that yep that's what you feel like doing um and your eyelids may feel okay I can't sit like that any longer your eyelids may feel heavy but it does not matter cuz you still feel happy and I think that's everything I don't I don't know what else to talk about so that's it that's all bye", "oGCLl9dSxZw": "review time probably the one i'm most excited about so far we're gonna get right into it here quest peanut butter cups couple notes first and foremost reese's peanut butter cups are my absolute favorite candy in the world hands down they hold the number one spot in my heart i absolutely love them side note people around here in michigan say reese's if you say reese's you gotta stop many years ago quest had peanut butter cups they were quest cravings peanut butter cups i don't remember the exact macros of them i think they were higher in protein but they were pretty dry and kind of chalky so they left your mouth really like lip smacky after you ate them they were pretty different from reese's i happen to like them they got really mixed reviews and i know a lot of people didn't like them i've heard these are completely reformulated and based on a lot of the reviews they taste identical the reese's i don't believe it so we're gonna put that to the test what i did is i bought reese's dark chocolate cups so i've never had reese's dark i love regular reese's and to make this fair since these are definitely going to be a little less sweet since they used a dark chocolate and they're sugar free i think this is going to be the closest comparison and what i'm going to do is a complete blind taste test and see if i can tell the difference now i think it's going to be a bit of a fair shake because i've not had the dark reese's before so i don't know exactly what it's going to taste like but based on a lot of reviews i've been hearing and reading these supposedly taste identical to reese's somebody said that they taste better than the reese's pumpkins that's crazy everyone knows that reese's shapes are the best and if you know you know reese's eggs the best don't know why that shape is the best but it goes eggs trees then pumpkins obviously anyway we're gonna do a blind taste test here because i'm curious how they actually stack up west is 190 calories for both cups 15 grams of fat 13 carb and then it's four grams fiber less than one gram sugar so they use a sugar substitute erythritol eight grams of that and then 11 grams protein total versus 100 calories 13 grams fat 21 carb 2 fiber 18 sugar and 4 grams protein so as a protein snack it's not a ton of protein compared to regular reese's so depending on how it tastes i don't know if i would rather have these than regular but we're going to find out so the first time around when quest made peanut butter cups they were not the greatest shape and they were in this weird plastic container so these actually now look like reese's and they are in the same wrapper so right off the bat looking at it that looks like a reese's and here is a regular reese's so the thing i can tell immediately is that the reese's is a little bit softer than the quest size-wise i mean those are very very similar so since these feel a little bit different i don't want to be able to tell which is which and actually since one's a little softer let's take it one step further there you go i smushed them so that way i can just dump it right into my mouth and i won't be able to feel what the difference is genius i'm gonna blindfold myself with an inside out dirty shirt all right that is very tight mix and mix and mix in mix in so here is one of them i have no idea if you can see the letter the dark chocolate's strong the peanut butter taste is not quite as strong but that's pretty good that has to be the quest cup i don't even know that it's going to be close if that's not the quest cup then i am going to be completely thrown here that one's reese's that's got to be reese's i will say they are shockingly similar tastes like reese's peanut butter so if that's not this is going to blow my mind all right so no surprise reese's is still identifiable but so this is the reese's and then you have the quest underneath so you can kind of see that it's a little bit on the dry side i feel like when you break it it leaves you with that thick layer of chocolate it's not a reese's it's not a exact replica of reese's there are a lot of reviews that say you can't taste the difference you can taste the difference but considering that there's no sugar in it extremely impressive everybody knows that reese's tastes better frozen so i did buy an extra set of quest cups threw them in the freezer now i'm curious they've been sitting out here for like two minutes they are frozen oh boy so when you compare it to the dark chocolate reese's the chocolate's actually pretty similar the major differences in the peanut butter it's really hard to replicate reese's peanut butter without sugar as evident by reese's having 18 grams of sugar versus quest having zero i would choose reese's over these definitely but for me sugar is not a concern if you want to eat low sugar if you're keto whatever the reason might be these are a phenomenal replacement for reese's for me personally i would choose the reese's but they are very close so taking that into account overall these are probably they're between a 7.5 and an 8 out of 10 honestly i think so if you had the old version these are significantly better they have improved them very much if you've never had it i mean it's close to a reese's if you were to break these up and put them on ice cream or mix them into a smoothie or something whatever you would use reese's toppings on you'd probably be hard-pressed to tell the difference when you're eating it straight up you can tell that there's a difference but i'm gonna go on the higher end of the scale i'm gonna go with an eight out of ten quest nailed it very impressed still love reese's but these are these are a good snack", "-jUFVycLaAg": "hello my name is Sam Felton I'm the director of the public health collaboration and welcome to the PhD virtual conference 2020 the coronavirus has changed all

Twitter Facebook and Instagram thanks for your support take care and stay safe [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] greetings from a lovely and sunny Hebden Bridge West Georgia today I'm talking about whether we can obtain our central nutrients from real food as Hippocrates said let food be thy medicine and let my medicine be thy food when I refer to real foods I'm talking about warming gradient foods that haven't been processed or fortified in any way so what is an essential nutrient well it's a nutrient in which an organism must obtain it from the environment or from food since we're unable to make it so there are essential fats essential proteins essential vitamins essential minerals and another substance called choline is also essential so where's carbohydrate wisent carbohydrate on this list well as one really good reason and that's because carbohydrate is not an essential nutrient if we don't eat carbohydrate we make it and we make it by a process called gluconeogenesis so for every gram of protein we eat it's possible to convert about half of that into glucose that means that if we eat 100 grams of protein we can make 56 grams of glucose around 10% fat can be converted into glucose so if we eat a hundred grams of fat we can make 10 grams of glucose so back in 2005 it was stated in the die with Dietary Reference Intakes but the lower limit of dietary carbohydrate compatible with Y is zero provided that we consume adequate amounts of protein and fat so here the process of gluconeogenesis where we can convert triglycerides which is fat and amino acids from protein interval polls now Professor Tim notes and his team have demonstrated that we've got the ability to convert or to make glucose at a rate of 6 grams to 25 grams per hour so over a 24-hour period we could if we needed to make 600 grams of glucose that's a very very high carbohydrate diet now unfortunately if people are very stressed or sleep-deprived or there's very high levels of insulin resistance then they might actually be making these high levels of glucose in the liver every day and that's not good if people wanted to control their weight however the good news is is that we can make lifestyle changes to reduce that happening so why am i funny thing to have the essential nutrients from real food well they advantage of food is that it also contains many of the compounds called phytochemicals that work in synergy with the essential nutrients to allow them to do the body processes also when we - nutrients in real food the nutrients together helped tell the hunger center in the brain that we're satisfied so it creates a feelings as I ate a feeling of fullness however sometimes supplements need to be used and that's when insufficient amounts are available through food such as vitamin D and also when times of increasing requirements such as for late in pregnancy and perhaps even returning see at the moment with korvac 19 so let's start with facts now flats there are essential nutrients in fats but not all fats are essential to eat fats are building blocks of fatty acids and so we have the fatty acids three fatty acids joined up with a gristle glycerol backbone the former triglyceride there's three types of fat saturated fatty acids mono and saturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids and the difference between these three is whether they have double bonds or not the fats or fatty acids are chains of carbons and saturated fats all the carbons have been fully saturated with hydrogen as notable bones in monounsaturated fats then there's one so mono is one bond extra-virgin olive oil is a fantastic example of a monounsaturated fatty acid there's one double bond which could be a weak spot that because the extra virgin olive oil contains polyphenols which is an antioxidant this allows the extra virgin olive oil to be very stable and less prone to oxidation then we've got the polyunsaturated fatty acids and these have got multiple two or more double bonds so they're more prone to oxidation now believe it or not 90 to 95 percent of fat in the body is actually saturated or monounsaturated so only five to ten percent of the bank in the body is polyunsaturated and as I've said already the saturated fats and monounsaturated fats are more stable less prone to oxidation these aren't essential because we can make them so he can make such a weight affair - monounsaturated fat from glucose and this process normally is carried out in the liver and is called de novo like for Genesis which is the production called Duchin of New France so we can't make polyunsaturated fat so they become essential but they're only needed in very very small amounts only 1% of our energy intake should come from polyunsaturated fats and their key rule is for the construction of cell membranes and for singing what networks so when we do take in the polyunsaturated fats it's best to ticketing them in with real food that also contain the main antioxidants such as between a and C B because that way and also a selenium as well because that way it prevents these fats oxidizing so the two essential polyunsaturated fats or omega-6 and omega-3 omega-6 controls and regulates implement air responses so it's key to respond in to injury or damage but excess can lead to chronic inflammation therefore chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes linoleic acid is the crime rate omega-6 fats and it's converted to a highly unsaturated fatty acid to be active in the body however this conversion uses the same enzymes that are used to convert the omega-3 to its active component so they compete for these enzymes so the ratio between our intake of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids is crucial back in the day when we only ate real foods this ratio was one to one the advice is now is that with the ratio is for too warm or less refined vegetable oils are very detrimental because these provide the body with huge amounts of omega-6 and can get this important ratio unstable or unbalanced so many people are consuming ratios between omega-6 and omega-3 I'd look to 22 arm or 30 to 1 and this really is going to put this body into a state of oxidized cells so the recommended daily value for the omega-6 is around 14 grams today that's only 14 grams a day and two tablespoonfuls of Walmart's just about give us that requirement sunflower seeds were also a good source as our free-range eggs omega-3 we need this for anti-inflammatory reasons and also it can reduce blood levels of the triglycerides the main fatty acid is the alpha linoleic acid and this is converted to the active components EPA and DHA however as I've already said it competes with the enzymes the omega-6 conversion now when it is converted it becomes the building block for the brain and also the nerve and I cells as the conversion isn't great especially people consuming a huge amount of omega-6 fats then direct sources are better although those new rni for these amounts the diet daily recommended value for epa and DHA is around 2.2 grams a day so the big sources is the only fish the oily fish mackerel sardines trout herring mackerel and salmon but weird fun reasonable women of childbearing age are advised not to have more than two portions a week and the rest of those four portions a week and that's because these oily fish may cause high levels of mercury dioxins and PC there's PCBs which can be harmful to the body freely range eggs can provide us with good sources of the omega-3 it's better if the hens are left to roam the pastures and eat the natural foods by pecking at the bugs and grass and these provide more of the omega-3 fatty acids for vegetarians or vegans they could get the active EPA and DHA from having a our alveoli of seaweed good sources are also in walnuts Tracy's amid flaxseed however this is the Ala that is provided and not the active components of the epa and DHA so people may need to take more of these foods to actually get the active components from them you can't take a supplement for omega-3 and cod liver oil high-strength cutter oil capsule size of 0.3 grams and a dessert spoon 2.6 grams now the supplementation of the omega-3 has not been shown in clinical trials to reduce cardiovascular risk factors or disease it has been shown to actually reduce pain and morning stiffness associated with arthritis moving on to protein-protein is building blocks of around 20 amino acids there's nine essential amino acids that we can't make in the body so when they take these into the food and the six conditionally essential amino acid just means that they're not normally essential unless our requirements are increased or our diet is not providing enough at them and then there's five non-essential amino acids neo acids are vital for survival muscles bones repair making enzymes the immune system making hormones and also the neurotransmitters now protein quality is based on the ability to provide all the essential amino acids in the correct quantity so complete protein can be found in meat seafood eggs poultry and dairy foods if you're vegetarian or vegan you can get complete protein from soya but you should really perhaps the organic Sawyer as there's lots of genetic engineered so you're around quinoa and also weight so how much of each essential amino acid do we need and how can we get it so here I provided the recommended daily amount adults per kilogram so for a 70 gram kilogram adult then these are the requirements for each of the essential amino acids you can see here the animal foods two eggs and 100 grams of lamb the very around 50 or 60 percent of the requirements for each essential amino acid at the right hand side here you can see that soybean do provide around a third 40 percent of the essential amino acids or more so you would have to be eaten to get the daily requirement moving on now to the vitamins or vitamin A we need it for functioning of the major organs of vision in new health and also as a potent antioxidant animal sources are more bioavailable you can also get it from the plant sources that need them to be converted to the by available source and this conversion is often quite inefficient because it's a fact at sobel vitamin it needs to be absorbed with the fact deficiency can cause blindness good sources a liver carrots herring and eggs vitamin b1 so we this for a regulation of the metabolism brain functioning any energy production and the conversion of the amino acid tryptophan into serotonin so deficiency can result in very very often unheard of nowadays especially in developed countries but also neurological symptoms as well and it started may be the causes of the deficiency may be one of the causes of Alzheimer's disease good sources are pork people notes mussels and sunflower seeds which may be to the function is for energy production detoxification and control system levels these become too high then it can crease risk of cardiovascular disease deficiency is rare but if people have a poor diet or abusing alcohol then deficiency is more common and this can cause skiing an eye problems sore throat swollen tongue and anemia so sources nuts like almonds eggs beef steak chicken kale vitamin b3 needed to convert food into energy optimum land and liver function production of enzymes and coenzymes for example nad which helps more than 400 enzymes to activate body processes deficiency where nowadays but if people aren't efficient under slides missions it may cause premature aging dementia and dry and cracked lips so saucers again from real foods beef liver had a pig beans and spinach Whitman b5 function is at tissues and organs can work correctly and in the production of red blood cells cholesterol we looked at the stress hormones bringing a neurotransmitter and that helped with the muscle contractions deficiency can be a lead to generally fatigue and malaise and numbness and tingling in the lower extremities again real food saucers chicken liver eggs again peanut butter natural yogurt it have been b6 so the function is that it's co enzyme involved in more than a hundred and forty biochemical reactions may help premenstrual tension it may a helps with the hemoglobin formation neurotransmitter since this and also in their new system deficiency although rare it can cause seizures rash confusion depression anemia and information of the total patterns some sources tuna salmon chickpeas and pork chops these were examples it's being b7 which is also known as biotin so in the production function it's the production of energy healthy hair and nails deficiency rarebit can cause fatigue insomnia dry and scaly skin and hair loss good sources lumps liver eggs salmon and cheddar cheese so folic acid it mean be knowing increased requirement in pregnancy and that's because its formation of the spine in babies helps a brain and heart health and improves mood deficiency can cause anemia fatigue irritability cognitive impairment and shortness of breath good sources beef liver sping aged avocado and green beings between b12 so important function fatty acid since this energy production DNA census and the coating of the nylon sheath saw every cell in the body needs it it can be made by bacteria in the gut but it's made in a large intestine and we can only absorb it in the small intestine so basically any that we do make with templates creep from the body so that's why it's an essential nutrient and we need to take it into our diet deficiency can lead to fatigue weakness confusion constipation and depression sources is all available in angle animal products some good examples of beef liver clams trout and cheddar cheese so certainly vegans and probably also vegetarians will need teh Testament vitamin C so the rni for an adult is only 14 milligrams per day however there's emerging evidence that supplementation is beneficial especially with Corbett 19 and I'd like you to I think an excellent podcast or interview is with Steve Bennett interviewing Patrick Alford and he's taught he's talking about puppies talking about his work and his research in the fact that vitamin C is a fantastic antiviral properties and that we should be perhaps taking at least 2,000 milligrams a day or one gram a day so I do recommend that you listen to the YouTube video with Patrick Hallford and also Steve Bennett it can be synthesizing almost all mammals except humans so we can't make between C the function is that it helps to build and repair tissue so it's a healing process it helps to fight infections or leading the immune system and also in the formation of collagen and antioxidants now the deficiency a was known through scurvy when food levels dropped less than 300 milligrams good sources we've got the red peppers the kale the strawberries a lemon and also you can have a small amount in chicken livers another vital vitamin vitamin D so they referenced nutrient intake for adults is 10 micrograms a day and it's actually the cause of this mmm but it's actually a hormone that is synthesized witness King is that so absorbed to sunlight its function is that help supposed to absorb calcium regulates immune response and may improve mood and control yeah deficiencies more commonly experienced and people with got about the skins because they absorb less from the sunlight and people who live in northern latitudes and it can cause symptoms Teague low immunity bone pain and poor healing sources diet resources involves salmon sardines or the fatty fish the eggs cheese mushrooms and mushrooms but the UK government recommend that we do supplement throughout the winter at 400 international units a day vitamin E functions as an antioxidant boost boosts the immune cells and it's anti flattering anti-inflammatory it protects age-related eye deterioration and its signals transmissions between cells deficiency can lead to a belong to the immune system nerve and muscle impairment and vision impairment so a lots of good sources here clarified butter which is known as ghee eggs double cream broccoli walnuts and salmon and finally vitamins k k1 and k2 we often class k2 was the Forgotten bitumen so we have a reference nutrient intake for k1 but not for k2 and it suggested that we should have 200 micrograms a day ok - we can make small amount by the bacteria in the goat these vitamins are fat soluble and the function of K 1 is blood water cutting of the k2 prevents the calcification of blood vessels deficiency can lead to bruising bleeding and excessive and Aust also osteo premia so the sources of K 1 is in km cards amethyst brown the green leaf village and Ketu the high-fat dairy products cheese egg yolks liver and also fermented foods such as sauerkraut and kimchi I hadn't got time to go into all the minerals but here provided a table that you can browse through in your own time I've listed all the essential minerals why they're needed and good food sources those calcium phosphorus magnesium potassium sodium chloride zinc selenium chromium manganese iodine copper and so on and the final one is calling which isn't a mineral but it's still essential nutrient when you can get from liver eggs Cod salmon cauliflower and broccoli so I hope with I needed a good case for the fact that we can obtain our essential nutrients by consuming real food thank you for your attention [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you", "_FKYikezRng": "hi and welcome back to cannabis infused motherhood my name is Sabrina and I have created this channel just as an avenue to express my love for cannabis I'm posting blog posts talk about different mindset techniques for healing and things like that so if you're in any of that please subscribe I'll be coming out with more and more content as time goes on um if you haven't seen my videos going over the car accident I was in in July you can go and check those out I'll also be recording a video of my healing from then until now so yeah if you're interested in learning about my experience and what happened you can go ahead and watch those videos as well so yeah today I decided to record a little bit of a tutorial for how to make chocolate chip cannabis cookies which I made because I had some leftover can of butter which I also have a tutorial on how to make your own peanut butter so if you want to watch that I'll leave that below as well so yeah I had some leftover cannabutter I was craving some edibles because I really like the pain relief and euphoric effect that edibles can provide even though they take a little longer to kick in so yeah so I will be going over the recipe it's very simple recipe my cookies turned out pretty good there are about a hundred milligrams apiece I'll also link below if you want to find out how much like milligrams of THC is in your edibles there is a converter where you can figure out exactly what is in each of your cookies that you make if you want to keep track of your dosage and not go over or not take enough okay so let's get into the recipe so first you want to pre-heat your oven to 375 and you want to add all your dry ingredients to a bowl so you want 2 and 1/3 cups of flour 1 teaspoon salt and one teaspoon of baking soda and put that into one bowl and then in a separate bowl you're going to want to take six ounces of cannabutter I used a scale to weigh out six ounces of the cannon-fire that I previously made and then you want to take one ounce of regular butter and add that to a separate bowl with fewer peanut butter next you're gonna want to add one cup of brown sugar into the bowl with the butters I was using a half cup measuring so I put two in there to equal a cup and then you're gonna add about a teaspoon of vanilla extract oh and also three quarter cups of regular sugar for all my recipes I just kind of wing the amounts as you see I didn't actually measure out a teaspoon of vanilla I just kind of plops them in there but that's okay and then you're gonna want to mix up your sugar with your butter really really well until it's nice and smooth my butter was in the fridge so it the texture was a little rough so it took a long time to get it to that creamy texture if you wanted to soften it a little bit I think it would go a little more smoothly then then mine did so once it's all mixed up you're gonna want to add two eggs to your mixture one at a time and then mix that in as well the recipe calls for two large eggs so that's what I used and again mixing it up and once that is all blended together you can then add your bowl of dry ingredients into the mixture and then continue mixing until it's smooth and turns into a batter and after you add your flour mix you're going to want to put in about 1 and 3/4 cups of chocolate chips and then again you just mix it all together till it is mixed and blend it and looks like a nice cookie batter and once that is done then you basically just throw your batter onto a cookie sheet I lined mine with wax paper just to prevent sticking on the pan itself and then you baked in the oven for about nine to eleven minutes I think mine were pretty much done at ten minutes so you want to make sure that you could use are nice and golden brown before you take them out of the oven so we have and you let them cool and you can eat your cookies and have a nice buzz going on thanks so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this recipe and let me know how your cookies turned out

podcast and stuff um you know I I guess you know what's your experience with that or have you had any experiences with Stan or you know what's your your take on with like psychedelics like no yeah yeah tried it I've been like wanting to at least like at least rooms but like I just like heaven I think I think I had an opportunity to potentially cop some I went to this event a couple weekends ago that's just like something like kind of secret like cannabis event put on by this group like maybe multiple events like every month it's at least a little bit of month and like some of the vendors in addition to like we even dance and whatever and I was like damn truce and I didn't like I should have brought more money but I only brought like limited amount of money so like I had already copped a bunch of stuff and didn't have enough time like much money left over to splurge on some shrooms but like there's definitely something that I want to try like in the near future yeah madam potentially LSD but I'm a little bit worried about that well and I think that I think you you kind of like dipped a toe in when you took way too much but I don't that was a mistake bro haha wholeheartedly that was mistake but I'm just saying you could you could easily have a psychedelic experience within that oh yeah I believe and how much what like that yeah yeah yeah I like that okay okay so what happened with you with your situation yeah I was at the Korea bro and where'd you get this stuff from so so there's this company and I don't know if there it was this bud box company I'm gonna be heard of that but they like you the packages like this one Internet and you have to like I have a password to even access the side or whatever so I got the edible the munch box I think it was called and it just had a variety of edible was like it was a and they're like like officially like stuff on my Denver and stuff like officially package company like so I got home there's some brownie in there and it was a cookie there was this pretzel peanut butter at the [ __ ] there was some some Fruit Chews and then there was a she but she and I think I heard about Chiba Chu from from from Stan cuz like he had just you know he just knew about that like in like so I was like okay I got you so one day I'm with my girlfriend and we're just like let's try the Chi with you today I think it's a Saturday so we were like look at it I'm like man let's just take half like it we'll take half of it right we'll just take half so that's like one half she took one half this [ __ ] tastes like a 2-0 I'm like the and it's the most like good taste and edible that I've had I don't really taste any you know we oh so we're chillin bro the stuff starts to hit some type of way like where I'm just like damn like you see damn and like we're like I remember what we were watching believe we are like having a [ __ ] good time bro like we are laughing hard and like just like making some type of clever connections and like we was also sort of waving bro for like 30 to 45 minutes brother was having some good as fun and then it just went south bro just it's just declined like like quickly it's in there and I think like when we were having a good ass time I like we had already like eaten food like a lot and then I like I just had some Ben and Jerry's in the fridge a pint I'm next on it I finished it and like that was the one that was the second mistake first thing was taken she would shoot the second one thing was eating the whole [ __ ] pint of ice cream as it was not so we're on the couch bro and we just start feeling like for lack of a better word just just crazy bro like that was just like what's going on right now like an end and the feeling I had was just like something's happening but I don't I think I don't like it the thing and I think is it's gonna get worse so like of course yes it got worse so like I just start like getting intense knowledge it broke stupid intense Nos and I'm like and I told my girlfriend I was like I got it I gotta go upstairs cuz I'm thinking I got a naked the bathrooms upstairs i room was upstairs I'm just throw up and I go to the bathroom on stairs bro and I'm just over the sink like contemplating everything everything in my life I was just like thinking like God please help me please and it was some sort of thought process where like my mind was racing so ridiculously but I was also it was also like time was going slow but in reality like time was moving fast for like so I'm just I'm over the sink for like at least 30 to 45 minutes just like trying not to throw up like right I'm just like I'm trying and then I'm like I we'll myself I'm like I have us I have a stomach of Steel I'm good I'm good and I go downstairs so I'm like mink my girlfriend is downstairs like if I'm feeling like this I'm no she not something good either so like I gotta go check on her so like I go down the stairs mind you I take the stairs one at a time so I don't really know how long it took me to get down low but yeah and then when I say one at a time I mean like one foot second foot on the stair one foot second foot rest one foot second foot on the stair and go all the way down like hang on to the walls as I'm heading towards the living room and then I read my girlfriend's in the bathroom like down that's now stairs and like I'm just like are you okay and I'm just like okay I'm and then I just was like oh and again like I was rushing but I took them [ __ ] one at a time again to go up and I just did it a little bit quicker this time because I was just like the consternation bro was too much I was it was just like in stress went to the bathroom upstairs and I just I just hurled I just I just threw up and it pretty much was just that I scream that's what I would call the memory of just throwing up bad ice cream and being like oh my [ __ ] goodness what the [ __ ] and I'm still [ __ ] up bro I was [ __ ] up to the point where like I think I just had to lay in the bed I have a debilitating I just like curled and of like almost a fetal position in the bed and just was just there like praying there like my girlfriend like we'll be okay and come upstairs and like I think she came upstairs eventually because she was just like I guess in a better stage michaelis and she's just like I think just laid in the bed with me and then like we were like in and out of sleep some type of way or like I think I again like two or something tonight in the a.m. and I was just like [ __ ] I still don't feel this so I let me just go the [ __ ] back to sleep but I feel a little bit better than I did earlier but I still feel like [ __ ] like it's best to just go to sleep the next the next day both of us were like yeah this is we were like yeah we're gonna take a break anything we related like that just the smell of it's like was just like triggering a terrible feeling that I had like right dude like when I was trying not to throw up in the night right when I do it all of that I was just like oh my god and like took my girl we go you know and then also that following day like I told Stan about about this I think of the following day was it the following there sometimes and I was just like brother I tell you about what happened and like I asked him I still had like the package of the tuba shoe and like that's just said a hundred milligrams and I was like stand I was like this just say a hundred milligrams and he was like bro you guys took like terminal illness dosage levels of the deeper - that's why you were [ __ ] and I was like I used are you serious just like yeah bro like the regulation is like 10 15 maybe 20 y'all 50 and I was just like oh my god that makes a lot of sense oh okay because I was really mystified I was like growing like how can this small little thing half of this [ __ ] like finish me like this like it has to be something wrong okay well that's what was wrong and I'm over here thinking like damn so it's a freaking terminal illness patient like say stay will they be okay like that's how they'll be they'll just be okay like will they be good cuz like actually the way I was feeling I was like a damn like having cancer like that's a gotta be I mean I know it's trash but like for that bag that type of doses will like make it bearable yeah it's like well yeah and I feel like that was just like an introduction like when you were explaining like time going slow but fast at the same time I feel like that like distortion was like somewhat psychedelic and yeah yeah yeah cuz like one you mentioned and you said that like that level of edible like looks like kind of like you know similar to at least have some psychedelic qualities I thought about it and I was like yeah the way it the way my brain and head was feeling and I can't even recall like I know I texted all that [ __ ] I gotta look do I text just cuz I was describing this [ __ ] and it was like you know pretty close to the event so I was describing this [ __ ] how that she was feel me and right now like I remember but like not the same as like how I described it so like I can't capture it the same way but that [ __ ] was crazy and it was it was legitimately I will never do it again but like and then now I'm like wary about freaking edibles like I I'm just like man I'm definitely not trying to err on the side of taking too much so like if I don't know how much this [ __ ] is man I'm probably gonna take too little and it's probably not gonna do anything but like better than they did too much and for the national again the context it Oh", "HIwES9pE_yY": "[Music] welcome to week everyone the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are looking at a brand new brand we are looking at dedicated medicated we are looking at their Cinnamon Toast Crunch bar it's a pretty low-end edible it's only 100 milligrams of THC and it only cost $4 at my dispensary so I don't have a whole lot of I don't want about a lot of high hopes for this but I am willing to be surprised and I hope to be surprised so this as you can see here is basically a rice krispies treat but instead of Rice Krispies there cinnamon toast crunch and again pretty cheap looking packaging just like a shitty little sticker pasted on there and a little vacuum seal bag but again only four dollars and 100 milligrams of THC so without further ado let's open it up and give ourselves a little taste test here so if this your first time tuning in tomates everyone the way we do our reviews is I eat this bad boy up I don't eat the entire thing in front of you because it just takes too long but I you know sample it make sure it tastes good let you know how it tastes then I hop off the camera and I come back two hours later to let you guys know how I'm feeling after consuming the whole thing and we wrap up then okay so here we go here is the bar right here you can see all the cinnamon toast crunch the marshmallow fluff it's kind of light and gooey very true it mmm look my prediction guys is you know exactly how this is gonna taste um no we taste no real weed odor probably because it's such low potency but it tastes exactly like you expected it's gonna taste it tastes like the rice a homemade rice krispies treat but with cinnamon toast crunch so otherwise pretty good or excuse me in other words that's pretty good and at least it is to me but we know the most important thing is not how it tastes but rather how it makes you feel and for that I'm gonna have to finish this off and I'm gonna have to come back to you guys two hours from now and let you know how we're feeling then so with that thank you so much for watching weeks guys and we'll check you back into two hours germs I am back it has been 2 hours since I've had the dedicated and medicated cinnamon toast crunch 100 milligram edible and I feel nothing literally nothing whatsoever not I can't say I'm too surprised knowing the price and the sort of shoddy craftsmanship involved but it's still a disappointment again this was only four dollars but still I was hoping for some kind of sensation but this could just be this particular edible or just this particular batch or whatever the case may be I do have some more dedicated medicated edible reviews on the way and I am certainly hoping for something a little bit more promising or a little bit more you know something will actually give me I but but maybe that's that's too much of a hope for a four dollar product again this was the dedicated medicated Cinnamon Toast Crunch 100 an\u00edbal total wet part of the product uh thank you so much for watching weeks guys and we will check you out on the next review hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "NZgCPdfUWW0": "hey there Laci here of the sweet pea chef and today I want to talk to you about all of these crazy amounts of hidden sugar that's in your food in some of the products that you're buying probably that are in your pantry right now these are really common things that we all buy and we don't really think about so today I'm going to show you a bunch of foods that have shockingly high amounts of hidden sugar and what you can do about it so let's get started alright before going any further if you are new to my channel please go and subscribe so you never miss my new weekly recipe videos and health and wellness videos and hit that Bell so you get notified of anytime I published a new video so something that isn't really that sweet that you might not have guessed has a lot of sugar is pasta sauce pasta sauce has a ton of added sugars in there that aren't necessary in just a regular pasta sauce if you take a look at the ingredients sugar is the fourth ingredient in here and that means that there's added sugars and there's seven grams of sugar for a half of a cup of this sauce so that is pretty dang high so I would recommend looking for a pasta sauce like the organics 365 brand they have absolutely no added sugar in the ingredients list which is a really big E and it has four grams of total sugar in a serving but you know that that's just from the naturally occurring tomatoes in there rather than added sugar so it's a huge difference in what your body is gonna do with that sugar once it gets it and it's not just like a bunch of processed sugar in your body so peanut butter a lot of people think oh I'm having all these healthy peanuts I'm getting a lot of protein and yes it is a higher protein food than other options but there's often a lot of hidden sugars and especially added sugars if you don't pay attention so like in here it goes peanuts and then sugar followed by palm oil which is its own issue now this is a natural brand and natural doesn't always mean no added sugars so you have to really pay attention to the ingredients list this is a better option than some some have just like high fructose corn syrup in there this one just has sugar in there as an added sugar if you can and you like the flavor because I feel like this natural is actually a natural this one has basically peanuts and it contains 1% or less of added salt so if you like a little bit of a salty flavor with your peanut butter this is a really good option and there's no added sugars you get all the same amount of protein and it's just it tastes just as good so definitely look for one with no added sugar [Music] so ketchup has a ton of added sugar oftentimes it is high fructose corn syrup that they're adding into it you want to pay attention to the ingredients this one has organic sugar which is just sugar in here and it has three grams of added sugar for one tablespoon so a lot of added sugar in this now a lot of people go and get no sugar added ketchup which okay that sounds great right there's no sugar added into it the problem is they're adding in sucralose as they're added sweetener and that's just fake sugar so it's just another way of adding unnecessary sugar in there if you need to have ketchup make your own I have a recipe on the blog and on YouTube that you can just make your own homemade ketchup and that's using raw honey as an example for your sweetener so it's definitely a more healthy unrefined version of ketchup cinnamon applesauce how could this be bad it has little eyes on there and everything right the problem is let me read to you the ingredients apples high-fructose corn syrup and a sorbic acid and some natural flavors right so in one pouch your kids are getting 14 grams of sugar and seven of those half of those sugar grams are from added sugars from that high-fructose corn syrup which is absolutely horrid for your body so you definitely want to if you are gonna get applesauce which is a perfectly good option get unsweetened applesauce apples are sweet they're a fruit they have fructose in them naturally occurring fructose even without any added sugar in the ingredients by the way it's organic apples your total sugars in here is 12 grams and that's naturally occurring no bad stuff in here and this is basically what apples should be rather than having all that high fructose corn syrup added in there but while we're also on a topic of applesauce most of all of the nutrients and the fiber from the peel of the apples is taken from this and so even a better option is to eat an apple so kind of think about that in terms of how far away removed are you from the actual whole food so we all drink sports drinks thinking that that's good for us right but let's go through this so Gatorade has the ingredients it goes water sugar dextrose which is another sugar about five other ingredients that I can't pronounce and then glycerol and and then caramel color and then artificial red food coloring not a healthy sports drink nothing that an athlete should really be drinking anyways this entire thing is two and a half servings for one serving you're getting 21 grams of added sugar 21 grams of added sugar if you drink the whole thing it's 55 grams of sugar that is a spike to your system your body is not gonna enjoy that even if you're depleting yourself completely during a workout or exercise or sports of some sort this isn't gonna make it better this is basically just gonna give you an insulin kick and just increase your blood sugar levels and then it's just gonna fail and drop it's looking at the ingredients in this one so water fructose and then cane sugar and then a bunch of other flavors and a bunch of other things in here that are fake it does have electrolytes in it it does have vitamins in it you can get that in a piece of fruit though you don't really need to drink a fake water so for one serving of this which is an entire bottle you're getting 26 grams of added sugar naturally occurring sugar is not happening in this it's just it's just not a great option either so if you are feeling like you need some help during a workout try water water gives you a ton of energy it replenishes all the things that you need when you're working out you really don't need added sugars and if you really really hate just plain water I have a video on infused water so you can add in real fruits real foods to kind of flavor it for you make it a tiny bit sweeter as well let's start with the protein one so one might see this at the store and be like oh snap it has protein in it it's gonna be a great option not only do I get a little snack I also get my protein so the first ingredients in there include so you have roasted peanuts which that's great but then it goes into chocolate chips which has a bunch of sugar and I'm palm oils which aren't good for you sugar it also has corn syrup it also has fructose it also has glycerin and and it's just basically for one a bar you're getting seven grams of sugar which if that were naturally-occurring it's not horrible for a snack but five of those are added sugars and I just read to you none of those added sugars are naturally-occurring added sugars they're just a bunch of fake sugar that's basically gonna give you an energy spike and then your energy is gonna drop down even further it's gonna just make your body just crave more sugar and you're gonna go into this endless cycle of needing more and more sugar more and more empty carbs to replenish your energy the same goes even 25% less sugar right which I'm glad that they're adding less sugar to it it still has as the cheese as like the second ingredient it has brown sugar and then it has Polly dextrose and glycerin in there and caramel color which is I know we're not talking about food coloring but caramel colors really don't have anything that has caramel coloring in it it's really not good for you said try to have like a piece of fruit or some nuts that's a much better option than like a granola bar Clif bars we think are options that are really healthy for us they're gonna give us a ton of energy the problem with that is the first ingredient is organic brown rice syrup which is just a fancy organic way of saying sugar it also has just a organic cane syrup again another fancy way of saying sugar one bar is 250 calories and it has 21 grams of sugar so 21 grams of sugar is quite a lot for a little bar that's not gonna really fill you up and it's just it's a bunch of fake sugars you have the ability I would go for like full fat cottage cheese or full fat Greek yogurt or some tofu or something that has a high protein content that's actually real food so I wanted to bring up what probably a lot of us might have grabbed thinking this is a healthy option we have organic we have low fat we have a bunch of thing we have even it says gluten-free you know you pay attention to that marketing the more things they throw at you on the front so more likely there's an issue on the back so let's take a look at the ingredients so the fourth ingredient in here is organic evaporated sugar cane syrup okay so a serving is one cup how much sugar do you think should be in a cup of yogurt just like think about that in your head my guess is it's not gonna be 37 grams of sugar that's more than a Gatorade like that is so much sugar to be adding to your food now you're also getting 10 grams of protein but you're all you're getting because it's low-fat you're not even getting a full amount of fat in there that's gonna make you feel full so they're basically they took out the fat which makes you less full and they added a bunch of sugar which is gonna give you an energy spike and then you're gonna have a crash and you're gonna want more sugar to get more energy so instead of that go with full fats unsweetened Greek yogurt it is so good for you let me compare the ingredients so in this one you get 15 grams of protein in one cup you get 5 grams of sugar for an entire cup there's no added sugar in this this is a great option if you needed a little bit sweet that is fine too just add some raw honey on top add some pure maple syrup add some fresh fruit any of those are gonna be way better to have a healthy high protein high fat snack just the name granola kind of implies that it's healthy right the problem is that most often it's not so this one is by kind it says healthy grains and it's maple quinoa clusters it has all the right stuff going for it your brain kind of thinks that it's healthy and it's not is gonna be super high in sugar for you right so the problem is is that when you start to take a look at it you look at the ingredients list the third ingredient is dried cane syrup you're like well shoot that's kind of bad but then you just keep reading then it's maple syrup then it's molasses then it's brown rice syrup and that's like half of the ingredients in here are a sweetener but they're not measuring any well I guess they have maple in the name but like they're not saying how high in sugar it is so a serving of this is giving you 10 grams of sugar so compare that to purely Elizabeth which I think it does a much better job of while they do add sweeteners to their foods they do it a lot less crazily so their ingredients that they use to sweeten things the only one that they use is organic coconut sugar organic coconut sugar if you've watched my video on how to quit sugar is a much better option for sweeteners because it's naturally occurring and has other fibers in there it has other nutrients then just fake sugar [Music] this is kind of a sad one this kind of hurts my heart to read this to you the second ingredient in here is high-fructose corn syrup in tomato soup it's like absolutely insane it's kind of disappointing it's very disappointing so in terms of the macros on this for 1/2 of a cup of a serving which is about there's two and a half servings in here which when do you ever just have like that much tomato soup but for a half of a cup of a serving you're getting 12 grams of sugar 12 grams of sugar in your soup in your salty soup it doesn't make any sense so if you're gonna be getting soup I highly recommend making your own I have a super-easy tomato soup recipe that has naturally occurring sugars absolutely no added sugar in it all right so next up is something that is marketed in a way to make you think that it's good for you those are Wheat Thins and I'm pretty sure that they call them thins on purpose to kind of make you feel like you're gonna be thin if you eat them it says 100% whole grain no artificial flavors or colors and it's it's something that one might grab thinking that they're having a healthy snack problem is there's some hidden sugars in there along with other hidden highly processed ingredients so if we go to the ingredients label and we'll see the third ingredient is sugar it also has multi rep which is another type of sugar it also has refiners syrup I don't know what that is I'm guessing it's sugar and so that makes it all to be a total of 5 grams of sugar per 16 pieces of the Wheat Thins and four of those are added sugars so you're getting a ton of sugar in these they might as well be cookies if you're gonna have that much sugar in something especially if you're thinking oh well this is my non sugar eat snack so definitely you want to pay attention to the ingredients labels and how much you're getting in there a great option to have if you really need a crispy kind of crunchy savory kind of tip is to go with something like a Triscuit these are just sold at all the stores I just picked this up as just an option that you could pick up it's made with sea salt and the ingredients are whole grain wheat organic press sunflower oil and sea salt so no sugar added to these so if you are trying to avoid having added sugars this is the way to go total sugars in here zero we haven't really talked too much about fake sugars and artificial sugars so something like this which is a Cal zero calorie zero added sugar drink the fake sugar that they add here is sucralose sucralose is basically if you it's like Splenda if you take sugar and you didn't you like chemically alter it then that turns into sucralose your body thinks this is sugar your body ink has an insulin spike because of this to bring your blood sugar levels down so in addition to all of the other stuff that's in here that's giving you a bunch of energy spikes this is definitely not a good option either so just because it has no sugar in it you got to pay attention to how it's sweetened if you need something to give you some energy you could have coffee you could have black tea green tea any of those are gonna give you energy [Applause] if you think about it you're basically taking just like with applesauce you're taking your whole food you're taking away all of the fibers of it all of the stuff that takes a while to digest and to breakdown and you're basically getting the sweet sugary drink from that naturally-occurring fruit right so orange juice is the same way for eight ounces so for one cup of this orange juice you're getting 23 grams of sugar that is a lot of sugar to be drinking back quickly kind of consider water instead and if you really want that flavor have the whole fruit instead it's so much better for you also if you think about how many of these it'll take to get into a cup of these that's a lot of oranges to get into one cup of orange juice typically you're not gonna eat more than one orange you're gonna have just one but if you're having a cup of orange juice you're probably eating a total of like four or five oranges which is more than your body needs it's more than any sugar amount you ever would need it's everywhere you guys it's just all the places that manufacturers want you to buy more of their stuff they're gonna add sugar in there all right let me know what foods I missed in the comments below and if you like this video give me a thumbs up so I know to make more of them and I will see you in the next video", "FUrSrAjZEIo": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we're going [Music] [Applause] [Music] look away [Music] [Applause] [Music] uh hey [Music] is [Music] and i and i might be with a white but i ain't gonna wife it i know that love ain't priceless i've been on a mission since i was 17 to get this green live my dream but they all trying to play i've been chasing cheese dropping songs every week working trying to [Music] [Music] [Applause] so i just got back from the beach the whole reason why i'm like this and the wet we are going to make a smoothie [Music] so [Music] all right testing time [Music] okay honestly i prefer this over ice cream i'm not even lying it's so fresh it's like powder [Music] the color it's so pretty okay look my life is complete [Music] because it's melting oh my [Music] so nice so refreshing that's the only thing that i don't like these seeds really really well are me this feels super nice after spending the day at the beach because me personally i am never ever hungry when i come back which makes a lot of sense you've been exposed to the sun for so many hours give me time to cool down a little bit and get hungry so this is like the perfect thing to have it's refreshing it's light it's really pretty there's so many [Music] i'm like the only one who [Music] so annoying when i eat the whole fruit by itself like the blackberry the whole blackberry or the whole raspberry it's not annoying but when it's like you're drinking something it's annoying you can feel like every single little seed and increases even how many seeds they have it's crazy even though it's already melting [Music] so today's lunch would be my first big meal and this meal is highly nutritious and satiating the protein and fat from the eggs cheese and pork sausage and fiber from the salad aid in satiety first of all eggs are incredibly nutritious their nutritional profile is amazing and then pork is an excellent source of thiamin selenium vitamin b3 vitamin b6 and phosphorus and then old age cheese is also a great source of fat and protein full of probiotics and high in calcium and vitamin k2 also the salad is full of vitamins and minerals to keep you healthy young and vibrant so that when they ask you you can say just thriving so here's the deal i don't do 100 sugar but i don't do 100 alternative sweetener either so this is what i do i do a bit of sugar and a bit of alternative sweetener the reason being is because if you overdo alternative sweeteners you can get digestive problems but if you mix them it's fine as you're not over doing sugar you are just using a tiny amount and you don't get digest issues either this is my cheesecake recipe which is low in sugars and carbs it's high in protein and fat so it keeps you satiated for a long time besides cream cheese is a great source of vitamin a and k and let's not even start with eggs eggs are one of the most nutritious foods on the planet this cheesecake is more of a basque cheesecake so it's not as crazy sweet and it doesn't have the cookie part or the marmalade like the american or new york cheesecake type [Music] i used a bit of this organic ice cream to give it some flavor and natural sweetness it's just organic milk cream and organic caramel by using just a bit it gives so much flavor and then i added monk fruit which is my alternative sweetener you can use a stevia erythetrol stylus tool then i added a bit of coconut flour which is naturally sweet it adds a bit more sweetness and it's slowing carbs so it's a very healthy alternative to flour it does the job well and fast it's a little tricky so if you don't want to have it undercooked or burnt you have to check it once in a while so this would be the perfect cheesecake i am making a mess and making it look super ugly but just for the sake of showing you guys this is how it should look like like a cloud a little little burnt just a little or well i wouldn't say burnt if you want burnt it's fine but you know a little like toasted do you want to call it toasted crispy i don't know but it should look kind of like this [Music] seems like they [Music] [Music] these days it ain't hard to tell who i'm tight with me myself and i and i might be with a white but i ain't gonna wife it i know that love ain't priceless i've been on a mission since i was 17 to get this green live my dream but they all trying to play i've been chasing cheese dropping songs every week working trying to get my buzz up now they're all on my way pull seems like they never [Music] [Music] [Music] yes the feeling after finishing though dead but good so this time it's a little different than usual because i would have a much bigger meal but because i was going out for dinner i had to make room for dinner even though this snack has a fair good amount of fat i don't do bread often only when i want peanut butter or something similar to spread on if you're going to do bread i recommend you to do organic bread the problem with conventional bread is they bleach the flour with toxic bleaching agents aside from the pesticides chemicals and whatnot i recommend to do a whole wheat ancient or sprouted grain fruits as they offer more nutritional value this one is a sprouted bread spread means whole grains are soaked in water until they begin to sprout and enzymes and nutrients are released so it's easier to digest and absorb the nutrients nonetheless grains in general do not have a high nutritional value profile bread is more of a taste but thing than expecting to get a wide range of nutrients from it and as you can see this bread is sprouted whole wheat grains so it doesn't have as much sugar and carbohydrates as regular bread and it also has more fiber so we don't excessively spike insulin or sugar levels this is the peanut butter i'm currently using it's organic and it doesn't have added sugars just organic peanuts and organic palm oil and palm oil if it's organic it's completely fine believe it or not palm oil has a decent amount of vitamin e in the carotene i also had a kefir always do whole milk because it has a better nutritional profile skim milks are depleted of their fat soluble vitamins and then manufacturers fortify skin meals with synthetic vitamins kefir is better than yogurt as it has more probiotics and it's easier to digest for those that are lactose intolerant i didn't want to eat more because i was wanting to go out for dinner we went to a japanese restaurant and i had sushi and sushi can be super nutritious if you only do fish okay the problem comes when people choose sushi that are on rice and a tiny tiny bit of fish if you didn't know sushi has added sugar so if we consider that sushi is extremely high in carbs and has added sugars and that white rice is bleached and depleted of the few nutrients the rice grain originally had sushi rice only spikes insulin and sugar levels it doesn't nourish you at all so keep that in mind", "8rXhePC9Nlk": "what's up photography users this is dark house from dhf TNS calm and today I'm going to show you guys how to make seven quick recipes that'll take less than 1% of your day so let's get to it if you guys don't know what the Arnold 1% challenge is basically it's a challenge being held by Joe Darcy calm and Arnold Schwarzenegger that challenges you to use 1% of your day to become a healthier you I'll post a link to the actual challenge in the description box below where you can earn points and potentially win prizes but the biggest prize you're going to win is that you're gonna become a healthier person so there's three main things we're gonna focus on when making these recipes 1 we're gonna make them as quick as possible in less than 1% or 15 minutes of your day - we're going to keep the cost as low as possible and 3 were not gonna compromise the taste the first recipe I'm going to show you guys is protein cereal which is more of a think outside the box type of recipe and who doesn't love cereal the first ingredient you're going to add in is 1 cup or 8 ounces of unsweetened vanilla almond milk if you can't find or don't like almond milk you can use regular milk or any other milk substitute that you prefer one scoop or 30 grams of protein powder the flavor you use will be the flavor of your milk so make sure you use a good tasting protein powder before you add in your cereal you want to make sure that you mix your protein powder with your milk if your protein powder doesn't mix easy use a shaker bottle or blender to mix it before you put it into your bowl and last one serving of cereal or granola so there's your protein cereal it only takes about 2 minutes to make as for the calories with the ingredients that I use there's 381 9 grams of fat 43 grams of carbs and 32 grams of protein one thing that I do want to mention before I continue on is that this video is just to give you guys some quick recipe ideas if some of these recipes are too high calorie or too low calorie then you can pretty much all of them for example if you want less carbs in the protein cereal recipe just cut your cereal serving in half or if you want more protein add another half scoop of protein powder to your recipe moving on the second recipe I'm going to show you guys is protein oatmeal also known as protes the first thing we're gonna do is make our oatmeal so take on a microwavable safe Bowl and put in half a cup or 40 grams of rolled oats into it 1/3 a cup of water and 2/3 a cup of unsweetened vanilla almond milk you can also use regular milk or any other milk substitute that you prefer now microwave your oatmeal for two minutes the most important part of this recipe is to make sure you add in the rest of your ingredients while your oatmeal is still hot one scoop or 30 grams of protein powder I'm using chocolate but you can pretty much use any flavor protein powder as long as it tastes good it also doesn't matter whether you use casein soy egg or like I'm using whey protein 2 tablespoons or 10 grams of cocoa powder a lot of people think cocoa powder has a ton of sugar in it it actually doesn't have any sugar in it at all and two grams of fiber per serving one tablespoon or 16 grams of peanut butter and that's it now just go ahead and mix everything together so there is your protein oatmeal it only takes around 30 minutes to make as far as the calories go in the whole recipe there's 434 14 grams of fat 40 grams of carbs 10 grams of fiber and 37 grams of protein one quick tip I want to throw out there for this recipe is if you can find instant sugar-free fat-free pudding one to two servings of the flavor of your choice will make this recipe even better the third recipe I'm going to show you guys is a protein shake recipe you don't need protein powder for this it's great if you're on the go especially in the morning the first thing you're going to do is take out either a shaker bottle or a blender I prefer using a shaker bottle in this recipe just because it's easier there's less to clean up and it's one of those recipes where I want to make really quick and not have to deal with anything else the first ingredient we're going to add in is 3/4 a cup or 6 ounces of unsweetened vanilla almond milk you can also use regular milk or any other milk substitute that you prefer 12 tablespoons or 184 grams of pasteurized liquid egg whites which is around 3/4 a cup and yes pasteurized liquid egg whites are perfectly fine to drink 1 tablespoon or 16 grams of peanut butter 2 tablespoons or 11 grams of a chocolate mix you don't have to use Ovaltine I just prefer it 2 tablespoons or 10 grams of cocoa powder and half a cup to a cup of ice now there's 2 tips I have for you guys in this recipe 1 if you have protein powder you can add half a scoop to a scoop to this recipe to get more protein and 2 you can add some instant coffee to this recipe to get that extra boost I need a little boost right now so I'm gonna go ahead and add 1 tablespoon of instant coffee in depending on the brand of instant coffee you buy 1 tablespoon will be around 75 to 100 milligrams of caffeine once all of your ingredients are in your shaker shake it up and there is your protein shake it only takes about 2 minutes to make as for the calories in the whole shake there's 304 12 grams of fat 22 grams of carbs and 27 grams of protein so those first three recipes I showed you guys can be considered our breakfast recipes the next four recipes I'm going to show you guys can be made for either lunch or dinner the fourth recipe I'm gonna show you guys is my version of tuna and rice it's really quick and absolutely delicious first things first take out your tuna and drain it after you drain your tuna take out a bowl the amount of tuna you use is completely up to you I'm using 2 5 ounce can of chunk light one other thing is a lot of people ask me the type of tuna that I prefer and my answer to them is always the type that's on sale next thing we're gonna do is make our rice Uncle Ben's makes these 90 second brown rice packets that come in a ton of different flavors and only costs around a dollar if you can't find uncle ben's other companies make these as well Uncle Ben's is just one of the more popular ones where I live tear the top off and microwave it for 90 seconds there's two cups in this bag I only use one cup or 141 grams in this recipe 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 2 tablespoons or 30 grams of salsa mix everything together there is your tuna and rice it only takes around 3 or 4 minutes to make as for the calories and the whole recipe there's 545 21 grams of fat 44 grams of carbs and 45 grams of protein if you want to cut down on the sodium in this recipe rather than buying one of the flavors just buy the regular brown rice the regular brown rice only has 30 milligrams of sodium in the whole bag two cheap things I think everybody should have in their kitchen one a digital scale this thing is extremely durable I've had mine forever it does grams and ounces comes in a ton of different colors and it only costs around twenty-five dollars shipped into a good shaker bottle that doesn't leak I've had blender bottles for around five or six years now that still don't leak they also have measurements on the side of all the blender bottles you can pick these items up at pretty much any home goods store but I will post links to them in my description below the fifth recipe I'm going to show you guys are some really quick garlic turkey burgers the first thing you're gonna do is take out a large mixing bowl and put your lean ground turkey into it as for how much we're using 1.3 pounds or twenty point eight ounces I'm using 93 seven you can also double or even triple this recipe one large whole egg in one large egg white 1/4 the teaspoon of lemon and pepper half a teaspoon of garlic salt one teaspoon of Italian seasoning one and a half teaspoons of minced garlic or three cloves of regular garlic if you want it to have some spice to it you can add two teaspoons or 10 grams of a chili garlic sauce if you don't have or can't find this you could also add two teaspoons or 10 grams of sriracha the company that makes sriracha is actually the same company that makes this chili garlic sauce 1/3 a cup or 30 grams of whole wheat bread crumbs whether you use seasoned ones or not is completely up to you 2 tablespoons or 10 grams of grated Parmesan cheese and last take out and chopped 1/3 a cup of red onion add the 1/3 a cup of chopped red onion to your mix if you don't like onions you don't have to add it wash your hands and then we're just going to mix everything together with one of them to save some time before you shape your burgers take out a large stovetop pan book your burner on medium spray some nonstick cooking spray into your pan and let it heat up a quick tip before we shape our burgers is if you wet your hands a little bit beforehand your mix isn't going to stick to them as bad so now just shape your burgers however big or small you want to make them is completely up to you that's how big I make mine once your pan heats up put your turkey burgers on and cook them for three to four minutes aside after three to four minutes aside or however long you like your burgers cooked for go ahead and take them off so there are your garlic turkey burgers they only take around 8 to 10 minutes to make and depending on how much you eat you'll have enough for a couple days as far as the calories go in the whole recipe there's 1080 - 52 grams of fat 24 grams of carbs and 132 grams of protein so if you make four burgers like I did there's 273 calories of burger 13 grams of fat 6 grams of carbs and 33 grams of protein since these recipes are all about saving time if you want some extra carbs I would either use some of that uncle ben's 90-second brown rice that I showed you guys before or simply use some bread just make smart decisions I personally like this Arnold double protein bread it's absolutely delicious and we're doing the Arnold 1% challenge so you got to like the Arnold name a lot of people have trouble getting fiber in their diet and it's extremely important so I thought I'd show you guys three quick and cheap ways to get some more in one chia seeds which in one tablespoon or 12 grams only have 60 calories and 5 grams of fiber and you can pretty much put these in anything your yogurt oatmeal cottage cheese or even your protein shake - flaxseed which in two tablespoons or 13 grams has four grams of fiber this is great to cook with and even goes well in protein shakes and three as I mentioned before cocoa powder which in one tablespoon or 5 grams only has 10 calories and 2 grams of fiber pretty much anything you want to add a chocolate flavor - cocoa powder will go well in it's also great to cook with as well the six recipe I'm going to show you guys is hummus tuna the first thing you're going to do is take out a bowl and then drain one tuna add your drains can of tuna into the bowl I'm using chunk white and there's four ounces or 112 grams per can if one can isn't enough then you can double or even triple this recipe 1/4 a cup or 56 grams of fat-free cottage cheese if you don't like the taste of cottage cheese I promise you that you can't taste it at all one teaspoon of minced garlic half a teaspoon of lemon and pepper 2 tablespoons or 28 grams of hummus you can use whatever flavor of hummus you want I've used them all and personally my favorite is roasted red pepper and now mix everything together so there's your hummus tuna it only takes about three minutes to make as far as the calories go in the whole recipe there's two hundred and forty to six crimes of fat eight grams of carbs and 39 grams of protein it tastes great as is but I usually like to add some extra carbs in so I'll either put it in a sandwich or over some Ritz crackers now if I'm really in a rush and I don't have time to make anything or am out I need to buy something my protein bar of choice our quest bars if you've never had a quest bar there's a ton of different flavors they're low in sugar around 20 grams of protein per bar and absolutely delicious you can probably find them locally pretty much anywhere but I will post a link down below to them the seventh and last recipe I'm going to show you guys is my really quick stovetop garlic chicken the first thing you're gonna do is take out a large stovetop pan turn your burner on medium high heat add in 3 tablespoons of olive oil 2 teaspoons of minced garlic or four cloves of garlic stir your garlic into your oil and then let that heat up while you cut your chicken take out 2 pounds or 32 ounces of chicken breast trim the fat off and then chop your chicken breast into little pieces so that they're about that big once you finish cutting your chicken add it in once you add your chicken in you want to keep stirring it around for five to eight minutes after five to eight minutes turn your burner on medium add in 1/2 a teaspoon of onion powder and half a teaspoon of garlic salt mix those in and cook for another 1 to 3 minutes the only thing you have to be careful with in this recipe is that if your stove gets too hot boil will tend to splatter everywhere and that's the last thing you want to happen so if it does do that just reduce your heat a bit there is your quick stovetop garlic chicken it only takes around 8 to 10 minutes to make as far as the calories go in the whole recipe there's 1437 49 grams of fat 0 grams of carbs and 249 grams of protein so if you make four meals out of this there's only around 359 calories of serving 12 grams of healthy fats 0 grams of carbs and 62 grams of protein and if you want to top this with something while you're cooking it you could be making your rice pasta or quinoa to cut down on time as for how I prepare my vegetables when I'm in a rush this is all that I do take out a microwavable safe container put however many vegetables you want into it add 1 to 2 ounces of water put a cover or piece of saran wrap over the top and rather than seal your top you want to leave one of your corners open after that throw your container in the microwave and microwave them for however long the back your bag says to then I like to top mine with some lemon and pepper garlic salt and of course sriracha alright guys that about wraps up this video if you had enough time to watch it then you also had enough time to prep all your meals for the day so

multiple-choice questions on our website new questions are added weekly so just click the link in the description below to get instant access to them in today's video we're going to be talking about trigeminal neuralgia which is a chronic neuro facial pain disorder and it's associated with sharp and electrifying severe pain due to the trigeminal nerve it's been suggested that this condition is probably one of the most painful conditions a human can experience and it's even been nicknamed the suicide disease because of the extreme pain let's make a quick overview of the anatomy and pathway of the trigeminal nerve I'll make a separate video discussing this in more detail so I'm just gonna keep the basics in this video what you need to know for now is the trigeminal nerve has three branches they are the ophthalmic the maxillary and the mandibular branches so the ophthalmic and maxillary branches both have only sensory innervation which means the nerve fibers are responsible for only transmitting signals of sensations so this is things like pain and pressure whereas the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve not only provides sensory innervation but also motor innervation which means they carry impulses to the muscles of mastication to allow for chewing and opening and closing the mouth the cause of trigeminal neuralgia is actually unknown but there's been a lot of research on potential causes so we'll discuss a few of them now the first idea is due to nerve compression so this means that there's an artery nearby along the pathway of the trigeminal nerve and this is pressing onto the trigeminal nerve and this is causing the extreme pain some scientists actually disagree with this because they say throughout the body there's numerous places where a nerve is in close contact to a vessel but on the other hand when certain surgeries are done to separate the trigeminal nerve from a blood vessel using a barrier in a lot of patients this results in resolution of the pain another cause of Tramel neuralgia has been said to be due to a space-occupying lesion and this is a growth which occurs inside the skull which might be benign or malignant but it causes compression again of the trigeminal nerve multiple sclerosis may be another cause of trigeminal neuralgia so multiple sclerosis is a condition which involves the formation of plaques or lesions along the nerves in the central nervous system there's also damage to the myelin sheath which is what insulates and surrounds a nerve but the interesting thing to note is not every patient who has multiple sclerosis will experience trigeminal neuralgia in fact a study which I'm gonna link below suggested that those who do experience trigeminal neuralgia who have multiple sclerosis had a higher concentration of these plaques and lesions along the tracks of the trigeminal nerve the symptoms a patient will experience with trigeminal neuralgia is an extreme sharp an electrifying pain which happens suddenly the neural gear can occur along any branch of the trigeminal nerve but the maxillary and mandibular branches are most commonly affected the pain attacks can occur in cycles occurring five to ten times a day and certain movements like chewing gum or brushing your teeth may trigger an attack trigeminal neuralgia has a predilection to women over the age of 50 and a milder form of the disease called atypical trigeminal neuralgia also exists where these attacks occur but the pain is less severe and it's associated with more tingling and burning sensations as opposed to extreme pain so trigeminal neuralgia can be misdiagnosed as quite a few different diseases there's quite a lot so I'm only going to discuss three so the first one is dental pain so the difference between trigeminal neuralgia and dental pain is that trigeminal neuralgia is not responsive to heat and temperature like the teeth are so an acute form of poop itis might result in severe pain which might seem like trigeminal neuralgia because of the city but it comes alongside a tooth which is likely to have like carious lesions extending to the pulp which isn't necessary for trigeminal neuralgia trigeminal neuralgia can also be misdiagnosed as various temporal mandibular joint disorders but the key thing to note is with trigeminal neuralgia the pain is paroxysmal which basically means very sudden and it's an electrifying pain which is very very severe with temporal mandibular joint disorders the pain is more of a dull sensation and in fact the location of the pain is outside of the tract of the trigeminal nerve so it's not exactly in the same area trigeminal neuralgia can be misdiagnosed with another two diseases called su n CT and su na which both have very long abbreviations the first one is short lasting unilateral neuralgia Foam headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing and su na stands for short lasting unilateral neuralgia form headaches with cranial autonomic symptoms the reason that both of these diseases can be associated with trigeminal neuralgia is just because it's a type of facial pain and it comes randomly and it's paroxysmal in nature but they also come alongside issues with the eye and this includes things like edema and swelling z' lacrimation and nasal congestion which doesn't happen in trigeminal neuralgia so now we can talk about the treatment methods of trigeminal neuralgia and they can be divided into a pharmacological approach which involves prescribing drugs and the surgical approach as well so medications like carbamazepine which is an anticonvulsant can be given or phenytoin and gabapentin the surgical methods of treatment can either be non destructive or destructive in nature which depends on whether they cause damage to the nerve so non-destructive methods include microvascular decompression and this is where the nerve is separated from the surrounding vessels which is causing the compression and this can be done with barriers like Teflon the destructive methods basically aim to cause damage to the trigeminal nerve so it can't transmit pain signals but also there's going to be a loss of sensation as well because of the nerve damage and these methods include glycerol injections balloon compression and radiofrequency thermal coagulation rhizotomy", "KwiQ66QZ-c8": "[Music] well folks

recipe with you it's a nice switch up if you're used to having your oatmeal or your cream of wheat every morning and no it's not dessert i know it looks that good i get that question all the time on my instagram it's a very nutritious grain that is just jam-packed with so much vitamins minerals it keeps you full until lunch like you literally cannot go wrong with this amaranth porridge especially because i made it gluten and dairy free so if you guys want to see how i made this berrylicious creamy bowl of goodness just keep on watching first off you're going to start by boiling some water i boiled about 2 cups and once the water starts to boil you want to add 1 cup of amaranth greens amaranth grains are so healthy for you it's packed with vitamin d thymine niacin phosphorus calcium potassium riboflavin i don't even know if i said that right but y'all know the name of that vitamin and on top of that it has 47 grams per serving which means that it is so filling you guys like this will definitely keep you full until lunch time when the amaranth starts boiling you want to turn the heat all the way down on low and cover your pan after about 8 to 10 minutes you want to give it a stir then in about 10 minutes you'll start to see the amaranth start to thicken up a lot so from this stage you want to keep stirring then add your milk of choice i like adding coconut milk or almond milk to mine and today we're using almond milk so you just want to pour your milk in while stirring until it's to your desired consistency so continue stirring and mixing until the seed is fully open until it has like a soft texture to it i recommend tasting the seed just to make sure it's fully cooked so i went ahead and added some cacao powder which is quite bitter but it's jam-packed with so many nutrients this is a sugar-free amaranth porridge so feel free to add some coconut sugar maple syrup or stevia because it's pretty bland by itself so you can use whatever you like then i put a little bit of cinnamon and pumpkin spice and continue mixing like with any part you have to focus a lot of your attention on it because you don't want it to burn the bottom of the pan hard to get too thick then you just want to pour your cooked amaranth into your bowl this can actually serve two people but i have a big appetite so i'm just gonna serve it in one big bowl don't judge me okay then you can serve it with whatever you want like warmed up apples peaches bananas with cinnamon raisins or almonds now i'm not really a fan of warm the fruit so i just washed and cleaned some fresh strawberries and blueberries added them on top along with some walnuts and my ultimate favorite must-have for amaranth porridge is almond butter like y'all don't even know like almond butter is definitely the goat like it just takes it to a whole nother level i got this creamy salted one from trader joe's which is like my ultimate fave i just drizzle it on top which makes it more like a dessert than a breakfast i do the same with my oatmeal and it just looks delicious with all the bright colors and textures and oh my god flavors but most importantly it's really really simple a delicious warm parsh that you can have any time of the year it will keep you energized until lunch time i assure you okay it's really filling good food truly makes my heart smile especially to start off your morning with and this is something that i go to time and time again when i want energy and just want to be filled and satisfied with a dessert like breakfast in the morning to just make me smile you know you just want to do these little things for yourself to make yourself happy and if you guys do give this a try be sure to let me know in the comment section down below if you guys are you know trying to incorporate some healthier meals and want to see me do more videos like this be sure to let me know in the comment section below as well and i will see you guys in my next video bye beauties [Music]", "wSDwefu92VU": "[Music] we help you make sense of your dispensary welcome to weeds guys on on today's review we are taking another look at a product from the fine folks at the Venice cookie Co and today we're taking a look at their I assume compliant with the new edible regulations taking effect this July their cannabis infused dark chocolate sea salt vegan no gluten 10 mini so there are 10 minis of whatever these little chocolate bars things are we've reviewed I think these are the people that make cannabis quencher and they also make the 420 bars which are really good and this is their new minis line here again probably can plant with those regulations on the back everything you want to see a product testing provided by SC labs love seeing that nutrition information ingredients all that fun stuff and a lot of text to get through that I'm not gonna read peace-loving cannabis that's all you need to know so this has the annoying new packaging they their instructions are to grip rip and enjoy will see if I can actually get that to happen I doubt it this new packaging is the worst Korova uses it I think Hanako now uses it it just it really sucks and their grip rip and enjoy is not precisely helpful alright guys I'm gonna have to go uh maybe grab like there's a tear thing but is that going to help no why do they even option offer the option to tear I'm gonna have to go grab some scissors I'll be right back defeat it and I'm back that was a bit of a pain in the ass I understand they have to do this but I am too stupid for this kind of packaging so here we go here are the minis right here it'll a lot like their candy bars just sort of broken up into ten little mini now this is the again the dark chocolate and sea salt let's give it a taste oh very salty well I gotta say I think that's too salty for me I'm normally like the dark chocolate sea salt combination but damn there is a lot of salted here whoo but the chocolate itself is a pretty good quality I feel and very little cannabis taste mainly just because it's covered up by that salty flavor whoo yeah way too much salt good well oh why why would you do that the rare edible where the taste is not bad due to the cannabis it's due to a different ingredient not my favorite but as we always know it's not about how it tastes it's more about how it makes you feel and for that guys I'm gonna finish off the rest of these minis although I'm not really looking forward to it and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that is the most important part of the edible review process all right guys what I'm gonna polish off these hundred milligrams cannabis infused dark chocolate sea salt and I will see you guys in just a bit peace [Music] welcome back awaits guys it's been two hours since I had the oh whoops there we go the Venice cookie Co cannabis infused dark chocolate and sea salt hundred milligrams here and although the edible had way way way way way way way too much salt in it I ain't even salty because damn it hits hard this is another win for the Venice cookie Co really really pleased with how it feels I I'm at like a seven or so for one hundred milligram edible which is pretty good I like this one quite a bit and it cost me exactly ten bucks I think my dispensary you know I think it was twelve so you know decent for a hundred milligram edible especially a chocolate one I said I like this one quite a bit I would definitely recommend it if you can find out at a fair price especially if your dispensary is now only stocking these hundred milligram edibles if this is the time of a hundred milligram edibles only if you're watching this then yeah then yes I recommend this one go for it so uh yeah I'm I'm pleased with it if this is our future if it contains edibles as good as this well it's far from ideal it's not gonna be the hellscape I once thought it was so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "MFKbD1RNKeE": "welcome back to top five best make sure to smash that like button and subscribe if you do let me know in the comments below and I'll try to reply to as many of you as I can 15 healthy foods that aren't number 15 multi-grain and wheat breads most people generally know that white bread isn't the healthiest thing in the world but fewer people realize that the supposin healthy alternatives are not that much better whole-wheat bread is good for you but the ones you'll find at the Shelf of the supermarket are hardly ever whole-wheat they're generally made of the same enriched flour that you'll find in white bread you need to incorporate more whole grains into your diet number 14 muffins many consider these a nice and delicious bread like snack in reality muffins no matter what flavor or style are basically miniature cakes loaded with unhealthy fats calories sugars and the same nutritional aspyn flour found in supermarket bread if you feel like buying muffins next time you're at the market consider sharing one with a friend number 13 cereal many people love their cereal and proclaim it's the best way to start their day that just is not true obviously we know the sugary cereal aimed at kids is generally not healthy but even the healthier alternatives like corn flakes and raisin bran contain just as much sugar since the manufacturers destroy the original vitamins minerals to add their own preservatives even when you find a brand of healthy cereal that retains as much of the original ingredients as possible the reality is you're still much better off with Whole Foods number 12 reduced fat peanut butter now this is a marketing trick to pretend that there's a healthy alternative to a product considered fatty by removing the fat and replacing it with things that are much much worse if you get peanut butter with reduced fat it means they've added in sugar in fillings to retain much of the taste the fat count is reduced but the overall calories are not you're better off eating the healthy fats found in peanut butter and knowing exactly what you are putting in your body rather than getting a slightly worse tasting product for absolutely no reason number 11 pre-made salads amazing what salads can get away with to the point where they end up with more calories than the media start attack inducing fast-food hamburger there are those that have some lettuce covered in ham bacon turkey cheese fried chicken and drenched in mayo claiming to be a salad and the longest word stretching technicality ever you are better off preparing a salad at home just adding the little tasty meat and minimal dressing and you can eat all the salads you like number 10 fruit juice now this one is mixed because wallet does contain some nutritious vitamins the amount of sugar and empty calories it contains just outright destroys all the benefits if you were to drink cans of coke you wouldn't be filling your body with anywhere near the amount of calories and grams of sugar and carbs found in juice you're better off having a whole piece of fruit number 9 sports drinks this product is aimed at Olympians and athletes those who push their bodies beyond breaking point it wasn't aimed at guys who'd be ten sit-ups and call it a day these drinks contain liquid sugar and heavy salts and while they're generally considered slightly less unhealthy than soft drinks there really isn't much difference electrolytes will help you regain lost salts in your body but most people don't need this number eight margarine many don't understand the difference between margarine and butter and since butter got a bad rap back in the day because of the high saturated fat content most stick with margarine but here's a newsflash margarine isn't real food it's a frankenstein creation of oils and chemicals made to look and taste like butter studies have shown you are more likely to get a heart attack from eating toast with margarine than you do with butter butter preferably grass-fed is the way to go number seven fish as unbelievable as it sounds there are a couple of reasons fish aren't good for you they contain harmful toxins and actually have a slight risk of ending your life farmed fish unlike those caught fresh and wild are kept in horrifyingly bad conditions and prone to parasites and disease farmers combat this by pumping them full of antibiotics and chemicals then feed them gluten soy and junk grain until they end up dead and on your plate fish should be a part of any healthy diet just make sure you are ingesting wild-caught fish and not farm-raised fish number six energy bars energy bars are the perfect pre-workout snack right not always energy bars are filled with high fructose corn syrup added sugar and the artery-clogging saturated fat plus some bars contain more than 300 calories each that's a bit more than a snack size for most people it's a good idea to fuel up with the mix of high quality carbs and protein before an extended workout just choose wisely or make your own healthy granola bars number 5 dried fruit now this one sounds amazing because well it's fruit it's supposed to be healthy but there's something very basic that should be understood if you're gonna have a fresh and healthy product sit on the shelf for weeks on end you're gonna need to add something that will keep it from spoiling and sour preservatives dried fruit is loaded with sulfur and sugar to keep them from going bad which jacks up the calorie counts to insane degrees number 4 pretzels thanks to a lingering effect of the 1980s fat-free craze many regard pretzels is a healthy snack but there's not much to say about pretzels nutritionally that make them a good snack choice usually made from refined flour pretzels are low in vitamins fat protein fiber and minerals which is why you still feel pretty hungry after eating them if you're craving a salty snack opt for one with a little protein and fiber to help keep you full and satisfied such a handful of nuts number three yogurt covered snacks sugar partially hydrogenated oil milk powder and yogurt powder are just a few of the ingredients that make up the so called yogurt covering on raisins almonds and pretzels these yogurt coatings obviously don't offer the same nutritious punch as yogurt and actually adds saturated fat sugar and trans fat because of this these snacks should be treated as an occasional sweet treat number 2 trail mix certain nuts and seeds are actually good for you but trail mix is much more than that most supermarket versions come with yogurt chunks candy pieces in deep fried fruit pieces all loaded with calories sugars refined carbs and trans fats 1/4 cup of trail mix can be almost a hundred and seventy-five calories not including the added sodium and sugar you're ingesting number one vegetable oils we're often advised to eat vegetable oils this includes soybean oil grapeseed oil canola oil and numerous others this space on the fact these oils have been shown to lower blood cholesterol levels at least in the short term it's important to keep in mind that blood cholesterol is a risk factor not a disease in itself even though vegetable oils can improve a risk there is no guarantee that it will help prevent heart attacks in fact several controlled trials have shown that despite lowering cholesterol these oils can increase the risk of death so eat healthy natural fats like butter olive oil and coconut oil [Music]", "NPtmAFKR0Nw": "[Music] joining me now is Ian Culbert he's the executive director of the Canadian public health association thanks very much for joining us my pleasure let's walk through this I mean I guess first of all just your general general reactions to what we saw today we're really very pleased because we do believe that the federal government is taking a public health approach to the legalization and regulation of edible products that are have a cannabis basis to them and that's really important because there's obviously a demand for these products they need to be manufactured in a safe way we need to know what how potent the products are but most importantly the consumer needs to educate themselves about using these products why they delay because a lot of Canadians I mean who didn't follow the debate were were unaware why it was going to take a little extra time to deal with regulate and and and control the edibles and pointment sand extracts well the legalization and regulation of cannabis in Canada is a massive change in policy they estimated that there were somewhere near to 16,000 decision points just for the legalization of the dried substance and then when you add edibles to that the levels of complexity just magnified so they just need an extra time to be able to get it right it's certainly one of the lessons that we learn from others jurisdictions if you try to do too much too fast you end up making hasty regulation that really doesn't satisfy the requirements okay I want to get to I mean one of the interesting things is that in the new regulations they divide this whole field into three different categories edibles cannabis extracts and cannabis topicals so while topicals would be like pointment saw Royals what are the three categories and why would they be divided up into three like that well it really comes down to how they're going to be used and so they're going to you need to know your potency differently depending on how you're using it an ointment for example a topical can be absorbed very quickly into your system and can be probably one of the more potent ways of consuming it an edible you're going to digest and then it's taken through your digestive system so it is its effect takes much longer to feel but can last much longer so they are very different topics even though THC is the underlying component in all of them and extracts in all of this what were the extracts be that with extracts are specific oils that you can then be using to you make your own products with what were your concerns for example I mean there have been concerns expressed for example people refer to Colorado and there was big problems that they were they encountered with their legalization of edibles what were the concerns and and do you think we are going to be avoiding them we have learned a lot of the lessons from jurisdictions such as Colorado certainly the number one problem there was the entire legalization process was driven by the industry and in Canada public safety has been involved health has been involved public health hasn't been involved and really driving it from a very different perspective but we've also learned the lessons of you need to be more restrictive in the beginning and perhaps people say well there's too many rules and and you're not allowing us enough flexibility we will learn that over time and if it makes sense to loosen regulations it's much easier to do that than to tighten regulations one of the things that I saw in the regulations is that they're not going to allow products that mix alcohol and cannabis and they're not going to allow products that mix tobacco and cannabis why not well certainly we don't want anyone using tobacco it is cancer-causing substance it is one of the leading causes of death in this country we do not want you mixing tobacco with cannabis ever we don't want you mixing alcohol with THC because the effect on the human body is unpredictable and it's very specific you're actually combining two substances that shouldn't be going together so even if they're not allowed in a substance an important message to consumers is never consume them at the same time if separate so we've seen situations of people out for the evening in a nightclub and consuming alcohol and then they have an edible and the results can be quite definite okay the Canadian Public Health Association you were in favor of legalization for up on a public health basis one of the arguments was if we make it legal we can control it and we can etc etc as you know though one of the key things was getting the legal market surpassing the illicit market there's been a lot of reports in the last eight months I mean it's you can argue it's still early but there's been a lot of reports that in provinces like Ontario and others there they haven't even made a dent in the the the production and the legal legal sales haven't really met the demand so if your goal is to do replace the illicit market we're not doing very well is there a concern in bringing in this 2.7 billion dollar new industry that a lot of the production will just go to that area and we still won't be making a big enough dent in replacing the illegal product well from our perspective we were never expecting the legal market to overtake the illegal market in the short term we're talking about five to ten years before you really see the illegal market being overshadowed by the legal market that was our expectation because we're creating a brand new legal industry and so it takes time and so I would say Canada in Canada we've done quite well for people who have been regular users of cannabis products and they have their guy that they get their product from right now there's not a lot of incentive for them to move away from that supplier cost and availability are both cited as big problems the province is where the cost is nowhere near it is much more expensive than your guy is exactly and over time I think we're going to see closer to parity between the illegal and legal markets as the legal market just catches up it's the the rate of growth is astronomical in this industry and with any fast-growing industry it takes time to work all of the things out and to get your economies of scale working so I'm not displeased with the progress that we've made because I know that it will take a significant amount of time your biggest concern is it children consuming probably cuz one of the other jurisdictions I mentioned Colorado in place I got you know when you have candy products with THC and other substances in it and it's what how do these regulations address that concern about not making this very attractive to children well in addition to not mixing these products with tobacco or alcohol you can't have additives such as caffeine or sugar or colorants and they can't be shaped in such a way that they're going to be attractive to children so important lessons learned from Colorado we're not going to have quote-unquote gummy bears infused with THC that's really important the the most important thing is for consumers is if you have an edible product in your house or a topical or an oil you need to lock that up if you have small children in the house because they cannot tell the difference and it seems strange we tell people lock up your liquor cabinet you should be locking up your cannabis as well is there is that just more of a question of public education regulation is not gonna cover the line no it won't it is education it came that message out there that this is a serious product that we're talking about it can do harm to children we're talking about a poisoning not death but a serious poisoning that we want to avoid but that goes for adults too if you have not consumed these products and consumed them as an edible you need to educate yourself start slow and go slow I'll ask you a big question but it could maybe have a just an easy answer it was eight months ago that the legalization came about there was so much media attention there's so much public attention to that October 17th deadline we're now eight months in a net we're now going to on the year anniversary have edibles how does the Canada Public Health Canadian public health agency help organization how do you evaluate how we've dealt with this as a country evaluation is a big part of what the work that still needs to be done we at a National Forum in Ottawa just a month and a half ago that talked about that the early results are that fairly we're doing fairly well it's been a as I say a massive policy change in this country with potentially over 16,000 decision points at different levels of government still lots of work to be done but was an important step you could delay in delay until you have every decision made but quite honestly the environment keeps changing and so you have to adjust as you go so I would say so far we're doing well we just have to remain vigilant and continue to do that evaluation okay well I want to thank you very much for coming in and we will no doubt be having other interviews on this as we monitor this as it rolls out thank you very much my pleasure [Music]", "59KugzL639A": "[Music] my name is just Pinkerton for those who have not met me my husband and I opened CrossFit vitality 10 years ago it's always been my passion to help people achieve their goals when it comes to fitness and nutrition and overall health I have a bachelor's degree in biology and exercise science and a master's degree in health promotion and health education so the nutrition really has been my passion though so I really love these challenges at the beginning of the year getting people started off on a good track and then helping you hopefully maintain that all year round making this a lifestyle so I'm going to explain both the paleo and the ketogenic diet tonight um I'm gonna talk from the speak from the scientific literature and the research and it will also be speaking from my own personal experience because I've done both of these diets for extended periods of time I've done paleo for six years when we first started our Hospital in 2009 that was paleo was really big on a scene it was all the rage it's just getting started off so we Steve and I jumped on board and we loved paleo did that for six years and then about five years ago I started seeing a lot of research about the ketogenic diet and the benefits so I said I'm gonna try this maybe just for two months get keto adapted and then probably go back to paly well I'm coming up on my five-year keto anniversary this year so I've been doing keto for four and a half years and love that as well so I'm gonna speak to guys about both these diets tonight so the challenge details like I said we have both the Paleo and keto option hopefully when you leave here tonight you'll be very clear on which one is gonna be right for you okay that's my goal so it's six weeks we're starting Monday in January sixth and it ends at midnight February 16th so six weeks in total but again it's always my goal to have you guys carry this on throughout the year throughout a long period of time and not make it six weeks and then go back to our old habits we always do a potluck at the midway point so I always I want to put this date in your calendar January 25th it will be here upstairs that vitality will have both Aikido and a paleo potluck it's a lot of fun because at that time we all have a favorite recipe everybody makes their favorite recipe they bring in the recipe to share an exchange and we have a little friendly competition we vote on the best dish and there's a little prize baskets involved so that's always a lot of fun we want to give you guys new ideas so you don't get bored of the same things the real biggest value of the challenge is the Facebook group okay so some of you do not have Facebook I would highly recommend making an account even if it's in a false name and alias if you don't wanna be involved with everything else with Facebook just join this private group because that's how I communicate with you guys I went on there all day every day those of you who have done challenges in the past I post multiple times post recipes ideas you can share ideas share recipes vent if you're having a tough day tell us some good things that are happening and everybody will kind of chime it so it's a lot of fun and it creates a good kind of community so definitely I want to make sure if you're doing the Challenger part of that Facebook group there'll be a separate one for keto separate one for paleo and the criteria for kind of winning the challenge we do in body scans which if you haven't been on the new embody scale we found this for a few years now but it is a great way for us to measure body composition so it uses bioelectrical impedance analysis to tell us your percent body fat your muscle minimus your body water and how they change over time so we'll do it at the beginning of the challenge and the end of the challenge to be able to kind of compare so it's we're really cool to see those changes we also do the before-and-after pictures and then we have a baseline workout so if you're not a member you can't technically win the challenge because we won't have your baseline workout but definitely you can still participate in the challenge and still get the benefit the baseline workout will be Monday in any CrossFit or even fit class time that you come to and it will be the 16th at the end of the challenge the exact same workout so we can compare how your performance increases with six weeks of strict Aikido or strict paleo okay so we take all of those things into consideration when determining our male and female overall winner of the challenge so this is what the embody scan looks like it may seem intimidating but really you step on it it takes under two minutes takes longer to enter your name than anything else and then you get a printout to take home with you that shows you all of these metrics it shows you where your muscle is located on your body how many pounds of muscle you have in each segment of your body it grabs out any time you come in so you'll have a data point from the beginning of the challenge and a data point from the end of the challenge then if you want to do any more throughout the year it'll kind of gross out to show your results so really good metric to help us keep accountable throughout the challenge and hopefully throughout the year all right so to get started going to go and kind of break it down into basics so the macronutrients what is our food composed of we've got to understand that before we can understand these diets and the first mentor new trainer to talk about is approaching very important it is the building blocks of our muscles and tissues okay so it's composed of the amino acids it's essential for building muscle mass and we should all strive to have more muscle mass because as we age the odds are against us and that's what makes us non-functional as we get older so the more muscle we can maintain and even gain as we get older the really the younger we are so examples of good protein sources beef chicken turkey pork fish eggs and protein powders and shapes so you can see all of these are animal-based proteins and the reason I like animal-based proteins is because they are the only proteins that are a complete profile of essential amino acids so essential amino acids just means we cannot make them internally we have to get them from our diet and plant these proteins don't make up those essential amino acids so I'd like to get them from real whole food animal based sources if we're gonna do proteins that can be very convenient I like to do either away a clean whey protein like what we have downstairs is stronger faster healthier is from grass-fed cows I like an egg protein or a beef protein isolate would be good options if you can't get in a real full food source and protein is also the highest thermic effect of food meaning that when you consume protein it takes about 25% of the energy from that protein to digest it okay so that's three times more energy than it takes to digest carbs or fats you're getting that little benefit when you eat protein the next category of macronutrients is fat and if that is very important it makes up every cell membrane in your body it's essential for proper brain and hormonal function it actually makes our performance that intellectual makeup challenge it slows the rate of gastric emptying so it means it stays in our stomach longer keeping us feeling full and satisfied longer and it's the most powerful source of fuel for our body so if we think of an analogy of a campfire the fat is like the logs on fire okay it takes a little while to get it to ignite but once it does it burns longer it burns more clean than a kosher carbohydrates so the good fats what are we talking about healthy fats are coconut product products anything from full coconut to coconut oil coconut milk all great sources of fat olive oil avocado avocado oil nuts and butter all these are going to be really good and healthy anti inflammatory types of fats the fats we want to stay away from are the vegetable when okay so canola oil corn soybean oil vegetable oil trans fats and margarine and there's a lot of research out there on these nowadays showing just how toxic these things are to our body so here's some examples of what we want to stay away from but what happens with these seed oils is that to extract oil from any type of sea it has to be exposed to extreme heat and toxic chemicals so in that process it renders that oil toxic to our bodies it forms what's called toxic aldehyde which causes a lot of inflammation okay we know inflammation is the root cause of all of our chronic diseases today a lot of it comes from sugar but a lot of it comes from these processed vegetable oils too so things like margarine it's also called partially hydrogenated or hydrogenated vegetable oil canola soybean oil now if you go out to eat every restaurant it could be the nicest restaurant it's gonna use these type of oils because they are cheap okay so they're gonna fry eggs in them and just tell people if you enjoy that you need to be able to go out and eat but when you're at home do the best you can to avoid these don't have these that you're in your home use the olive oil to avocado oil instead um mayonnaise and salad dressings 99% of them at the grocery store are canola or soybean oil based so those really aren't healthy options but there are some healthy options for Mayo and salad dressing so have you heard of the primal kitchen brand or the cert Kensington brand there avocado oil based so a really healthy type of oil that's going to be a much better option coconut oil is great olive oil Kerrygold butter it's a it's a butter made from the melt of grass-fed cows and then of course avocados and nuts are going to be really good healthy fats on either a paleo or ketogenic diet alright the third category macronutrients are carbohydrates and this is kind of a large encompassing category examples of carbs what we think of that mostly is bread pasta cereal rice and grains that's what we know as high carb foods but candy and soda also are involved in that category the sweets fruits and vegetables and I highlighted these because these are the only two categories of carbohydrates that will be allowed during the challenge vegetables for keto and then fruits and vegetables for paleo okay so the other cards are not good for us and we'll talk about why cards are the easiest energy source for our body so if we go back to that campfire analogy they are like the little little pieces of newspaper and twigs okay they get the fire burning pretty hot but it burns out really quickly so if you think about a standard American breakfast okay maybe a bowl of cereal with some skim milk a banana a glass of orange juice on the side all of that is carbohydrate so you might feel good as you leave the house but by the time you get to work or school or the gym you're gonna be coming down and your blood sugar is gonna be coming down you're gonna be starting to crave more carbohydrates whereas if you had a little bit of fat and protein in your breakfast maybe some NES and bacon a side of fruit or avocado you would be satiated and have steady blood sugar throughout the whole morning okay so that's what we're gonna kind of focus on and what one thing to think about is that whether the cards come from a pop-tart or a soda or a carrot or an apple they all break down to the same thing which is simple sugar glucose in our bloodstream so the only difference when you consume like a carrot or an out bowl is that you get some fiber and some vitamins and minerals whereas the pop chart so that's just entirely empty calories all right so let's look at the macronutrient breakdown of these different diets so you can kind of put this all into perspective so we're gonna start with what's called the standard American diet it's kind of ironic that that acronym is that sound diet but right now our current standard American diet is 1/2 carbohydrates we got out 20% protein 27 years on fat when we compare that to a Paleo diet there's a quite a reduction in part so it's about 25% of the diet coming from carbohydrates in a Paleo diet and then about equal portions of fat and protein going from paleo taquitos you can see that the carbohydrate con is even less okay it's you know between 5 and 10% carbs maybe 13 to 25 percent protein and then it can be from 55 to even 80% fat so a lot higher fat on the keto now paleo is what we call macronutrient agnostic there's really not a set of macro nutrient ratios that you have to follow it's more about the quality of foods so if you're eating good quality foods and I will outline them for you on the Paleo diet it really doesn't matter the quantity there's no specific ratios or amounts of protein carbs and fats with keto it's a little different because we want to get our bodies into a state of nutritional ketosis and to do that we have to keep cards low extremely low for an extended period of time so I want to show you this this looks like a traditional pie chart for a ketogenic diet of someone who's just starting it and going through the keto adaptation phase or if you've never done keto before the more fat the better we've got a really tell your system that is the predominant fuel source the carbs aren't coming in we want you to start using cars or sorry start using fat as the prodigal source but as you get keto adapted which can take between six weeks to six months that's kind of different for everyone when you really start feeling good with a ketogenic diet you can back off your dietary fat if your goal is fat loss because you want more of the fat coming from your body fat stores if that makes them so it doesn't always have to look like 80 percent fat it can be it can come down but in the beginning like I said if you're new to keto we've got to start out with quite a bit of fat and very low carbs over time after working with people on this diet for over five years now I've realized that once people have been doing heater for a while they are testing their ketones or in ketosis we back down the dietary fat a bit so now that might look more like 55% fat from you know 70 or 80 percent and we add a little more protein and a little more card to it so if you've done queue for a while this could be something used during this challenge but if it's your first time its kind of really kind of the more fat the better so if we're going to endorse a diet that really encourages the fat content to be high I want you guys to really understand that that is not bad for you that is not what's gonna make you fat as long as it's not consumed in conjunction with a high carbohydrate diet which is what the standard American diet is so if we think about a doughnut it's high fat and high carb if we think about a burger with a bun and a side of fries it's high fat and high carbs you've bought a pizza highest fat and high carbs but if you take out the carbs those fats are extremely healthy for us okay so I want to show you guys part of a documentary this is called fat head and it does a great job of explaining why we went wrong and why for so long people thought that was not good for us so just really have all of human history into one year we only been farming and eating brains since about yesterday which is when we became shorter and fatter we only started consuming processed vegetable oils about 10 minutes ago which is when heart disease became our number one killer so after examining all this human history experts came to the obvious conclusion we need to eat a lot more of these and so they convinced us that human health depends on foods we didn't eat for more than 99% of our entire existence how did this happen in the 1950s a biochemist named Ancel Keys published a study that compared heart disease and fat consumption in capitalism countries the more fact the more heart disease the trend line was unmistakable just one little problem keeps left out countries where people eat a lot of fat would have very little heart disease like Holland in Norway he also left out countries where people don't eat much fat but do have a lot of heart disease like Chile in fact Kings have reliable data from 22 countries and the results are all over the place Raja can make a big splash in the scientific community with a trendline that looks like this so Kees did what any dedicated researcher would do he drew out the data that didn't fit and published his results his punishment for this bit of scientific chicanery was to get his picture on the cover of Time magazine Kings became known as the father of the lipid hypothesis which says that eating saturated fat raises the cholesterol in your blood and high cholesterol in your blood clogs your arteries and causes heart disease the hypothesis that when you eat high fat that then that produces high cholesterol and their cholesterol produces hype disease is wrong in every one of those links this whole idea that dietary fat causes cholesterol problems is sort of a myth the whole idea that cholesterol problems lead to heart disease is a myth the theory is completely entirely wrong it was a theory that was made out of cloth and then pushed the the tongue artery-clogging saturated fat it's as though it's a homework [Music] it's become part of the zeitgeist everybody knows saturated fat is bad for you but when you give back and you start looking at the medical literature and you're through to find out where this whole idea came from it's bogus three authors who did route through the medical literature our science writer Gary towels Swedish doctor goofy Robbins Paul and British dr. malcolm kendrick when they examined the data from all the big Studies on heart disease they discovered some pretty interesting facts here's my favorite guess how many studies actually prove that a high-fat diet causes heart disease the answer zero that so I watch all of this of course but it's a great documentary if you guys have more time that's called fat and you can watch it on Netflix but um I kind of does a great job explaining why one scientist back in the 1950s really kind of started this low-fat craze and what came out of that was the first USDA Dietary Guidelines so if you guys remember the food guide pyramid okay that stemmed from his research that was developed from Keyes's research and that's fun to have six to 11 servings of greens a day a whole face of the pyramid was brains then some fruits and veggies than a little bit of meats and dairy very little fast up at the top okay so that's what we were told so in 1980 I like to show this this is a map of the US the percent of obesity in the US and 1980 and it's hard to read but on the key you can see that there is no state in the US that had more than a 14% obesity rate okay fast-forward to our last last CDC report from 2018 there is no state in the US that has less than a 20% obesity rate so crazy something big happened between these two time periods and you can also see here this is the rate of obesity in the u.s. again this is the year 1980 when those dietary guidelines were published and it's been going up they spent so what happened as Americans we cut out animal more animal products who started eating less sweets less eggs less butter and we started increasing our cereal granola bars grains rice bread all of those things the USDA Dietary Guidelines told us but things are starting to change and now even a few years ago Time magazine came out with their big cover story eat butter why the science was wrong a cardiologist and the UK doctor esteem of Mehrotra came out with a documentary the big fat fix why fat is good for heart health that get thin there's so many different hide lines out there now trying to debunk this myth and we're actually discovering what the real culprit is these are headlines from the New York Times and The Daily Mail from several years ago 50 years ago sugar industry quietly paid scientists to point blame at fact reveals how the sugar industry paid prestigious Harvard researchers to say that not sugar causes heart disease so when it comes down to it it was it all involved a payoff and it's really sad because a lot of lives were negatively affected with the wrong information so how does this work well if you guys think about a clean healthy blood vessel it's nice and smooth okay a clean healthy artery but when we consume a lot of fruits mined and processed sugars in our diet actually a brillo pad so that sugar scratches up the insides of that nice smooth arterial lining and causes little lacerations and those last short lacerations bring about inflammation and the inflammation is what causes plaque to build up there okay so it's not the saturated fat or the cholesterol it's the fact that sugar is damaging the blood vessels and that inflammation is causing our gross gross and ass or heart disease so over carbs sumption I love this term this is the chronic overconsumption of super normally stimulating nutrient poor carbohydrate-rich foods these are the foods we tend to overeat I call them food without brakes because you can't stop at just one serving and they were designed this way in a lab somewhere to sabotage and hijack our neuro regulation of appetite so everyone in here we were all born with the ability to know when we are full and satisfied and to stop eating but when we eat these super normally stimulating nutrient-poor foods it hydrate hijacks that neural regulation so we don't realize that we're full it would burn through it we have a blood sugar crash and we want more okay so these are the things we take them out of our diet it's so much easier to eat real Whole Foods and not crave them anymore alright so just some other statistics about carbs and sugar Americans consume an average of a 150 pounds of sugar a year okay so if you guys think about the five-pound bags you see at the grocery store and that would be 30 of them staffed up for one individual it equates to 22 teaspoons a day so we can all visualize a teaspoon here's 22 of them a spoonful all right so 22 teaspoons when the recommendation for optimal health is 6 teaspoons or less for women and children and nine teaspoons or less for males so we're getting over three times the recommendation and that is one good thing that came out of the latest USDA Dietary Guidelines they're published every five years so the last one was 2015 it was the first time they put a limit on dietary sugar and they also took the limit off of dietary fat and cholesterol so things are moving in the right direction there'll be a new guidelines published in 2020 so I'm anxious to see what that what comes about with that um but knowing these values I want to show you you'd be blown away by just some common foods in the amount of sugar that is in them so remember six teaspoons are less for women and children nine teaspoons or less for men and this is added sugar guys so it's not the sugar that is kind of naturally found in products okay this is the limit on added sugar so a can of soda nine teaspoons of added sugar there's your limit for the day a candy bar 8 teaspoons a small Starbucks strength a lemon a cup of orange juice 60 Spurs now that's not added that's what's actually in the oranges but it takes three oranges to make a cup of orange juice we would never eat three oranges right because they have the fiber and they would fill us up beforehand we can easily drink a cup of orange juice that's why juice isn't that great for us a lot of people think it's healthy but it has the same effect on our blood sugar and insulin as soda does it just has a little bit of vitamins and minerals along with it and then Light & Fit Greek yogurt we all think yogurt is healthy their seventy's or sentence of added sugar in most yogurts sometimes it's even more than that that's an individual size and then a serving of an ice cream 5 teaspoons but I always have to point this out because a serving of ice cream is a half a cup who eats a half cup so it's the size of a small lemon here so it's at least 10 teaspoons of sugar when most of us have ice cream maybe even more than that but one other statistic I'd like to share is that the average eight-year-old living today has already had more sugar in their eight years of life than someone living a century ago a hundred years like their grandmother had in their entire lifetime eight years so it's crazy how much sugar we have in our diet that's something that definitely has to change I'm gonna mention teaspoons here because we can visualize teaspoons but it doesn't show us teaspoons on a nutrition label who remembers what would it's as a nutrition label for sugar yes it's in grams so it makes it very abstract so I want you guys to remember each teaspoon of sugar is 4 grams okay 4 grams so if you're looking at a label and you do the math on that for females 6 teaspoons would be 6 times for 24 grams each to your limits for the day males 9 times for 36 grams for the day and that comes really quickly I mean if you look at condiments things like ketchup all of that tons of added sugar I also there are a lot of different is out there so if you're looking at an ingredient label it may not then usually doesn't just say sugar it's gonna be super O's or fructose or multi dextran anything that has the suffix O's or the words agave corn cane syrup or rice those are all kind of key words and no are sugar so we want to stay away from those as much as possible in the American diet sucrose and high fructose corn syrup are the two most common forms of sugar used so briefly I just want to make sure everybody knows how to look at a nutrition label this is for a kind bar okay so when you look under the carbohydrate section it's gonna break it up by how much fiber isn't it and then the total sugar and a new thing that's me and David's if we put on all nutrition labels by next year is the added sugars which I love that because it makes us eat it makes a lot easier for us to tell how many sugars are naturally naturally occurring at product versus added to it alright so you can see of all the seven sugars in this bar they are all added okay and if we look at the ingredient label when you're reading ingredient labels the the first ingredient is the most prevalent in the product okay and then it goes down in prevalence as it gets the last ingredient is the least alright so in this product you can see the second ingredient is sugar then it has tapioca syrup brown rice syrup and honey so several different forms of sugar added to us we know it would not be a good option a good option on the other hand would be like a beef jerky that has no sugar so when we look at the carbohydrate section here total sugar is zero and no added sugar all the ingredients are real Whole Foods so that's the kind of thing we're looking for for either paleo or keto it's more important on keto to stay away from the sugars but heylia doesn't include added sugars as well alright so how does this work well sugar and insulin are what caused fat gain and profit prevent fat loss and the way that works is that insulin is our storage hormone okay so it is secreted by 15 in response to carbohydrates coming in from our meals so this is an example of a piece of white bread so you can see as we ingest that way bread or it's our glucose or blood sugar level increases and at the same time our insulin increases because influenza job is to take that glucose out of the blood vessel and store it for later because we saw what can happen when glucose stays in the blood vessel makes those lacerations it's not a good thing and our body works really hard to control our blood glucose to have just one teaspoon of sugar circulating in our whole blood circulation at any given time so about four to five stores it alright the first place it's going to be stored is in our liver and muscle glycogen those are the only places in our body where we can store sugar okay once those are full which fill up with under 2,000 calories of sugar or glycogen and everything excess of that is going to be stored as fat okay and we are really good at storing excess calories as well because in our ancestors days they had to do that they didn't know when their next meal was coming when they come across the next herd of buffalo or the next Bush that had berries on it or something so they got really good at storing extra calories and extra sugar as fat but fast-forward to today there's a vending machine gun every poll there's a gas station or fast-food restaurant on every corner we don't really have time so famine but we're still as good at storing excess calories as fact the other thing when insulin is chronically elevated is that we are not able to tap into our fast stores so if you guys think of the excess energy on our bodies like our refrigerator think about it as a refrigerator that we should be able to open and pull from in times between meals okay say we forgot to pack lunch our meeting ran over our waiters taking forever whatever it is we shouldn't get hungry if we're metabolically efficient and able to tap into that refrigerator and our fat stores but when insulin is chronically higher than a standard American diet it's like putting a walk around our fast I'm not able to access them all right and carbs are addictive they obviously are fuel for our body but they are also a drug so the same receptor sites in our brain responds to the opiates and heroin and cocaine also respond to sugar so this is a PET scan of the brain and you can see the same segments of the blame brain laid up with cocaine and sugar showing that addictive nature there's also a great example of a mouse study where the researcher has put my mice in a crate on one side of the crate they put a dropper of liquid cocaine so within a day all those mice were addictive they also had a fuel source some food to eat but the next day they put an identical dropper on the other side of the crate of sugar water and after those mice had gone to the sugar water they never went back to the cocaine so it just shows how addictive sugar is and it's legal so I know we're surrounded by it right it's cheap Oh so one of the big similarities between paleo and keto is they both restrict added sugar and that's really important what happens when we do take out that sugar though and especially coming off the holidays I know it's hard over the holidays we've all had some things maybe wouldn't normally we're gonna have what we call hard flu or sugar flu paleo flu or keto flu going into these challenges and so what that entails is fatigue you could be a little more tired than usual sugar withdrawals you could actually start like sweating when you're having these cravings because your body is like give me this fuel source that I'm most used to being able to digest and use sugar cravings of course moodiness you might just want to tell your co-workers or your family members give you a little space just for the first few days um possible digestive distress okay so any time you're changing up your diet you're gonna change up your gut microbiomes those little bacteria that live in your gut and that's gonna cause a little bit of distress and it happens more so on the keto diet if you're come from a diet that's pretty low fat and then going into a ketogenic diet adding that much fat it takes some time for your bile which emulsifies fat to upregulate it takes some time to upgrade elite your lipase enzyme which breaks down fat so you can have some digestive issues in the beginning diarrhea is kind of common just prepare yourself for that it's not abnormal at all it doesn't last long as your body you know up regulates that bile production and those enzymes and then headache and leg cramps these are usually an electrolyte issue so if we're cutting carbs from our diet our kidneys don't retain the sodium potassium and magnesium like they normally would and so you have to replenish that if you get a dull headache a little bit of pink Himalayan salt really helps drinking some water leg cramps like at your counter you have to sit up in the night that's an electrolyte issue as well and that can happen at the beginning so some remedies like I said the salts can be important coffee can be your best friend because we you are going to be a little more tired coming off of the sugar and the carbohydrates coffee can give you a little caffeine in the afternoon and then lots of water to help you detox oh and then have compliant snacks with you at all times guys so that if you're in a weak moment you won't grab you know something from the M&M jar that's on your desk or something so it complains nice for nuts beef jerky deli meat hard-boiled eggs if you're doing paleo fruit if you're doing keto cheese sticks those things you can you know have with you have a little cooler or you know leave in your purse so that you have an option all right so let's start in where to first talk about the Paleo diet alright um this is the way our Paleolithic ancestors ate tens of thousands of years ago and they ate this way for 2.5 million years so I hope you guys caught it on the beginning of the video but I love that analogy I said if you can fit all of human history into one one year we've just started consuming the processed foods the refined sugars the vegetable oils and the flowers and grains yesterday okay we just are leading yesterday so for 99% of our existence we ate hunter-gatherer type foods our genetics are not wired for modern food environment ok so they ate foods that are in the ground around trees they animals they were able to hunt or fish and it was a time when sugar was not readily available so a list of paleo foods here they are any vegetables all nuts and seeds some fruit and little starch and why do they put a limit on that because remember paleo is macro nutrient agnostic there's no specific ratios but if you are wanting to lose fat fruit and starchy potatoes few potatoes root vegetables can have the same effect on our blood glucose and insulin as greens and so we can do some of those but if your goal is fat loss we don't want to overdo those even on paleo and then no added sugar let's put simply there fill your plate with some animals some plants and have water it's simple that does not mean it's easy at least of the beginning and then what can we have on paleo well diri dairies a big one and that's a big difference between keto and paleo so keto does allow some dairy paleo does not ok so no dairy on a paleo diet that means no cheese any type of milk we can do almond milk or coconut milk but no dairy products no grains so brands include everything from breads rice pasta cereal oatmeal corn is agreeing all the corn as a vegetable quinoa is a grain legumes so legumes are basically beans now green beans are OK by most paleo experts but things like kidney beans garbanzo beans black beans lima beans chickpeas hummus soy beans edamame soy sauce anything a soy base would be included with that legumes and peanuts are actually illegal laboum they're not enough so peanuts and peanut butter would be off for paleo as well as sugars like we mentioned and then the inflammatory oils of course so if you are deciding to do the Paleo diet one use I've already put in the Facebook group mmm PDFs of all of this so you'll see lists of what is allowed what isn't allowed so it's more clear to you than just yes so what are the benefits of okay okay I wouldn't want to do paleo in the first place well it reverses type-2 diabetes because again we're bringing the carb content down from the standard American diet that bears insulin levels down and it hopes bring back what we call insulin sensitivity and that's huge because in our society one in three Americans are insulin resistant so they're on their way to developing type 2 diabetes which leads to obesity which leads to heart disease which leads to stroke and cancer so if we can nip it in the bud now cutting back on the sugars we can reverse that which is huge it can reverse and prevent heart disease the number one killer in our country it can treat ulcerative colitis Crohn's and celiac which are all diseases of the digestive tract and usually the cause of either lactose which is a sugar found in dairy or gluten which is a protein found in grains so these things kind of wreak havoc on our digestive system and they cause diarrhea constipation bloating inflammation all of that goes narrow in the Paleo diet it strengthens our immune system because eighty percent of our immune system is located in the gut so when we heal our gut we're not gonna get sick as often so that's a huge benefit not getting things like the common cold every year it helps them develop lean muscle mass to fuel our metabolism so again more muscle we have on our body the more the more calories we're burning even at rest and that promotes fat loss so all of those things are a great benefit and then finally it improves our workout performance and we could all use that and this is another difference between paleo and keto they both will improve workout performance you should Leo will do that within the course of this six week challenge kedo it may take longer for a lot of people because Kyo is a full metabolic shift ok member kellyo we're just focusing on quality foods real Whole Foods keto we're telling our bodies that you've been burning glucose as your primary fuel source for however many years you've been alive now we're gonna change it up and burn its back so it's gonna take your body some time and workout performance can take a dip in the first few weeks so kind of just prepare for that hey Leo I can kind of take a dip as well but it comes back up a little quicker so let's go through a sample day on the Paleo diet to see if these are even who do you be interested in okay so breakfast could be eggs scrambled with coconut milk you could scramble it along with some veggies spinach tomatoes and mushrooms have some bacon some red skin potatoes on the side and then you could do coffee with coconut or almond milk creamer so a lot of people are like me I know I'm not going to really give up my coffee mate Kraemer I know that's tough but usually by the end of the challenge people are like oh my gosh I don't even I love black coffee people that never thought they would your black coffee or drinking black coffee or using one of these options and liking it just as well so any of these would be fine I think one has maybe two grams of sugar but the nut pods has no added sugar it's just a flavoring along with the coconut milk so try those and like I said the coffee can be a good a big crunch in the beginning yeah so butter or ghee which is clarified butter I'm fine on either plan so that's kind of an exception because your Rhea butter and Yi are technically dairy but they have the lactose which is the milk protein are the most sugar removed so a lot of times they are not problematic at all now some people are still they have issues with butter but they can do ghee other people can't do either so if it's not upsetting your digestive system that's fine snack option could be a protein shake a scoop of whey protein water or unsweetened coconut or almond milk out we have an apple with almond butter okay so a good snap if you're at the grind any of those options are gonna be great we use monk fruit which is a very key to a paleo friendly sweetener and the protein you just stevia so another good good one potential lunch options Jimmy John's there on which the lettuce wrap they'll let us wrap any of their subs hint to the cheese so you could always do double meat to make sure it's it fills you up you could do jackson's honest potato chips are awesome the only three ingredients are sweet potatoes sea salt and coconut oil so really good healthy option if you want to chip another option could be grilled steamed broccoli and a salad basically leftovers from the night before up there is a picture of one of the chopped and chiseled meals that's the flank steak so we have a new food delivery company that delivers to the gym we have those grab and go meals down in the cooler all week long so if you're ever in a bind there's keto and paleo friendly options there I try to make it as easy for you guys to be compliant as possible another snack option in the afternoon you could do a hard-boiled eight or to half an avocado and a handful of strawberries so that would be a good filling snack and then dinner you could do meatballs sweet potato and broccoli or zoodles so zoodles are great pasta alternative you can get this little machine on Amazon or you can buy them already zoodles kind of gives you the feeling of pasta but without the carbs and the brains alright so that is sample day of paleo now I'm going to switch gears and talk a little bit about keto before we come back and learn about the differences between them so the ketogenic diet nutritional ketosis is the metabolic state in which the body is using fat as the predominant go source and the metabolic byproducts of fatty acid breakdown is what we call ketone bodies all right there's three of them and ketones are the only other substrate that can cross the blood-brain barrier and provide provide energy to the brain and they burn they brought a cleaner they give you more energy for the brain than glucose does but this this phenomenon is only possible when cars and insulin are kept low for an extended period of time so to think about this and understand this I kind of mentioned this earlier but think of a time when we've been at a restaurant and the waiters taking forever and the kitchens taking for effort it's past our dinnertime and we are hangry like we are getting mad and irritable and we are just starving okay that shouldn't happen because even the leanest individual has over 40,000 calories of energy on their body as stored fat okay even the weenus inter-individual so we should be able to tap in to those fat stores and not get angry in the restaurant okay the reason we can't is because we're on that carbohydrate roller coaster okay and our insulin is constantly elevated and we can't happen another analogy think about this shelf fuel truck okay we've also seen one of these on the highway the whole back of this is filled up with gasoline well imagine the irony of seeing that that truck pulled over to the side of the road because it's run out of gas okay so it's tiny little fuel tank here is empty and it can't tap into all of this fuel and it's got hanging out in that the back okay so and that's kind of the same thing that happens with humans when we don't have metabolic flexibility we've got the energy there to use but because we're constantly giving ourselves simple sugars and carbohydrates we can't tap into it alright so on the ketogenic diet like I said you you have to be a little bit more particular about your macronutrients and the biggest thing is the carbohydrate count so you can make it really easy by just getting your carbohydrates from veggies I'm gonna talk to you all about the keto friendly veggies you could pretty much have all you want of those but some of you might be you love gadgets you love finding exact numbers and tabulating things so in that case chronometer is a great app you can get it on your smart phone is a free app where you can log your food and it'll tell you what your karbala at the end of the day okay so ideally we want to keep our net carbs under 25 grams per day to get into ketosis and to stay in ketosis now what our net carbs because that's a whole other thing you're gonna hear about okay so net carbs are the total carbohydrate - the fiber because remember fiber doesn't get absorbed and assimilated in the body it just goes through the bowel it kind of provides bulk to our stool and it rids our body of any toxins in the digestive tract so it was a good thing all right so we can take something like an avocado which has 11 grams of carbs total carbs but when we subtract the fiber which is eight point five grams it really only has two and a half grams of net carbs so that's all we're worried about Aikido most people they see 11 grams of carbs and the ketogenic diet I wouldn't believe that that's too many carbs when you know it has a lot of fiber like avocados or like green leafy veggies broccoli cauliflower kale Brussels sprouts those things all have a ton of fiber so it's really it's hard to overeat any of those and so the ketogenic diet has been around since the 1920s it's not a fad diet like a lot of people will say it was used for a treatment for epilepsy especially children who wouldn't respond to traditional treatments so they weren't responding to the medications but if they upped their fat include oh no the carbs they were not having seizures so it's still used today for epilepsy and a lot of children and the ketogenic diet is completely safe we were born in a state of nutritional ketosis so that is our native state any of you who nursed babies you remember the first few days after they were born your breast month didn't come in and those babies were survived surviving and thriving because they were in a state of ketosis all right and nutritional ketosis is not ketoacidosis so some of you may have heard of this term this is a very acidic condition that happens in take 1 diabetics who do not do not have a functioning pancreas so if you don't have a functioning pancreas you don't produce insulin your ketones can go really high at the same time as your blood sugar hi and that can be very problematic but we're talking about levels of like 25 millimoles per deciliter in our ketone levels where nutritional ketosis is like 0.5 to maybe 7 millimoles per deciliter so two totally different things nutritional ketosis is totally safe alright and what are the benefits of a ketogenic diet well the first and what most people talk about is the fat loss and that happens pretty quickly pretty efficiently for a lot of people because when you cut the cards out and you're able to tap into those fat stores your body it's really good at storing or excuse me at using excess fat as fuel also ketones are muscle sparing so beta-hydroxybutyrate which is that main ketone body spares losing and losing is the main branch amino acid in charge of muscle protein synthesis so we have more leucine in our body we're not gonna we're gonna lose fat but at the same time we're not gonna lose a lot of muscle mass which happens a lot when you go on just a low calorie diet in general that won't happen on the ketogenic diet improved cognitive function so remember ketones cross the blood-brain barrier they cut they give good energy to the brain they take away that brain fog give you more mental clarity don't have that 3 p.m. kind of slump increased energy which is huge ketones provide 38% more energy than glucose and they provide less oxidative stress when they're metabolized in the system satiety this is one of the main reasons that I still do keto you know 4 and a half years later is because it is so nice to not be at the mercy of caring snacks around with me everywhere I go for years I had to do that and not only for myself but for my husband who's 340 con man would be constantly I have you know all kinds of beef jerky and fruit and nuts in my purse and it was just like you couldn't even go the grocery store without having a snack well with keto you can go out I have clean come in and tell me just I skipped lunch I got busy and ditched forgot to eat lunch and that's never happened in my life but that's what happens when you are metabolically flexible so imagine a diet where you don't have to use up your willpower I mean you're not missing things because your appetite is under control and so it's so much easier to avoid those often and foods so loss of the sugar cravings a desire to snack is huge and then reduced inflammation remember chronic inflammation is at the root cause of all of our diseases okay all of our major diseases in our society so again they have hydroxy butyrate that main ketone body prevents the accumulation of the nlrp3 inflammasome so it takes that inflammation out of our joint to recover better for workouts all of that good stuff alright so what are the best keto foods all right all of these things and again these will be on our Facebook group as well but be any kind of beef any type of chicken it can be the ladies the breast the white or dark meat any type of fish or shellfish or seafood any type of pork hippie the Tenderloin bacon sausage whole eggs definitely the yolk salami and pepperoni I've highlighted these three because these are the only things that are not allowed on on paleo anything else all of these other ones would also be allowed on paleo as well and this is the dairy products so again what about cheese sour cream heavy cream all part of a ketogenic diet full fat coconut no butter coconut oil avocado oil olive oil and then your fattier nuts so the best one to be walnuts macadamia nuts hazelnuts Brazil nuts and almonds the only notes you really need to be cautious of with keto are pistachios peanuts and cashews because those three are the highest in carbohydrates all right and then the keto veggies oh yeah any of these are good for paleo as well these are the low glycemic index vegetables okay these are what I was saying pretty much can't overdo these this is where your carbohydrates will come from on a ketogenic diet anything from asparagus broccoli cabbage cauliflower celery leafy greens Brussels sprouts peppers mushrooms onions zucchini and summer squash so again a little zoo de leur that's always a good idea for making zucchini noodles cauliflower could be your best friend because it can be anything these days you can make cauliflower rice it comes already pureed you can mash it up and make it like a cauliflower mash so yeah any of these veggies are going to be good and then the only difference with the Paleo ball is that we're adding the root vegetables so the starchy tubers things like sweet potatoes white potatoes butternut squash beets turnips parsnips all of those type of root vegetables and winter squashes would be good on the Paleo diet as well all right so a sample day on the ketogenic diet one potential breakfast is what we call bulletproof coffee so it sounds crazy and remember when I first heard about this I was like there's no way I'm ever trying this but it is really delicious and it helps you get into a state of ketosis so you would blend up a cup of coffee with a full tablespoon of grasping butter in here gold butter if you're a larger person you might do two tablespoons of grass-fed butter to keep you going a little longer and then MCT oil is the magic ingredient here and we'll see T stands for medium chain triglycerides so they are a special type of fat that are processed differently than any other type of fats with a 5 pounds the little system they go directly to the liver where they're converted to ketone bodies so it really does help you get into a state of ketosis the brain octane oil is the one I recommend you can order it on Amazon and get it earth fare but you're just gonna put a tablespoon in there if you like a sweeter coffee you could use Truvia which is a sweetener that doesn't affect like glucose or insulin levels and then you blend it all you can't just stir it you've got to blend it it gets frothy it gets creamy so that could be one option and it really is filling so you could do that I was lunch Monday if you're in a bind or an afternoon snack but an alternative breakfast if you don't like coffee could be more traditional eggs and bacon you know a scrambled some avocado um have an avocado two to three slices of bacon and some eggs that's very simple you could do hard-boiled eggs as well and have them on hand if you have to run out the door yes but yeah you don't really cook hmm you could you don't need as much fat in healio if you make your you know not doing as many of the starchy carbs then yes yeah um so much here's an example you could always do a Cobb salad if you're out they always have come Stanley lots of good keto appropriate foods there um dressings this primal kitchen has a whole line and you can get these on earth at earth sphere Target Harris Teeter they're everywhere now again they're off okada oil base not the soybean and canola oil you could do again Jimmy John's on which you could have the cheese on this one if you'd like with with keto you could make your own lemon straps with some ground beef make it like a taco or you can put deli meat in there as well with lettuce wraps this is actually what I do I do a dairy-free keto I have for the past nine months now and everyone's like that's crazy that's so hard and it was in the beginning because cheese is really good like I think it when you start keto you've got to do it with dairy to kind of you just transition yourself into that but I was like I just want to try it I had some joint pain and some inflammation and it can be inflammatory and some people so since April I've cut out the dairy and a staple in my diet is this primal kitchen Mayo because that's a really good source of avocado monounsaturated fat but it's dairy-free so that's my lunch aisle have its chicken that I chopped up actually get it from chopped and chiseled so it's already made I just chopped it up steam in the bag brussel sprouts I'm all about the steam in the bag vegetables because again it takes five minutes in the microwave chop up the brussel sprouts and then put a few tablespoons of this mayonnaise mix it all together with lots of salt and it's good to go so that's something that if you are trying to do it dairy-free it can be done so any of those would be good options dinner it could be a lettuce wrap burger patty you can put bacon and guacamole and so many places now have this option you guys bad entities will let us track any of their burgers Freddy's custard shop will do it even five guys I mean there's so many places out there just say I don't want the bun they'll let us wrap a burger um outside could be cauliflower rice which is very easy it comes pureed hook it up with some bacon some bacon grease and it's really good make cauliflower mac and cheese which is another really good keto friendly side another dinner action could be zoodles and meatballs so again you can get them already made the rouse sauce is great if you guys have seen that brand there's no sugar added and you can get that pretty much anywhere they even have it at BJ's and a really big big one snack ideas on keto again your appetite for snacks are gonna go down you're not gonna have as much tendency to snack but in the beginning you probably will want something so these are all great options the only ones you couldn't do on paleo would be the cheese and the cream cheese but anything from coconut flakes beef Jerky's par boiled eggs deviled eggs pork rinds if you've not have for crimes they are really good if you're missing like a salty crunchy potato chip okay and I like to ethnic brand this again there's no canola or soybean oil you dip them in the holy guacamole little individual packets salami pepperoni macadamia nuts olives deli meat all of that would be great so any questions on foods from either paleo or keto the sample days awesome so let's move let's move on to a little bit of you other similarities so we talked about the first similarity being that they both don't allow added sugar the second similarity is both diets don't include grains okay so remember from the video grains were only added to our diet about 10,000 years ago our bodies weren't didn't know how to process them for thousands and thousands of years so they're relatively new our genetics aren't really made to use them and they don't have many nutrients we're led to believe that there's a lot of vitamins and minerals those that are in them are fortified like in cereal they're fortified with iron and zinc and they prevent them from being actually absorbed by our system they don't have as much fiber as we're led to believe so vegetables actually have eight times the fiber as cool grains and fruit has twice the fiber as whole grains so if you're getting vegetables on academic diet or vegetables and fruit on a paleo diet you're getting all the fiber that you need and then they're high in carbohydrates so again if we're trying to get off that blood sugar roller coaster grains are not a good way to do that they also irritate the gut lining so I want to touch on this for a minute there's something called leaky gut and what happened is when we consume a lot of grains the gluten which is a protein in the grain bores little holes in our digestive system lining so they're meant to be tight junctions between those cells of our digestive system but when we're exposed to it in our diet and in some cases dairy for some people it bores holes in that and then the undigested food particles from our gut can go out into our bloodstream where they never should be in the first place and when that happens our immune system recognizes them as foreign so it thinks that's like a bacteria or a virus and it elicits an immune response and this manifests differently to different people so in some people with leaky gut they have a joint pain when I get out of it their ankles ache or their their wrists and their hands ache other people have like a chronic runny nose a lot of mucus going on so people bloating diarrhea gas so it's different for different people but it all stems from exposure to either gluten or in some cases dairy for some people and an interesting thing is it takes the gut about 10 to 15 days to completely heal from one exposure to gluten so that's why you could have say halfway through the challenge you have a birthday or a big celebration anyway no I'm just gonna have one piece of cake well it's really gonna set you back because at that point you're good has just healed you're starting to feel some of the benefits and then boom you're back to start a square one in terms of gut health so really take this six weeks to use to kind of detox your body and see how good it can feel after six weeks with no grains all right the third similarity is very limited limited alcohol in maintenance so I'm in the actual six-week period there's no alcohol for the challenges so this is a big detox period for our bodies and as we know alcohol is a toxin in our system it actually has the first oxidative priority in our body which means our body metabolizes things in order of toxicity and if alcohol is in our system that's the first thing that the liver will process so it will stop any fat burning that's going on until it gets through the alcohol and that's why it's very bad for fat loss so people who have a fat loss school we want to really stop that alcohol consumption has twice as many calories per gram and sugar itself as a large insulin response we talked about why that is bad it turns off growth hormone release inhibits testosterone production and decreases our physical performance by 40% so anybody who's really interested in their performance in the gym is not going to be drinking alcohol even on the weekends it also has a diuretic effect so this is more important on the ketogenic diet as I mentioned when your carve levels are low and your insulin levels are low your kidneys Reese stop retaining sodium potassium which are really important electrolytes body their sponsible for all of our muscle contractions for conducting electricity through our body so when that happens we have to replenish them right on a standard American diet your doctor will tell you don't consume salt don't salt your food because your blood pressure's already high you're taking cards your insulin is high your kidneys are retaining those electrolytes on keto that's not the case so you're already in a mildly dehydrated state if you if you combine an alcohol with that you can get even more dehydrated which can be dangerous so if you are gonna drink alcohol definitely have lots of water make sure your electrolytes are really need to be lots of salt on your food on a ketogenic diet and it wouldn't be an issue for maintenance keto you can definitely drink alcohol but for the six weeks we like to keep it out as you're getting adapted so the fourth similarity is the food quality so both paleo and keto focus on the quality of foods and paleo is even more so you guys may have heard of dirty keto which a lot of people do and these see results but it's not gonna make you healthy so dirty keto an example would be like going through the McDonald's drive-in and getting a double cheese burger without the bun and a large diet coke I mean that's gonna keep you in ketosis so our type of keto which I want to teach you guys I want you guys to promote is a clean keto it's more of a paleo style keto based on food quality okay so really little foods focus on the perimeter of the grocery store you can save yourself time by not even going down the aisles of processed foods that are gonna attempt to try to stick to the quality meats so grass-fed and pastures when possible it's not mandatory but those are going to be healthier options in the quality oils you want to stay away from the vegetable oils and in favor of the anti-inflammatory oils which we went over the fifth similarity is sweeteners so some people on paleo will say no sweeteners whatsoever I'm not going to be that strict because I want you guys to enjoy your coffee if you need to have something sweet in your coffee I want to give you some options so in both diets these sweeteners are allowed because they are one natural they are not artificial sweeteners they are not chemicals and two they do not spike blood sugar or insulin okay so that's true beyond what you can see in the packets that is a combination of erythritol and stevia stevia liquid drops okay cuz even stevia in the packets are bound to multi dextran which is sugar so that's kind of it as big of a deal on helio but on keto it could keep you out of ketosis so we wanted you the liquid drops erythritol which is a sugar alcohol it's also comes as the name swerve so you can get that at any grocery store now it's either granulated or the powdered form and then monk fruit which is my favorite sweetener it has the least aftertaste it tastes most similar to sugar itself that's what we use down in the grinds it's a really good sugar alternative now means paleo so if you're doing this for like the year you've met your fat loss bowl you could add in some honey maple syrup agave coconut sugar dates and other dried fruit but for the challenge you want to stay away from those because those will spike blood sugar okay so things like Larabars or rx bars there's a lot of those 18 grams of sugar in that and yes it all comes from dates and raisins which is natural sugar but it's still a lot of sugar okay so now if you're active and trying to build muscle and you're at your goal weight that could be helpful but if your goal is fat loss that could kind of be negative because it's gonna spike your blood sugar as well all right sweet drinks I'm not a huge fan of this but some people that are trying to come off like soda or something sweet and you can't do just plain water these drinks are sweetened with a favorable sweetener so if you do need something the Bywater is sweetened with erythritol which is a natural sugar alcohol does spike butcher insulin and then Z via our sodas that are sweetened with stevia and you can find these at Earth Fair here's your most grocery stores have them but if they cause you to crave other sweet things I would avoid them if they give you just you're satisfied only needed awesome but if you find yourself dingy in the pantry after you've handed one of these it's probably not good fries but the best drinks are gonna be here so unsweet tea the unsweetened Norns so black coffee water any of the sparkling bars there's so many so many different varieties out there just money bubbly is one Lacroix and then even hint water is just a flat water with a little hint of flavor so those are gonna be really good options that don't have any sweeteners at all alright because six the molarity in both diets is the importance of food prep and this I cannot stress enough I want you guys to be able to set yourself up for success because we know when we don't have options around that's when we're gonna be vulnerable to go to our kids some of our kids are eating which is probably not what we should be having so take some time whether it's on the weekend whether it's a weeknight or you can go grocery shopping and then do some grilling or just some some cooking of the proteins even if you can just get your proteins done for the week that would be huge so cook up some sausage of steak some chicken you can put it in little Tupperware containers it will last in the refrigerator all meat okay this is something we do every single week put everything in little bins and it's just easy to go you can pull it out and heat it up in the microwave if you have the proteins done it's easy to just steam some vegetables or grab some greens you know and do a salad those are easy things but the protein is what takes no time if you're in a bind like I mentioned the chop and chisel mildewed meal delivery service this can be a really big help okay and they have awesome meals if you haven't tried them yet you order online you go to the website as long as you have you're ordering by Thursday night which is tonight it will be in by Monday it'll be in Britain early Monday morning and our big fridge downstairs you can pick it up anytime and it's good all week so they will have Paleo specific or keto specific meals and these are some other options so they have bulk items like this is their bulk flank steak bulk salmon both chicken breasts and chicken thigh they do two really good salads that is called a black and blue salad and the Cobb both of them do have dairy but you can ask in the notes just say I don't want dairy if you're doing helio they do a really awesome color flour mac and cheese with chicken to learn their signature else as well so if you know you know that there's a week coming up you're going to be coming home from a trip or on vacation not have time to fool it food prep get online by Thursday and put your order in and you'll have meals for the week so the difference is we talk about the similarities a few differences I want to mention first being the protein quantity and paleo again it doesn't matter all the protein you can handle with keto we have to be a little more cautious because just like carbohydrates have a blood sugar response a big butcher response protein has somewhat of a blood sugar response fat doesn't have much but protein does have a little bit of a blood sugar response so so if you're just starting keto for the first time be mindful keep your portions of protein to a palm-sized so if you're a male your palm size portion if you're a female your palm size portion so it's going to be about 4 to 5 ounces for females or 5 to 7 for males whether that's a stink whether that's chicken thigh chicken breast salmon that's about where you want to keep it you can have up to 3 times a day and still be good alright the second difference we mentioned this already the carb source so I'm paleo all the G's including the starchy tubers are good all fruit is good except for dried fruits and those dried fruit bars because very concentrated sugar on keto there's no starchy veggies and no fruit with the exception of berries once you're in ketosis and we'll talk about how you'll know you're in ketosis but berries is something as a high fiber content so again a low net card there's few net cards and berries so that could be something you could add in okay eventually so a lot of times if you're on the fence and someone comes in my office and they're like you really don't know which which way to go Jess I'll say do you prefer fruit or cheese like really when it comes down to it what is easier to give up for at least a while fruit or cheese and that can help you decide if it's if you can give up fruit then keto is gonna be a better option if you can give up dairy then paleo is gonna be a better option with cheese without cheese alright so the third difference like I said is dairy so paleo no dairy allowed our exception is butter and ghee and whey protein so clean grass-fed whey we allow just because it's not problematic for most people if you do have issues with whey protein though and a protein or a beef protein isolate is another good option keto allows all full fat dairy so we want to stay away from the light or the part skin because there's more lactose than milk sugar in that cottage cheese is very high in lactose so they're gonna be six grams of sugar just send us serving of cottage cheese and even though it's no added sugar no milk or half and half so if you want something in your coffee heavy cream would be the way to go because even whole milk has too much lactose you can always do unsweetened almond or unsweetened coconut milk as well no yogurt except for this year it came out with something called too good it's gonna be seen this too good yogurt um my I don't do dairy but my husband loves it we get it in BJ's on the big container but and so that has two grams of sugar it's very feasibly fit into a ketogenic diet so if you miss your yogurt that's a great option and then no fake cheese's like Velveeta cheese was they're very overly processed so my feeling about dairy is it goes along with the Paleo philosophy that our modern very over processed dairy that came from factory fed factory farmed cows that were given a lot of hormones and a lot of antibiotics is probably not that healthy okay but if you can find like this care gold as a pastured cheese from pasture cows you can get it again at BJ's and the big thing that's gonna be kind of the best for you and you might find that dairy does affect you it gives you inflammation or acne or make Nick you have more mucus kind of more nasally when you consume dairy and that may be something you want to opt out of even on a ketogenic diet it definitely can be done but that's very individual most people that start keto love it to have the dairy so it can be overdone though I will tell you it can add more fat and even in some cases more protein than that we need so another difference is the testing so with keto you're able to test to see if you're in nutritional ketosis which is really beneficial because you know Blackie wait am i doing this diet correctly so the first way so ketone level can be directly tested to ensure it's done correctly the first way is owned by urine so you can buy these urine strips over-the-counter at any drugstore any pharmacy even on Amazon they're relatively cheap and it'll tell you trace moderate or high levels of ketones in your system I don't like it particularly because it's it relies on your hydration level a lot and over time as your body gets really efficient at using the ketones you don't urinate them out anymore so your body only makes enough that you're gonna need so you can get a function negative getting rid of them the second method is what I prefer it's kind of a gold standard for ketone testing and that's the blood ketone meter so it's the same type of leader you use if you are diabetic checking your insulin levels it comes with a little lancing device you just poke your finger you put a little drop of blood on the strip and within 10 seconds you have a number on the screen and the goal is to be point 5 millivolts per deciliter or higher so 0.5 is that threshold for nutritional ketosis so it's not essential that you test for ketones but again it's kind of cool to know am i doing it right and down the road say you're doing this for a month or so you've had some positive readings you know you're in ketosis you could test out maybe a half a cup of berries you know have a half a cup of berries test the next morning did that throw you out of ketosis you'll know how your body handles it and everybody is different some athletes that are doing a lot of physical activity can get away with more berries in their diet they can even get away with some sweet potato academic diet and stay in ketosis whereas other people have to keep it extremely little carb and it's very individual so that's where the meter can be very telling all right the fifth difference is electrolytes and I mentioned this before but electrolytes are super important on a ketogenic diet our body doesn't retain them so we have to replenish them you're gonna get a really bad headache or some leg cramping so some ways to do that salt your food get this pink Himalayan salt because it has not only sodium but other trace minerals in it as well put them everything you will crave salt more as you start to make them so if you're doing keto um from bullion cubes have Mazin on hand because if you get a headache which 90% of us do in the first week or two of the ketogenic diet you can put a bullion cube in hot water stir it up and drink it before you're even done with that it should that headaches should go away a new product that's come out since last year is this element element II it's an electrolyte which is another great option that's what we've used downstairs in the electrolyte grind that has one full gram of sodium in every serving so again if you're having a headache that's something that would take it right away and replenish those electrolytes and then museum before bed I would recommend 400 milligrams how for the ketogenic diet it will prevent those leg cramps that we get in the middle of the night all right so if you want more information on the ketogenic diet we have a youtube channel we need this several years ago so but all the information is still great there's lots of short videos on different topics related to keto it's called keto vision you can just google that my favorite book is keto clarity by Jimmy Moore really good read good recipes at the back as well if you want to know more about performance on a ketogenic diet the art and science of low carbon our carbohydrate performance is a great one for Paleo the best book it's like the Bible of the Paleo diet is the Paleo solution by Rockville's lots of good information it starts with food is all about the whole thirty you guys see whole thirty on products that's basically paleo compliant it's the same standard doesn't a strict Paleo challenge like we're doing so full of thirty stuff would be good and then practical paleo is another really good book so what questions you guys have I know that was a lot of information", "PjOhX9ysXxc": "hey guys what's going on my name is Erwin Litvak on today's video I'm gonna be teaching you guys how to make stacks of pancakes that's right America's best breakfast yes so a lot of people think that having pancakes in the mornings is an unhealthy breakfast but what if I was to tell you guys that it can be so today I'm gonna be mixing in a lot of different ingredients to make the best-tasting pancakes with the minimal amount of calories you guys are in for a treat let's do this so what I like to make pancakes I already like to buy them pre-made so what I do is I buy these Kodiak cake brands and you can pretty much get them in any supermarket you know I have a stop and shop by me so that's where I buy these but you can also get these at Costco or BJ's you should definitely check them out because they're absolutely delicious a lot of people can just create you know pancake mix on their own but why already do that when it's already made for you plus I like these Kodiak cakes because the macro breakdown on the bag is actually really good for one serving of 53 grams you get 190 calories you get 30 grams of carbs and you get 14 grams of protein even when I think oh that's a lot of carbs versus the amount of protein but what we're gonna do is I'm gonna add a scoop of protein that's 24 grams and it's gonna you know outweigh the amount of carbs so for this video we're gonna be using the buttermilk version because it's gonna look the best here are all the ingredients that you need to make a perfect set of pancakes you got the buttermilk powder on the side you got your milk variations depending on which one you want we're gonna be using the almond milk since it has way less calories we're gonna be using one egg some blueberries and ground cinnamon for that extra touch so the first thing that we need to do is we need to check how much one serving sizes so based on the box it says 1 serving size is half a cup you need a measuring cup a spoon preferably just so you can measure it we're going to measure out 53 grams or half of a cup so as you can see here we have about half of a cup which is one serving size next we're gonna place that into the bowl the next ingredient that we want to use milk this one specifically this is the silk almond 30 calorie unsweetened milk obviously the less amount you use the less calories it is but it's 30 calories so that's negligible I'm going to use a submit we have a cup as well so right now as you can see we have half of a cup of almond milk so let's pour that in you could pour it in in a slow circular motion the next ingredient that we're going to add to our concoction is we're going to add one egg so typically per serving if you have two servings you can add two eggs if you want more protein or if you just have one serving like what we have here we'll use one egg crack it open like so easy work guys easy work at the moment what you should have inside of your bowl is you should have the one serving of pancake mix as well as an egg I like adding a little bit of ground cinnamon just to give your pancakes a little bit extra flavor just a simple little - as you can see next what you're going to want to do is you're going to want to mix the ingredients [Music] protips if you want your pancakes to be thinner then all you have to do is just add a little bit more milk so the next ingredient that I like to add our blueberries how many blueberries can sprinkle in honestly a healthy amount there's just like a handful just drop it in like so if you're not a fan of the cooking sprays you can always use the OG the extra virgin olive oil you'll make your pancakes taste fantastic as well in terms of using like other oils such as the vegetable oil canola oil grapeseed oil I wouldn't really recommend those since this is the more healthier option definitely trying to stick with either this or one of these next what you're gonna want to do is you're gonna want to pick up your pan have your cooking spray spray about ten inches away nice little coat place it back down close your Pam spray because that's what we do here and then you're gonna want a ladle [Music] so you're gonna want a ladle because it's gonna be easier for you to scoop out the pancake mix and pour it into the pan we're gonna take about a full scoop of the pancake mix we're gonna just pour it into the middle of the pan and just keep pouring down the center just wait obviously the pancake makes us thick so it's gonna take a little while for it to get out so I'm just gonna use this spoon here to help me extract the ingredients a little bit faster boom let's take a closer look and see what we got so right now as you can see where the pancake mix inside the pan and it's cooking so how do you know what to flip the pancake well that's an excellent question I typically wait until it's about an inch thick maybe a little bit less and then I flip it over another way you can test out to see if your pancake is going well is if you start to shake the pan and you could see that the paint is moving like so we're gonna use a spatula to flip this bad boy scoop underneath and flip [Music] once you flip the pancake over you should see a nice golden brown layer on top now you might be asking well I flipped it over how long do I wait till I know it's done you check the back you see a nice golden brown layer and you're good to go so we added that to our stack let's keep it going so now I'm gonna repeat this process as many times as necessary to until the batter is done so right now I'm gonna repeat the process [Music] [Music] now we got three pancakes a tower of beautiful pancakes hey guys so we just finished making the pancakes and they came out bomb I mean look at that you guys made the same ones or at least I hope you did and they came out this awesome looking but also you know these are just pancakes we need to add something extra to them to make them even sexier so let's look at some syrup options because we need to drizzle these bad boys in something yummy well you guys are in luck I have two healthy options right here in front of me one is miss buttersworth light and Vermont sugar free now if we look at how much sugar each one has compared to one another a miss Butterworth's light has about 25 grams of carbs and 9 grams of sugar you're like man that's a lot of carbs Vermont sugar free it only has six grams of carbs and five grams of sugar which is obviously a much better option so these two options right here are a great choice if you guys can find something that's light and low in sugar in your neighborhood you know stop and shop or BJ's or you know local deli these would be some great options to pick up just to give you an idea of those that we just looked at compared to something like this which is an original syrup has 53 grams of carbs and 33 grams of sugar this is something you definitely want to stay away from if you want to minimize the amount of calories so for the sake of this video we're going to be using Vermont's sugar free to minimize the amount of calories now what I like to do is I like to use a food scale to measure out the serving size of syrup pour one serving which is 60 ml onto my pancakes [Music] hey guys so we made it to the final part we drizzled some syrup on our delicious looking pancakes I hope your pancakes came out delicious as well if this is your first time to my channel hit that subscribe button for more fun fitness and food related videos and if you really like this video hit that thumbs up button it really helps me out a lot see you guys in the next one peace", "0B3J8o560kg": "today we're going to make these Betty Crocker salted caramel cookies they're a limited edition cookie we got an at Kroger don't know how much they were but they weren't Kroger calories prepared as made is three tablespoons of mix or about two cookies is 160 calories that's prepared so that's not it's not too bad actually give me one stick of butter softened or margarine and I've got my I got my margarine and it's been sitting out for a little while and I've got my one egg that you also made and you pre-heat your oven to 375 or 350 for dark or coated pans and basically just mix it up and drop it on drop it on the sheet so I'm gonna use a mixer this is have a description the motor doesn't say anything Yellin salted caramel stock no want to make sure there wasn't any description on there yeah weights the ball it says artificially flavored salted caramel I was reading the ingredients you don't get any box top on there I don't know if this is the brand is this the brand that has the box top sorry I can't keep track of which brand has little it's over yeah there's golden powder yeah that's a good place for you girl that's what okay I'm gonna turn this on low just kind of get its toll and after the dough gets a little moist I'll turn up and you mix it on medium no soft dough cool so for anyone not just to get all that butter nope I think it's safe to say that's pretty ready let me get a spoon just enough knock it up what I'll probably do is knock it off here and then just mix it again for just another couple seconds just to make sure no butter stuck on this beater oh yeah it smells it smells like like a maple syrup scrape all this down waste now cookie okay package right now I've got my cookie scoop oven to you I've got my cookie scoop wish you I think we've showed you the past if you watched our other videos and I'm just gonna literally scoop these out on a pan and I'll show you right here now I put these sheets of parchment paper we bought these actually the sheets are pre-cut pre-funded you know you literally do is unfold them and put them on your pan so they're pretty cool it says to put them two inches apply cafeteria protection well they do use the scoop to get those yeah so how long do they stay in the oven i covered up that portable seven to nine minutes so we'll probably have about eight minutes yeah yeah we can check out a little extra is it good could we go what is it nice like it almost has a maple flavor seriously i need to taste like caramel that's good here are the cookies and Kevin and actually are going to try one and they're still warm they're chewy it's maple to me it tastes like a pancake view but maple syrup on a little bit that's kind of tastes like a pancake mmm-hmm I don't get that what do you get Ashley and I get the syrupy flavor but not the pancake flavor the texture that was spot-on the textures perfect that's a good preview I like the texture I like the flavor actually I don't know they taste like salted caramel and they don't need icing or anything like that I just I just did get actually salt I don't know I'm getting bites of salt now have you got anything and just got a few bucks all better but you have to like them", "6xbPn15RKFU": "I'm really gonna eat the whole thing yo yo yo what a

more person that blessed the PBR last year but I can't remember at the moment my bad I'll give you a shout out if it comes to me all right about to go wait in this line I'll catch you guys soon screw out here in this Beverly Hills streets awesome humans where effects are positive vibrators we arrived at med med in Beverly Hills we're gonna go in here and see if there's any good stuff on sale preferably a sativa let's get right all right positive vibrators we just got out of bed bed this is what we got check it out watch me thank six cookies ten milligrams per cookie and skipped up one of these a Badman battery pack for the vape all right positive vibrators about to test out one of these big peach sativa cookies I'm going to eat one now it says take one and wait 30 minutes to two hours for the full effect so I'll just take one it's ten milligrams then we'll see if I feel anything let's get right [Laughter] [Music] we gonna eat the whole thing I thought it was a mint cookie plate that says mini cookies tastes pretty good I can't even taste the trees in it just tastes like a chocolate-chip cookie to me the time is 12 12 it says it takes about 30 minutes to two hours so in that case I should be feeling something at 12:42 or 212 I'll give you an update all right positive operators is 1240 has spent about almost 30 minutes since I took the head of all I'm starting to feel it a little bit I feel it in my eyes I feel it in my head a little bit we're still functioning and we're still alive we're still positive I got a sandwich in the coffee I'll show you guys what it looks like when it comes out that's what we're working with some chicken soup chips and a chicken sandwich there's our coffee you like us to have another meal and what our positive Barbara ders is to 12 it's been a couple hours since I ate the cookie chilling here my manager does some shopping doing pretty good not as high as I was about an hour ago for still cooling all right it's just chill now pretty much sober so I would say put that 10 milligram cookie the height of the power is in between 30 minutes to an hour then it starts to taper down and two hours later now I'm just feeling a little bit tired but we're all not bad I think if I want that to last a little bit longer I should probably eat about two to three cookies at a time and we'll be flying high a little bit longer but not a bad high though solid appreciate you guys tuning in to the mini sativa big Pete's cookie review holler at you guys things such suits us endorse us again I'm swaggin I'm swaggin", "ro8rNrOkLpQ": "hey

the video i'm going to do a review on these next well i'll highlight you later", "KNU4y_izoC4": "alright I'm here in the protein bar section of Costco now I wasn't planning on doing a video but I walked on this protein bar aisle and I see that holy cow there is just wall-to-wall protein bars and a lot of them are just total garbage so to be completely honest I wanted to do a video to help shed some light on what you can choose to be the best option for you now truth be told you really shouldn't be relying on a protein bar to get your protein in it's more of just a stopgap let's go ahead and let's take a look at some of the ingredients and some of these things and really try to find a clear winner so that when you go into Costco you can at least find that at least top to protein bars that are worthy of taking home for at least a protein emergency so let's go ahead and let's dive right in but first please do hit that red subscribe button and then hit that little bell icon so you never miss our daily videos all right where to start for those of you that are out there that like cereal and still want to be able to have cereal please do check out magic spoon okay they're a new supporter of this channel but they're a product that I've known for a while these guys are super super super cool maybe you've seen them floating around I just want to throw it out there that they are the bomb when it comes down to a low carb high protein cereal okay these guys absolutely no sugar they're utilizing like a whey protein blend to actually make a protein cereal and you're gonna get a really good deal on this stuff by using the link that's down below so I just want to give them a big shout out because it's totally relevant when I'm talking about breakfast they've got chocolate they've got like a fruity flavor they've got a blueberry flavor they've got a frosted flavor you have to check them out you've probably seen them on Joe Rogan's podcasts all these guys that are reputable within the health industry talk about them so just because it's bright colored and it looks fun doesn't mean that it's unhealthy it's definitely a good way to be able to swap out your breakfast so highly highly highly new legitimately recommend that you try these guys at least give them a shot so the links down below in the description you can check it out after you watch this video and thank you magic spoon for making this channel possible and for helping out so many people with their health okay this first I'm going to start with is a nature valley quote protein bar now nature valley is just kind of a regular candy bar type of granola bar but it looks like they slap the label protein on it to try to capture the attention of well people that are looking for a high protein satiating snack so let's go ahead and let's take a quick look at the ingredients on this onebut flip the camera around okay so here's what the label looks like and then let's go ahead and let's look at the nutrition facts like roasted peanuts that's not too bad to start but soy protein isolate as the second ingredient that is pure adulterated soy okay pure phytoestrogens which is not exactly something that we want when you look at overall thyroid affect when you look at the effect in the body in general soy is not a good ingredient especially that high up on the list chicory root extract not the end of the world but again this high up on the list that's going to be a prebiotic fiber that is going to give you a lot of intestinal discomfort that should not be that high up on the ingredient list so this one's a little bit sketchy already but then the big scary one is the vegetable oils down there okay so in terms of the fats that we're adding to the mix here we've got palm kernel oil which isn't terrible then we've got canola and peanut oil definitely not something I want to have in there the bulk of the protein here it's coming from soy protein isolate which is just not going to be good quality stuff and not worth the paper it's really written on it so this one of course we also probably have some sugar added to it yep oh we're some sugar we have fructose okay remember fructose goes straight to the liver and doesn't really get stored in the muscle let me explain something so here's what happens with fructose and fructose gets in your body okay because fructose can only get metabolized by the liver you can only process like 30 to 40 grams at a time which means the excess fructose goes through what's called de novo lipid Genesis and gets converted into fat very easily but it's also very easy for it to contribute to a fatty liver it's very easy for it to cause all kinds of other effects especially in the world of viruses fructose directly feeds a virus so we have to be really careful with that kind of stuff just in general we're worried about health so this one's a no-go let's move on to the next frankly a lot of these aren't even protein bars so I don't want to waste the time these are just granola bars or peanut bars fruit and nut bars these grain free bars are kind of cool but they're not a protein bar once again in the world of bars though they're not that bad I just know for a fact almonds pecans and maple syrup organic honey okay we still have fructose coming from honey and maple syrup so you have to be careful with that still fructose still gonna go through that same de novo epigenesis thing but at least it's clean ingredients not something I would really feed my family but worst case scenario it's probably one of the cleaner ones now this next one is one that I just stumbled across now I haven't tasted it or anything so I can't really attest to to that price it seems a very expensive it's called a ratio bar and $17.99 for 16 of them ethyl I mean not the end of the world it's still pretty cheap but compared to like the Nature Valley bars right but those are garbage so let's take a look at what's in this one I actually was pretty pleased with the ingredients I'll spin the camera around and then I'll flip it back and explain some stuff in a minute so label looks like this okay let's go in ingredients here we got almonds pumpkin seeds soy protein isolate which is definitely not something we want as far as the protein goes coconut oil erythritol whey protein isolate sugary root extract okay so you remember how we talked about chicory root extract this is further on down the list okay which I appreciate that means it has less of the actual binding fiber that's going to give it sort of the texture but it's further down the list meaning at least prioritize that I like this stevia extract that's gonna be really solid I like that it's a river towel that's better than sugar okay the problem is once again soy protein isolate alright we have a big problem there we don't want to use that now let me explain something with whey protein isolate which I was pleased to see when you're looking for a whey protein you want whey protein isolate not concentrate it means they've taken the protein and they've isolate X Q Z they've taken the way and I've isolated the protein out of it so that means you don't have any to lactose you don't have any of the milk solids you just have pure protein now with soy you end up with a lot of the you know soy isoflavones you end up with a lot of the phytoestrogens and everything like that it's a different story what's funny is they go through the effort of having a high quality whey protein isolate but they have a high or zooming a low quality soy protein isolates it doesn't make any sense they go through might as well just use whey protein concentrate and just use the cruddy stuff point is if it wasn't for the soy protein isolate in that ratio bar I absolutely wouldn't use that I think it's a really clean one and I think it's low sugar so it's not the end of the world it's better than some of the other ones but it definitely doesn't make the top two this is one that people love all the time it's not even a protein bar it's a protein cookie now they've done an amazing job of marketing but we have to be real here for just a second because it's not a bar and it's still thing of the day just a cookie fun fact as I was filming this someone comes up to me says oh my gosh I follow you this is awesome and she's holding one of these and she says is this good or should I put it down I said put it down I could already tell I'm Keeley so we're gonna explain some stuff in here but it's actually quite simple the Linnaean Larry's cookies are not good to go but let's take a look at the ingredients just for the heck of it bad price $13.99 I mean price wise here's what we're looking at label and okay first ingredient enriched wheat flour okay every time you have gluten or wheat you are triggering the release of a protein called Zhong Yulin within your body Zhong Yulin causes a cross reaction that triggers what's called a leaky gut thus leaky gut makes it so that what are called lipopolysaccharides which are basically things that coat your bacteria can leach into your bloodstream compromising your immune system and making you ultimately feel sick okay it doesn't matter if you have a gluten allergy or not even those that are not gluten intolerant will have an issue when it comes down to week 12 Lam Ettore since we have simply over consumed it now additionally what's in there chicory root fiber as the second ingredient okay bloat City once again we don't like to go to bloat City look at the protein blend the lowest quality protein blend I've seen sorry I'm talking quiet so I don't be rude we gluten as a protein pea protein which is okay but then rice protein not even using a way not even using anything they're trying to be able to call it I don't even know how they going for plant-based I don't know what they're going for here point is very low quality stuff and then invert sugar vegetable glycerin which isn't that bad cane sugar peanuts palm fruit oil this stuff is garbage pure garbage honestly I would barely even consider that remotely healthy junk food and I'm not trying to bag on them I feel like their mission was good in the beginning but marketing just caught on anyhow that's not worth again the cardboard that it's on next one was another popular one the rx bar good clean bar but not really a protein bar once again more so just a snack bar so let's take a look at what's inside this one again I actually like the company as a whole I like what they've done with almond butters I like what they've done with some of the nut butters they obviously got their start more so with the bars so let's take a look at what's in here's again what the box looks like okay so 1999 for 16 again not a bad price but let's see what some clean ingredients I do like that dates egg whites cashews almonds chocolate cocoa natural flavors sea salt we have to be careful of natural flavors I don't say avoid natural flavors I'm just saying use caution the thing with natural flavors is there's no real regulation on them there's a hundred and fifty different ultimately chemical compounds that can go into natural flavors known as what are called incidental additives so Organic natural flavors is what you want to aim for it or a company that you know and trust okay our X bar is pretty clean so I'm not too worried about them because I know they have a good reputation so that part doesn't bother me but the protein is coming from a little bit of egg white which is straight albumin which isn't the highest quality protein in my opinion simply because it can trigger an inflammatory reaction let me explain what that means so the dates that are in an Rx bar are still pure fructose okay it's got to be careful with that but then when I was talking about what's with the egg whites so albumin it's a complete protein it's a good protein but the problem is you have to remember that's essentially the placenta for the yolk right so it's full of different immunoglobulins different things that are there to support the immune system of well growing a chicken that can trigger an inflammatory response in humans in fact if you look at like the AIP autoimmune Paleo protocols where they actually remove inflammatory foods eggs are one the first thing they remove however it's not the yolks they're bad it's the white that can be bad can be bad you just have to introduce them to make sure you don't get flushed make sure you don't feel bloated personally I feel bloated my egg whites but I eat a ton of egg yolks anyone just fun fact okay this is the big one this is the one that people ask about all the time so I would be doing it to service if I didn't talk about it the good old Kirkland protein bars people talk about how they taste really good I had on for the first time about three or four months ago surprisingly good taste but let's break down the ingredients I'm actually pleasantly surprised with this and price-wise pretty darn solid check this out can you get 20 of them for 18 bucks so less than a dollar a pop different flavors but anyhow I talked about this in another video check out the ingredient in this surprisingly not bad okay protein blend milk protein isolate remember we want to isolate isolating the protein then we have a whey protein isolate once again isolating the protein from the whey dietary fiber from tapioca starch okay so not using chicory root tapioca is a little bit better you just don't overdo tapioca because what we're finding right now is that people are starting to become sensitive to tapioca because of the overconsumption of it in a much similar way to wheat we developed a gluten intolerances later on in our generations because we've been consuming so much wheat since the 1950s with the fortification and also trying to reduce fat and adding more wheat in we're seeing the same thing with tapioca just be careful there erythritol peanut flour could be inflammatory natural flavors again questionable cocoa powder cocoa powder butter excuse me cocoa process with alkali which just means it's gonna have a higher potassium content sea salt sunflower lecithin not a big deal somewhat of an omega-6 but again this is not something you're trying to eat as a health food unsweetened chocolate so they're not using sweet and chocolate with sugar in it which is great and then we have stevia and Coleco sides which is just straight up here stevia okay that is clean in the world of a protein bar not gonna lie okay now what scares me a little bit 23 grams of carbs 15 of which are from fiber four of which are from our mr. tall that fiber is gonna send you to well you know it bloat City hashtag below city and we'll say though in the world of protein bars it's pretty clean the only thing I would have wanted to really see changed in there is instead of milk protein isolate just left it with whey protein isolate but it probably would have made it less of a creamy taste and they don't really want that so I totally did it that's a good price and that would definitely make the list so I highly recommend that one in the world of Costco protein bars oh one more thing to add to that don't eat more than one or you will definitely be in below city I promise you that making this a little quick here next one Robert Irvine's fit crunch okay these are the bright yellow ones and you can't miss I know from seeing these in other stores they're not the cleanest Robert Irvine should definitely stick to being on the Food Network because he's got a great personality on TV but I'm not sure if he's a good formulator let's take a look at this well maybe I'll meet my words this is what it looks like 18 count still a little under a buck protein blend alright wait hey I will say at least he starts with whey protein isolate not milk protein isolate but then we got whey protein concentrate okay that already kind of notifies it and then ooh soy protein isolate dang it vegetable glycerin vegetable oils palm and palm kernel that's not the end of the world he could be using canola he's using palm and palm kernel oil so he doesn't have to use anything hydrogenated which is great but sugar then sorbitol which is a sugar alcohol gelatin bovine gelatin brown rice flour maltitol talked about below city that's again that's a sugar alcohol that does not digest so basically what it does it causes something called passive diffusion okay it draws water into the gut let me explain this it draws water into the colon and it ferments it essentially rots in your gut but it doesn't digest so they can call it something that doesn't affect your blood sugar I've seen enough that ingredient list was really long that ingredient list was really dirty that one definitely does not make the gun another one that comes up in question all the time is pure protein I'll save you a lot of time and headache and just flip the camera around and get right to it but I think they're starting to get the gist about the common ingredients and a lot of these just inexpensive protein bars are so when I'm in a little bit under a buck once again oh here we go milk protein isolate not the end of the world whey protein isolate nothing up then it goes to concentrate hydrolyzed collagen so they're getting a protein from a little bit of collagen but once again we've got that maltitol in there fractionated palm kernel oil sugar again milk unsweetened chocolate and oh my gosh okay so if you're gonna put sugar in it you already have sugar and soy lecithin but you're gonna put sucralose in it too that doesn't make any sense let's give you the worst of both worlds let's give you sugar but let's also kill your gut microbiome with sucralose that's a little sketchy not make the cut unfortunately obviously the Kirkland bars were designed to kind of take them out and I would definitely recommend that one so there's an interesting study that found that in human subjects if they had any kind of artificial sweetener it would make them glucose intolerance okay and then when they took their gut bacteria after becoming glucose intolerant and transferred it into mice the mice became glucose intolerant what that means is artificial sweeteners actually have an effect on our gut microbiome which has an effect on our sugar and glucose metabolism meaning if you eat a bunch of artificial sweeteners you change your gut microbiome and sucralose has been shown in other studies to literally kill off up to 50% of your gut bacteria that is scary scary stuff so when I get upset about the fact that our dicas sugar we've already done the damage with sugar okay why do we also have to do damage with sucrose it's like one or the other pick your poison sugars gonna cause a bunch of metabolic distress sucralose is gonna cause a bunch of digestive and gut biome distress why have both so that definitely that's probably one of the worst ones here to say I hate to say it okay we're down to almost the last one here this one is one called smart for life which is a relatively new one let's take a look at the price once again they're all about the same but this is a new one so I haven't really investigated it let's see that's what the label looks like collagen infused gluten-free okay that's a plus $15.99 for 18 of them whoa that's a lot of ingredients okay so let's take just one of them protein blend soy protein nuggets okay which contains soy protein tapioca starch and salt then milk protein not even milk protein isolate so you're gonna you're gonna use soy protein as the protein source might as well try to make it a vegan bar but nope then they go straight to milk protein but again not even go protein isolate just straight milk protein collagen coming from egg and kosher bovine okay that's a plus tapioca syrup soluble corn fiber okay SCF is dangerous stuff soluble corn fiber ferments in the gut a soluble corn fiber is derived from heavy duty GMO corn starch okay bad bad bad news then canola oil oh man so omega-6 bomb that's smoked listen milk chocolate coating which has a riff through tall malt so again here's what I don't know scent you're using a river tall which is a pretty clean sugar alcohol and then you also use multi salt but then you also use sugar and sustainable for me I don't understand it the world the processed foods is so sketchy like there's so much just nasty stuff that they throwing things just to increase shelf life and the reality is if they just went a little bit cleaner they could probably sell a little bit more to be honest if people start educating themselves which they are we can make better decisions on this stuff now there's only one more that I want to show you and then we'll have our two clear winners the go macro bar but this isn't even a protein bar to be completely honest okay it's kind of another let's see here's what I like about it its organic ingredients it is vegan it's clean organic brown rice syrup organic almond butter organic protein blend which is sprouted brown rice protein organic pea protein very clean organic puffed rice organic fair trade and chocolate chips actually a very clean bar to be completely honest when it comes down to it this one is one that I would recommend it's just not the highest protein okay so we have proteins here let's see only 11 grams of protein but 36 grams of carbs okay and again the sugar is gonna be coming from brown rice syrup which is not going to be the best solution here for us so technically yes it's a protein bar but since they're using the brown rice syrup that's a again it's a syrup sugar that's being directly derived from a brown rice which is going to make it a little bit better than say I don't know like a corn fiber or corn syrup or something like that and at least it's organic so at least it's not going to be as bad so that probably does make the cut at least for the best plant-based options the go macro bar for the best plant-based non keto bar but the cleanest ones otherwise are gonna be these two I'll be say the ratio bar even though it does have some soy in it not the end of the world okay so the ratio bar does make the cut but I haven't tasted it now I just say keto friendly which I don't really buy that and sugar alcohol yeah not really kind of two differently calls itself a protein bar was not a protein bar basically a knock off of a kind bar so technically not a protein bar also not a protein bar just so you know okay protein cookie disguised in disguise our X bar not really a protein bar but at least clean go macro bar gonna be the cleanest plant-based option not Quito we got the kind bar minis which again are not a protein bar then we've got Z bars not a protein bar Clif bars not a protein bar and in the cliff builders I don't even want to touch them to be honest I already know at least they are gluten-free and low glycemic that's a plus but they don't make the cut so we had those ratio bars and then we have the Kirkland bars okay these are going to be the two that you should choose when it comes down to it plain and simple obviously I could go into a lot more depth but I want to be respectful of everybody's done so I do want to encourage everyone to keep watching my channel but also if you're interested in a video that I did on protein powders at Costco I'll link out to it below and YouTube will probably recommend it but I highly recommend that one cuz I break down a lot more of the detail of what goes into a protein powder not in just a protein bar anyhow please don't forget to hit that subscribe button don't forget to turn on that Bell to never ever miss a daily video I'll see you tomorrow you", "AUznOAx-GFs": "hi I'm Robin Inge a WIC nutritionist nutrition labels can be confusing so today I'm going to break down a few important details about reading a nutrition label now I've picked a couple staple foods that WIC provides first let's take a closer look at peanut butter now the best way to find out what's inside this peanut butter is by reading the ingredient list always look for the ingredient list ingredients are listed from highest to lowest amounts and in this particular peanut butter peanuts are the only ingredient and that's a good thing because other peanut butters have added ingredients such as sugar oil and salt and those things we want to avoid now let's go into more detail about this peanut butter by looking at the nutrition facts first let's start off with serving size in this case two tablespoons is one serving size let's go into the Witte kitchen to see exactly what that looks like remember as VG says thank you always wear your apron when working in the kitchen follow me so before eating or preparing anything in the kitchen it's always best to wash your hands first washing your hands is so important you don't want to spread any of those germs or bacteria that you pick up from the outside you don't want to give that to your family okay so here we have our peanut butter and some whole wheat bread and I'm going to show you what that two tablespoons looks like so notice it's not a heaping spoon rather it's a level spoon you may think I'm being too picky about serving size but if you really want to make healthy decisions for yourself and for your family being careful about accurate serving size can make a big difference in everyone's health so this is what two tablespoons looks like on a piece of whole wheat bread yeah delicious you add an apple and you have yourself a perfectly balanced meal now let's see why this information is so important to us by going back to our nutrition label follow me next on the list are calories in that two tablespoons we just saw thank you there are 210 calories so that means if you're trying to maintain or get to a healthy weight you may not want to eat too much of this peanut butter now I look here at this column on the right percent daily value now what does that mean well as it says here at the bottom of the label it's based on a 2,000 calorie diet and it tells you the percent of your daily nutrient needs that you'll eat in one serving of this food now percent daily value can be a very helpful guide how well if it has 5% or less then it's low in that nutrient and if it has 20% or more than its high in that nutrient so what nutrients do we want to keep low and what nutrients do we want to keep high well we want to keep saturated fat trans fat cholesterol sodium and sugar low and we want to keep fiber calcium vitamin D and iron high let's see how this information can help guide us we see here in the peanut butter that one serving size gives you 25% of the fat you need in one day now that means if you have peanut butter for lunch you may want to be careful about the fat you eat for the rest of your meals throughout the day now not all fats are created equal polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats can be healthy for you and look this peanut butter has all that now let's take a look at dietary fiber the label here says that one serving size of peanut butter gives you 8 percent of the dietary fiber for the day now dietary fiber is very important for your health it's a nutrient we want to keep high at least at 20% now usually we have butter with whole-wheat bread how much fiber is in whole-wheat bread the label here says that one slice gives you eight percent of your dietary fiber for the day but let's be honest we normally eat two slices of whole wheat bread so in reality we're eating 16 percent of our fiber for the day add that to peanut butter and you're getting 24% add an apple and you're getting at least 1/4 of your fiber needs in one meal that's great I'm Robin in for the wick so thanks for watching", "1Z7Xb-rUgwM": "[Music] hi welcome back to token tv my name is mckenna i'm naomi and we're here today to show you some of the different edible products that we carry and some of the different ways that you can consume them um ma'am you want to get started on some of your favorite products yeah um so one of my favorite products is these wild gummies here i absolutely love them they're honestly one of the best tasting gummies i've ever had i took one and instantly i started feeling like very relaxed and i wasn't at first i wasn't um i wasn't aware that they were that fast acting but they are and i love them and they taste good um so we have a lot of different great products i would say that one of the top employee picks would be the peanut butter cups right here these ones are really really just as far as taste goes this is going to be one of the best tasting products on the market i would say it's incredible it doesn't taste anything like wheat at all and they definitely do still get you high so don't be fooled by how good they taste and get carried away eating them that's super easy to do it's really understandable because it does taste just like candy but you definitely want to be careful dosing these obviously it is strong and this is actually a new packaging for these ones it's a double dose so you always want to make sure you're checking how many milligrams are in each piece of the product that you're going to be consuming something that's really cool about all the different edibles we have is that there's many different ratios of cbd to thc that you can find them in so if you're looking for just pure cbd edibles we have those if you're looking for just pure thc those are going to be the most common and of course we have those as well we also are going to have many ratios in between those so for example the ones that naomi was just talking about the wild strawberry over here this flavor right here is going to be a 20 to 1 cbd rich inedible which means that for every 20 parts of cbd there's one part thc in it all the specific milligrams can be shown on the packaging as well it's going to vary from product to product this is going to be a particularly high one in cbd sometimes they're going to be one to one so it's equal parts sometimes it's going to be thc rich with just a little bit of cbd added it's going to depend all entirely on the brand and then the specific products within that brand for example we have another one right here the mindy's these are going to be really popular uh for kind of people who are just starting with edibles people who are micro dosing trying to get kind of that more specific dose so that you're not over committing with a big piece like maybe the peanut butter cups are a little bit more heavy duty um these ones are going to be partly cbd as well so again they are going to be very good for a beginner doser just to kind of get in the hang of finding what dose how many milligrams works for you it is going to be different for everyone so whereas i may need a higher dose or a lower dose naomi may take the exact same edible and need something much different from what i took so it's always going to vary a little bit just depending on your system and everything that goes into the different edibles is there any other products you want to touch on me yeah um me personally i love beverages um i personally like the beverages for my days off these beverages are no joke when it comes to full body all day high like when you are on your day off and you're taking a drink you prepare to be like um in a daydream so with this it's really simple and easy this brand particularly their cap it's kind of like a little shot glass so when you are dosing yourself it's easy to kind of just like micro dose yourself take a little sip um these kick in pretty quick it will keep you in a haze all day so um part of the reason why the drinks do hit you so much harder is because they do actually absorb into your system a little bit differently than actually chewing on an edible and swallowing it that way when you're chewing on an edible and you're swallowing food like that it's going through your liver and it takes a little bit longer to absorb it may not hit you quite as strong with something like this the drinks anything that's going to be liquid in your in your mouth as it goes down it actually goes through the soft tissue lining of your mouth which does actually kind of give you that quick activation and it does give you heavier effects for the most part again this is going to vary person-to-person but that's in general what the drinks will do um similar effects to that is going to be anything sublingual so tinctures is something we'll talk about in future videos another item that we have that will be sublingual in the edible category will be the strips right here we have a variety of sublingual edibles as well those are going to be taken under the tongue that's what sublingual means for the most part and it's going to be kind of similar to the drinks and that they are more fast acting because they are going right into the soft tissue lending of your mouth rather than going through your whole system and taking a little bit longer to process and absorb that way yeah from there there's many different ways that you can eat you know so if you like cookies we have cookies again we have the peanut butter cups these are incredible we have everything from taffy to chocolate covered almonds chocolate bars of course the strips the drinks we've got a bunch of different gummies we even have tea if you want to get a little fancy with it we have a bunch of different products so no matter what you're looking for or how you want to feel we most likely have an edible that's going to suit your needs there's definitely something here for everyone um we have so much product some that's not even shown on here i would say with edibles more than anything um it is kind of just you got to forge your own path so to speak you kind of have to really try a bunch of different products see what works for you and see what dosage works for you from there another thing that's good to take note of is that every product you see here is going to have some kind of guidance on how to dose it so that's always a good starting point if you um unsure on how to start your dosage every single package here is going to have some kind of information on what dose is going to be right to start with so always make sure you check that out but again it's never one size fits all it's always a little bit different everyone's a little bit different like naomi was saying your weight affects it your mood affects it what you've had to eat that day affects it you're going to eat a whole bag of edibles on an empty stomach it's going to hit you very fast and very hard whereas if you were to eat it at the end of the day when you have a very full stomach and it's kind of like more post you know everything's happening in your day that is gonna tend to take longer to set on and it might not be quite as strong as a high so there is just so many factors that go into edibles specifically always just be cautious when you start dosing and i would just say yeah just kind of start eating see what feels right and just make sure you always take caution don't want to get too high i've all been there hey guys so today we learned about edibles with mckenna and naomi for more information about these products click on the links down below and for more videos go ahead and

vanilla almond milk one and a half cups i don't know if i need all of one and a half cups but i was just like let me just take it all out just in case next pb2 i used to use this back in the day and i forgot about it peanut butter with cocoa for this i have 12 grams which is approximately like the two um two tablespoons well yeah close close enough so yeah i got that i got me some spinach because they always say you really can't taste the spinach it's just all about getting your veggies in and i'm very particular with the veggies i like so i'm gonna do this and i have 30 grams of this next i'm not too crazy about this one but i have um like plain greek yogurt like plain but it has a lot of protein so with this i have i brought like the little packets and i got half of that um so with this i have oh i didn't write it down one second guys so according to the app this is like 2.6 ounces half of a little individual size um container okay and then i have my banana and this banana is 92 grams y'all i did not realize how much carb is in a banana so obviously you guys know this is not a keto recipe okay this is not keto and then of course i got some ice usually i add um frozen strawberries and that's like my ice but i'm not adding strawberries today that's gonna be like another smoothie um recipe that i want to do but today i really want chocolate banana and peanut butter and so um yeah i need to put ice and yeah disclaimer you guys i was never a keto channel i was just doing keto and i decided that my you know i need to change up my lifestyle i needed to be more realistic for me those who do keto and love keto and continue it y'all are the real real mvps for real but i am doing it's gonna be more like low carb so i might i'm not i have to i'm literally starting today so i have to just mess with it like am i good with 40 carbs a day 50 who knows but it's not keto okay michael and i bought this new blender because we desperately needed it the other one i've had for like five six years and it was like 20 bucks so we got this ninja look at ninja ninja twinning over here so we got this blender and i am like it's already been bombed with our smoothies over the weekend so i hope that it just makes the smoothie even more bomb so let's get it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] you guys i am so scared like i obviously i was excited to get green because of the spinach but it smells good it smells good that's so scary okay it's okay if it tastes bad it's okay all right here we go this is a true test i have not tasted it [Music] yet it's not bad for me i would add another like tablespoon of the pb2 powder and probably a little less spinach i kind of taste the yogurt but it's not like a bad like [Music] [Music] for real for real not not too shabby it's just it's different [Music] it's not too shabby i taste the banana which i love bananas so yeah i'm so glad it's good because imagine if it wasn't i mean i would still have to drink it

today I'm gonna show you guys how to make my red velvet protein pudding it only takes a couple minutes so let's get to it take out a blender and the first ingredient you're gonna add into it is 1/4 a cup or 2 ounces of unsweetened vanilla coconut milk if you don't like or can't find coconut milk you could use regular milk or another milk substitute such as almond rice or soy milk another thing I should mention is if you don't have a good mini blender I do post a link in the description below to the exact one that I'm using it's only around $30 shift and a great investment for your kitchen next we're gonna add in 2 tablespoons or 24 grams of chia seeds chia seeds are a great source of fiber with 5 grams for every 60 calories 2 teaspoons of instant coffee one scoop or 30 grams of chocolate protein powder 2 tablespoons or 10 grams of cocoa powder cocoa butter is also a great source of fiber with 2 grams for every 10 calories 2/3 of serving which is around 29 grams of a red velvet cake mix and one container which is five point three ounces or 150 grams of a fat-free vanilla Greek yogurt now you're just gonna blend everything together for a couple minutes once you're done blending it put in the fridge for around 20 to 30 minutes so it can pick it up a bit more and there is your red velvet protein pudding as far as the calories go in the whole recipe there's five hundred and ten ten grams of fat 56 grams of carbs 15 grams of fiber and 49 grams of protein as you guys saw the pudding is dice and I'm just gonna try it by so basically if you put it in the fridge for a bit and let it thicken up it tastes like I would imagine a red velvet soft-serve ice cream would taste like after it melted a little bit it's really rich thick and of course absolutely delicious something I like to recommend every now and then is if you don't have a good kitchen scale it's a great investment for your kitchen the one I'm using only costs around 20 dollars ship does grant announces and will last you forever I do post a link to it in the description below so there are two things off about this video and the first two people to guess what they are in the comments below

are going to be looking at the MILF and cookies brand [ __ ] brownie 375 milligrams of THC so first and foremost we've got the name noth and cookies which is on I guess it's a play on milk and cookies but mom I'd like to [ __ ] and cookies makes very little sense to me anyways uh 375 milligrams as I said the [ __ ] brownie it's got some shitty packaging just a plastic wrapper oh this isn't edible that does not require refrigeration unlike different companies but let's open it up and take a look and try fight alright so here we go here is the [ __ ] brownie not much of a weed smell very very very very small hint of cannabis uh it looks like a brownie cookie hybrid with some Oreo like bits in there and some chocolate chips again this is our [ __ ] 375 milligrams brownie from cookies I bought this from eleven dollars from a dispensary in Orange County this I think again is on the low end of how much you could find this for I'm guessing this probably normal it's runs about fifteen bucks and most dispensaries so yeah without further ado let's give it a buy here see how it tastes well it's not bad um very little wheat flavor on the Sun but not anywhere near the best brownie I've ever had in my life it's a little dry the Oreo bits taste suspiciously like hydrops they still make eyebrows I don't know but it's not bad it's not bad you're not gonna gag eating this one for sure um but the most important thing as always is how this makes us feel and as always guys I'm gonna finish this here and I will check back within you with you guys in 30 minutes one hour and two hours and let you know how we're feeling so I'll check back with you guys then thanks for watching weeds hi guys welcome back we are I'm checking in with you here at the half hour mark for the experiment with our milk and cookies [ __ ] bratty I went ahead and uh dusting off that bad boy again not the best tasting brownie in the world if you hate the taste of marijuana it'll be fine for you because it doesn't really have much of a weed taste but but yeah it's it's not a good brand as a brownie uh ingredients nothing too strange in here lots of you know we got some partially hydrogenated soybean or condensed cottonseed oil not a big deal okay so half an hour and most important question how am I feeling this is this was a 375 milligram and which is pretty potent edible half an hour and I'm feeling a little bit as expected won't be feeling 100% strength just yet but there's a nice little mind hike coming on nothing quite in the body yet but a placid peaceful hiya so far I'm looking forward to seeing how this will feel in another half hour when I'll check back with you guys the hour mark so let you know how this brownie is feel and then thanks so much hi guys I'm back it's been an hour since I had that milk and cookies [ __ ] brownie thinkin warm not sure why it's called a [ __ ] brownie I don't know if that's really a name for a brownie cookie hybrid thing um you might be wondering why I've got this rice krispies treat with me that's because I want to eat it and you might be wondering why I would want to eat a giant rice krispies treat after eating that entire giant brownie that's a great question and the reason is because I ate that entire brownie and it makes me want to eat rice krispies treats now not a very good feels pretty good this has been one hour mark catch you guys in another hour this time I won't have one of these ciao ciao now that's what I call milligrams 375 mm in fact milk and cookies [ __ ] brownie it doesn't taste very good but it'll do the trick I give it four SOI lectins out of five canola and or palm oils that's next time PostScript I think at the one hour mark while also I think I forgot that the last mark was two hours I forgot to mention that the last time I talked to you I was two hours the time before that the one hour mark I promised you I wouldn't habit of miss left but I do and I just want to apologize for that catch you next time on weeds just a word of warning guys always follow the directions on the package never take a dose higher than what the package or the person who sold it to you recommends unless you know your tolerance unless you have an incredibly tolerant high tolerance or you've tried the animal before never try a higher dose than it recommends if you liked this video please feel free to subscribe and if there are a procs you would like me to try in the future please just leave a comment below and we'll be sure to review it on a future episode of wheats thanks for watching we'll catch you guys next time", "lb9T3hj74JA": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at a brand that I have seen taking long beach in Southern California by storm and that is Miss Mary Jane's edibles and we are reviewing their cookies and cream cake pop both the first time we're reviewing a Miss Mary Jane's edibles and a cake pop period these are very popular Mary Jane's is very popular I've seen her everywhere her mug and smile and face I don't know how much more we'll be seeing her after all these new rules take effect but for now we'll review what products they've got and hopefully they get to survive the upcoming at apocalypse so handsome packaging here on the outside nice little cardboard box but well labeled well decorated nice packaging I like it quite a bit it shows what the product looks like it's got the ingredients and my favorite thing to see it shows the lab rating from SC labs 100 milligrams of THC and here SC labs you know you're always getting a quality product when you see from them I've never actually eaten the cake pop period before I know what cake pops are I assume that they're like cupcakes with a stick in them I've never had one edible non edible anything in between so I'm kind of excited about this and I'm excited to give this Miss Mary Jane's a try I hope its ubiquity means it is it is good but that SC Labs has already got me pretty pretty pretty hopeful so here we go packaged in there as well there's your little cake pop in an additional little wrapper and this wrapper looks like it's gonna be annoying to get off here let's see there's got to be an easier way to do this but I'm gonna make it difficult there we go finally got it okay oh [ __ ] I just broke the cake pop up a little bit it's a little delicate so here is the old cake pop let's just do it in one cuz it's about break oh wow wow nice delicious wow that's incredible I loved it the taste was incredible no cannabis taste whatsoever good moist cake I know some people hate that word I'm sorry good what's a synonym for moist good vaginal secretions cake that's [ __ ] up to say to this good cake good icing no cannabis taste love the taste of it now the most important part how it's gonna make me feel for that we're gonna have to wait two hours to see for sure and I'll be sure to come back to you guys in two hours to let you know thanks so much for watching weeds and I'll see you in just a bit peace [Music] welcome back to week guys and we are talking cake pops from Mary Jane edibles Miss Mary Jane's edibles this hundred milligram are here this multiple award winner I liked it I liked it quite a bit I love the taste of it really really enjoyed the taste that it was truly excellent and it got me pretty high not outrageously bad a you know somewhere in the average sort of 5 range mid mid still pretty high from it these and oh it's been longer than two hours which you should articulate it's actually been closer to four hours we got to dinner with some friends I got lost track of time but I'm still high four hours later from this but never got outrageously high at any point and as I would like to reiterate one more time I thought it tasted in credit no cannabis taste whatsoever and it's definitely a hundred milligram er in terms of potency so thanks SC labs for verifying that and again it's just a nice little package I think I neglected as well to mention the price I got these two for fifteen which is a pretty good deal 750 each for 100 milligram edible it's not bad especially for one that tastes as good as this one does so guys I think that's gonna do it for this review if you see Miss Mary Jane's cake pops or at least the cookies and cream one yeah maybe give it a shot I think he'll be happy that you did I'm gonna do another Miss Mary Jane's review in the future just to make sure everything is a-okay but asked right now that's going to be a pretty good endorsement from me so guys thank you so much for watching wheats and we will see you on a future review peace", "9op4wtQYk4I": "[Music] if you've watched almost any amount of commercial television lately you've probably seen this ad it's for Nutella a woman gives her family breakfast consisting of toasted bread products covered in Nutella and a little bit of fruit on the side she's kind of upset that nobody thanked her for breakfast until she finds a drawn picture saying she's the best mom ever this got me to thinking would the best mom ever give her family Nutella for breakfast is Nutella part of a healthy breakfast I know a lot of people swear Nutella is the best thing ever and quite a few view it as a tastier replacement for peanut butter so I came into the kitchen and asked myself do you know is Nutella comparable to peanut butter is it healthier or possibly worse for you how the hell should I know I am literally you I know everything you know so if you don't know the answer I don't know the answer now leave me alone I'm trying to figure out which is better for shaving butter or olive oil so today we are going to look at the nutritional facts as listed on the jars and figure out if one is better than the other or if they are actually interchangeable for a healthy diet we're gonna look at Nutella jiff creamy peanut butter and a third mystery food that will be revealed at the end so it's only fair to start with the serving size thankfully the serving size for each of these is two tablespoons that means we don't have to adjust the listed nutrients so calorie count food a has 190 calories in two tablespoons and 130 of those coming from fact while food B has 200 calories with 100 coming from fat and food C has a hundred and forty calories with 50 coming from fat so far they aren't that different with the exception being food C which is a bit lighter in overall calories but not by a whole lot since we know the total calories from fat we have an idea of what we're gonna see next but let's dive into the details the total fat for food a is 16 grams with 3.5 grams as saturated fats and nothing from trans fats food B as you might guess is less with 11 grams of total fat 4 grams coming from saturated fats and a goose egg in trans fats so less total fat but more saturated fat food C has a far less total coming in at only 6 grams of fat 1.5 grams from saturated fat but also 1.5 grams from trans fats the calories from fats and even total grams of fats would lead you to believe that food B and C are the healthier choices but in fact food B has a half a gram more of saturated fat than a and food C while much lower in fat contains trans fats which are known to raise your bad cholesterol lower your good cholesterol and can lead to heart disease and strokes so for my money the races between food a and food B speaking of cholesterol that's our next item on the list food a comes in with 0 milligrams as does food C food B does have some but it is listed as being less than five milligrams which keeps it at a zero percent of the daily recommended value so while they aren't all even here there's not much of a difference and really no discernible winner after that we have sodium which can be the make-or-break category for some people food a weighs in with 140 milligrams or six percent of the daily recommended value for sodium while this isn't a horrible thing people with cause to watch their sodium intake might be better off avoiding it food B meanwhile has only 15 milligrams of sodium or about one percent of the daily amount which is much better food C on the other hand comes in between the two with a hundred milligrams or about four percent of the daily value as far as sodium is concerned food B is the clear winner and this brings us down to the box that most people pay attention to carbs now understand that carbs aren't totally good or totally bad it depends on what type of carbs you're eating dietary fiber is good for you while sugar is not so good that being said let's take a look at the totals and breakdowns for our foods food a comes in at a respectable 8 grams of total carbs with two grams coming from dietary fiber and 3 grams coming from sugar that's not bad in my opinion though diabetics may want to look for a better option food beet comes in with a whopping 22 grams of total carbs one gram as dietary fiber and another 21 grams of sugar this should be alarming to everyone that is a lot of sugar for two tablespoons and can throw a diabetics blood sugar into dangerous levels food seat comes in with 22 grams of total carbs again with one gram as dietary fiber and only 20 grams of sugar so two of our three foods is concerning ly high in sugar for the serving size of two tablespoons finally we come to protein which is not as evenly spread as some of the others food a comes in with seven grams or seven percent of the daily value food B has two grams and food C has no protein at all with reaching the end of the basic nutrition for these foods it looks to me like food a is a pretty clear winner but again that's my opinion the rest comes out with a no score tie between the three as far as vitamin A and C two percent calcium for food a and four percent calcium for food B food a has four percent iron while food B has six percent iron food C has nothing in any of these so the question comes up now which of these foods was the Nutella which do you think it was well it's actually food be the highest and sugar trace amounts of cholesterol some protein but not much and the lowest in sodium but what about the chip peanut butter was it the comparable food C or the better food a it was the better food a higher in protein much lower in sugar but highest in sodium and total fats though the saturated fats was actually lower than the Nutella so based on the nutrients I personally would choose peanut butter at least Geoff creamy over Nutella every time now I can already hear you asking so what is the mystery food C what is lowering calories and sugar but higher in sodium and trans fats than Nutella well the answer to that is Duncan Hines homestyle creamy chocolate frosting that is the reason that Nutella tastes so great on everything it is not really hazelnut spread but Hays nut flavored cake frosting in some areas the frosting is much worse with 1.5 grams of trans fats more sodium and no protein at all but realize that Nutella actually has a gram of sugar more than cake frosting for the same serving size so as far as their commercial I have to say that giving her family Nutella on toasted bread with a little bit of fruit for breakfast certainly does not make this woman the greatest mom ever now I know being a mother is a hard and oftentimes thankless job but part of being a parent is making sure that your family eats healthily that in and of itself is a difficult task but just because your family loves nutella doesn't make it the best choice for breakfast jiff creamy peanut butter would be a much better choice more protein less saturated fats less cholesterol and a lot less sugar in some ways two tablespoons of chocolate cake frosting would actually be better and that does it for our comparison between peanut butter and Nutella and it comes time to ask what do you think of the comparison were you one of those people who thought Nutella was a good replacement for peanut butter or were you a little skeptical if you use Nutella regularly will knowing the nutritional facts change how much you

wheat's the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary uh accidentally jumped the gun forgot to record this once so i already opened this package that was just a moment ago haven't eaten anything welcome to weeds guys with a review show here on welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary classic ass episode today which means yes a good old-fashioned edible and one of the most old-fashioned kinds of weed edibles the gummy that's right we're taking a look at wanna one of the makers of the cannabis infused sour gummies these ones your standard 100 milligram edible 10 different uh pieces at 10 each however these ones are also a cbd blend uh at a ratio that they actually have listed incorrectly there of 10 to one even though it should be one to ten the way they have it listed in that it is 10 milligrams of thc per piece one milligram of cbd per piece 100 milligrams of thc total 10 milligrams of cbd total in this package in these strawberry gummies i picked this up and i accidentally already opened it was recording didn't realize my bad haven't tried any i picked these up for 18 bucks at a dispensary here in long beach california which is a slight premium i would say over there traditional gummy edibles which probably average about 15 so a definite premium there not a whole lot but something to notice and again it doesn't have that nominal amount of cbd in it which i'm curious if it's going to have an effect on me that's not a lot of cbd i'm guessing it probably won't but we'll be on the lookout for it um and on here as well as all the good stuff you want to see they've got lab testing results although this is nearly a year old at this point which is a little disconcerting but whatever uh nutrition information all that good stuff so let's go ahead and take a look at the most important stuff the gummies themselves these 18 gummies and here you go looks just like that 10 of these squares in there oh smells very strawberry not very weedy at all mostly just strawberry well let's go ahead and give it a bite give it a test see what it's like gummy weedy strawberry a lot of wheat flavor actually more wheat flavor than i was expecting not grotesque but for the gummy candies higher than average but otherwise a totally fine gummy candy nice soft chewy okay well i would say in terms of taste a slightly weedier taste than your like plus or your steezy gummies but not revolting in any shape or form but it's there uh but of course guys it's not the taste that we're in this for trying to figure out if they're gonna work or not are they gonna make you hide and for that well that's what we're gonna have to wait around and see um so uh any time i do gummies i like to try to do them under the optimal conditions i don't think i said this i did have a little bit of fat beforehand just to make sure it's going to hit me just right not necessarily for you or for everybody i do it just in case so i had a little bit of fat before just for the optimal thc absorption um but it's still going to take a while to hit the old bloodstream so i'm going to finish these gummies off of the next i don't know hour so do all 10 as we do here on wheats we review the whole product i'm going to review them over the next or as i said eat them over the next hour and then two hours after i have that last one or thereabouts i'll come back to you guys and give you our wrap-up thoughts the most important part of the edible review is it gonna get us high and for that guys you're just gonna have to stick around and i'll be back in just a bit to let you know our wrap-up thoughts about these wanna sour strawberry gummies well here's one for the blooper reels guys i'm back two hours two and a half hours later with these wanna cannabis infused sour gummies uh and as you can see with my eyes they are pure as the driven snow uh and i came here with a really bad review i was gonna come and really trash them as i was like these are pretty um non-existent non-existent in terms of the high that i feel from these wanna cannabis infused sour gummies uh and i was gonna say something along the effects of well maybe it's the 10 to 1 ratio and maybe that little 10 percent of that welcome back to wheats guys it has been two and a half hours since my first uh bite at the wanna cannabis infused sour gummies and if i look very very sober you're correct um i this guys is gonna be one for the blooper reel uh i came here to excoriate the uh folks at wanna i'm saying that these gummies basically did nothing to me all ten of them felt practically nothing and i was originally going to think well maybe it has something to do with that um strange 1 to 10 ratio of cbd to thc and maybe just that 10 cbd was enough to totally blunt the thc and but not provide any of those cbd benefits that was just i've said i was gonna feel like i felt just kind of peaceful but that's about it not really high at all uh and that's because that is actually the case uh i had it wrong not them well actually the bud bud tender had it wrong uh i ordered the one to ten and they gave me the ten to one uh so this really is 10 cbd milligrams to 1 thc so this is 100 milligrams of ca cbd 10 milligrams of thc the exact opposite of what i thought it was um at least i know that i know when i'm high or not and i was definitely not high in any traditional sense with these but that's on me not on them this one's for the blooper reel we'll have to review wanna again in the future this was just a fun little [ __ ] up um and an 18 mistake so uh wanna i am sorry i uh did not mean to disparage i don't know anything about you just yet i do know that my bud tender [ __ ] up the order uh oh well uh [ __ ] happens but we will check you out again in the future apologize for that it's been fun it's been funny anyways that's gonna do it that's gonna do it for this non-existent review here on wheats no cherry on top just a big shame on me thank you so much for watching guys stay high and more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you guys right back here for our next review live stream or even [ __ ] up see you then bye", "meJn0xdhKsg": "I love the incredibles peanut butter buddha bar and I wish that I could eat a 35 milligram piece but unfortunately I can only eat about this much which is a little over 10 milligrams I believe so I'm going to enjoy it makes me feel very happy and energized and hyper so if you want to feel like that you should try the peanut butter buddha bar have a good day", "5G4WXk3SAWY": "oatmeal is a wonderful food it's high in fiber it sticks to your ribs it gives you lots of energy and it has important nutrients such as magnesium phosphorus and iron there are four different types there's steel o fashion quick cook and instant and basically they're processed in different ways usually the one at the end the instant that's the most process the steel oats are still oatmeal comes from oat groats so it's got it has more fiber it takes longer to cook they cut it into pieces then the next one is old-fashioned that's the one you mostly see in the stores that is pressed into even more flakes but it's short it takes a shorter cooking time the still o to take about 30 minutes the old-fashioned oats take about 10 minutes quick cooked are precooked oats so they'll take even less time maybe five to ten minutes and then instant of course is even processed even more and you can put some hot water and it you'll have your oatmeal in a quick flash but my plate is a wonderful way to make sure you hit all the food groups every day by having things from all those food groups you'll get the nutrients that your body needs with oatmeal which is a whole grain you want to make half your grains whole grains so oatmeal that'll get you started and then you can add other food groups in the oatmeal you can add cut-up fruit you can add peanut butter as a protein or nuts and seeds you can add an egg another protein scramble it and put some vegetables in there so you can get it vegetable which and get fruit and you get a protein to add to your oatmeal it's a great option for food if you're on a budget because it's cheap and it's easy to fix so it doesn't take a lot of time so you have a whole wide span of oats you can eat you can make it fast and easy or slow but more fiber and more filling", "nq344D7IgOo": "[Music] welcome to y'all the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and today we are taking a look at another edible we are taking our first look at chill just keep it nice and chill chill medical cannabis cherry chunk dark chocolate hundred and eighty milligram THC each batch is triple lab tested who doesn't love seeing that I love seeing lab tested results on my edibles let's read there are little flavor texts on the package here at chill we offer the highest experience from our cocoa to our cannabis we are dedicated to quality safety and social responsibility we work daily to give our consumers a consistent safe and delicious product our chocolate bars are handmade with ethically sourced ingredients of the highest quality this is truly the highest chocolate that's the second time they made that joke and then on the back we've got nutrition advice we've got ingredients love seeing those as well so a couple of points there for having lab tested results which you can see right there on the back having ingredients and nutrition information I always love to see that for my edibles so as I said this is chill a kind of nice packaging here 180 milligrams of THC and this is the chocolate-covered cherries flavored Wow okay so it is packaged and exactly like Bane bars if you've ever seen the bang bars it's both the same exact milligram \u00e4j-- and pretty much identical packaging so chill and bang very similar uh and this says keep out of the reach of children on it in case you're wondering what it says and do do keepo the reach of children and it looks to be exactly the same way designed as bang bars to a couple of rectangular shaped his nurse if I could get this whole thing open excuse me everyone I'm incompetent okay it's not exactly the same way as Bing I believe bang is for vertical rectangles this is ten half split in half rectangles well let's give this chill a taste I was gonna try to come up with something clever to say but I couldn't so that's why I just went let's get this chill uh taste let's give this Joe a taste [ __ ] you perforations okay in terms of chocolate I put it about the bang level of taste it's pretty good it's not the best this this ain't of all say this ain't Kiva in terms of taste it's right about the bang level so good good not meant in any way derogatory eyes and complain good solid chocolate no complaints about the taste don't really taste any of the cover are the big chunks of cherry as they promised but I'll say them not bad at all um so taste test is fine but now for the most important test is this chill gonna get me chillax in and for that guys you guys are gonna have to wait just a couple of seconds me however I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know for sure exactly how this chill is lying in thanks for watching wheats guys and I will see you in just a bit peace chill the highest chocolate cherry chunk dark chocolate and guys this is pretty much bang every nice thing I have to say about bang and every the few not glowing things I had to say about bang apply to this as well this is good chocolate not great chocolate this is potent stuff but not the most potent stuff but it's available for a pretty decent price I picked this up at my dispensary for 25 bucks for a 180 milligrams that might sound like a lot but here where I am in Long Beach that's actually and at this dispensary is a pretty good deal I picked up a more expensive less potent two chocolate one that I'm actually more excited for because it's a default city but overall I really liked the chill this is something I have no problem recommending to folks again tasting pretty good got me quite high got me up to the eighth level easily and in on all it was pretty reasonable price to so as far as chill goes I am quite pleased with my first experiment with them that is the chill the highest chocolate a pun I don't think is that good cherry chunk dark chocolate if you see in the dispensary near you and they got it for a reasonable price give it a shot especially if they don't have Kiva or DuPont say or any of those you know premium premium brands I think Jill's gonna do the job for you guys and that is gonna do it for this review here on weights I appreciate you guys watching as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "8N-d_bmDlNE": "hey guys it's Christine before we jump into this video I am going to give it a small disclaimer so first of all if you are triggered in any way by the talk of losing weight or calories or food or anything like that perhaps maybe skip this video and I will be happy to see you in the next one I think another topic that I want to address is lately people think that if you want to change something on your body that you hate it or that you don't think you look good and I don't believe that that's true you can absolutely love your body and still want to change something whether that be your hair color if you want straighter whiter teeth fake eyelashes get a tan or lose a couple of pounds to see your muscles underneath or you know I know some people that want to put on a couple of pounds so they look a certain way and I don't think there's anything wrong with any of those decisions so let me say it one more time for the people in the back you can still love your body and still want to change something did also want to say before we jumped into that that I am NOT a dietitian you do not have to eat what I eat you do not have to eat the amount that I eat or do anything that I'm doing I'm not suggesting that you do that it's just showing you what I do give you some ideas if you want them that being said I have been a personal trainer I have a bachelor's degree in health science and my mom is indeed a dietitian so I do have some knowledge about food in general but you'll see this day of eating video is mostly quick and easy meals and I definitely don't eat like this every day I like a lot of variety my food that just happens to be one day so anyway with that being said here we go we are going to start our day of eating with kind of my workouts that I've been doing so on this particular day I had just finished a seven mile run it is one of the longest ones that I've done when I tend to run a lot more like way more than three miles my hamstrings and hip flexors and IT bands get very very tight so I try to spend maybe 20 minutes 15 to 20 minutes just kind of stretching everything out so everything feels better I guess and to prevent any injuries I've noticed this has become more important as I get older I'm definitely not running very fast right now I have definitely had a hard time I've been struggling getting my speed back after the whole long winter and everything like that I'm just trying to do all of my stretches so everything that you see me doing here is injury prevention and helping me feel better and you'll notice that I am extremely inflexible when it comes to my hamstrings I like I can barely keep my legs straight when I raced down and touched the floor my hamstrings are so tight and because I know someone's probably going to ask about my outfit the camo blue shorts were from Walmart a year ago it was only about four or five dollars very cheap the orange Under Armor tank top was from a friend at the gym she gave that to me about four years ago because she didn't want it anymore and I am trying out a new sports bra I'll probably do a sports bar review coming up here pretty soon so wait on that one it's red I like red so that's fun and then of course I did wear my favorite running shoes the Brooks ghost at the moment I'm wearing the purple ones and they are fantastic my runs during the week I do I'm running right now about three days a week outside anywhere between four to eight miles depending on the day and I am doing some sprints trying to get some speed back hopefully as some of the excess weight that I've gained comes off the speed will come back a little bit more and I'll talk about that a touch more later on in the video I'm currently working out six days a week I'm weightlifting four days a week there is some overlap on cardio and weights and I am loving the way it's making me feel right now okay I'm done with my stretching and I am like desperate for a shower right now but I'm pretty hungry so I'm gonna eat my breakfast until I just want something super super fast that will fill me up and I don't have to worry about so I'm gonna do one packet of this oatmeal right here this is the maple and brown sugar steel-cut oats microwave packet 160 calories actually really like these and one serving of a whey protein shake this is chocolate cellucor brand just like molten chocolate um so I can have some protein as well to help me feel full longer so this has like the fiber and the carbs that I need punished after the run and this one's got the protein to make me feel full so I'm gonna scarf these really really fast with the big lots of water and then hop in the shower and I will see you after that here are the oats I put them in a really really big bowl so it is actually a full packet it just looks really small and this bowl there's my protein shake always delicious and of course had to go with my crystal like pure energy strawberry lemonade you pick it up on it today's eating to be very like quick I was in a meeting and it went kind of long and so I'm really really hungry right now so I got out the leftover fajita chicken and veggies from dinner last night put it in this very very large bowl this is probably six ounces of chicken with peppers and onions I added one and a half ounces of cheddar cheese and a big dollop of sour cream so I'm gonna eat this with a big glass of water right there and I'm gonna see how I feel so if I'm hungry after this I will eat something else but if I'm not I won't it smells really good and pretty excited about it I could have put it on a tortilla but I actually really like it just like this I love fajitas yourself it is I'm still a little hungry someone to eat this brownie that one this edge piece because I don't eat dessert every day or even multiple times a day but hey if I have to go through like life without desserts ever that's not a life I want so I will be eating this right now I just finished my lunch some I eat this finish my water and we should be good lunch is over and we are headed to do Haley's driving test today skills test wishes luck if we can get through this we can set the appointment for her to get her license which probably won't be for another week but hey one step at a time guys one step at a time we're here we're waiting for our tester guy to show up or right next to his car I have all of the documentation proof of insurance Haley's permits with better being here you check ok this registration the money so we have all of the things so while I'm sitting here right now what I'm gonna do is tell you guys about as we've dealt with this stressful driving situation it's the perfect time to segue into Ned CBD oil who I have partnered with on today's video and I have worked with them quite a bit in the past if you've seen my previous videos you guys I love this company the owners care so much about you having a quality product about you having a great experience and there's a lot to be said for that when it comes to people running businesses all of their CBD oil is grown and processed right here in the United States in the state of Colorado I've been doing their period blend CBD oil it has some other essential oils and things in it and Dave's been doing the traditional CBD oil and I have mentioned before the body butter and what's the period lotion so like the salve am I saying it right that came with the hormonal blend okay so check this out Dave's knees were achy and he rubbed it on his knees and it totally worked he was like my knees feels so much better I thought that was like a nice probably different application that the owners at Ned probably don't know about if you guys want to refill your stock of CBD oil or try it out for the first time use my link down below to get 15% off and if you've used my link and do a subscription they'll give you 20% off down there in the doobly-doo all the time if you want to check it out and thanks again to Ned for partnering with me today how you feeling quite a bit nervous I'm very warm so the AC in this car doesn't work it did they turn this one over oh that's him he's here we are back from the test and I don't remember the last thing I said to you but she passed and he let her slide on a couple of things I think because she took the test in a stick he was like I'm really really impressed that you would take the test in a stick but I think one of the things was she didn't signal for a turn early enough he was so nice like he wasn't mean at all but it was like I just like to remind you that blah blah blah anyway so she passed and we are moving on to the appointment at the driver's license office which we can't do until next week I couldn't even call make the appointment today because they're closed today because they're moving to a new location so they're moving everything today so I can't call for a couple days and I know this video is supposed to be about like snacks and food and things like that it's also gonna kind of be a vlog I'm gonna talk about right now is why I personally would like to get back down to let's say my like normal weight there's the reasons are threefold number one when you are an athlete who does sport performance running cycling triathlons like that your weight affects how fast you are right now I'm trying to like get back into running shape I'm considering a marathon but right now it's not going very well so imagine trying to run a 5k which is 3 3.1 miles with a 10 pound backpack on is essentially what I'm talking about if you take off the 10 pound backpack you're faster because you have to move less mass right and so I do approach it as a sport performance issue typically during racing season I always cut 5 to 8 pounds anyway just to assist me in my speed and ability to climb my body and bike up hills better my engine doesn't have to work as hard right if you want to relate it to a car analogy so that's one thing number two is always been an athlete a lifelong athlete played sports my whole life I like on me a muscular look it's not necessarily about being like skinny in fact I would prefer to be a little curvier with like and a little heavier with ball muscles then weigh less and just be skinny for my body type I like the look of muscles on me so I have to lift weights and exercise to gain and keep my muscles and then also I do have to lower my overall body fat so you can then see the muscles and then the last reason which is totally a vein issue is that my pants don't fit very well they're a little tight they're harder to button and that's really it like I just don't want to go out and buying a whole new wardrobe that's all there is to it when it comes to like running clothes or you know like when you look at yourself out of the shower or whatever truthfully I don't think there's anything wrong with the way I look I don't think I look bad I just want to look more muscular and have it be easier to run and have my pants better and that's really it Haley and I did run to the store so I'm gonna record that haul separately you'll see that in a different video you'll probably have already seen it actually but I am gonna get a snack based off some of the stuff that I just got so let me record that and then we'll come back and I'll show you my next snack here's my snack it actually looks really sad but I cut up one of the nectarines they're really small it's almost like a snack size so in the future I'll probably eat two and a string cheese it's like man the name of the game today is like quick and easy I am Telling You string cheese nectarine Oh delicious okay we go do it what it's a little tart but okay I'm gonna have more of these after dinner I love nectarines mmm holy smokes I'm telling you I do like don't even need candy when these are around these are better than candy so good okay I'm gonna start making dinner in just a minute but before I do that I want to show you guys my Amazon subscribe and save order that just came today you guys do that I've been doing it for years you can get a really good deal if you get the five items and get the 15% off and then you buy items that have coupons as well it's typically how I get my protein powder so I'll get the protein powder with like 30% off plus the 15% so it's like 45% off well so good okay I actually didn't want very much this time so I got a couple of new flavors I'll have the Crystal Light energy this one I can get at my regular store but these I cannot didn't really save a ton of money it was just new flavors that I haven't had before the cherry splash and the tropical punch so there's three of my items I am trying out this well both of these like isolate protein powders for Dave we're trying to see if maybe the isolate works better for him or whatever so this one's for me because look it's birthday cake flavor can you believe that so I'm gonna have to maybe I'll try this after a bedtime snack or something I will try it out but here are the stats one serving is 110 calories one carb and 25 grams of protein this one we got chocolate peanut butter because I really like the peanut butter flavours approach powder it cuts like the over sweet flavor I feel like so this is 71 servings this is a huge five-pound container and stats are pretty much the same I've got two grams of carbs hundred twenty calories and 25 grams protein in one scoop chocolate peanut butter and birthday cake flavors and then my little crystal lights so who's like all drinks this time woohoo alright here's my dinner sorry about the noise the air fryers going I'm making some okra in the airfryer so I'll probably have that when it's done it's just not done yet everybody else is having these chicken and black bean and rice burritos and I am having the same I'm just not putting it on tortillas I did a really really small little salad with grape tomatoes over here on the side you know what I'm gonna have more Tomatoes I love Tomatoes and I would do a cucumber but I'm feeling lazy so we'll just do that and the okras coming too so I have about a half a half a cup of cooked rice down in there with I would say at least over a cup of this black bean and chicken mixture with this adobo sauce and a little bit of cheese on top and I'm just gonna kind of mix it all up and eat it with boredom so everybody else is having it wrapped up like that and I'm just eating mine in a bowl okay my okra is finished cooking and I think I'm gonna eat I don't know how many this is probably a cup ish really a cup a cup and a half it's a cup and a half of okra and it's really really hot so I can't really touch it I may or may not eat this whole thing I'm not sure if I do no problem and if I don't no problem I'm just gonna eat them until I'm not hungry anymore cuz I'm still gonna hunker okay I'm done I would say I ate half of that so I'm gonna stop there but I still think I'm probably gonna eat something later it's about 6:45 I like eat one more okay it's about 6:40 6:45 and I'll probably have a snack in like an hour or two look I'm really really trying to cut quickly as far as body fat goes I'll stop eating after dinner I just won't eat anything until the next morning and if I feel hungry I'll have a flavored water just cuz it tastes good it feels like I'm putting something in my stomach but because I feel like I didn't really eat a whole lot at the beginning of the day like breakfast felt small to me and lunch was like small and quick I find when I eat less processed foods like I focus more on things I've made myself for clean proteins vegetables that I'm more hungry more often and because the calorie content of all these homemade things are lower than like a burger or whatever your overall daily calorie intake is significantly less I'm just trying to make healthy choices when I do eat so like for the dinner tonight everybody else had theirs on a on a tortilla and I was like well I don't need the extra calories of a tortilla so I'll just have a salad on the side with some fruit afterwards which I'll probably have cuz that nectarine was so good but clearly I have no issues with like carbs or anything I'm eating rice and beans and fruit and stuff so and because I am in a more of an endurance athlete carbs for me are good like you'll often see me with some gummy bears or Swedish fish on a long run because you need the sugar like right now promise the kids that we would watch the second season of stranger things and so I'm going to log into my bed Angell accounts I can edit out all the bad language and if there's any adult content which actually really like they do not sponsor me but that would be cool if they did because I'm a really big fan it's made me feel a lot more okay with showing my kids a lot of different movies that I wouldn't been okay with otherwise so we're gonna go do that it's an hour episode or like 45 minutes we'll have like a snack number 562 you know when you're scrolling on your phone on Facebook well you're not scrolling on your phone you're scrolling on Facebook and they have those like little video snippets so I saw once a day and my brain just exploded oh I was today years old when I found out that you can cut a watermelon with dental floss oh my gosh my world has changed I need to go buy at watermelon tomorrow you try this out Wow like whoa wow my hair looks really weird it was mushed on the couch for a while I need to finish off this day of eating cuz wow it's nine o'clock and the two little boys are in bed what are you doing with that Hayley's gonna eat hey what what Wow Hayley is going to eat an Abel Abel no it's Abel for sure it's Abel for sure I'm like really thirsty so I'm feeling some liquids at the moment so I might even actually get my snack this nectarine sounds so good but I'm so thirsty I think I'm gonna do a crystal light like with a really big cup of water and water it down and just like hydrate cuz I'm feeling you know what I mean like you super thirsty so I'm really just gonna drink something I think I'm not really feeling hungry right now an apple a day keeps the virus away so if you guys want to know about the calories and all of the macronutrient breakdowns from what I had today I'll put that like over here I actually didn't calculate it out at all so I'm gonna have to total it up right now with my phone I use just using my Fitness Pal app and type everything in the most important part is being like really accurate with what you ate I'm not saying that these are the calories that you to eat and I'm not saying these are the calories that I eat every day some days I go way high and some days I'm just not as hungry and I go lower it's all over the place and most of the time honestly I don't track it that much I just try make semi good choices while enjoying life and not feeling hungry I've been kind of being more careful with my food choices like cutting out all the desserts and I may have been John some cookies a few many times a day during the lockdown to make myself feel better and so I've cut that out so I will say just in the last week and a half of like just being more careful I have already dropped like three and a half pounds of the about seven pounds that I had gained before and then I'll get back down to my normal pants and everything will be fine I may go to a couple more pounds below that like I said earlier in the video really about sports performance and running faster more than anything else I'm gonna finish up this video here I think because it's nine o'clock and I want to watch one episode of Supernatural with Haley before I go to sleep so I'm gonna go do that thanks for hanging out with me feel free to ask me any other questions about like checking your food or food choices or you know whatever you want in the comments and I'll hang out and answer those if you'd like to click on the screen if you want to see any other stuff I've done or if you want to sub or and I'm gonna go to bed so goodnight goodbye you turn it off videos over to go to your home don't you want to go to your home", "RPeeF0o9IRM": "what's up youtube i'm rugby juice recipes the basket of laundry is back and this is diy made easy [Music] [Music] it's friday i hope you're all doing well the videos in this series are geared towards mixers who are just starting out making their own e-liquid there is a list of 32 flavors down in the description in this video that we use to make all of the recipes in this series so i've been getting a lot of requests for lower wattage mtl pod system style juices thought that i would do a really nice fruit blend so the first thing that we are going to put into this recipe is l a watermelon really watermelon is a nice sweet candied style watermelon it's a little bit weak so we're gonna use it at five percent and it's gonna pair really really nicely with wonder flavors island mango under flavors island mango is an artificial mango it's got a little bit of that funky mango flavor but not too much of it it's going to pair really really nicely with watermelon and the last flavor that we are going to put in here is of course fa pear i like to put fa pear in a lot of my fruit mixes because it gives fruits moisture texture something that i find frequently is that only fruit profiles tend to get a little bit boring you add a little bit of fa pair in there gives it a lot of moisture makes it really really nice more convincing more realistic more fruity so since this is an mtl pod style recipe i am using the requiem rda i have it set up in mtl mode perfect this thing does mouth to lung pretty well if you're a person that likes to add cooling or ws23 or menthol to your recipes i think that this would be a good option for that also it is a certified rugby shake and vape recipe which means that you don't really need any steep time you can mix it up shake it up and you're good to go as far as sweetener goes i did put half a percent of capella super sweet into this one but sweetness is something that's completely subjective so feel free to use sweetener in it if you want to so i think that about does it for this recipe if you like what i'm doing here please subscribe to the channel there's a link to my patreon campaign down in the description this video if you can afford to give me three dollars a month to give keep me doing what i'm doing i surely appreciate it if you can't that's okay too you

today I'm gonna show you guys how to make my tiramisu protein oatmeal it only takes a few minutes so let's get to it take out a microwavable safe Bowl and the first ingredient you're gonna add in is 1/2 a cup or 40 grams of rolled oats 1/2 a cup or 4 ounces of unsweetened vanilla coconut milk if you don't like or can't find coconut milk you could use regular milk or any other milk substitute and then 1 ounce of water go ahead and microwave your oatmeal for around 2 minutes the most important part of this recipe is to make sure you add in the rest of your ingredients while your oatmeal is so hot starting with 1/4 TSP of butter extract and then 1/2 a teaspoon of rum extract 1/2 a teaspoon of ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon of instant coffee the coffee's gonna give it some flavor and you a boost as well since every teaspoon of instant coffee usually has around 75 to 100 milligrams of caffeine in it one scoop or 30 grams of chocolate protein powder 1 tablespoon or 5 grams of cocoa powder and then half a container which is 2.6 5 ounces or 75 grams of any coffee or mocha fat-free Greek yogurt you can find I'm using a caramel macchiato one mix everything together this is optional but I like to top mine with the other half of the Greek yogurt we didn't use and then a little cocoa powder and there is your tiramisu protein oatmeal as you guys saw the whole meal is done so now I'm just gonna try it bite alright so if you guys didn't already know tiramisu is one of my favourite desserts ever it's probably one of the hardest flavors to replicate my opinion but this recipe is more on point

whole recipe there's 358 6 grams of fat 38 grams of carbs and 38 grams of protein alright guys I just want to thank you for watching if you like this recipe please go ahead and give me a thumbs up it

various health benefits associated with the consumption of peanut butter peanuts contain proteins peanuts are known to contain a high concentration of protein when you match peanut butter with a slice

disturbing thus increasing the level of potassium in the body has been recommended as a means of fighting sodium interestingly peanut butter contains high levels of potassium peanut butter contains beneficial fats beneficial fats include whole eggs cheese avocados and olive oil as they are all known to contain high levels of unsaturated fat which is very beneficial to the body however one should note that saturated fats are not so healthy and should be avoided peanut butter is a well-known source of unsaturated fats peanut butter offers higher energy levels in addition to fats and proteins there is a high level of calories in peanut butter as well with calories energy thus for anyone in need of extra energy perhaps to work out or do extra work peanut butter offers just that peanut butter aids perfect digestion when you have enough fiber in the body digestion ultimately becomes easier and by taking a tablespoon of peanut butter you are consuming about a gram of fiber thus you can use peanut butter as a form of supplement to complement the fiber you get from other meals peanut butter cares for the hearts yes peanut butter contains relatively high concentrations of saturated fats however these are insignificant when compared to the benefits it offers as in olive oil peanut butter contains high levels of unsaturated fats but they both are found in the healthy region of foodstuffs when choosing a peanut butter brand ensure that you go for the high quality types and preferably organic these variants are good for the heart and are also a healthy way of consuming nuts

different levels of saturated fats ensure that you check the jar for the percentage presence you should watch out for brands that contain artificial ingredients like sugar which have been added to enhance the taste you can find as much as 250 milligrams of sugar in some commercial brands compared to the natural products because sugar enhances the taste of the butter it is usually to the baking peanut butter is a renowned ingredient in baking cheesecakes cookies and desserts the best method to get the desired taste is to combine the natural spread with a little sugar in addition to sugar you should also check out the sodium concentration of the peanut butter you want to buy you will see the percentage of sodium present on the back of the jar for natural peanuts the sodium is usually lesser thus they are better than the artificial peanuts conclusively you get the best out of peanut butter when you consume it moderately two tablespoons are enough daily in instances where you suddenly develop a craving while on a diet a spoonful of peanut butter is highly recommended it's known to suppress the cravings vigorously thus eliminating the urge to consume unhealthy snacks in between meals [Music]", "OgtrVwOSnKU": "this meal is about to be crazy and it's not carnivore sour milk yum the bacon beautiful it's gonna be good perfect some bacon jerky butter yawn when we add up all of the money we spend on buying food and groceries for the two of us to eat for the whole entire month it only cost [Music] us [Music] hey what's up you guys in this video i'm going to show you what i make for each of the two meals that i have for each day for a whole week right now bryce is cooking up three burger patties one and a half burgers for me and one and a half for him and then cooking with some us wellness meats pure beef tallow for our eggs and two eggs for me five eggs for brice i just turned around and saw that rice threw on some organ meat based seasoning so i guess we're having that too [Music] we're about to start making meal number two and i guess today is like a bit of a boring day because we are just having the exact same thing that we had already today so i am just having one and a half burgers plus two eggs but with this kefir i bought it at whole foods and i've just been having the tiniest little bit after my second meal of the day he's always got on the bacon apron and then just so you know what kind of eggs we're cooking with we have happy eggs they're free-range pasture-raised organic eggs and then this is their nutrition facts so five grams of fat and six grams of protein so these eggs are a little more expensive then i know you can get eggs for a carton for like a dollar but these ones are gonna be like the cheapest we can find is four dollars and eighty cents almost five dollars at walmart so it makes each egg about 40 cents an egg i finished eating and now like i said i'm gonna have a little bit of this kefir which if you've never had it before it smells like sour milk and it kind of tastes like sour milk but it has supposed to be really good for the gut i also feel like i should clarify this is my first bottle of kefir in my life i have never had it before but i've been hearing people talk about it so i figured you know i like trying new things so i figured i'd try it and the first day i had it the taste i was like yuck and now i've been having it for like a week ish now so i'm way more used to the taste i don't know if i'll keep buying it but right now i'm just drinking it until it's gone it's day two meal one i'm cooking up two slices of bacon love me some bacon and one burger patty and one ounce of cheese and two eggs for lilly yum yum wow these bacons look amazing it's like a bacon sunny-side up cheeseburger without the buns but there's cheese egg bacon yum [Music] so i figured i'd show you guys what kind of burger patties were eating would have 100 grass-fed beef patties from costco 30 grams of fat and 26 grams of protein which is why if you watched my i only eat meat and butter video you'll notice i have really calmed down on how much butter i'm eating in a day just because costco finally started carrying some grass-fed beef in the form of these burger patties and with this specific brand it does have that 30 grams of fat per burger and if i'm eating three in a day then that's 90 grams of fat right there so i'm having less butter but i love butter it is my favorite food which is why right now i'm gonna have some more eggs and have some less left beef just so i can have some more butter you can see the beautiful eggs cooking in the background it's day two meal two i have one burger patty four eggs and about a tablespoon of butter and then i'm going to have a little bit of that keeper at the end of the meal as well we are cooking up a 100 grass-fed beef ancestral blend i have here a half pound of heart liver mixture and then some oh my gouda moon cheese and then two tablespoons of butter here's the nutrition facts on the liver heart blend if you want to check it out [Music] one burger with four eggs all scrambled together with a tablespoon of butter and then two slices of bacon oh yeah the perfect bite right now we're cooking meal number one but today is our anniversary so we are going to have a special meal number two but for right now we're just making some burgers and eggs which at this point i'm sure is no surprise but i do just have to get a little bit of background and then also i want to tell you guys how much it costs to feed a lily in a day and how much it costs to feed a price per day and just overall how much money we spend on groceries for the month and so the background is we did just move to missouri about two months ago so before this we were eating more steak and eggs but at this costco they just don't have the steak that we like and these burger patties are actually a pretty killer deal it's only four dollars and fifty cents per pound for grass-fed beef which is really unheard of so yes in a typical day i do have three burger patties and four eggs and i will typically have that meal five out of seven days of the week so it costs about six dollars and 10 cents to feed a lily each day and as for bryce he eats the three burger patties so a pound of beef plus 10 eggs plus a little bit of butter plus he does have some ancestral beef liver supplements so it costs about let's just say ten dollars it's probably like nine dollars and fifty cents but for easy numbers we're gonna say it costs ten dollars to feed a price per day so in a month it's gonna cost me about 180 dollars to feed me and three hundred dollars to feed him so in total we're spending less than five hundred dollars per month for food for the whole month we don't typically go out to eat which is why again it's our anniversary and we're not going out to eat but it's mostly because i've been trying to find the best words to explain this but basically i don't want to throw restaurants under the bus but most of the time they are going to be cooking with vegetable oils or seed oils maybe they're adding different things into the meal or adding different seasonings and we just would rather know exactly what we're consuming so we would just rather cook at home [Music] this meal is about to be crazy and it's not carnivore by any means we are most days carnivore some days keto this is one of those days starting with sweet potatoes we're making sweet potato fries i cut up the chicken and then we put ghee all over our sweet potato fries and now we're loading them up with some pepper actually while we're cooking i thought i would just show you guys this is our relationship acknowledgement form bryce and i used to work together he used to be my manager and then once we told hr we had to sign this relationship agreement form which meant that we were never allowed to work together ever again even if we broke up we were never allowed to work together but i thought it was really funny so i hung it up on the wall and we signed and dated it on march 6th and that is why we celebrate our anniversary today we have some raw cheese ew bryce cut the cheese cooking with coconut oil [Music] in case you missed it i've said this before but i'll say it again i believe that chicken does not have as many nutrients as like red meat so we do put this organ meat based seasoning on top of our chicken so tasty we took sweet potato fries out and then we're just like flipping them around a little bit and then we're gonna put them back into the oven [Music] i know you've been seeing bryce do a lot of the cooking but i am in charge of the bacon and the eggs and then for the eggs i do something special where i make them like an egg soup so i do slow cooked eggs we add in half of that amount of raw cheese that you saw cut up and then we add in people's choices machaca which is just chopped up beef jerky and it's just a really delicious egg soup i'm so excited we have chicken and cheese bacon sweet potato fries with butter egg soup with cheese and shredded beef jerky butter town mostly excited for the butter oh this is going to be so good you think we're done no way there's more including more bacon [Music] a couple of bites of a rubble mint chip ice cream and a slice of bacon with some of lily's keto brownies and redmond's real salt it's a party but um seriously with the keto brownies they're actually in my opinion pretty clean they end up having only like three carbs so for the ingredients i did just use eggs and butter which i typically would eat and then the additional ingredients are going to be almond flour baking cacao and then some monk fruit sweetener but even still not that much for meal number one today i am doing half of a burger and then using some of that leftover chicken so i'm having three ounces of chicken and then two sunny-side up eggs and two tablespoons of butter which is why i like chicken just because it doesn't have as much fat which means i can have some butter [Music] the perfect bite some chicken beef egg and butter for meal number two i do have two eggs they're underneath my beef and then one burger patty usually i do a burger patty and a half so since i'm not having that extra half i did make two slices of bacon and then i still wanted a little more protein so i am going to have some beef and jerky and then i'm going to finish the meal with that tiny bit of kefir i finally finished the bottle of kefir and i still don't know if i'm going to buy it again and i did cook my chicken in the bacon grease it is monday meal number one and this is the only meal of the week where bryce and i don't eat together because he is off at logan university with the future doctors of chiropractic and he's taken blood pressure so every monday he is gone and you know he does all the cooking and i do all the cleaning so i don't make burgers and eggs i will have sardines because that's easy and then the leftover chicken from saturday and then because the chicken and the sardines are so lean i am having about two tablespoons of butter and then i do have bacon because i definitely know how to cook bacon so it's gonna be good [Music] what's cooking good looking one and a half burgers and two eggs surprise i'm actually not feeling this anymore so i'm going to give it to i'm going to be very transparent and honest with what happened yesterday for the past year i have been having sardines a couple times a week and even at one point i was having sardines every other day i was just craving them i was loving the taste of them bryce was getting sick and tired of eating sardines so often but i couldn't help it i was loving them and i think it's because my body was lacking something that the sardines have in them and that's why i was just craving them so much whereas the past six weeks to two months i just have not been digesting them very well at all basically yesterday after i finished eating i immediately was bloated my stomach hurt and two hours later i ran to the bathroom and had a liquid stool so my stomach hurt the rest of the day when we had the second meal i couldn't finish eating it all i was just in a lot of pain so i let bryce finish eating the rest of my beef and eggs and i might take a little chill pill on the sardines maybe start incorporating different fish but i just want to emphasize that the body changes what we crave changes even how we digest might change but i'm getting very hungry since i didn't have as much to eat yesterday so let's start cooking meal number one cooking the liver heart beef i have a quarter pound of the beef heart liver and then four ounces of chicken so finishing off the chicken from saturday and then two tablespoons of butter i'm having one burger two eggs some moon cheese and a tablespoon of butter this week we had a lot of meat and fat and that is pretty typical for us and i don't think that is going to change anytime soon but we do make slight alterations and adjustments to what we eat each week each month whether we're having more fat or more protein or reintroducing foods into the diet actually a couple weeks ago we tried some chicken bone broth and it made our hands very dry and crack and bleed but it could have just been the specific chicken bone broth product that we bought but that was just our experience this week we had a sweet potato and it was fine this upcoming week bryce is actually going to have less eggs and more beef i personally would like to have more organ meats but i just don't want to ever stick us in a box of this is what we eat every single day or every single week because we do make slight adjustments depending on how we're feeling and how we're digesting like i said about the sardines and i also did want to say too that i have been loving reading your guys's messages and comments about your successes with the keto the carnivore animal-based low-carb diets or even the standard american diet actually one of my best friends is a vegan and she says that she loves it but we just like seeing what works for other people how does it make them

"rxb6Add8w1Y": "[Music] hello babes welcome back and for those of you who are new here hello my name is Janelle and welcome to my youtube channel in today's video I'm gonna be showing you guys how to make five healthy and delicious snacks that I love all the ingredients and the directions will be listed in my caption below anyways you guys thank you so much for the love and I hope you enjoy snack number one veggie spring rolls this is my favorite way to eat all my veggies I got my rice paper sheets from my local Asian market if you don't have any rice paper sheets you can just use a big lettuce leaf and then I have a variety of delicious vegetables that I have in my fridge thinly sliced lemon avocado jalapenos cucumber orange bell pepper carrots cilantro spinach and a big lettuce leaf this is optional but I also have four strips of tofu and I'm marinating it in 1 tablespoon of low-sodium soy sauce first step is to fill a bowl with warm water a bowl big enough for the rice paper to fit inside this is what the rice paper looks like when it's hardened and then you're going to dip it into the warm water for about 30 to 40 seconds until the rice paper is soft [Music] you're gonna want to place your rice paper down on a wet surface so it doesn't stick and the trick with these is you have to work really really fast or the rice paper will start to dry up and it'll be very very sticky to roll first I'm adding the big lettuce leaf then spinach cilantro then I'm going to be adding avocado and the rest of the vegetables I'm going to be making some spring rolls with tofu and some just vegetables as you roll it push all the vegetables kind of to the bottom of the rice paper and then roll it like a burrito [Music] for the dipping sauce I'm using this sweet chilli sauce from Trader Joe's it is so so good and fun fact I actually read an article and it said that this product was their number one selling product out of everything that they sell which i thought was pretty cool and with these fresh veggies it just gives the spring rolls a nice kick [Music] here's a final product such a good snack so refreshing and light I love these because you can get creative and put whatever you want in them and it's just like a fun way to eat your vegetables I added some seasoning to it this is everything but the bagel seasoning which pretty much consists of salt garlic sesame seed and poppy seed it just gives it a little bit more flavor and it's just so good with that sesame sauce oh my god snack number two tuna salad boats these were so so good my sister and I devoured these if you're a fan of tuna salad like us this recipe is for you we're gonna start off with one can of tuna drain all that excess oil and juice we don't need that if you don't like to now you can use shredded chicken you can use cut-up shrimp if you're vegan you can use crumble tofu or you can use shredded carrots just some different alternatives for you guys mash up your tuna into smaller chunks okay I love citrus so much so I'm going to be adding a squeeze of lemon and lime juice I don't measure when I cook I usually just i everything and I finish this jar so I put about like one big spoonful of meanings I also added some mustard and buffalo sauce for the seasonings I added salt pepper garlic powder and paprika for my herbs I chopped up some cilantro and then I cut up some with green onions I tasted my tuna salad and I feel like I need more spice so I added some jalapenos to the mix so usually we eat tuna salad on bread like a sandwich but for this snack we're gonna be eating them in bell pepper boats and it's just such an amazing snack the sweet bell pepper crunch with the tuna salad you guys you have to try it this way is so delicious I personally like the orange bell peppers I find it it's the best sweetness then I just filled up the strips with a big spoonful of tuna salad until I was done with that bowl and [Music] here's a final product full of protein from the tuna and full of antioxidants and good vitamins like vitamin A from the bell pepper [Music] [Music] on to snack number three I'm starting off with rice cakes white cheddar rice cakes I love rice cakes so much I always recommend it to those who are trying to lose weight because this simple switch instead of eating bread can save you lots of calories and carbs let me just show you guys what I mean one rice cake has 45 calories and a total of 8 grams okay verses these are plain bagels one bagel one bagel has 230 calories and 47 grams of carbs even half a bagel would be more calories and carbs than two rice cakes so if you're trying to lose weight simple switches like this can really save you from eating extra calories and carbs that you don't need not that carbs are not necessary but they're not needed with every single meal and rice cakes are still really healthy for you they're filling they're nutritious and let me just show you what I mean I will be using half an avocado a slice of tomato and half a cucumber [Music] step number one I am smashing half an avocado on my cooking board and squeezing some lemon and lime juice and a little bit of seasoning [Music] then I'm going to take the avocado mixture and spread it over the two rice cakes this is pretty much like avocado toast but instead of bread with using rice cakes next I'm cutting one slice of tomato and then I'm cutting half a cucumber into little cucumber circles to top off my rice cakes and that's a final product this can be your snack as is but I'm going to add some more things on the side like some fresh watermelon and some nuts here I'm adding a handful of dry almonds and I'm also adding if you dark chocolate covered almonds just for something sweet [Music] snack number four egg muffins this could be a good snack idea but it could also be a good breakfast idea so I'm starting off with just two eggs and my vegetables I'm using spinach mushrooms jalapenos onions and garlic here I already pre-cut my onion and jalapeno then I'm going to dice the mushrooms into small pieces and cut the spinach into smaller strips next I'm heating up some oil in a medium pan and I'm going to start off by sauteing the onions and the jalapenos to be honest mushrooms and spinach are like the number one catfish vegetable because look how much they shrink what the heck for the egg mixture I'm adding two eggs and I'm also adding half a cup of egg whites this is optional but I'm adding literally a splash of milk and makes the egg mixture a little bit fluffier for the seasonings I'm adding salt pepper and a little bit of lemon pepper I'm also adding a pinch of baking powder which will make our egg muffins fluffy coating my mini muffin tray with some olive oil this is a nonstick pan and my muffins still kind of got stuck to it so I definitely recommend using a nonstick spray or some muffin cups I filled the tray with the filling for the muffins about half a spoonful per muffin and then I filled it up with the egg mixture this is optional but on top I sprinkled some Parmesan cheese as well as shredded cheddar cheese i preheated my oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and I cook these for about 10 to 12 minutes if you are using a bigger muffin tray it might be a little bit longer and here's a final product such a quick snack these would be perfect for after the gym because they're packed with protein and delicious vegetables these would also be really good to meal prep with you can keep them in your fridge and then reheat one whenever you want some breakfast or a healthy snack Cenac number five finishing off with something sweet these are seriously the easiest and quickest cookies I have ever made start off with one ripened banana and I'm going to mash it up until it becomes all mushy if you don't like bananas you can use half a cup of applesauce instead next I will be adding a dash of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla extract I'm adding one cup of oats and as you mix it you're probably don't notice that you might need some more so add as you go until the batter sticks together then I added 1/4 a cup of the chocolate chips and a splash of almond milk I'm gonna chop up some walnuts and also add this to my batter if you don't like walnuts you can also add pecans almonds or peanuts once the batter is evenly mixed I rolled them into bowls and then press them into cookie shapes since these aren't going to be melting into a cookie shape you kind of have to already press them into one I had leftover walnuts so I added some to the top and I place the cookies on a pan with some nonstick spray i heated my oven to 350 degrees and I cooked these cookies for about 10 minutes and here's the final product they were so good so moist inside and just so simple and easy to make thank you guys so much for watching that is the end of todays video I had so much fun creating this video and I'm really excited to make some more for you guys please let me know in the comments below if you tried any of the recipes and give me a thumbs up if you're interested in seeing more content like this I love you guys all so much I hope you're staying safe and I will catch you next

Today we're going to talk to you about PlantFusion. In the past, if you wanted to get more protein\nin your diet, your options were primarily limited to taking whey protein shakes. There were many people who had trouble digesting\nwhey, which is made from concentrated dairy. So, PlantFusion set out to solve this problem\nby creating a complete protein made from 100% plant sources, like quinoa, amaranth and peas. They also wanted to make a protein shake that\nactually tasted good. This sparked a mission to merge these two\ndiverse elements of complete plant based nutrition and great taste into what they call \"the Fusion\". PlantFusion began with the basic vanilla and\nchocolate flavors as a protein powder. Yum! From there, they expanded their flavors to\ninclude Cookies and Cream and Chocolate Raspberry. They also created a convenient ready-to-drink\ndrink that you could take to work or the gym and their Lean drink for those who are looking\nto curb their appetite. Now we're going to talk about Phood. Phood! One of my favorite products is PlantFusion's\nPhood. Phood is packed with the complete amino acid\nprofile to help recover and build muscle. How I like to make it is I'll take 1 scoop\nof Phood mixed with some almond milk and if I want an extra protein boost, I'll add\na tablespoon of peanut butter and a scoop of chocolate protein powder. Whether you're a vegan, or like me, just looking\nfor an alternate protein source, check out PlantFusion.

here you go Roger ramil faith is here to help you with some remedies to overcome it's a time of year everybody's gonna be doing a little extra party anything I said I got a tip for you that guy if you forget everything else I say today for one thing what do you think it is to prevent hangovers um water water there it is hey you know what most people are dehydrated especially here Ashley here you're already dehydrated you're drinking alcohol which dehydrates you further you have a hangover in the making and it's a simple fix all you have to do is drink about twelve two or three of these before you start drinking before see now I always thought start before you drink two or three glasses or bottles of water okay and then while you're drinking sipping a bottle of water some other liquids in a non alcoholic and definitely before you go to bed yeah be drinking another two or three glasses before you go to bed two or three glasses or two or three bomber bottles about the same Santis hydrate yourself will find yourself not really having a handle that's really good news and then you go to the party right you're at a party yes ranking start eating eat a little bit first that's never a problem for me okay won't have much of a hangover with this and a little bit of food particularly the fatty foods like if there's some peanuts or almonds i recommend six to ten raw almond really while drinking before you drink before you drink and white while you're drinking eat those are high in fat do you think the bartender's thought of that logic when they always place peanuts on the bar there you go ahead or some peanut butter or even halloween i don't know the moment but ever had almond butter no licious really do i like it absolutely good to know yeah does it matter like all right doesn't matter if you mix your alcohol does it matter what you did first question it's a good question don't mix your alcohol we all heard the phrase you don't mix beer and wine with hard liquor right what is it beer before yeah whatever threw up with that we can follow very well right but you choose your and by being carefully what you want to do is pick the pure alcohols for instance if you're going to drink distilled spirits pick me like vodka but I don't drink vodka but I was picking the spirit that would be the deaths the cleanest and the least impurity okay good to know yeah and then whiskey and brandy those are not good giving a lot of impurities and those of the elements the ingredients that cause severe headaches well that's actually I have to interview because that's an interesting thing because whenever I've been nauseous or not feeling well or had you know if I was sick I've got what is it a hotty toddy and that's made with whiskey isn't it I think so which is very ironic being that yeah it is a hotty toddy and nothing did that help you make it worse it actually made me feel better I'm not sure I'm gonna let that we know yeah just don't drink it good thing you know keeping watch how much you're drinking in a period of time okay nice yourself i mainly these people to drink 67 alcoholic beverages in an hour you're gonna have a hangover sherry absolutely one to two drinks an hour makes sense no more than five a knight and do make sure you're not driving home unless you're completely in charge yes that's a nap absolutely true hey and if you haven't you wake up in the morning right you've got the hangover right what do you do well that's exactly your drinking water of course but the best thing to do is get yourself to 240 spoonfuls of honey oh honey why honey why I don't know because there's high fructose high sugar in honey and the citrus fruits as well like lemon and other citrus fruits bananas apples these sugar slow the metabolism of alcohol okay help you get rid of these horrible symptoms like the headache and the sensitivity to them flight oh my god as you very much helpful hey the best thing to do you know you could have had a v-8 this is good and had a VA don't hit yourself in the hell hit yourself the VA that I'm not promoting v8 if you don't have a VA to get yourself some regular tomato juice preferably organic okay squeeze a whole lemon fresh lemon in that in the tomato jam this tomato juice drink that down you will feel better shortly really as far as the honey goes to 24 teaspoon fulls about every 20 to 30 minutes until you're feeling better you will feel better that's really but yeah now I always thought that if you drink a lot they always recommend whoever they are I don't know that I don't know if you have you have water and you have an aspirin before bed because that diminishes that possibility of a headache is that a myth this is this is a problem actually because your tummies are already being irritated by any alcohol taking aspirin which is very much a tummy irritant I've got some problems worse yet don't take tylenol with alcohol really known it in the younger days well you thought I had you I'm gonna have a hangover let's take some tylenol that's acetaminophen it takes an acetaminophen and drink wrong because you can easily blow your liver right there single time don't do that try and deal with the hydration the citrus fruits okay money and other ways to do it also walking I was going to ask you is anything physical possibly because when you walk you're kicking up your metabolism never gets started and it starts detoxifying your body which is basically a hangover your body is working to detoxify the acetaldehyde the toxin from alcohol Oh so when you're when you're waking up and you're saying I'm not moving for the rest of this day cuz you can't if you're thinking you're thinking that but ultimately you'll feel better if you do move if you do if you can't get out and walk please do it ok B vitamins I think they're they're essential to everything i'll be talking about the b-vitamin complex 50 to 100 milligrams a day wonderful especially the morning after you want to do that that helps the body stimulate the liver which helps detoxify the alcohol you'll feel better okay vitamin C we talked about it yeah it's knock on wood it's been saving me for the last antiviral great for the immune system it to stimulates the liver to detoxify the body so vitamin C about five hundred to a thousand milligrams twice a day with food be a great idea and you would do that if you woke up in the morning you felt not so good from the hangover would you say that vitamin B would be high so first thing in the morning you take your honey you do your VHS you take a milk thistle I've heard of milk yes you told us about does not milk right because I thought it was very product no it's just a name okay what milk thistle great again for rebuilding liver cells clearing toxins helps to support the liver and the kidneys ok actually milk thistle b-complex vitamin C and there are other ones a lot of remedies out there very very good to know and yeah and now you know how to prepare and I have to tell you this you want to get these supplies before your party yeah that's what I would think a hit think ahead always and that's always your advice isn't it absolutely think ahead and be

"[Music] oh good morning everybody welcome back to my channel today is a project come back hence why i'm in my workout gear for the day i started off my morning drinking some fresh lemon water now the reason why i use bottled water is because we are currently trying to figure out how to make our fridge water a lot more filtered because as you guys know filtered water is very key to step one of your health so i want to give you guys a body update because it is a project comeback so you gotta have a body update involved so this is what my abs are currently looking like very squishy not very defined like you get some definition like on the sides here when i flex i just have a lot of extra chunk and squish around my hips and this is me not sucking in it's just very like bloated like i said it's just very bloated i just want to de-bloat and get rid of all this extra squish for sure but this is me when i suck in and then me when i don't suck in you can tell the difference there is a lot more squish so that is the body update for this morning [Music] [Music] [Music] it is now 2 45 i've gotten back from the gym a couple hours ago i had an appointment and then i went shopping at costco and got a few things i went to costco and i got these organic hard-boiled eggs that are already come in and done it's just a big tray of already hard-boiled eggs but i love this because they're just pre-wrapped ready to go so i can take them easily to work then i also got two of these grilled chicken strips these are what i've been eating lately really good macros 22 grams of protein and then i just got some fresh fruit got some blueberries and some strawberries because you know your girl needs to have a variety you can't tell yes i have the hiccups if you guys know how to get rid of hiccups and this legit scientific way please let me know but until then forgive me i might hiccup in between talking oh but i want to show you this cool find that i found hiccups it's called purely elizabeth and it's vanilla almond butter graham grain free granola so this is paleo i was so surprised that there is only five grams of sugar for one serving because typically granola has at least like 15 to 20. so i was very very impressed by this paleo natural higher in fiber protein and less sugar is a win so i'm going to whip me up an acai bowl i'm going to put some of this delicious granola in there and then i'm going to add some dark chocolate and peanut butter so typically when i do an acai bowl or a shake i typically use almond milk but i actually recently found that almonds are actually really hard to digest and right now because i'm trying to work on my bloating and then my digestion i'm going to stick to water today to keep it a little more natural and hydrate my body so i'm just going to put some of that in there and because i'm making an acai bowl i don't want to add a ton of water so that i that might even be too much depending on how much i want to make then i like to add my frozen bananas which i did add into this container which guys convenient tip if you want to have frozen bananas put them in a plastic container like this because so much easier than a bag or frozen with this peels on don't do it a lot i'm going to add like a fourth of a banana add frozen blueberries i'm going to add some spinach and this is actually a mix of kale and spinach a cool tip i actually want to share with you guys i don't unfortunately have any zucchini right now but something that is so good is if you freeze frozen zucchini like i did the banana you it just adds a creamy texture and a creamy like just flavor overall and honestly like i don't taste the zucchini super much and like yeah you just add protein so good this is the protein powder i've been liking a lot lately i got it from costco but it's chocolate probiotic and it is vegan and vegetarian because i am sensitive to whey i'm gonna just do two but definitely if you want to cut it in half you can but i like extra protein turn on the lid and let's put it on yes so this is the texture that you want it to be you want it to be really creamy like like wendy's frosting if you guys know what i'm talking about here in the u.s if you've ever had a wendy's frosting that's the texture you want it to be okay now don't laugh at me we're using a paper cup because i don't have a dishwasher to clean a bowl so i don't have access to bowls right now so this is going to be my i saw e cup instead this is the finished product doesn't that look so delicious i'm telling you guys 10 out of 10 would recommend this so so good all right it has come to the end of this vlog but before i go i wanted to give you guys a couple tips that would help you on your own project comebacks if you're starting them one is to never underestimate how much water you actually need make sure you're drinking a lot of water to where your pee is like a light tint of yellowish white this means that you're well hydrated and that you're drinking enough water this helps flush out all the excess food chemicals anything in your system that your body does not want it helps activate that gut which is so so important that leads me to tip number two make sure that you are going to the bathroom regularly at least once a day studies have shown that if you are not going to the battery room regularly it can cause a lot of problems one of them being you are going to have a slower metabolism meaning that you're going to gain more weight because your body is not working and functioning as it should so by going to the bathroom and going regularly is going to get rid of all that excess waste in your system that your body does not need and a healthy digestive system means a healthy functional and fit body three is to make sure with every meal that you are having good sources of fiber a variety of the rainbow so make sure that you're having lots of vegetables a variety not just eating the same vegetable every single day but have you ready next tip is when you are going to the gym get into a routine that is going to help you sweat it out sweating out all those excess excess toxins sweating out everything that you just don't want in your system and just really getting that gut activated again this is going to really really help when you guys are starting your own project come back on your own health journey make sure you guys are doing it the right way make sure that you're eating a sufficient amount of food to fuel your body to give your body the energy that it needs but do it the right way exercise drink lots of water and eat the rainbow and i promise you guys you'll get there hope you guys enjoyed this video i am looking forward to the next video so stay tuned for it and we will see you guys next

wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and look at this little puppy hook-shaped doohickey I've got here today Tara from Kiva Kiva guys we reviewed Kiva products before nothing quite like this we've only reviewed their chocolate bars which are among my favorite edibles if a little pricey they are delicious and today we are looking at their espresso beans coated in dark chocolate not only is this the first time I have had the tera kiba product this is the first time I've had chocolate-covered espresso beans so I'm excited on two fronts that's my dog Newton the back there everyone say hi so let's go ahead and open this up take ourselves bite and explain how wheats works so if you guys have never tuned in two weeks before the way our reviews work is I am going to take this edible eat some of it in front of you here not necessarily the whole thing because I don't want to bore you to death but I rest assured I will eat the next the whole thing over the next couple of minutes and I will come back to you in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review now we've got a sticker here that says hard to see with no background start with one bite that's the wait for at least two four hours for the full effects we're going to ignore that advice and go straight into the beans here we go whoo that tastes like dark chocolate covered coffee beans Wow that's not bad actually they're very bitter but no wheat taste so I see you I'm specific you're not also very caffeinated is that part of this I hope maybe a fun side effect so guys they're quite a few of them in here I'm gonna crunch and munch on them all and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how these guys are feeling I should come to you quite high and quite jittery from all the caffeine well who knows maybe unroasted espresso beans don't have caffeine I don't know who says who's to say we'll find out soon see in two hours feels like I'm caffeinated already see you then peace guys I am back it has been 2 hours thank you for sticking around and man I love this the Terra the Kiva excuse me the Kiva ter a hundred and twenty milligram espresso beans are great I mean I'm really high for 120 milligram Anibal they tasted great and I feel pretty energized like yeah you know like there's just probably quite a bit of caffeine in there maybe yeah this is this is a great great product another real win from Kiva I was I was optimistic about it but it was a little you know trepidatious and never had like the chocolate-covered espresso beans and was a little worried about how potent they might be and how they might taste and on both fronts I gotta say they exceeded expectations really happy with this one from Kiva and this is again the Kiva Tara espresso beans it cost me I believe 12 bucks at my dispensary worth every penny home run love it if you see it a dispensary grab it and that's gonna do it for this episode here on wheat skies I would throw this at the camera like I normally do but I'm afraid it would break it because I think this screen is made of glass yes I think it is okay all right well thank you so much for watching and we will see you on the next review peace No hello and thank you so much for watching weeds if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "RgNbp3c-LKQ": "welcome to the first episode of mm medical edibles edibles listen don't play dumb he means like pot brownies my name is Jeff Tania Nicol and I'm a culinary nutritionist the way a professional chef no would graduate from Johnson & Wales University today we're gonna make brownies the most popular and common first edible experience you can make your own edibles at home by making butter or oil simply by using some marijuana is not a drug or trim if you can get your hands on it you can make oil with Keith's hash or shatter in terms of dosage it's really personal we'll go to the loony bin together this recipe makes 12 rounds we'll be using half a gram of shatter and butter which will equal 30 milligrams of THC per serving this shatter was tested at eighty six point four percent THC will be using infused oil as well as butter from this recipe my edibles have been recently featured in two Redman videos as well as the enough about me let's get to baking pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees we're gonna start by melting 12 ounces of bittersweet chocolate we also have a stick and a half of butter and a quarter cup of oil which we have already infused with the shadow we'll melt that together over a double boiler on a low simmer this is just a saucepan with about two inches of water and a heatproof bowl and then stir occasionally as it melts and let it completely about once the chocolates melted turn off the stove take it off the heat and set it aside let's get our baking dish ready while the chocolate melts in the oven preheats I've prepared a 9 by 13 inch baking pan I've placed parchment paper on the bottom we're going to cover the bottom as well as the surrounding edges with the infused oil that way the brownie will come out really easy once it's done baking if your supply is limited you don't have to use your infused oil you can absolutely use butter looks good to me now just set aside Oh what I'm so high right now I have no idea you should always clean as you go it always makes the end process that way less cleaning for you and now for the dry ingredients next we're going to sift all the dry ingredients together two cups of all-purpose flour one tablespoon of instant espresso and a quarter teaspoon of kosher salt I got papers but bongs all the ingredients the reason why you want to sift your dry ingredients is you want to make sure that you take out any lump it also aerates the flour so we're going to put two cups of all-purpose flour and you can put all the ingredients right in the sifter all together next we're going to grab our measuring spoons then we're going to add a tablespoon of instant expressive coffee really brings out the flavor in your chocolate and half a teaspoon of kosher salt we've set aside the dry ingredients now let's get the wet ingredients ready let's start by cracking some eggs we only need four eggs for this recipe when you crack eggs you really want to crack them one by one that way if there's a bad one you can just throw it out can I offer you a nice egg now again we're using four whole eggs for this recipe now we're going to mix it with two cups of sugar you want to use your paddle attachment for your stand mixer we'll blend the two cups of sugar with the four eggs until they're nice and fluffy then we'll add a tablespoon of vanilla extract the chocolate mixture and then our dry sifted ingredients if you prefer to use vanilla bean pods you can use one vanilla bean pod scrape the inside and add it to the mixture you mean marijuana and we're going to mix this until it's light and fluffy [Music] that looks nice and light and fluffy now we'll add a tablespoon of vanilla extract now we're going to add the chocolate mixture chocolate did you say chocolate we're going to combine the rest of the dry ingredients to the batter before we do that I'd like to take the semi-sweet chocolate and just give it a nice toss through the flour that'll prevent the chips from sticking to the bottom right now the batter looks like a thick chocolate mousse and we're going to add these dry ingredients and it's going to definitely thicken up you want to start off slow so that the flour doesn't go flying everywhere and then gradually increase the speed and you just want it till it's well combined you don't want to over mix this batter or else it will end up being like a cake I love cake the final step before we put it in the oven we're going to add 6 ounces of semi-sweet morsels [Music] perfect so you just want to place the mixture into your 9 by 13 baking dish remember we put parchment paper on the bottom and again that's going to help us to remove the brownies once they're already cooked and as you can see it's a very thick mixture that's efficient and of course we want to get every little last drop of this that's what she said you want a nice even mixture so you want to spread it out nice and even that's what she said and that looks just about perfect we're going to put these delicious brownies in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes in the meantime give us a thumbs up and subscribe once the timer has gone off you want to check your brownies with a toothpick and as long as it comes out mostly clean your brownies are all set to go you want to let your brownies completely cool on a wire rack then they're ready for garnishing we're going to make a simple caramel sauce for our brownies we're gonna start with 1 cup of sugar J 2 tablespoons of water I got you and then I'm going to squeeze some fresh orange juice which I'm just going to put through the strainer so we don't get any pulp in the sugar and we really only need about a table if our in juice doesn't appease you you can use any citrus you like lemon lime even grapefruit with the wooden spoon to slightly stir you want to leave it on a medium to low heat until it turns a nice dark amber color the caramels turned a nice dark amber color we're going to lower the flame and slowly add half a cup of heavy cream be careful when adding the cream because steam may rise and you may burn yourself it has such a delicious smell and you can really smell that orange in it your last step is to add one tablespoon of butter it's this beautiful dark amber color this is going to be absolutely delicious on top of those brownies remove the caramel sauce from the stovetop and pour it into a tempered glass dish I've gathered a couple of other ingredients a few of my favorites actually some shaved coconut some Thin Mint Girl Scout cookie cereal pecans peanut butter cups and a variety of candy bars literally the combinations are endless chocolate is like wine is like cheese is like coffee you can pretty much pair it with anything I love chocolate my favorite are the Rolo's I think I'll do coconut Rollo's and pecans definitely a good combination with the caramel sauce I'll just give the pecans and the Rolo's a rough chop you always want to be careful when you're cutting next keep your fingers away from the blade it'll tend to move on you I like to use unsweetened coconut because I think this recipe has enough sugar sugar as you can see I'm barely putting the knife to the edge just to loosen it but it should flip out for us fairly nicely another piece of parchment paper on top and just going to flip it and because we put that parchment paper on the bottom of the dish the Browns came out really easily now this does make 12 servings but you can make them smaller if you want you can use the same dough and use a springform pan and I like to make ice cream cakes or ice cream sandwiches these are definitely a nice size brownie not only the fact that they're 30 milligrams thg per serving but the actual brownie itself is a nice cents now look at how deliciously decadent these look and we haven't even topped them so I've cut these upside-down but look how delicious they look flipped over see how fudgy and chocolaty they are they have a nice crisp outside and you can tell the inside is nice and moist just melting I like to drizzle each brownie individually with the camo sauce that way the caramel sauce loses on all four edges a little bit of coconut a little bit of rolos some pecans and then another drizzle this is a great recipe that you can make with either cata butter or can oil it's really up to you and what you have available please leave us a comment and let us know how you like this video also what do you want to see us make next questions likes dislikes leave it in the comments and we'll get back to you here you have it our medical editor with shaved coconut Rollo's and pecans and a caramel drizzle just you could taste all the chocolate and the stickiness from the caramel the crunchiness from the coconut and the pecans it's just delicious tune in next time subscribe and give us a green thumbs up that was [Music] this is not for you no chocolate for your doggie [Music]", "eihmApGWX0M": "Let's talk about Insulin Resistance, the\u00a0\nsilent killer. Insulin resistance is a very\u00a0\u00a0 common health problem. Around 60-75% of people\u00a0\nhave insulin resistance. And it is often not\u00a0\u00a0 diagnosed, until you get pre-diabetes or type 2\u00a0\ndiabetes. All pre-diabetics and diabetics have\u00a0\u00a0 insulin resistance. Insulin resistance\u00a0\nalways occurs before type 2 diabetes.\n\u00a0 By the way, if you\u2019re new to my channel I\u2019m\u00a0\na nutritionist and a health coach who is all\u00a0\u00a0 about providing you with the best-science\u00a0\nbased health and weight loss advice.\n\u00a0 So, If you\u2019re interested\u00a0\nin staying healthy and fit,\u00a0\u00a0 don\u2019t forget to like this video, subscribe to\u00a0\nmy channel and click the notification bell,\u00a0\u00a0 so that you would get notified\u00a0\nwhenever I release new videos. \n\u00a0 So, what are some of the\u00a0\nsymptoms of insulin resistance?\n\u00a0 The most common ones include excess belly fat,\u00a0\nfrequent urination, constant hunger and a need\u00a0\u00a0 to snack, feeling tired after meals, craving\u00a0\ncarbs, brain fog, inflammation, high cholesterol,\u00a0\u00a0 high blood pressure, fatty liver.\nAnd if you have this condition and don\u2019t do\u00a0\u00a0 anything to reverse your insulin resistance, you\u00a0\nhave high chances of becoming obese and getting\u00a0\u00a0 most common chronic health conditions\u00a0\nsuch as type 2 diabetes, heart disease,\u00a0\u00a0 Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which is now being called\u00a0\ntype 3 diabetes or diabetes of the brain. \n\u00a0 So, What is insulin?\nInsulin is hormone produced in pancreas\u00a0\u00a0 that regulates your blood sugars.\nWhat is the function of insulin?\n\u00a0 When you eat food, that consists\u00a0\nof carbohydrates, fats and protein,\u00a0\u00a0 you digest your food and absorb the digested\u00a0\nfood molecules into the bloodstream. \n\u00a0 So, when you eat sugar and other\u00a0\ncarbohydrates, it gets converted\u00a0\u00a0 into glucose and it raises your insulin.\u00a0\nInsulin comes to lower that sugar in the blood\u00a0\u00a0 and help glucose to get to where it needs to. \nInsulin is like a key that opens the door to the\u00a0\u00a0 cell, allowing the cell to get the glucose\u00a0\nin. Once the cell has enough of glucose,\u00a0\u00a0 it will send a signal back to the pancreas\u00a0\nto say that it\u2019s fed, it had enough,\u00a0\u00a0 and the pancreas will stop producing insulin. \nSo, there\u2019s this on and off communication\u00a0\u00a0 between the cells and the pancreas.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s called the feedback loop. \n\u00a0 Insulin allows the cells to get their fuel \u2013\u00a0\nglucose, and then puts the rest into storage,\u00a0\u00a0 in a form of glycogen, and the rest gets converted\u00a0\ninto fat and stored in the adipose tissue. \n\u00a0 We have only around 350 - 600g of storage space\u00a0\nfor glucose in a form of glycogen. This would\u00a0\u00a0 be equivalent to 1400kcal up to 2400kcal. We\u00a0\nstore it in our muscles and liver. And then,\u00a0\u00a0 we have around 100000kcal worth fat stores.\u00a0\nWhich is around 11000grams of srored fat,\u00a0\u00a0 which is equivalent to 11kg of stored body fat. \nWe are quite efficient at storing body fat and\u00a0\u00a0 have almost unlimited storage capacity. \nSo how do you get insulin resistance?\n\u00a0 To understand this, we have to first look\u00a0\nat how much glucose does your body need?\n\u00a0 You are supposed to have constant levels of\u00a0\n80-100mg/dL of glucose in your blood. This\u00a0\u00a0 amount is equivalent to around 1 teaspoon. \nAnd if your numbers exceed the 100mg/dL\u00a0\u00a0 concentration. It becomes toxic to your body. \nOver time, it can lead to cardiovascular disease,\u00a0\u00a0 nerve damage, kidney damage, blindness\u00a0\nand several other conditions.\n\u00a0 So, the insulin is there to keep\u00a0\nthese levels at around 100mg/dL. \n\u00a0 Even slightly higher levels\u00a0\nmight cause damaged over time. \n\u00a0 And what do I mean by slightly higher levels?\u00a0\nEven 0.5 a teaspoon more than you need,\u00a0\u00a0 let\u2019s say instead of 100mg/dL, you have\u00a0\n150. Even this smallest increase is toxic. \n\u00a0 So, to help you visualise, let\u2019s look\u00a0\nat an example of a regular meal.\n\u00a0 Let\u2019s say you had a plate of pasta. A serving of\u00a0\npasta will be around 100g. Pasta has around 70g\u00a0\u00a0 of carbs per 100g. Then, almost 100% of it will\u00a0\nget converted into glucose. It won\u2019t get released\u00a0\u00a0 into your bloodstream all at the same time, that\u00a0\nwould be deadly. But it will go into your blood\u00a0\u00a0 gradually, to be used as energy by the cells\u00a0\nor to be put into storage as glycogen and fat.\u00a0\u00a0 The speed it is released will depend\u00a0\non the glyceamic index and glyceamic\u00a0\u00a0 load, and it will be released over a few hours\u00a0\nperiod. But just to visualise, these 70g of\u00a0\u00a0 glucose theoretically would be an equivalent of\u00a0\naround 70,000mg/dL of glucose in your blood. \n\u00a0 And what if you eat this 3 times\u00a0\na day and snack in between? \n\u00a0 You will have a constant high\u00a0\nblood glucose and insulin levels. \n\u00a0 That\u2019s what I mean by elevated\u00a0\nglucose. High carbohydrate meals\u00a0\u00a0 provide you with crazy high amounts of sugar. \nSo how much sugar or other carbs should you be\u00a0\u00a0 getting a day to maintain this blood\u00a0\nglucose concentration of 100mg/dL?\n\u00a0 The answer is 0.\nThe amount of glucose we need a\u00a0\u00a0 day is 0. Because our bodies can make their own\u00a0\nglucose from the protein and fat that we eat. \n\u00a0 For the parts of your body that can run\u00a0\nonly on glucose and the maintenance of\u00a0\u00a0 correct blood glucose concentration, can\u00a0\nbe achieved without eating carbohydrates.\u00a0\u00a0 That\u2019s why they are not essential. There are\u00a0\nessential fatty acids, essential amino acids,\u00a0\u00a0 we must get these through our diets, and\u00a0\nthere are no essential carbohydrates. \n\u00a0 But carbohydrates are our main energy\u00a0\nsource, it\u2019s the preferred fuel source?\n\u00a0 Really?\nAround 85% of the body can run\u00a0\u00a0 of ketones. And only the rest 15% can run only on\u00a0\nglucose. And our bodies can produce that glucose.\n\u00a0 We use glucose first, because high\u00a0\nconcentrations of it are toxic,\u00a0\u00a0 so the body wants to get rid of it first.\nWhen we rely on glucose as our main source\u00a0\u00a0 of energy, and follow the dietary recommendations\u00a0\nthat we should be getting 50-60% of our calories\u00a0\u00a0 from carbohydrates, we getting these huge\u00a0\namounts of glucose into our systems.\n\u00a0 So when you have too much sugar and\u00a0\ninsulin over a prolonged period of time,\u00a0\u00a0 you develop a condition called insulin\u00a0\nresistance. That is basically a defensive\u00a0\u00a0 mechanism your body uses to prevent the toxic\u00a0\nlevels of glucose from invading your body.  \n\u00a0 Just look at this graph, comparing how each of\u00a0\nthe macronutirents affect blood glucose levels.\u00a0\u00a0 Carbohydrates affect blood glucose the most,\u00a0\nand fats affect blood glucose the least. \n\u00a0 Also, on the insulin scale, you will see that\u00a0\nhigh fat foods affect insulin the least.\n\u00a0 Then, there\u2019s another trigger.\nThe frequency of eating.\n\u00a0 As you eat a diet that is based on carbohydrates,\u00a0\nyou will have these huge blood sugar fluctuations.\u00a0\u00a0 And you will feel hungry all the time.\u00a0\nYou will want to snack once those blood\u00a0\u00a0 sugars crash few hours after your meals. \nJust look at this graph showing the low fat,\u00a0\u00a0 high carb vs the low carb high fat\u00a0\ndiet on blood glucose levels over time.\u00a0\u00a0 Low carbohydrate diet provides you with a steady\u00a0\nsupply of glucose, without those huge spikes. \n\u00a0 So as you eat carbs, you have more hunger and\u00a0\ncravings. Plus, as you\u2019re insulin resistant,\u00a0\u00a0 and your cells are starving,\u00a0\nyou will be even more hungry.\n\u00a0 This will result in frequent eating. And frequent\u00a0\neating will keep your blood glucose and insulin\u00a0\u00a0 high all the time. Just look at this graph.\u00a0\nEach time you eat your insulin gets elevated\u00a0\u00a0 and you are in a fat storing mode. \nSo these two things, a high carbohydrate diet\u00a0\u00a0 and frequent eating are at the root\u00a0\ncause of your insulin resistance.\n\u00a0 So now, as you are insulin resistant, you eat\u00a0\ncarbohydrates, it elevates your blood glucose,\u00a0\u00a0 the insulin comes, tries to put it into the cell,\u00a0\nbut the receptor is blocked. The insulin can\u2019t\u00a0\u00a0 bring glucose into the cell. Now the glucose can\u2019t\u00a0\nget into the cell because the key is no longer\u00a0\u00a0 working. Your cells are starving, the energy is\u00a0\nthere, but you can\u2019t get it. As glucose can\u2019t\u00a0\u00a0 get into the cell, there\u2019s no signal back sent to\u00a0\nthe pancreas to stop pumping insulin, there\u2019s no\u00a0\u00a0 feedback loop to turn the pancreas off. \nThen the pancreas keeps producing high\u00a0\u00a0 amounts of insulin. Typically, with insulin\u00a0\nresistance you get around 5-7x more insulin. \n\u00a0 So you end up having these extremely high\u00a0\nlevels of insulin that is ineffective. It\u00a0\u00a0 can\u2019t feed the cells. It can\u2019t lower your\u00a0\nblood sugars. It takes all the glucose it can\u00a0\u00a0 and puts it into storage as glycogen and body\u00a0\nfat. Especially around your belly. And then,\u00a0\u00a0 you have a really hard time getting back\u00a0\nthat stored body fat, and using it as energy,\u00a0\u00a0 because as you have constant elevated\u00a0\ninsulin, it inhibits fat burning. \n\u00a0 What can you do about it? How can\u00a0\nyou reverse insulin resistance?\n\u00a0 You simply have to remove the root cause, which is\u00a0\nfrequent eating and the high carbohydrate diet.\n\u00a0 And does it work?\nBetter than anything. Type 2\u00a0\u00a0 diabetics manage to put their type 2 diabetes into\u00a0\nremission by following this simple advice. \n\u00a0 So, if you would like to learn more about\u00a0\npreventing, or revering type 2 diabetes,\u00a0\u00a0 you can check out my other videos where I explain\u00a0\nit in detail. You can check out my video about\u00a0\u00a0 intermittent fasting, type 2 diabetes, or the\u00a0\nbenefits of low carbohydrate ketogenic diet. \n\u00a0 So, I hope this video was useful, thanks for\u00a0\nwatching, if you found this video useful,\u00a0\u00a0 don\u2019t forget to like and subscribe.

", "H_xCQ9IEQCE": "hi mixers welcome to the first installment of nad cue never a dumb question and today's question is what are percentages wellton percentages are exactly what they are they're the percentage of each item in your a juice so let's say you wanted to make for ease of this explanation of 100 milliliter bottle of ejuice in this bottle when filled to 100 milliliter is a hundred percent full well we decided we wanted regis to be 80 % BG and 20 percent PG now let's say our nicotine was a hundred milligram per milliliter PG based Nick and we want 3 milligram Nick in this e juice while we'd add three percent nicotine 3 percent of 100 milliliter is three milliliter of Nick to be added now let's add our VG eighty percent of a hundred milliliter would normally be 80 milliliters VG to add but we must subtract the 3 percent nicotine that we added because it's BG base and counts towards our total there fro will be adding 70 percent or 77 percent or 77 milliliter of VG our next is our flavorings so we know how much PG we'll need to add in the future so let's use our raw peanut butter and jelly recipe for example and we're using TFA peanut butter at 8 percent so 8 percent of 100 milliliter is 8 milliliter of peanut butter to add and then now we're gonna use our sweet bread crust at 4 percent of 4 percent of a hundred milliliters for milliliter of breakfast tab and then the strawberry eight percent which is 8 milliliter for 8 percent of 100 milliliter is 8 million no leader of strawberry Dan now these flavorings RPG Basin counts towards our final pg/vg ratio so our total flavorings in this recipe are 20% therefore we don't need any PG to meet our twenty percent PG ratio if a percentage of our flavorings only add up to say 15% we would have had ad 5% or five milliliter PG to this mix demeanor 80 % BG 20 percent PG ratio well that's it for first installment of nad kill it like I said if you guys have a question feel free to email us at the DIY e-juice

has definitely been a random like week or so and then i am not going to be here the first couple days of this next week and so i just been randomly um filming just different clips of food so this is a totally just random keto low carb meals is what this video is going to be i started this morning off with some coffee using the holiday blend starbucks coffee which is amazing i mixed together the pumpkin spice and caramel nut pods in my little frother here i love this frother i'll try to remember to link it down below pour it in there my coffee and look how good these nut pots froth up it is amazing and they taste amazing i am having some of these birch benders keto chocolate chip toaster waffles um two of them are six net carbs i um and i do like these i think they're better than the birch benders keto mix which you guys know i do not like i'm also having a couple slices of the uncured bacon topping my waffles with this la canto maple syrup which is not my favorite but it was what i had so i had one waffle two slices of bacon and a couple of scrambled eggs so this was a really good breakfast i also had some butter on top of my waffle as you can see for dinner this night i did have some parmesan chicken meatballs so good i did record this recipe so it will be coming out in a what's for dinner video probably this next week i paired that with a salad that has some sprouts some avocados some tomatoes and some grated parmesan cheese it was an amazing dinner as usual some of the holidays um this morning i'm starting off again with something coffee this time we're having some of these sugar international diet caramel mixing that with the caramel nut pods you know just trying to make sure i get a little bit of goodness in the day i had a snack this was either a snack or lunch i have this quite often provolone cheese with some meat wrapped around a pickle for dinner this night i had some bacon wrapped chicken tenders with some broccoli and some cheese side salad with some parmesan bacon cheddar crisps which i forgot i had these they are really good okay and then i have two slices of this keto bread with a half of an avocado i did put some red pepper flakes and salt into the avocado and smashed it up i have a busy day of painting so i'm going to have one of these happy food coconut sauce chicken bowls these are let's see this one is seven net carbs the other one i had was four night carbs these are really good i am going to prep some of these on my own i just need to find like a coconut milk sauce because it smells amazing and all these ingredients are super easy so i think i'm going to meal prep some of these bowls for next week here it is i feel like i can make that look so much more appetizing it's super watery which i don't like but i don't know we'll just we'll see but i bet i can recreate these a lot better um but it smells good so i'll let you know what i think this is terrible so it smells good and you would think it would be good based on all the ingredients but this tastes terrible i will tell you i had the southwest one it was good this one has a funky taste and i think it's that sauce um yeah i don't know that it's just it's just bad so the day i had that terrible lunch i ended up just making a salad so i just have some lettuce cucumber some diced up ham diced up cheese and some bacon and egg so for my breakfast i'm going to try this legendary foods pop tart i got in my ketokrate and i will let you guys know what i think it was weird it's like it's really soft i was afraid to put it in there for too long because my toaster likes to burn things um but i could hear it sizzling um this is four net carbs for this thing i feel like we can make these pretty easily and i may do that i'll need to get some sugar-free jelly but i may try to make these on my own because these are kind of spendy but i'm gonna try and let's just see what i think okay let's try this i need to try it on instagram though too that's why i told people i would try it on there also hmm not sure really sure what i think on first bite not very sweet the dough isn't kind of salty it's um eight total carbs oh no 21 total carbs eight fiber five erythritol for agulos the dough is super strange i feel like i could do a lot better with this dough that's my mission you guys make sure to figure out how to make a pop-tart it's just not that great not worth the money i don't think in my opinion on this day for dinner i had a couple of pork chops i always make my pork chops in coconut oil it's usually a garlic flavor coconut oil also cooked in the same pan some green beans with bacon and i had a first snack some of these crispy cuts uh from field trip island barbecue i got these off of my ketokrate these are amazing for a i think this is for dinner or lunch i had a wrap that i made with some pastrami love pastrami some mayo i had some of the hot habanero cheese on there and i just wrapped it up added in some spring mix with some spinach and then for the side i had some of this jalapeno cheddar dip which is so spicy but it is so good you guys definitely recommend that also had a couple of jalapeno poppers on the side this was a spicy meal which i guess is not unusual for me but there's my wrap and this dip like i said you have to get that dip it is really super spicy though i have not tried the buffalo one that i picked up but i bet it's just as spicy i hope you guys enjoyed this video of very very very random eats and a review of a couple different new items and thank you guys as always for taking time out of your day to watch my video and i'll see you guys in the next one bye guys", "XIjc3PlD5ZA": "so today i'm gonna be talking to you guys about my favorite snacks um to help me lose weight hi my name is rasmu welcome to my channel if you're new here welcome i hope you like this video enough to subscribe if you return into my channel welcome back i'm so excited to see you here today so today i'm gonna be talking to you guys about my favorite snacks um to help me lose weight so what do i consider a snack i snack it's anything that it's around 300 350 calories or so i think that will be a snack anything beyond that it's a meal let's be honest i'm gonna show you guys my favorite snacks right now um i hope you guys like them if you try any of this just let me know down below what you thought okay so let's get started so one of my favorite snacks right now and you're gonna love this if you like tuna it's infusion um chicken of the sea by infusions and they are delicious it's pretty much tuna and then they have a different um seasoning in it this one is specifically the thai chili um it's like a 2 out of 10 spiciness and it's 140 calorie i think this is especially for like the mid-afternoon hunger attack that you get because one of this and two rice cakes this is my favorite right now to eat with this one um and they are amazing these are 45 calories each so 90 140 230 so that's amazing maybe paint it with some you know water or if you're feeling down some pre-workout i dream pre-workout like it's water so don't judge me you might have a problem i don't know i don't know if i should be saying this on video but yeah so pair it with that um and it is delicious they have so many flavors they have the basil one i love it they have this one too my favorite one is the basil but they don't have basil right now so they were out of stock so delicious and it has it's amazing it's really good snack now if you're looking for something crunchy and again don't judge me for this dessert um something that i love to do is i do have a two-year-old boy and sometimes i eat his snacks and why because i have noticed actually kids snacks are very low in calorie check the labels if you wanna if you wanna see that so what i do is i buy for me and him um crunchies it's almost like cheetos i guess but not not really um the mild cheddar this whole thing has 110 car 210 calories this whole thing has 210 calories which is like a like half of uh like actually cheetos bag or any other snack that is for adults this whole thing has less calories than this and they are delicious i pair this with a monster a white monster that's zero calories but still energy and they are delicious i know i know but it works for me i need to lay off the cutting delicious so 210 calories another great snack for when you want something crunchy now let's move on to the most to the more sweet things um so one good thing to do is you can actually make yourself an iced coffee and a hot coffee and i mean you can put one cup of almond milk and you know make your coffee then i use um sugar-free flavorings so right now i'm using this one but it's just because there is no there were no other colors these are exceed these little things like four dollars i don't think so so i usually get them actually from ross or burlington any of your discount stores they will have the big bottles for like three dollars those are banging and you can take any flavors that you want and if you think about it maybe you do make it an ice cup you use one cup of almond milk um coffee no calories sweetener no calories a little bit of salt that's me and what you have like you have a huge cup of iced coffee or warm coffee or cappuccino if you want to call it like that for like 30 40 calories 50 at max if you went overboard with milk delicia said okay you know you can always just pair one piece of fruit like the bananas um with some kind of protein or some kind of fat as well so i i love peanut butter and what sets this peanut butter specifically apart from the others it's that it only contains peanuts and less than one percent of salt and that is very important you don't actually need um the extra added oils that they put on peanut butter that is just um to keep it from from separating the oils from the actual peanuts and one trick that i do it's that one whenever i get the peanut butter um and i go to storage it like for the first time i just make sure it's sealed and then i turn it over and i save it this way okay and what is what happens is that all the oil actually goes on the top and once you go in to stir it it's way easier than having all the oil accumulated on the top and then trying to like mix it with the peanuts hopefully it makes your life easier it definitely did mine because trust me i will i would go with no peanut butter for a week just because i had to like i knew i had to stir it once i open a new one nothing do you really wanna find me do you wanna catch these hands to the peanut butter like no no no no do not rely on peanut butter for protein because it's actually a fat source more than a protein source like come on um one like two tablespoons of peanut butter will give you 8 grams of protein but 16 grams of fat so don't look at this as protein look at this as fat and fats are important so good source of healthy fats my favorite snack ever is this what is this this is um i don't know what i don't i don't think it doesn't have any but basically it's um i took a sweet potato i and i i milk read this okay so i probably gonna like on sunday i just wash like five of this for the whole week and i put holes that you see in here i poke holes in it put it put in some aluminum paper foil paper and put them in the oven for like [Music] like two hours two and a half hours um at 400 let it cook let it be and then i take it out and it's all delicious so what i do is it's i take um i cut it in half for a little bit of salt um before i put any of my toppings i put a little bit of peanut butter on top of it then a little bit of cinnamon then a tiny bit a little drizzle of this bad boy and then i put it in my airfryer for two minutes and it's heaven it's heaven you guys have to try that if you like sweet potatoes and you like peanut butter i might have just changed your life i think that's it those are my favorite snacks to help me um lose weight i don't snack in the mornings i actually not very hungry in the mornings i mainly eat and snack during the afternoon at night so that's where i reach out to all of these things um not at the same time keep it at one now if you have a favorite snack that i i might have not mentioned let me know because i'm always looking for snacks i am not a big eater like oh my god i'm gonna eat this plate of food yes but i am a snacker and some of you guys know that because if you follow me on instagram you know my problem with snakes so i hope you guys like this video please give it a thumbs up and subscribe if you haven't already and i'll see you guys soon [Music]", "9HDwYhqYrYQ": "what's up gets a crew welcome back to the channel it's your girl Jill and I'm coming to you guys with another highly requested video I get a lot of emails asking what is it that I eat throughout the day but I find that many of you have trouble with healthy snack ideas well today I'm coming to you guys with ten of my favorite healthy snacks especially the ones that I ate throughout my 96 pound weight loss journey and I'm going to go ahead and separate them in different sub categories from highest and protein to snacks that can help you with your sweet tooth and so much more so make sure you stay tuned so protein why is protein so important well for one protein helps build lean muscle mass now the higher your muscle mass the lower your body fat percentage will be and so it keeps you fuller longer so between your breakfast between your lunch and between your dinner when you're having these protein based snacks you won't feel as hungry and you'll be able to power through the day without binge eating now here's a few of my favorite protein base necks so the Starkist tuna creation package happens to be one of my favorite go through protein base back one because it's super convenient all you need to do is over the top open and indulge and - because it is jam-packed with protein now this flavor in particular has 18 grams of protein only has 0.5 of Speck's and virtually no carbohydrates there's so many different flavors to choose from but lemon pepper happens to be my favorite another one of my faves happened to be one that I talked about repeatedly here on this channel and it is the Chobani simply 100 Greek yogurt now why Greek yogurt over traditional yogurt and that simply because Greek yogurts tend to have more protein than the traditional yogurt would now the best thing about the Chobani 100 is that it only has 100 calories has anywhere between 12 to 16 grams of protein depending on which one you choose five grams of fiber and only seven grams of sugar definitely a great choice for healthy snacking and once again one of my favorite so I am mindful that there's some of you out there that can't consume dairy or you just choose to stay away from it well the great news is that silk has now come out with a yogurt alternative and it is super yummy super delicious now this yogurt alternative is plant-based soy protein so there's no worry as far as milk base or anything of the sort but it is super delicious as if it is the real thing now it lacks the same amount of protein as the other Greek yogurts mentioned before but it's definitely a good thing to try another one of my favorites happen to be Luna bars and these Luna bars in particular they start from 12 grams of protein and they go up my favorite flavor happens to be the chocolate chip cookie dough and these things are so divine it definitely helps me when I'm craving chocolate or I'm craving any other sweets and the perfect thing about this is that it's not super super high in sugar it's not super high in carbs and the fat is really good so once again this is another one of my favorites and it could be both for protein based neck or when you just have that sweet tooth craving that you seem to can't get rid of another great protein based neck idea is the Applegate natural chicken breast sandwich meat and the cool thing about this is that you can pair this sandwich meat with other protein based snacks to keep you fuller longer of course me in particular I like to pair it with sour gentle string cheese and what I do is I take the Sargento string cheese and I wrap it in the sandwich meat now I wrap it and I just have it with almonds and that will at least give me over 20 grams of protein the sandwich meat has 10 the sour gentle string cheese has 8 and the almonds have about 5 grams if you are measuring out so I next go to some people only limit this to breakfast but you can have this at any time of the day now as wife is definitely something that I love to eat on a regular basis and it's as a snack with something else now ed white I usually have a cart in ready to go however you can also have a whole egg boil it and just remove the yolk and have the egg white itself once again this is something that you can pair with almonds you can pair it with string cheese you can pair it with even tuna fish and it's a great way to get your protein intake if you have horrible sweet tooth cravings you are definitely not alone and the next series of snacks I find that help me a lot with my sweet tooth this gets really out of control now the first one we have here is the Quaker brand rice cake the one that is shown is lightly salted but keep in mind that Quaker has so many other flavors you have the green apple you have the chops where you have to Tedder and so many others but lightly salted is what I usually grab so that I can add peanut butter now the peanut butter that I grab is the peanut butter and cold white chocolate wonderful and the best thing about it is that it actually tastes like white chocolate wonderful it has no trans fat no cholesterol no high fructose corn syrup and only seven grams of sugar curve now it's really important to keep in mind that peanut butter is generally high in fat so make sure that you don't overdo it and you stick to the serving size listed on the nutritional facts now what I usually do is have this right before I know I'm fit in the gym or throughout the day when I know that I'm going to be burning a lot of calories don't have this neck at nighttime and also don't have it if you know that you're not going to be super active throughout the day now another one of my favorites that tend to help with my sweet tooth is the Chobani Greek yogurt flip now unlike the Chobani 100 seen earlier these have a little bit more of calories and a little bit more sugar but it still has 12 words of protein and they come in various flavors I am now hooked on the peanut butter and jelly flavor but they have cream pie so many other delicious ones that definitely is still a great source of protein and will help with your sweet tooth cravings so it's no secret that I'm totally in love with the Blue Diamond oven roasted almonds the happened to be one of my favorite go-to snacks and not only is it healthy but it definitely helps my sweet tooth whenever it takes in now with each serving of these almonds you get about five grams of protein and once again it is totally delicious it comes in dark chocolate as well as strawberry and blueberry now while these are healthy almonds nuts all together tend to be higher in fat we just want to make sure that you're sticking to the nutritional facts stick to the servings and make sure that you don't overdo it remember I have late-night cravings I tend to these outshine fruit bars now the best thing about these fruit bars is that they're low in calories low in carbohydrates and low in sugar they come in so many different flavors and once again there is no sugar added so whenever you feel that sweet food coming on at night this will be a perfect thing to grab now if you ever get a craving for chips and salsa the late July brand will definitely help satisfy that craving now these tortilla chips are available in different flavors and the nutritional facts aren't terrible at all it's always important to take note of the nutritional facts and I also pair this with the Muir Glen organic mouth salsa so what's your favorite healthy snack use the comment section below so let me know what some of your favorite healthy snacks are [Music]", "7HlBDiXv7Jc": "[Music] you guys havin your breakfast mush mush yummy daddy's having this shake good morning guys Taylor here from beating jeans and today I just wanted to film a video showing you what me and my kids eat today I started off with a cup of tea this is blueberry milkshake it's from David's tea you can order it online it is by far my favorite it's nice and creamy but still vegan sweet enough to where you don't have to add your own sugar and I am a huge believer in starting the day off right by making your bed it just kind of sets the tone for the rest of the day it makes you feel accomplished [Music] I made myself a protein drink this morning that consisted of almond milk my favorite protein powder buy or gain daily green boost a banana spinach kale and frozen cherries [Music] after making my shake I headed into the bathroom with the kids and got them ready for the day as well ah this selfie look at the big muscles on them you're getting so big yeah [Music] what are you doing in here making a simple artisan bread for what for whatever like for tonight oh yeah what's in it water yeast salt flour like let it roll you're gonna let it rise yeah and then bake it tonight yeah tomorrow so you can let it rest in the fridge for three days [Applause] Brad we love beard don't we we are getting ready to go to the gym the kids are gonna come with me and they are going to stay in the gym daycare while I do my workout and then we're gonna go

taking a bottle so I'm gonna bring a bottle and that she loves this flack smoked by good karma its lightly sweetened and it has like the same amount of vitamin D and calcium that you are going to find in regular cow milk but it's so much better for you I also decided I'm going to make the kids a peanut butter jelly sandwich I use Dave's killer bread that I love this dam so much because it actually has like blueberries in it the kids like me to cut their crusts off so it's always a good little snack for me peanut butter jelly sandwiches have as much protein as a three ounce steak which is pretty good knows eight grams of protein and then let's see one slice of bread there's five grams of protein so I tend to use about two tablespoons of peanut butter two slices of bread that's 18 grams of protein that's really good huh hey guys where are we going where are we going yeah yeah we're going to the gym gym gym yeah we're going to the gym gym gym Holly Charlie and Charlotte they're gonna

do a warm-up on the stair stepper by climbing a hundred flights of stairs which was pretty tough and then I headed over to another area where I did a leg focused workout and I used kind of light weights today just because I'm still recovering from a stomach bug that I had last week but all in all I'm after my legs and my abs I'd say I got a pretty good workout in [Music] if you guys want to know more about the workouts I do leave a comment in the section below and maybe I can make like a little video showcasing some of my workouts we just left that gym and I am having my protein shake

hey guys welcome back to my channel um today's video is going to be at macro counting video so I'm going to be giving you a breakdown basically what I eat in a day and I want to break down my macro count as well I made a video on how you can calculate your own macros and I'll put the link to that video in the description box below so you can figure out on your own macro count according to your goals but today I'm basically let me show you what I eat in my Pacific mackerel count for myself I'm starting off with my first meal of the day I'm having oatmeal and yogurt so I'm going to show you what I put in my oatmeal first I'm giving you a glimpse of the nutrition facts of everything so your macros basically make up your fats your carbs and your protein and so it's really good for when you are on any type of fitness goal that you have to measure these out I measure everything out and I calculate everything and MyFitnessPal so I don't really have to do any math myself my fitness power does everything all the ingredients basically mostly everything that I get I get from Walmart everything here I got from Walmart this oatmeal here is my Kodiak I believe that's how you say it but they make protein packs it's like oatmeal pancakes and things like that I'm gonna show you how I make everything but first I'm just going to show you the ingredients so here I have some yogurt and some some walnuts once again purchased at Walmart I shouldn't show the nutrition facts on that as well walnuts are pretty high in fat but it's hard for me to get a good amount of healthy fats in so I really like to rely on walnuts for my healthy fats the yogurt here has a lot of protein in it so that's why I have the yogurt and the oatmeal was for my carbs so those make up my macros for my first meal yogurt for protein walnuts for fats and then herbs came from the the oatmeal and the peanut butter also has protein and fats in it as well but like I said I record everything in my fitness pal I just measure everything out I put the measurements that I use and I plug it into my fitness pal and it does all the math for me so if you're not familiar with my fitness pal I know there's like tons video tons of videos out there on YouTube that teaches people how to use it so for my oatmeal I like to measure out a quarter cup of the still cut oatmeal and I'll use a pack of the Kodiak oatmeal and for the yogurt I use plain Greek yogurt and I used to have a cup of plain Greek yogurt a quarter cup of vanilla yogurt I do that because the vanilla yogurt has way less sugar than the plain yogurt and then I used a quarter cup of walnuts and once the middle is made up I'll show you guys the total macros of everything so as I was waiting on my oatmeal to cook I was doing like a body check and an ab check and I'm just really happy because I've been working really hard these last eight weeks to really just cut I can't dance y'all but I've been like really just trying to cut my body fat while hanging on to my curves and I've done that by basically counting my macros and I'm gonna be putting out a video I don't know what I'm gonna title it but a video on how to do that how to cut your fat while keeping your curves but now that my oatmeal is done I'm going to measure off my peanut butter everything that I eat I measure and I put it into my fitness pal so I track everything so my my my fats my carbs and my proteins my macros I track them it's very important and here's the total breakdown of my first meal and as you can see it's a lot of food I'm a pretty tall girl you can probably tell but I eat about 2,500 to 2,600 calories a day and my first mill is normally my biggest mill here's my second middle of the day and here's the calorie and the macro breakdown for everything I have some scrambled eggs with vegetables turkey bacon some whole wheat toast and a protein shake so everything like I said I normally get from Walmart so I have this uncured turkey bacon that I get from Walmart and I eat three slices of that and here's the the macro breakdown for my turkey bacon I like to put that on a stove top with some olive oil and then I'll just basically fry that on top of the stove I'm sorry for the bad camera angle I didn't notice that it was that bad until I went to edit the video but I'm still trying to get used to like this editing and everything like that but like I said before I did upload a video on why it's important to track your macros and I also let you know how you can come up with your own macro account so you can see how many carbs you should be eating your fats and your proteins for your specific goals but it's just really good to track your macros for overall body composition and I'm normally a MyFitnessPal I don't track like small things as far as like bell peppers and onions because they're very low in calories and it's just like pointless to track things like that like you'll drive yourself crazy but the things that are like loaded with like the fats in the carbs and the protein is like mainly what you really want to track and what you're really I'm trying to pay attention to so I put some olive oil in here in the pan and I track that as well about a teaspoon of olive oil to be able to because olive oil has fats good fats to be able to saute my vegetables in here is the protein and I'm using it some cheap protein I got from Walmart and I really don't you know buy expensive protein but it has a good amount of protein in it so one scoop is what I'm using and that has 30 grams of protein in it and I pretty much just helps me get to my protein intake for the day because because I have to eat so much you know I'm a tall girl I have to eat more than most girls it's kind of hard for me to get that protein in there so protein shakes have really helped me get my protein and protein is important you don't want to like a good rule is to get one gram of protein pound that you weigh so right now I'm sitting at about 205 pounds I lost 10 pounds in the last six weeks but so ie about 205 sometimes more grams of protein a day and that's a lot of protein to eat so I I you know use protein shakes to help here's the whole wheat bread that I'm using whole-wheat potato bread I really love this bread it's low in calories low in fat but it helps me get some carbs in there as well and I'm going to scramble my eggs now that my vegetables are done sauteing normally I'm so bad at doing egg whites normally I'll do one whole egg and I'll buy a car in the egg whites but I was out of my part in the egg white so I had to do the whole you know try to separate the yolk from the egg and I'm just horrible at that but I like to season my eggs with pepper garlic powder in Italian seasoning I love Italian seasoning so here's my middle two and I want to show you guys the sugar free sauces that I like to use I have sugar-free jelly and sugar-free ketchup I don't like to eat a lot of sugar because sugar tends to sit on top of your stomach and it turns into like belly fat that's hard to get rid of so I like sugar free some condiments jelly ketchup sugar free barbecue sauce things like that so that pretty much finishes up middle - I had scrambled eggs with sauteed vegetables turkey bacon some wheat toast in a protein shake on the side here's my third meal it is chicken thighs brown rice and a mixed vegetable that I got from Walmart so I didn't make those vegetables those are frozen vegetables I really don't make too many fresh vegetables unless I'm doing like some type of smoothie but here's the broccoli stir fry that's what it is I got from Walmart and asked some uncle ben's whole grain brown rice and so I'm showing you nutrition facts on that and these are as you can see very it has no fat have some carbs in it and a little bit of protein but you know I'm basically using it for the micronutrients and here's the brown rice and I'm using that for my carb intake so I just basically follow the ingredients on the bag and make that on the stove to give my vegetables some flavor I like to saute them with soy sauce and olive oil and once again I do track the bottle the olive for you because it is loaded in fat so I don't want to make sure I want to make sure I'm not you know eating too much olive oil so I measure everything out let me see okay so I used olive oil and soui sauce to saute my my vegetables because they didn't have any like seasoning or anything and it just depressed ripples and I basically just saute that up I didn't show a video of me cooking the protein because it was mill perhaps I already had it in the fridge but these are chicken thighs and I weigh everything on thighs like I measure and weigh everything and I try not to eyeball I really do sometimes I do but I try not to so I'm having about 5 ounces of chicken and then I have some ground turkey here and I'm having about 5 ounces of ground turkey the cup that I used to measure it you know I had to subtract that from the weight but that was about 5 ounces of each and so those are the proteins that make up for my macros so one is for lunch one is for dinner there's my rice there's my vegetables once the rice is done for dinner I mean for lunch I'm sorry for lunch I like to have a whole cup of rice and for dinner I'll do 1/2 a cup of rice so I'll go down on my carbs so I'm just basically measuring that out and then I don't measure vegetables vegetables they're just like 2 meters just free calories like I can eat as much vegetables as I want because they don't have a lot of you know a lot of macros in them so here is the dinner is the ground turkey the brown rice the mixed vegetables and for dinner I'll also add on another protein shake to help me get to my protein count so I hope you guys enjoyed this

fit town and in today's video i'm going to be revealing how food companies are using their packaging to lie to you and deceive you and the number one skill that you can learn and develop which is learning how to read nutrition labels in order to prevent these companies from being able to deceive you being able to read and decipher nutrition labels is one of the most essential life skills that you can learn and develop and acquire and if you learn how to do it it will be a skill that you will likely use every day for the rest of your life and how many things out there can you say that about so with reading nutrition labels what i often see is that people spend too much time paying attention to the front of the package and not enough time on the back of the package and one thing that we need to understand is that the front of the package is basically the brand the company that you're buying that package from that is their ability to market to you okay that is marketing on the front of that package with the brand name even some of the claims you see on there like low calorie high protein gluten free even sometimes organic these things can be very misleading and essentially the front of the package is the company's opportunity the brand's opportunity to mislead you where the truth typically lies is on the back of the package where we see the nutrition facts and the ingredients list being the two key components and these companies have to be a lot more truthful in what they put in the back of the package and those nutrition facts and ingredients list there's a lot less ways for them to kind of cheat the system and make things look better than they actually are and when it comes to the nutrition facts and the ingredients we have to understand that both of these two elements are important and what i found is that a lot of people either focus on one or the other so if you're someone that's very focused on tracking calories tracking grams of protein maybe you're following a macronutrient based diet you're tracking your macros you're going to be very focused on the nutrition facts if you're someone who's focused on what we would consider more of a food quality diet like a paleo diet or a vegan or vegetarian diet then you're most likely going to be focused on the ingredients because you're looking at what is in it and what does it have in it that i may want to try to avoid right you might be trying to avoid wheat or gluten or you might be trying to avoid sugar on there you might be trying to for avoid animal products and you're going to be focused on those ingredients to see what things are and are not in there and i would encourage you guys moving forward to look at both of those things because both of those things have value valuable information that when you match them up against each other you learn a lot so like in the case of nutrition facts it doesn't really account for a lot of these artificial flavors and artificial ingredients that don't really have nutrition facts to match up or even in some of the more natural ingredients like stevia's they're not going to show up in the nutrition facts because stevia has zero calorie zero grams of sugar and stevia is not a bad thing but you don't want to just consume unlimited amounts of it and not know what's in your food and if you look at something like a diet coke it's going to have very low calories very low sugar so all that stuff is going to be left out of the nutrition facts but if you look in the ingredients you're going to find a lot of things that you probably don't want to be putting into your body in excessive amounts and then when you look at the ingredients label there's things in there that may not tell the full story until you match it up against nutrition facts things like nuts and veggies and natural sugars might look good on an ingredients label but then when you look at the nutrition facts that thing might still be really high in fat it might still be really high in sugar and really high in calories and it might not be something that you want to over indulge on so circling back to those nutrition facts some of the key components that i would encourage you guys to focus on is first and foremost what is the serving size and what is the servings per container because there's a lot of foods out there that you might assume are one serving i look at a pint of ben and jerry's and i just assume that that's one serving because when i consume it i typically i'm gonna down that whole pint but if you look at the back of the package you're gonna see there's multiple servings in there and often actually with ben jerry's they kind of spell it out that there is more servings per container on there because they give you a lot of times the total for the entire pint but a lot of things are more subtle i know there was a lot of juices out there for a while where it looked like it was a single serving juice and then you look at the back of the package there's actually two servings per container and it might have 15 grams of sugar which is not terrible for a juice then you double that now you're getting 30 grams of sugar and that becomes a lot less healthy a lot less enticing to be able to just take in 30 grams of sugar in liquid form like that another example of a company that's very misleading with their packaging is a company called lenny and larry's and they actually got sued for kind of an unrelated issue which was just purely lying about the amount of grams of protein that was in their cookies but they have these single serving size cookies or what appear to be single serving size cookies since they're individually wrapped but when you flip it over the back of the package they're actually two servings per cookie but again if you go to the front of the package that has this 16 grams of protein per cookie advertised but again flipping to the back you realize that you have to eat two full servings in order to get that you're eating close to 400 calories close to 30 grams of sugar just to get those 16 grams of protein so it's not exactly the healthiest way to get that type of protein and it's just another way that companies can kind of use the front of the packaging to manipulate your buying decision and thinking you're getting something healthier than it really is the other key components in those nutrition facts that you're going to want to look at are your calories your macronutrients and your micronutrients and calories is going to be the big number at the top of those nutrition facts and if you're only going to look at one number to assess the quantity of what you're eating the portion control behind what you're eating calories is the number to look at okay there's there's an argument to be made that calories don't tell the full story and we'll talk about that in other videos but if you were to look at only one number calories is going to assess how much you're eating at any given time now those calories can be broken down into our macronutrients which is protein fats and carbs so if you were to know the protein fat and carbs of a given food but you didn't know the calories you can actually calculate the calories just based off of those three numbers because every calorie is going to be made up of either protein fat or carbs so on a label fat is typically broken down into types of fats like saturated fats monounsaturated fats polyunsaturated fats and that's a definitely a rabbit hole that we can go down in future videos but for now especially if you guys are new to reading labels just kind of roughly take that information in and get an idea of where your foods fall but i wouldn't spend too much time or energy on that in terms of carbohydrates that's usually going to be broken down into sugars and fiber which are more helpful numbers where as just a general rule of thumb we're looking to eat less sugar and more fiber and then with protein you're typically only going to see one number with that it's not usually going to be broken down into different types of amino acids and things like that so just proteins usually going to be just that single number and then below that you're often going to see your micronutrients which is things like vitamin c and zinc and calcium and not all of them are typically shown usually it's only going to be like four of them in any given food so there might be things in there that are not shown but just know with those micronutrients those are going to be different vitamins and minerals in given foods an important thing to note with micronutrients is that you can actually know if those micronutrients are inherent in the given food or if they're added in after processing and actually a lot of your milks out there a lot of your cereals out there these are probably the two most common categories of foods that most of the time when you see calcium and magnesium and zinc and all these things in those foods they're typically just added in after processing the way that those vitamins and minerals are just typically added into a multivitamin that you might take separately with your meal so just realize that those foods probably don't have it inherently in it or those foods had it inherently in it at one point but through processing those foods can actually lose some of those vitamins and minerals and those foods those vitamins and minerals get added back in after processing so for me i just like more of a natural approach where i like those vitamins and minerals to be inherent in those foods i don't like them to be added in and if i'm going to take those vitamins and minerals separately i'd rather just take what i want to take via a multivitamin or supplementing with vitamin d or something like that and then circling back to the ingredients section of any given label the most important thing you need to know there is that the ingredients are always going to be listed in order from the most amount in that food to the least amount in that food so if you pick up a jar of tomato sauce hopefully the first ingredient in that label is going to be tomatoes and what you're going to find with a lot of packaged foods is that sugar and versions of sugar right sugar can hide in many different forms but some kind of variation in sugar might even be the leading ingredient in that food or it's going to be in the top two three five ingredients in that food and a lot of cereals this is the case i took a look at like a kind bar and in a kind bar it starts with nuts but you're going to see the in the first five ingredients three of those five ingredients are some version of a sugar so it's important to note that you know things like corn syrup and honey and high fructose corn syrup and all these different types of syrups and sugars are going to show up in different ways on the back of the label and this is a way for you to be able to decipher what's really in your foods so one way this might play out is you have a lot of products out there that will feature these key ingredients or super food like ingredients on the front of their package but then when you flip that product over you're going to see that that ingredient isn't as prominent or as high up on that ingredients list as it's being marketed on the front of the package and one situation that i ran into recently is there's a lot more of these olive oil-based mayo's coming out which got me really excited because a lot of times mayo is typically made with less healthy oils like canola oil and soybean oil so it was great to see that a lot of these big brands are starting to come out with olive oil based mayo's but i was disappointed in almost every single one that i saw and i remember seeing hellmann's has olive oil but it's not even the first oil listed they actually have soybean oil as the most prominent oil in their mayo even though olive oil is a part of it i really love to see them just eradicate those other oils altogether and it's also important to note that a lot of your healthiest foods your proteins your vegetables your fruits they're not going to have a label at all you're going to grab some broccoli in the store you're going to flip it over you're not going to be able to find a label on most broccolis and ground beef and shrimp and apples and bananas most of those things won't even have a label so that's a good rule of thumb is that if something doesn't even have a label it's probably going to be it's probably real food first and foremost but it's probably going to be something that's healthy for you to eat so hopefully you guys found this video helpful if nothing else if this was new to you and overwhelming to you if nothing else what i want you to take away from this video is just when you go to the grocery store or you're picking up something out of your refrigerator your pantry at your house instead of looking at the front of the package i want you guys to get used to flipping that product over and looking at the back of the package looking at those nutrition facts looking at those ingredients and starting to get an education of what's really in your food if you guys enjoyed this video you want to see more videos like this i really appreciate you guys liking the video below subscribing to our channel and we'll

you're very busy girl like me maybe you work a lot maybe going to school or maybe you have a family responsibilities which taken a lot of your time and also perhaps you have a fitness goal in mind are you gonna whatever that is you understand that nutrition is so important in order to get there but also maybe you don't have so much time to meal prep and it's understandable i've been there i worked 50-hour week job and trust me meal prepping was not my favorite part because it's too complicated to meal prep and go food shop and do all that stuff well i got a solution for you we're going to be going today to the target store and get our groceries but not just the groceries i picked 99 are pre-made means you have to spend hours in the kitchen to bagging and cooking and preparing and do all this stuff which involves into meal prep the products i'm showing will be very easy grab and go or they will be requiring very little prep so if you're interested what look like keep on watching [Music] so guys we are in target i'm gonna be grabbing some foods super excited the first thing guys we have to get some hard boiled eggs super easy to grab and go um don't have to worry about anything so take a look and the best part look at the macros 50 calories per one egg i think we have to get it some sort of fats for our meals so i really like to get some of the hummus and if you guys saw this ones look at those singles 150 calories only 12 gram of protein normal fiber and super convenient and easy to grab and go so this is two of my favorite um high protein options for the snacking i would say this one one of my favorite flavors it's like 15 grams of protein over here and we have only five grams of sugar which is three gram of fiber super good my favorite flavor lighting feed another great option um it does have a little bit less calories however it does have a little bit more sugar and a little less protein today i am going to be grabbing let's see what they have i really want something pumpkin flavored but i don't think they have anything yet so i'll stick coconut vanilla yes that's a pretty good one i also do like strawberry cheesecake so as you guys know strawberry is actually super low in calories and they do have tons of vitamin c and other nutrients so out of all the fruits i always do strawberries i do make them glitter at home but sometimes when i'm super lazy and especially when i'm running errands i do like to grab this guy and it does have only 12 grams of sugar but that is not a real sugar in order to make kombucha you need to put actual kombucha culture into the black tea with sugar or green tea i guess and what happens the kombucha culture actually eats up a sugar and producing kombucha it's not necessarily a bad sugar it's a really great source of probiotics go for the almond milk because it's so low in calories and it's super easy to mix with your oatmeal or just with any protein shakes and things like that really great when you try to lose weight or fat or in the shape so i do like plant-based milk but if you are like many other people who just prefer regular cow milk i do get this milk for anthony and it's amazing it's reduced sugar and more it's more protein in here so as you guys can see look at the calories it's 80 calories total but six grams of carbs compared to regular milk and 13 grams of protein which is so awesome so it's a good source of protein and just overall if you like cow milk go for it guys look at the macros one carb six protein six fats pretty high fat but it's a really good high protein snack for duration um it's not a bad option cauliflower which is a riced veggies um i love this stuff they do have different options and they super super low on calories it's 20 no 30 calories sorry um that is lemon and garlic this one is cauliflower risotto manly the plain one so my favorites are it's definitely a lemon garlic one and this guy it does have some mini mini tiny mushrooms in there and super delicious it's super easy to make it this stuff i'm swearing by that is the barbecue sauce it is delicious it's 10 calories i promise if you are in a weight loss process that would be so helpful because food tastes amazing and it has more calories pretty much just be careful still with the serving size because 10 calories per 2 tablespoons and the dots have 17 servings per container so don't overdo it but sometimes actually why not it's only 10 calories right of course a tuna if you guys like the tuna and if you are trying to lose some weight or just overall want to have some high protein snacks that is a great option for instance that is a target brand it's 18 grams of protein um a bit sodium 220 it's not too bad for my carb options if i am on the run and i just not plan on making a bunch of rice turn rice cooker or just overall make it in the pot i just grab whole grain brown rice um i do probably split this bag for two or three portions so this bag should be good enough for one perhaps two days depends how many calories you add so whole grain rice brown uh we like that and my second favorite source of carbs for my meals super duper healthy that is quinoa quinoa has much more protein than rice take a look at literally 14 grams of protein and 390 calories total that's per package don't forget that so if you're planning to um stack up for entire week you probably need about five of those maybe four they also have frozen brown rice so whatever your preference is just go for it for breakfast i love to eat oatmeal and if i'm orion errands and i don't have time to grab the huge can measure it i'm just not into that then i always go for this one it's 100 calories per package but the best part that it doesn't have much sugar at all i have to show you guys a lot of different brands that do have a lot of sugar in them and this one i found being the most sugar-free pretty much it's less than one gram of sugar and you know you have to watch out for sugar when you're trying to lose some body fat so make sure when you pick your oatmeal you are very clear on your macronutrients and that is only 100 calories i do like to eat couple bags though this is my must-haves if you're super busy going to work just make oatmeal really quick or just make a sandwich and put some um almond butter or peanut butter they do have different options um i do like peanut butter probably the most on my oatmeal but almond butter is delicious too always check nutrients because sometimes when you see a vanilla or things like that or chocolate or honey or maple it does have more sugar probably personally will skip on a vanilla and just go for regular peanut butter just to be safe i don't want to get extra calories extra actually unnecessary calories when i'm running around i love to add to my oatmeal some freeze dried strawberry slices sometimes i have fresh ones sometimes i don't uh this one is just much more convenient and as you guys see per entire package it's 100 calories so you can just simply add tiny bit into your oatmeal in the morning into whatever you eat it maybe a greek yogurt so it's a really great option in a weight loss diet beef jerky my go-to it's high in protein i typically grab original one just because teriyaki has more sugar it has 11 grams of protein it does have 600 grams of sugar so grab it as almost like emergency snack maybe when you're traveling um and you're trying to still lose weight just going to help you stay on track uh i do like the fact that you don't you can keep this stuff in the car um nothing really going to happen unless you live in some sort of hot arizona then maybe it's not a great idea um so i do like it as almost like emergency snack i wouldn't eat it every day because it still processed meat but it is really a smart snack when you're in a weight loss process i never use butter when i cook butter or oil i always use pam spray target has a great alternatives but if you're in a different store than target then just grab any palm spray but you also know that is 473 servings so you can be spraying so much of this stuff even if it's zero calories guys this stuff to die for that is not a candy i promise look at the stuff 13 grams of fiber and only three gram of sugar so entire bag is 100 calories while that is no sugar my favorite flavors are definitely um sweet fish which is almost like a swedish fish and i do um i did try a fruity gummy bears they're actually very good too they also had some sour ones i don't see them today but i know they have them oh look at this stuff i've never seen that before hmm interesting maybe i should try that in your pantry you should have at any moment some sort of protein bars if you are trying to lose weight because they suppress hunger and your cravings especially for sweet stuff so one of the great um options right here you guys can see think thin i've been honestly eating this bars for years to come and now they come up with so many flavors i do like this bar for a couple of reasons one of them is a high protein content which is 20 grams of protein another reason if you see at the carbs and you see where they come in from you can really tell that it's not not a sugar that is sugar alcohol which is 11 grams and one gram of dietary fiber so honestly the high fiber the better um you can go for different boards but for me this one's uh works and i'll probably grab new flavor which i've never tried before i don't think i've ever tried this no i don't want that uh lemon now skip on that oh that's interesting okay berries and cream i've never tried this before but i am willing to it looks really good i like it but just on the side notes peanut butter ones oh my goodness i eat them forever and ever they're great when i'm craving for sweets um it's a great idea to have some sort of sweets around outside on the ones i showed you before so caramel rice cakes um it's a really good option it does have 30 grams of added sugar so total it's like 11 gram of carbs it's my another must-have is some sort of protein shakes like this yes you can use the protein powder but if you are busy working and you just have a lot of things on your plate it's super easy and convenient just sort of grab one of them and go it's 30 grams of protein it's a lot of different brands i do like quest brand um i've been trying them for quite some time and they do have only three gram of carbs and three gram of fat total 160 calories guys one of my must haves when i am on some sort of diet i really like to have some seltzer water just because it suppressed my appetite it has no calories and just you know it just kind of bubbly and fills me up kind of thing so one of my favorite flavors is actually coconut i love coconut flavor and if you do not like coconut i would highly suggest if you're gonna look into lacroix that you have tangerine and of course that is so crucial to drink water throughout the day i typically go with a three liters which is almost almost a gallon um so i do like this size and i do like the handle how you can grab it so i drink about gallon per day i love to add crystal light to my water i've been adding this stuff entire time when i was competing it tastes amazing it makes you drink even more just keep in mind that is about five calories per serving and it's five six packets which means it's about 30 calories per pocket so be mindful of that it does have some calories not much but just remember you don't want to get too much of this stuff maybe like one pocket per a gallon especially um my meal preps which is lunches and dinners i really like to put them instead of containers which i used to did i put them in as ziploc bags for the freezer because you can feel so much more in one bag and just overall in the freezer it's just so nicely stacked and i'm going to show you the picture so i really like to get just ziploc bags or target brands um let's see yellow one's a little bit too big for me i like to grab just a quart so just finish my shopping i have a whole bunch of bags it's time to get some coffee what can be better than coffee oof starbucks

don't know it either hit with a oh no fire yeah damn", "82W_DzVHEG0": "how're you guys doing today this is Derrick house with dhf DNS comm and today I'm going to show you guys my pre-workout protein shake recipe so let's get to it so the first thing you're going to do is take out either a blender or shaker bottle as you guys can see I'm using a shaker bottle just because it's a pre-workout shake sometimes I like to make it really quick and then head to the gym and not have to deal with the cleanup of a blender if you guys don't have a good shaker bottle I highly recommend any of the blender bottles they last forever I've had some for around five or six years now and they still don't leak they also include measurements on the side of all the blender bottles which is really helpful as well you can buy these pretty much anywhere but I'll also include a link in my description below to them as well the first ingredient we're going to add in is 1 cup or 8 ounces of unsweetened vanilla almond milk if you don't have don't like or can't find almond milk you can use regular milk or any other milk substitute that you may prefer one scoop or thirty grams of chocolate protein powder the type of protein you use doesn't matter you can use casein soy egg or like I'm using whey protein two tablespoons or eleven grams of a chocolate mix Ovaltine is the one I prefer to use and I think you can pretty much find it anywhere two tablespoons or ten grams of cocoa powder [Music] one or two tablespoons of instant coffee depending on the type of instant coffee you use one tablespoon will be around 75 to 100 milligrams of caffeine and two tablespoons will be around 150 to 200 milligrams of caffeine half a cup or four ounces of water and last around half a cup to a cup of ice and now just shake it up or blend it as far as the calories go in the whole shake there's 250 only 6 grams of fat 20 grams of carbs 5 grams of fiber and 29 grams of protein so there's a couple great things about the shake it's not heavy it's really easy to make it's a pre-workout that I averaged out to only cost around 90 cents to a dollar per serving but alongside being a pre-workout it also has nutritional value as well so you're going to get healthy fats carbs and protein to it not only that but it tastes like a chocolate milkshake alright guys I just want to thank you for watching if you liked my pre-workout protein shake recipe please go ahead and give me a thumbs up it motivates me to keep making these if you haven't already subscribed and you'd like to you can click right there unless coming up by subscribing you'll get email every week telling you I upload a new video comments or suggestions go down below I do try and respond everybody thank you guys again for watching I got a protein shake to finish stay out [Music]", "bvqtFNdBx1E": "what's good everybody so it's your boy Cory much from 24/7 aesthetics and I'm today I'm gonna show you guys how I make my protein shakes yeah I guess you'd call it a protein shake and I use it kind of as a meal replacement to so a little bit of a little bit of both and you'll see why I do that once you see what I'm putting in there so yeah I'm gonna take you to the ropes how I do it you got do it my way but hey this is what I do to get my gains whether I'm bulking cutting or you know just getting in shape where the kids may be first and foremost got your ingredients so I always drink silk milk almond and coconut milk usually it's all men sometimes like vanilla but this time side you get unsweetened so I can kind of limit the sugar as you can see press serving almond in coconut like coconut and there's 35 calories per serving guys so this is not bad for you use trucks you guys tracking your macros it has you know all the good benefits you can see right there on the label okay so with that you know let's not keep me a banana I love my bananas gotta have the fruits in there so blueberries and raspberries I'm didn't have any strawberries get in the store so we got these these are all good sources and you know dating vitamins and minerals and things like that so that's definitely a plus all right so I like the meat and potatoes of this don't the old-fashioned oats keep it in an old-school gotta have them so this way most of the calories is gonna come in most of the car is gonna come in with this yeah so you definitely gonna have you want some of this it's the freakin mandatory at least for me anyway especially if you're trying to put on size and sneak in some extra calories and carbs just like that definitely put this in it and it has a little texture ain't nothing wrong about that so keep myself from eating upon the peanut butter in the house I got this PB Fit peanut butter powder pretty good I wouldn't recommend taking by yourself because wouldn't be a good idea but um yeah pretty decent car just like that gotta let some pro getting my own proteins and stuff in there eight grams of protein per serving probably add about four or five scoops of that since I love peanut butter so pretty much go off the servants do that alright so then last but not least well not last but that display protein is pretty natural I like it not too bad hormone-free not a lot of crap in there which is what I like about it go to the back and stuff like that it's not a lot of different you know crap I mean I don't really know how to pronounce those things but it's not allowed a bunch of stuff in there I will be switching to emoji gif way or some be calm protein or you know micro cheese protein planta so I'm just feeling finishing inside this one to try it out because I before now I didn't use pro protein or any type of protein but you know you can't teach people stuff if you don't know so I'm just gonna I mean finish this out and go get some upgraded better stuff so but just do a job pretty affordable so yeah and then another little thing I've put in there a little bit of fiber guys know it helps me my system keeping everything straight so just put a little bit in there not much I put this in my water too so it helps curb my diet believe it or not I mean my appetite believing it now so please a little bit of that too and I almost forgot I gotta hide out honey and you know got the honey with the honeycombs in there so probably throw that chunk into this me some more and III up got this from what the farmers so it's organic raw really natural so always got had too honey so yep that's my ingredients pretty simple pretty straight for you can't you like this subtract switch things up the corn to what you like to eat you're dying like that what oh macros are they had the stuff guys imma be honest with you I'm not tracking none of this I madness I see a bit of fiber in there that I just I'm gonna powder boom actually maybe a little bit more that lay low with that take the banana plop it in there oh no one hand alright got this go some oats up in there sorry for the endless only got one hand this is pretty nice to hear this big speech on cares there you go yeah I'm saying honey for last guys go ahead top of the spoon [Music] there you have guys nice little shake pour it to the big boy Cup tastes pretty daggone good so again you can mix however you want for these I don't really check the serving size and stuff this hot filling I worked out right before so I'm kind of hungry so drink all this finish the leftovers in there all right um yeah we're good so I'm stay tuned for more little blocks with cooking vlogs little tips and tricks got any questions or suggestions for me let me know peace", "1VyhblRJGh4": "did you know you could use a food label to eat healthier hello my name is kimberly and i'm a volunteer with the national council of jewish women greater dallas section specifically i'm involved with a program called food plus faith equals fun and today i'm going to share a lesson with you from our program food plus fit equals fun is a healthy living program taught by volunteers like me we focus on nutritional information we teach healthy recipes and we teach fun physical exercises with the goal to combat obesity and we also want our participants to learn to live a healthy lifestyle so let's begin today's lesson is called using food labels to eat healthier the nutrition label on food packages is your roadmap and guide for choosing healthy foods every packaged food has a nutrition label and here's ours here's a giant version of the nutrition label which is found on all packaged foods so i'm just showing you on some examples of real food here's some cheerios nutrition label on beans today we are going to focus on 10 items the first one are ingredients the ingredients are located at the bottom of the food link so for example here with the cheerios again here are your ingredients even on a little power bar here are your ingredients you read this to find out what items are in your food items are listed by weight so they'll be more of the first product listed first for example in the beans the very first ingredient are beans which is what you want the second thing that you know when you're reading the ingredients or looking for food to avoid if you have food allergies if you have peanut allergies soy wheat gluten that will be listed on your food box on the nutrition label so if you're allergic to peanuts and you want some snacks you need to read the ingredients that are in the snack and see if there are nuts if there are then you will not choose that one you can also look for the ingredients in your pet your dog food so like the first ingredient here says chicken so i know that that's something that would be healthy for my pet things to avoid are words that end in ose that's another word for sugar so in this protein bar the very first ingredient is high fructose corn syrup which means there's more corn syrup which is a food additive a sugar additive than anything else so this would probably be something that you'd want to think about before you buy it another thing to look for are hard to pronounce words like monosodium glutamate which is another food additive i would avoid foods that have words that you cannot pronounce the next item we're going to discuss on the nutrition label are the serving size the serving size is at the top of the nutrition label and it tells you how many servings there are in the entire package the individual information is based on one serving size so for example there are 16 servings in this entire jar of peanuts but the information is based on one serving one serving equals 35 pieces of the peanut another example there are 10 servings in this bag and here is one serving so if you eat the entire bag you're going to have to double triple quadruple whatever the amount of servings that you're eating as far as fat sugar sodium so be careful be mindful of that another thing this is a little bitty pint of ice cream but there are three servings in here so if you eat the entire thing then the fat content and sugar content calorie content triples the next item we're going to discuss on the nutrition label are calories calories are located under the serving size and i'm going to use the same examples that i used when we were talking about serving size the average adult should have two thousand calories a day and children can have between fourteen hundred and sixteen hundred depending upon how active they are calories in the nutrition label are listed for one serving so as we discussed there are 16 servings in this jar of peanuts one serving are 35 pieces 35 pieces equal 170 calories but if you were to eat the entire jar of peanuts that is 2720 calories just in this dark peanuts which is more than you need for the entire day likewise this is a serving size for some chocolate if you eat the entire bag you're eating 2 600 calories the next item to discuss on the nutrition label are fats fats are located under the calories and they are under under the fat saturated fat and trans fat you want a small number a small percentage of saturated fat you really do not want to eat anything that has trans fat in it trans fats are bad for you they have negative health benefits foods like frozen french fries frozen pizzas those are foods that are high in trans fats just not good for your body also if you look on the right side this is the percentage of fat that you have in your daily value of fat the great thing about the grocery store are there a lot of options for choosing lower fat items whole milk has eight grams of fat but there's a two percent option that has five grams of fat the same is true for cottage cheese there's a lower fat option the same is true for beans there's a low fat option well i'm not saying not to eat fat because we all love a good helping of mac and cheese i know that i do but if you look at the stouffer's frozen this one per serving has 16 grams of fat versus another option of mac and cheese which you make yourself the craft version has 2.5 grams of fat so if you're choosing and you want to be healthier this is probably your better option also when you're cooking sometimes i mean i love to cook with butter but a better option would probably be cooking with olive oil this is a good fat the next item we're going to discuss on the nutrition label is sodium sodium is a fancy word for salt and it is located under the fat so sodium is shown in milligrams mg and on the side is the percentage too much salt can cause high blood pressure heart disease and kidney disease the milligram per serving should be no more than 2 300 milligrams a day that is one teaspoon of salt let me just show you the amount of salt that an adult should have actually in a day one teaspoon that is it there's a lot of foods though that have a lot of salt in it that we don't even know about ramen noodle soup you would think soup is good for you and it is good for you but the total amount of salt if you look at the nutrition label sodium in one serving there are 790 milligrams if you have the entire package of soup sixteen hundred milligrams that's a lot of salt that's almost your entire serving of salt for the day there's also salt found in other foods it's a little tricky ketchup has sodium in it and believe it or not green beans so a trick because in this package the sodium in these green beans there are 380 milligrams of sodium if you want green beans you can rinse it before you cook it and that reduces the amount of salt the grocery store is awesome because there are lower sodium options so for these beans here's the beans here's the exact same version with the reduced sodium the next item on the nutrition label that we're going to discuss are carbohydrates carbohydrates are under sodium carbohydrates are your body's main source of energy they fuel your brain your kidneys your heart your muscles and your central nervous system fiber is a carbohydrate that we're going to discuss next it helps your digestion helps you feel full and keeps your blood cholesterol levels in check it's very important for us to get carbohydrates in our diet there are good carbohydrates which are unrefined such as brown rice quinoa lentils and there are refined such as white rice white bread and plain pasta when you can choose try to choose unrefined carbohydrates the next item we're going to discuss on the nutrition label is part of the carbohydrates fiber your dietary fiber is very important and it can be found in many of the items that we use for carbohydrates fiber is very important to help keep your digestion working it's a broom for your intestines and it can help reduce the risk of diseases like heart disease high blood pressure and some types of cancer so it's very important to choose foods with a high fiber count some examples we've talked about it before beans are high in fiber black beans brown rice quinoa cereals lentils and even popcorn seeds and nuts fruits and vegetables are also good sources of fiber the next item we're going to discuss on the nutrition label is sugar sugar is a carbohydrate and it's found under the carbohydrate section sugars are shown in grams and there's also on this nutrition label it'll show that there are added sugars we want to keep sugar at a minimum sugar causes weight gain it may increase the risk of heart disease it may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes it may increase the risk of cancer and it decreases your energy try to choose products that are low in sugar or have no sugar added remember the ose words dextrose sucrose lactose high fructose corn syrup like we saw in our nutrition bar those are foods that we need to make sure to avoid we all love coca-cola i know that i love coca-cola coke has 55 grams of sugar there are many cereals that are high in sugar sports drinks are high in sugar when you can choose water is your best drink and truly if you can choose natural sugars are always the best like the sugars in fruits grapes strawberries that's a great way of getting the sugar the next item on our nutrition label that we're going to discuss is protein protein is listed under the carbohydrates and this is very protein builds and maintains our muscles organs immune system protein fights infections and helps heal wounds it is so important that we have a diet that is rich in protein the recommended dietary allowance grams of protein per day for men is 56 grams women 46 grams boys ages 14 to 18 52 grams girls 46 grams and children between 34 grams and the younger they are 13 grams protein is found in many of our foods you can get protein in sardines tuna fish beans dairy foods such as eggs milk cheese cottage cheese yogurt and peanut butter the final item that we're going to discuss today on our nutrition label are vitamins found at the bottom of the nutrition label foods that are rich in vitamins such as vitamin a d and calcium are very important for our bodies examples of vitamin rich foods are eggs and milk basically the higher the vitamin content the better thank you so much for your time today as we discuss the nutrition label hopefully you learned something new and next time you go to the grocery store you'll be able to read the nutrition label and choose healthy options for you and for your family don't forget food plus fit equals fun the

is it friend or foe the reality is it depends on how the granola that you're looking at out there you want to see the parallel oh my gosh I mean you know we think that it's supposed to be so healthy it's loaded with fat calories but the hidden sugar in granola that is in my opinion the big problem these make nice little desserts but you don't want to be eating this thinking it's hell yes so it can have more sugar than a lot of supermarket candy but not all granola was bad no so if you buy the right kind of granola obviously it can be lower insured because you got oats in it you can have other really good things you have an amazing granola recipe in your doctor's diet cookbook I do walnut granola and and these are things you can make on your own so easily and put all the good stuff in it the nuts the oats and then sweeten it with something like maple water alright so this is another big label for one one this drives all of us crazy what is it wheat wheat what's the big deal what's the wheat mmm it's not it's not what it appears that's right because most of the time you go to the store and you buy a wheat product whether it's pasta tortillas bread it's refined wheat and what happens when they refine the wheat is they get rid of the whole grain so first off they take off the brand right yeah outer the outer part of that grain that has all the fiber in it yea gone then they get rid of the germ which has all the nutrition the iron the vitamins and then all you're left with is what's called the endosperm what's that carbohydrate it's like piano sugar type substance so again the labels can be so deceiving because what's on the front of the package and certainly if you can see through the package this all looks pretty good you know it's dark you're like oh good whole weed healthy not necessarily so that literacy with reading labels so confusing but so important so I should say percent whole wheat 100% whole grain don't fall prey there's a grocery store right down the road they don't serve one 100% whole wheat pasta so I have to go an extra mile to get it because you know what I'm not gonna go for even though it says whole-grain pasta you're smarter than that Travis oh yeah read the label anywhere when it says enriched that just means they take all the good stuff out and then they enrich it with a few little teeny things so always read the labels hey I'm

cookie I think there are two things that are vital when making a good cook and those are going to be quality of the butter the quality of the chocolate chips that you use this is why I think the biggest problem with prepackaged cookie dough is the fact there is no butter don't get me wrong they're still good but they could be so much better when it comes to better we have two choices sweet cream or cultured I like to use cultured butter because I think it adds another layer of flavor but if you don't want that slight funkiness then just go with sweet cream regardless of which butter you use there should be two ingredients pre-installed if it's culture they might also add a starter culture and that's fine now you can use either salted or unsalted butter in these if you do use salted butter you're gonna want to reduce the total amount of salt by Hattie's now when it comes to the chocolate you can use whatever kind you prefer I usually use semi-sweet because it has a nice balance of that sweetness in the bitterness and with this you're going to want to make sure that there's only three to four ingredients in your chocolate and those should be sugar cocoa liquor or unsweetened cocoa and cocoa butter sometimes you'll also find soy left this in as well and that's okay that's just a normal supplier so now I have those ingredients accounted for we can start mixing I'm using my stand mixer but you can also do this by the end so I'm basing this recipe off of Nestle Tollhouse is done we're gonna make a few changes to give us a cakey or cookie now even want the traditional texture chocolate chip cookie Nestle recipe will give you that but just make sure that you're using good butter and put in chocolate chips but you're gonna add your softened butter into the bowl and get that a quick mix now we can add our sugar we're going in with half brown sugar and half white sugar the brown sugar is going to give us a little bit of that molasses business you want to beat this for at least three minutes stripping it down halfway through so today I have all these recipes because I need to make five batches of cookies but in the description I'll leave all the recipes in their folders then we can add our eggs now here's where the first change comes in I added one whole egg and one egg yolk this is going to add richness and texture to our cookie you want to end this one at a time letting them incorporate between additions then you can add the vanilla give it another strength and you can add in your flour salt and baking powder now the use of baking powder is the second change here this is going to be with the right amount of rice and pillow units that we need stop the mixture before it's just combined so that we can add in our chocolate chips you can unless for more abusive your heart desires mix those in but stop right when they're mixed because we don't want to develop any gluten in our dough which will give us a tough cookie then we can scoop these out I use a cookie scoop I couldn't find my large scoop so I just used two small scoops and places it now if you don't have a cookie scoop you can just estimate two tablespoons of dough and just scoop those out by I lined my tray with baking paper because I did not want these to stick then if these are ready to go into the center of 350 degree oven for 11 to 13 minutes or until you can see it going golden brown around the edges let them cool for a few minutes when they come out and then they're ready and you can see here that these have a nice cakey texture but they do look a little lackluster on the outside so if you want something that looks a little nicer you're gonna slap a couple chocolate chips on top before they go in the oven and then in the last three minutes of baking you're gonna turn your broiler on so that the top gets a little brown next we're going to thin crispy cookies and we're gonna make these ones vegan so we're gonna use vegan butter we're gonna replace the egg with aqua fala now I've had different results with different vegan butters but worst case scenario you're gonna end up a little bit of a thicker less crispy cookie we're gonna mix these in a bowl so you're gonna want to get a firm rubber spatula or wooden spoon and then you're gonna add in your butter and your server we do need more sugar in this version to achieve the texture that so if you want to date Li smoosh the butter against the bottom of the bowl with the sugar until everything is combined and then you're gonna start trying to mix and incorporate a little bit of air into it once it's lightly been color you're gonna enter aquafaba and your vanilla and mix side until combined now if it looks like it's not going to incorporate all the way that's okay just move on to your flour salt and baking soda with all these recipes you have to make sure that you use the proper rising agent because baking powder will give you a different texture than baking soda the amount of baking permit in this recipe is going to make our cookies rise so much that they can't hold in the air and then flatten out when they're out of the up but once your flowers almost combined you can add in your chocolate chips and this recipe does not contain raw eggs so feel free to clean the spatula yourself then we need to scoop these out just like the last ones we are also going in the middle of a 300 degree oven for 12 to 14 minutes when they first come out of the oven they're going to be puffed up but they will fall as they cool so if you like crispy cookies here they are on the side note don't stack them while they're warm because they will not come apart after that now the next version we're going to make is a healthier version [Music] then you're gonna add your vanilla and some sort of milk either dairy or non dairy mix that together and you'll end up with a very thick dough then we're gonna add in dark chocolate but you can use whatever chocolate you'd like and we don't have to worry about over mixing this one because there's no gluten in here to develop I've decided to make mini ones at this step and we do need to squish these down because they're not going to spread as much on their own then they're going into 350 degree oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until the edges are brown now these are not meant to be exactly like a traditional chocolate chip cookie but something that you could have before breakfast or a snack rather than a dessert now for our final cookie we're making something a little more sophisticated dark chocolate brown butter cookies our first step is to brown the butter slap that in a pan on medium heat and let it bubble stirring occasionally until the milk solids fall to the bottom and turn brown then you're gonna pour it into a bowl and put it in the fridge to cool once it's cooled to room temperature you're gonna add that into a bowl with your sugar there's more brown sugar and less white sugar in this recipe because that molasses and the brown sugar is gonna complement our brown butter very nicely now we're not going to be able to beat as much air into this because our butter is more of a liquid but you still want to cream those together for a few minutes to whip in as much air as possible then we're gonna add our egg and vanilla and make sure that those are nice and combined scrape the bowl and then add in your flour baking soda and salt and when that's almost combined we can add in our chocolate I used a chocolate bar for this one because I wanted it to have different sized chunks of chocolate throughout our dough I'm just using a 70% dark chocolate fold those in until they're just combined and then we can see now the thing that takes these to the next level is flaky sea salt this is optional but it adds so much texture and flavor to our cookies then just like the rest of them these go into a 350 degree oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until brown around the edges I think using the most aesthetically pleasing active punch you're also their most delicious but the others all have their place in my kitchen so there are four different versions of chocolate chip codes if you like what I do here feel free to

welcome back everybody happy Friday today is my day off and it's actually my company it's their 4th of July holiday so I'm getting paid for it so I'll actually get a 40-hour workweek in which is really nice because my hours have been cut to 32 hours per week because of the lockdown zombie apocalypse virus that's going on anyway you guys I'm really excited today several things but first before I share some exciting news to share what we had to eat yesterday which was perfectly keno Harry and I now tell me if you can see the board if it's not bouncing the light what there right there hey we did an 18 hour fast yesterday it was wonderful I had the rest of my chicken salad that I made which was yummy 4 ounces of it on two ounces of a bed of lettuce and 2 tablespoons of the lemon garlic dressing by chosen foods Harry had his beloved taco bowl you put a bag of crushed chips down you put your ground beef down you put your sour cream on top you nuke it he loved the Mexican seasoning that I put on it it was just fine for our second meal I had a steak salad I used 5 ounces leftover steak that I cooked it was a mixture between my ribeye and a little bit of my London broil I had 2 ounces of the mixed lettuce I had two tablespoons of blue cheese crumbles I used the rest of those I had two teaspoons excuse me two tablespoons lemon garlic dressing you guys didn't see it but we went to visit my kids and do social distancing with my mom I had to run into Walgreens and they had quest cookies on sale so I had a quest peanut butter cookie I had two scoops of collagen one in the morning one in the evening I had two apple cider vinegars one in the morning and one in the evening I had two tablespoons actually that's teaspoons Harry I only had two teaspoons of heavy whipping cream because I used that new toasted coconut almond milk and I had six tablespoons whoops a bit hairy for dinner had an eight ounce London broil steak he had the rest of that London broil steak that I had to cook because I took too much out of the freezer which was perfect I put a tablespoon of butter on top because London royal steak is not of a fatty meat he had a side salad with two table oh excuse me he had one table spoon primal steak sauce on his steak and it was absolutely you guys primal steak sauce is very if you guys like a one you guys will really like it um he had a side salad and that was two ounces of lettuce he had the primal Caesar dressing on it he had a little bit of mozzarella cheese on top he had the quest chocolate chip cookie and he had two scoops of collagen one in the morning one in the evening he had two apple cider vinegars one in the morning one in the evening and he used the toasted coconut almond milk califa as well and you guys you guys I am so excited because Harry talked out of that and he's been eating lettuce and I got proof all week long he had an all time new low one seventy nine point four his old he beat his old record of 170 nine point eight you guys look down on whole town down to 178 point to my lowest is 176 but we're going down you guys and I think I it's because we've incorporated chicken now I'm trying to I didn't have taken yesterday not but you we've been eating really clean and healthy so anyway you guys I'm really excited about that I'm gonna share with you some of you may not know so I'm gonna share these are the credit cookies I like the peanut butter and Harry likes the chocolate chip my mom the Walgreens that we go to has her favorite fruit frozen fruit bars so she wanted one of those and cuz it was like a hundred and ten last night when we got done and I grabbed one I grabbed it was buy one get one free so I got two of each and I thought while mom's having her little her little frozen fruit bar in the car we'll have just a cookie each so it's a treat for us and it didn't bother us at all now you guys the ingredients are pretty clean there's some stuff on it I wouldn't suggest this one is the chocolate chip bar I don't know if you can see everything so I think the reason why these didn't bother us at all is because the only thing we had to had carbs in it were the lettuce and I showed you the different boxes of mixed lettuce we're doing the 50/50 mix the super green mix and the field greens so I switch out so I'm getting a little bit of different leafy greens with my dinners so this the peanut butter has five net carbs the chocolate chip has four and the five net carbs is because they put real chopped peanuts in it but I was surprised because I was afraid we it would stall our weight loss and it didn't this is a an occasional treat not something we're gonna eat every day this is gonna be our 4th of July treat that we're gonna have I'm gonna make deviled eggs I'm gonna figure out what we're gonna have and we're gonna watch fireworks on TV because our animals my mom has to be home her dogs terrified of fireworks her little Ida she's got a little pit bull lab mix that she rescued and she's an older lady dog and she's terrifying and Sally is getting to where she does not like she'll go and hide under our bed so anyway I digress so we've been eating really clean I

instead of having it control you welcome to DICOM video i'm sarah do sub the number one a weight loss secret is writing down everything that you eat however many times when you're writing it down you might not be getting the amount that you're eating accurate so we are going to go over the top five foods that you tend to over eat now not on purpose of course it's just that it's really hard to see how much you're actually eating of it so today we're going to be talking about peanut butter now peanut butter has about 210 calories per two tablespoons so some tricks to measuring peanut butter are so we have a scale here now if you have one great if you don't we'll show you some other options now if you're going to be bringing the peanut butter to work as a snack with say some celery or if you're going to be putting it on a slice of toast you can put the toast on here I'm going to put my Tupperware and I'm going to hit the word tare so now my scale thinks that this is zero now basically what we're going to do is we're just going to add peanut butter to our Tupperware until it reads about 22 to 33 I say 22 I'm at 32 to 33 grams up that's 36 obviously I'm not going to be that picky there we go 32 perfect however since it is so calorie dense you do want to be sure to only have one serving and if you're going to be having more make sure that you write that down into your calorie journal so right there you get a close up that is what a serving looks like that's about the size of a ping-pong ball so if you don't have a scale and you don't have one of the measure all devices there is one other non-messy technique of course you can always just measure the teaspoon or the tablespoon one trick is to fill up a cup of water now I'm just going to use a half cup because it's more realistic with just a few tablespoons of peanut butter if you're going to use more use a big one so you're going to fill it about 3/4 of the way full if you have tablespoons add three tablespoons into the water alright and so this is 3/4 of the way full now we're going to add peanut butter to it until the water reaches the brim then once you have the peanut butter you dip out the water jump out the Rotter rather and there you go you have your two tablespoons ready to go and as always you can use just a regular measuring spoon so this is 1 tablespoon for a serving you'd obviously want to do two but I provided the alternate options for you because after you fill this with peanut butter you've got to scoop it out and then you dirty and extra spoon and who wants to clean up an extra mess so this is obviously a safe option make sure that it's not a rounded tablespoon you should you know swipe off the top so that it's flat but hopefully you enjoyed this video and now you know that you should be measuring how much peanut butter you're using because you never know you actually could very well easily be eating double the amount of the recommended serving check back later for more food

carbohydrates and this makes it a lot easier to get into ketosis and stay there you want to find a product that's non-gmo you want to look for organic ingredients and you really want to find a product

[Music] [Music] [Music] well butter is back and we've always loved butter but over the years we were told that butter was not necessarily a good food turns out butter is a terrific fat it contains things like cla and butyric acid it's a great way of getting fat soluble vitamins a d e and k and here's what's really exciting now there are powdered butter products that are available so you can have all the benefits of butter while you travel and when it's perhaps less convenient to have butter from the refrigerator when you take a teaspoon of this and mix it in your coffee in the morning you're ready to go so here are the important points that you should look for when you're looking at consuming butter first it should be from grass-fed animals and second it should be organic so powdered butter super convenient it's nutrient-dense it's a really incredible way of getting good fats into your diet [Music] probiotic from its derivative means pro 4 biotic health and in a very real sense these bacteria that live within us are for our health first you want to buy a probiotic that has a lot of organisms in it and i recommend somewhere in the neighborhood of around 50 billion second you want to have a lot of diversity in terms of those organisms that that are being represented you know somewhere 12 13 14 even 15 want to have a diversity a large number of different types of bacteria certain species i think are clearly more important for women things like lactobacillus fermentum is a really important organism that we know specifically good for women the other thing we see now is that you can buy a probiotic supplement that actually has prebiotic fiber built into the supplement that is the type of fiber specifically that will nurture those organisms once they arrive to where they're going [Music] probiotic from its derivative means pro 4 biotic health and in a very real sense these bacteria that live within us are for our health first you want to buy a probiotic that has a lot of organisms in it and i recommend somewhere in the neighborhood of around 50 billion second you want to have a lot of diversity in terms of those organisms that that are being represented you know somewhere 12 13 14 even 15 want to have a diversity a large number of different types of bacteria and i am so taken by the emerging science that shows us that what's going on within the gut the gut bacteria are playing such an important role in cognitive health in emotional health and in addition to this exciting new science related to probiotics i think it's really important to embrace how traditionally botanicals have been valued in terms of their ability to help individuals manage stress things like for example blueberry and ashwagandha have long pedigrees in terms of their abilities in this regard hey guys chef gwen here with some easy tips to help you stay hydrated we all know how important it is to drink water every day but there are two things you can add to your water to optimize hydration did you know that salts are electrolytes and contain beneficial trace minerals try adding a teaspoon of mineral rich sea salt to 12 ounces of water to ensure hydration also you can add fresh lemon or lime because these fruits contain electrolytes calcium potassium and offer a healthy ph balance next try eating foods with a higher water content like watermelon kiwi berries and cucumber you can also make fun and tasty infused waters with these fruits too lastly if you spend a lot of time in the sun being active try adding one tablespoon of garden of life chia seeds right into your water bottle to prolong hydration so stay hydrated this summer and get more tips recipes and products at [Music] gardenoflife.com [Applause] [Music] so [Music] you", "6iD7AQ9s9Yo": "quick label reading one on 101 and just kind of show you what I do when I grocery shop and what I look for in a label because it's so much more than just calories and fat and stuff like that so um I'm here with my kiddos and we have a couple of items that are just go to items for us that um I read the labels and I have the good in the band and I'm gonna compare them for okay say G show them what we have here peanut butters peanut butter another one peanut butter okay so I'm gonna flip it around here we go okay so this is just the regular peanut butter all these brand and on this label so when I look at the label the first thing I look at is being useless so the first ingredient is peanut but the next ingredient is sugar the next ingredient is oil vegetable oil which is not a good source of healthy oil and then fall in molasses so Dan I would go and look at the calories then ever look at I'm thinner look at the protein the carbs the sugars all the things but before I look at calories I always look at the ingredient list and some of my rules are to be the least amount of gradients as possible in the label so if it's peanuts what I'm looking for is peanuts in the ingredients label so peanut butter like this here's the other peanut butter let's show them move your fingers there we go Organic peanuts and sea salt that's all that's in this kind of peanuts NZ soldiers we don't need all the added ingredients you just need the two things no so I mean and then the calories and all of that is pretty similar to the two can you hold up that one next to it hold it together way for me hold this just like that hold it just like that oh you're kidding you hold the red one bear with me people - okay move your finger but your thumb okay so turn it to the side a little bit Kaden there we go so the one that has less ingredients has like 20 more calories per serving has two more grams of fat less sodium remove your finger CG less sodium less carbs less sugars so there's the comparison when I'm looking for something we've gotten to this point and are like and as Americans in our diet that we've gone for fat-free low-calorie sugar-free and then it's filled with crap it's filled with man-made processed stuff and fillers to make it be low-calorie so I would rather have 20 more calories and have real food that my body knows how to digest and process so that's why I look at the ingredients first and then go to the calories and if you're just eating it in its portions that you're supposed to eat it in that extra 20 calories is not gonna make you bigger and your body is gonna process that quicker and better and use it more efficiently than it's gonna do with the peanut butter that has a whole bunch of crap in it like oils and artificial process added stuff the only other one just really quickly is syrup my syrup label is this is a regular syrup label and the first ingredient is high for toast corn syrup I'm pretty sure yeah corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup and then about a million other things all artificial colors preservatives additives that we just don't need okay so then what do I opt for 100% pure maple syrup you want to hold it fun okay then with my helper so right there pure maple syrup is the only thing on the ingredients yes it has more calories it has more carbs that has more sugars but my body knows what to do with it and uses it more efficiently it would take me way too long to go into why I'm not a fan of high fructose corn syrup and GMOs and all the additives but if you do your research you can Google you can look on Pinterest you can look anywhere and do your research and see why real food is better for your body clean eating is what I practiced and that's why I read ingredients labels before I look at the calories and the fat which I still watch calories and fat but the most important thing is working real food", "N7dA8wpyKB0": "I think it is time for us to make peace with healthy snacks. If not we will be balloons by the time the quarantine is over. So let me teach you 5 snacks I eat frequently and an extra one to treat ourselves. We will start with peanuts. This is not a snack by itself but because we will be using it in the next recipes I thought I should show you how to make your own peanut butter. As you can see, you will only be needing peeled and salty peanuts. And that's it! It's so easy! And is way cheaper than buying one from the store at least in Argentina. You only have to dump it in a food processor and wait 5 to 10 min and it's done. By itself! We will be also making our own Granola. I like it with almonds and hazelnuts so I shred them in the processor until they reach the size I like them to be not too big, not a powder either. In a bowl I put some instant oats. You don't need to follow the recipe, I eyeball it. I just wrote the ingredients so you can have a rough idea of the quantities. I mix in the nuts, half the quantity of the oats. A pinch of sea salt Some honey for moist and flavour but being careful of not making it too sticky. a bit of shredded coconut and light brown organic sugar. Mix everything Finally I add a bit of olive oil to the whole mix to help brown it in the oven. As you can see, it shouldn't stick to the spoon. I transfer it to a plate and spread it to create a thin layer of oat. If it's too thick the middle won't cook. Take it to the oven for 13 min, middle power. But check it every once in a while just to make sure. Once it's looking a bit golden, I take it out I mix and spread the granola and take it to the oven for an extra 5 min. Then I take it out, mix it again and let it cool. Let's begin with the official snacks! In a bowl I mix in oats, I use instant oats, peanut butter, honey shredded coconut, a pinch of salt, vanilla essense and shredded almonds. I mix well. The mixture should look moist. If necessary add more peanut butter. Then we make some balls out of it and take to the fridge for 30 min. That's it! No need to bake. You can add any ingredient you like. chocolate chips, dates, whatever comes to mind. This is to taste! You can also do it in squares instead of balls. Just play with the recipe! When is hot outside, there's nothing better than a smoothie bowl. Here I mixed a frozen banana and blueberries. Remember to cut in pieces the banana before freezing it, otherwise you might find it a bit hard cutting it afterwards. Take it to a food processor an add almond milk or whichever you like best. add a tsp of peanut butter and honey and mix it for some time. If you need, separate the banana chunks before starting the food processor So that the machine don't work too hard. I used to make it in a blender because everyone was doing that. But afterwards the machine would feel too hot and I was afraid it might break. Now with the food processor is easy breezy. If you need add more milk but it shouldn't be too liquid. It should look like ice cream. Serve it with fruits, granola, whatever you like. I eat it with granola. I discovered this snack not too long ago and it is GLORIOUS. It will sound so basic, but hear me out. Boil an egg for 8 min till fully cooked. Then I cut an apple into slices, not too thin nor too thick. Then I cut some cheese. It can honestly be any cheese. I used camembert. Mix in a small bowl peanut butter and some honey. And now you have a super healthy plate you can eat separately or mixing everything. I like spreading peanut butter on the apple adding a cheese on top and eat it like a toast. If you try this please let me know! For those who know me might remember these cookies but just in case you don't about it I will repeat it, because these are my favourites while having a cup of tea. In a small bowl I smash a banana with a fork and cut in small pieces a handful of almonds. Leave some for decor. I put in some oat and I mix everything. It shouldn't look too moist nor dry. Now I gently press it over a plate covered in baking sheets. Now I bake it 15 min, medium temperature. Once you see golden edges and the base is also golden, they are ready to eat. They will look white on top, don't let that fool you. Always check the base. I must confess, I like to eat mine with dulce de leche. Let's leave the oat world and make some popcorn. We will use corn for popping. We put oil in a pan, I use olive oil. Pour in the corn, stir a bit, cover it and done. Here I will show you 2 options: Salty and sweet. On one bowl I'll put sea salt and matcha to the other one I'll put light brown sugar and cinnamon. Matcha is not for everyone. I personally don't like it, for example. But my husband likes it and it's a great antioxidant. I have a sweet tooth. And the smell of cinnamon makes me think of Christmas. which one do you like best? The surprise for the end! This is not light. but so yummy. I learnt it in kinderganden so it's super easy even my husband can do it. In a bowl tear apart some lady fingers. There shouldn't be any big chunks. Add a spoon of dulce de leche and mix. Trying to incorporate it the best you can. Most likely you will need to use your hands. Then you make some balls. And roll them through shredded coconut. You can also use sprinkles or cocoa powder. Whatever you like. That is it! You can enjoy! Which snack did you like the most? I always try to make snacks with few ingredients, easy to do with things you have at home. If you liked this video let me know. See you in the next one.

abysmal I don't know if I already said that or not DOM is in her own world here I don't know what the [ __ ] she's doing what's up the two fingers where were they on the meat there you go left you want one of mine no you wolf that down pretty fast I'm a hungry well maybe you should go back on your video and tell them another stage I stressed anyway I'm still smoking MK ULTRA from Canada so I think I said that Donna [ __ ] me up [ __ ] I don't know what the [ __ ] I should walk around pretending ups Tourette's a hit them all [ __ ] [ __ ] haha no I knew I said that [Music] [ __ ] ah what embers you doing that son-of-a-bitch [ __ ] I think I'm gonna have to tell you guys the next stage because Donna's gonna pass Oh I'm gonna have to get this bone cleaned out the [ __ ] I don't know if you guys noticed that the down stem was lifting when I lifted my bowl like that see [ __ ] starting to stick it's gonna need a clean what's your problem over there Donna's fighting with a [ __ ] I fly she's playing with a dirty old [ __ ] fly over there [ __ ] sakes anyway these things are [ __ ] good my walk [Music] she's [ __ ] anyway [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm still eating the sour cream and bacon ruffles and they're pretty [ __ ] good hey there dick close [Music] Donna's not passed out she took a shower and what are you doing Donna she's trying to edit her video that she made [ __ ] sakes try not to accidentally delete your [ __ ] eh mm-hmm that would suck I'd be telling you guys about a video or whatever that was supposed to go up before this video and the [ __ ] thing doesn't exist because Donna accidentally deleted it on the edibles I don't even know if that made any sense I hope so [ __ ] hopefully made sense [Music] yeah [Music] I hear a buzzing sound like a fly on the window or something but I don't see a fly I don't know what the [ __ ] that was maybe something outside the window a probably oh yeah I forgot to say also after the Timmins housing guys came and took the wood away this morning from the step outside I never talked to them but a couple well I'm not a couple another timmons hosing guy came here later on well a couple them did come but one came in the house and he came in with the cabinet guy to measure the countertops for new countertops so my understanding is they're gonna get brand new countertops and put them on top of these rotting cupboards mm-hmm that's [ __ ] but oh well hey not my money but yeah I guess they're gonna put brand new countertops on the rotting cupboards cuz it's like the sinks rotting underneath a so instead of switching it I guess cupboards just or a countertops supposed to make it all better I don't know whatever I mean maybe they're switching the cupboards but I don't think so I didn't hear that part so I don't think so I think it's just a countertop though which is [ __ ] but oh well anyway I got a dad's old-fashioned cream soda I've had it for a few days hopefully you guys can read the thing my Muir says you can read the label but my mirror is a [ __ ] liar sometimes so maybe you can't I don't know let's make sure you can yep you can anyway I've had this for a few days I forgot that I had it it's been sitting in the fridge so it's it's nice and cold it's got a twist pop a twist off cap you know [Music] smells just like cream soda hey [Music] not too bad but it's kind of flat well not flat but it doesn't have to fizz that it should have you know what I mean it should be it should be awestruck boom tongue-twisters a anyway I think it should have some more fizz in there there's some but it's nothing to write home the grandma boat hey [ __ ] I thought I was gonna be better than that I had one of these before I just didn't remember what it tasted like now I remember not very good I guess I should have got a crush cream soda then it would have been good okay anyway I don't know let's see if I got a bonus toke a real small bonus toke a teeny little [ __ ] hey anyway yeah I'm gonna fill my bowl back up and I don't know what the [ __ ] we're gonna talk about or what we're gonna do maybe nothing I don't know I'm hungry I thought the munchies real bad I'm probably gonna go look for something to eat and yeah okay and yeah but I gotta fill my bowl back up first because I need a full bowl you gotta have a full ball when you're gonna have munchies you got to have a full bowl of weeds they go together hey munchies and weeds Oh what the [ __ ] I'm talking about I better shut the [ __ ] up a [ __ ] I forget hidden [Music] I can't tell if you guys can see it or not mmm its new hey it's new it says [ __ ] new and I wasn't gonna eat any of these tonight on here I was gonna save them for sometime this week but it seems to me that you know if I don't eat one right now I'm never gonna get one they're going fast daughter Zeno liked it goin on a style mm-hmm no I'm just kidding but Justin's been stealing them daughters tried them because I know she has because she said each one of these they're good I thought you were in the do you were in them Justin was in them Charlie was probably in them so I'm gonna have one before the gun has chocolate on the bottom I didn't even know that it's got peanut butter on it in it on and in it's like a bowl it's like a cookie ball with chocolate at the bottom and the bowls filled with peanut butter hopefully you guys can see that I don't know [ __ ] [Music] do you see what I mean chocolate it's like a cookie bowl and then it's filled with peanut butter at least it looks like it's filled with peanut butter I don't know if it's filled all the way through but let's find out nope it's filled halfway during a it's okay it's like a really dry peanut butter cookie I'm not gonna finish it why did you tell me that was good you thought it was good hmm that's not good at all I guess it's good if you're hurting real bad but you know if you're starving hmm if you're not starving well I wouldn't bother touching the [ __ ] thing anyway I see we've got some new subscribers today cigarette holder - yes if you're wondering what that sound is Donna's handling the meat over there hey Donna's handling some meat that's the dry salami with Parmesan cheese all around it and Donna's hacking some off for us hey she's hacking it off hack me off a slice Donna holy [ __ ] I don't care which one just throw it on the box right there look at that a look at the thick layer of Parmesan cheese just look at it Bank go on have a good look Donna's still hacking on the meat are you mad at me don't want you cutting it like that you couldn't like her bad me [Laughter] that was funny but it probably wasn't anyway another bong toke [Music] that thumping sound if you guys heard it a few seconds ago is Charlie keeps trying to slide closer and closer to Donna because she's got the meat Hey Donna's got the meat and Charlie knows that and he wants meat Charlie Charlie you can't have meat well you can have me but I don't think you can have it can you have that kind of meat I guess he could as long as you didn't give him too much you give him too much he's probably gonna get two shits [ __ ] I'm losing my cheese [Music] oh my [ __ ] if you guys are smoking weeds go get yourself a [ __ ] Kaka that's enough some salami with Parmesan cheese yeah I want another one I have another gigantic slice over here anyway I don't really know what to talk about but probably bored you guys enough I thought Donna was gonna pass out and I was gonna show you guys Donna snoring but somehow she managed to make it through a hundred milligrams of THC plus a joint verily verily yea there was the hardest thing you ever had to do would you do it again [Laughter] [ __ ] seeks sleep next time she would sleep take the edible and then go to bed right now yeah I don't know what time it is probably about 9 9 p.m. has been 4 hours 4 hours ya know I still got this piece here you go ahead you make a video of you making dry salami with Parmesan cheese but you

"Oh [Music] [Applause] you good morning everyone welcome to Grand Rounds today's speaker is dr. Laura Jeju name I apparently been pronouncing wrong for nine years she is dr. J Joe is here from the Department of pulmonology she trained at University of Michigan for her undergrad on the graduate and medical school went on to University of Wisconsin for her pediatric training and allergy immunology fellowship and she's been in the Roanoke Valley since 2009 welcome dr. Jason thank you everyone for coming out on this beautiful morning and Janie in honor of the talk made a delicious peanut butter coffee cake and my talk again will be pretty formal we're going to talk about an update on where things stand with peanut allergy because hopefully in the next year or so they're going to be some major changes please but it's going to be as little on my own so please let it be informal on yours well I'll ask some questions some history stuff in addition to some allergy and peanut allergies stuff as well so interrupt if you need to I think alex has microphones that will we'll figure it out unfortunately I will not be getting anything from doing talk other than just getting a nail if you want so our objectives we're going to go over food allergy as far as diagnosis and treatment in 2018 again it may be changing for peanut allergy in 2019 we'll talk about oral desensitization as a therapy primarily for for peanut allergy and we'll go over to studies so I apologize for that hopefully one can get too much in the mud for that and then I'm going to ask your opinion and see what we might be able to do as brilliant kids to deal with this when all of these patients you start getting rules therapy from us hopefully again next year we'll talk about how we define C allergies diagnose it we'll talk about the new feeding guidelines that came out last year for the introduction of say nuts like I said we'll talk about a couple of studies and then how to approach the upcoming pant challenges like I said we'll talk about a couple of historical questions dr. Kraft is here and he's also a closeted history buff and he's going to be giving a talk on Kerry xi we think I started a CO so it'll be sometime in January on the history of Pediatrics um so hopefully you all can come to that as well I'm looking forward to it but William Osler famous physician he was also known for something else it was either has it was either an opera composer he was late opera in the 19th century and he said with Gilbert & Sullivan or he invented the elephant year but at the st. Louis World's Fair or even better experience terms of the name and Gurtej Edgerton York Davis or she also was a Shakespearean scholar he compared Shakespeare with milk and he thought what it is see it was it was an excellent okay yes and I told I told the nurses in our office one of his pranks and I'm not supposed to tell it's mixed company because he was a little raunchy so if anybody wants note we can talk about that and doesn't he look like a preacher so gotta watch her back with this guy so as far as switching to actually something or something lots of people think they have food allergy most of them are wrong up to a quarter of people think they have food allergy and sometimes it is a true intolerance but it's not an IgE you need a food allergy requiring that they carry epinephrine in adults it's one or two percent a lot of kids will outgrow a number of their food allergies at but in kids it is more common and that preservative allergies are actually quite rare I'm going to have a couple of pictures is this a common food allergen fish actually is fish and shellfish are are pretty common and they tend not to be outgrown what about chocolate no if anything with chocolate it could be the cross-contamination with the nut so if someone says you know I have hives you know three hours after I eat chocolate it chocolate and it may not have been anything and we'll talk about that a little bit to towards the end about math wait um eggs are eggs a common food allergens let's see and what strawberries the strawberries are actually not very common strawberries can be an irritant to lappa kids will get a perioral rash when they eat them but it's that's not something that you really need to get to work about you get sensitive baby skin and acidic foods you really don't need to give them an A PP generally don't gain testing the other thing that really tends to be very irritating to little skin is ranch dressing i used to test for it and finally I just gave up and so a handful of times a year someone will come in and that their kid is allergic to ranch dressing and they just go for you sure so these are the top 8 food allergens the nuts the seafood milk eggs wheat and soy and I divided them into two colors any ID why there Li GE made the top 4 tends not to be outgrown and the bottom 4 tends to be outgrown so now have a percent some kids will outgrow peanut allergy some kids won't outgrow egg allergy but as a rule that's a pretty good thing to tell patients again you never say never but probably about between 80 and 90 percent of people will keep they're not in seafood allergy and about 80 or 90 percent will lose the other allergies there are some allergic dish diseases that may have a GE influence like atopic dermatitis in ES and a philic esophagitis many people who have these problems are allergic that there may or may not be an allergic trigger for AoE there can be significant improvement with food restriction but that isn't necessarily related to any testing that's just kind of empiric and eczema lots of people come in saying my kid has eczema what's the cause and there isn't necessarily a cause a lot of most of the times these kids are going to be allergic but their eggs amiable flare for reasons that are not necessarily lerczak it to be irritant it could be illness and sometimes it is allergy but it's not it's not a wonderful and there are lots of things that are can be non immunological adverse reactions food poisoning heavy-metal poisoning surround by fish poisoning chemicals caffeine I had a cup of coffee so I apologize you know last page deficiency people will come in and say you know my twelve-year-old now can't tolerate dairy they get GI symptoms I can offer skin testing but I'll tell them by and large it it's going to be negative and they can try lactates on lactose free milk and see if that improves things and if not then I'll send to my GI cop class to see Nia pancreatic insufficiency can certainly cause some GI issues gustatory rhinitis this will happen more often with spicy foods but there are some people who get a runny nose no man what they eat and so we will move on to a patient that will just kind of think of at least for the first time talk and actually kind of think about this young man he's 15 month old first time he ate peanut is at daycare on a cracker five minutes he developed eyes on his face and then became generalized let's got a little swollen it's some coughing and wheezing and then vomited he did have some eggs but that's gotten better he does take soymilk he had some vomiting and rash when he took cow's milk formula but he tolerates dairy and baked goods parents have got some allergic rhinitis controlled with over-the-counter medications and it was at the parent sister and dog and his exam by the time you see him in follow-up is negative but mom's took a picture and with an IgE mediated food allergy the oral tolerance doesn't develop properly or break down and specific IgE to the food binds mass cells of a cell's tested the cells and causes degranulation and the symptoms you see with anaphylaxis the initial assessment when you see the child either while they're actively having a problem and we'll talk about treatments or you know three days later and follow-up after they've been seen in the ER is has been they eat in the food previously what was the food was how much did they eat how long did it happen afterwards was it immediate with seven hours later what was the reaction and how long did the reaction last if they had highs for a week and a half after that's also less typical of food allergy and maybe something more associated with just an acute episode of our area if they don't have any other symptoms I took this picture of my son when he was a baby he is my allergic kid and he's got some eczema he's got some seasonal allergies and when he was one he drank milk just fine but when you see themself yogurt we're kind of glom on to his face you get a little hive go away and it has an hour so I tended to ignore it because it didn't bother him and he was drinking milk fine so you kind of you have to put it into perspective I have always wondered if I would have tested and if you would have had any IgE to the milk but I didn't and now we'll never know but you if you've got a kid like if they're drinking dairy and they kind of get a little rash where things probably leaving it be is the best thing is reassurance that being said what if they're drinking milk and having significant reactions it's a little different questions so our guy who's 15 months old got a pretty convincing story it happened immediately he had multiple systems involved he's had eggs and mother's family history his story is pretty good definitely get him some injectable epinephrine hopefully they did it used it in the emergency room sometimes it's they don't and this is a guy that we need to see I'll be asking the same questions you've asked and finding out about other allergic diseases if they're older seasonal allergies this guy's only 15 months old so you may not have as many seasonal symptoms and then we do the testing actually this is our epi would anybody is here to show me how to use our various devices and in clinic dr. Jones and she so this is an EpiPen there's also a generic uses it the same way so the way that it works you always tell people to check the expiration date because it may be a good expires in six months you have to do a copay is that worth it and then pardon yep and then you hold it for five seconds it used to be ten but now it's five and this orange thing will come up come up and cover the needle so it can be thrown away and then we told the kids to go to the emergency room immediately who would like to show our Auggie you [Applause] the all view is really cool and actually it currently it's really hard to come by epi the EpiPen and even the generic right now the obvious you if patients have a commercial insurance if you send it to a pharmacy in New Jersey they'll cover the copay and they'll mail into the house and there is this is probably my least favorite mainly because after you use this that the needle is still exposed it's the only thing you can get it's certainly better than nothing the nice thing about it is it's labeled you pull one you pull two and it's the same thing outer part of the thigh hold it for five seconds and pull it out but there will be an exposed needle so we haven't put it back into the case immediately and I always tell patients if there's ever any doubt just use it all it is up and Efrain all it is is adrenaline otherwise healthy kids it's not going to cause any long-term problems and I'd rather have any patients use it and not need it than not use it and have needed it we do skin testing in our office it is very sensitive but not quite as specific so that's why the history is horribly important so I don't like to test for a gazillion things because if they're eating this food and not having problems it that's a much better story than otherwise it's just a pinprick there's no intradermal testing for foods and that that's the product we use but there are many other out there and that's what positive influences your bite so in our patients who respond to subpoena and milk and as far as cap rafts which are analyzer I don't know who these very often for diagnosis mainly for the initial diagnosis because we don't get the because we get the answer right away for the skin testing we can do the teaching and everything all in one visit and sometimes with unusual foods we'll do it if the kids got bad eczema or if they've taken an antihistamine we'll do it but generally I do it more for follow-up there are some studies saying at what points the numbers we would want to do a challenge to so it's more for follow-up at least with my patient's as far as what we tell patients we teach them how to read labels how to eat out cross-contamination when in kids with peanut allergy Asian African and Mexican food will often be crop produced with herb made with nuts baked goods fried foods fish and shellfish so they make it french fries but fried in the same oil as the shrimp and we go over this pretty much in depth tickle ate actually okay people peanut oil has very little protein in it which is the issue and there they've done studies and we've had a number of patients come in and say I didn't think like they were going to be allergic to peanut chick-fil-a and then again I'm looking at butter sandwich and oh my god so chick-fil-a is generally okay which and then we give them handouts regarding this it kids have multiple food allergies for our kid it's primarily peanut he's got the milk allergy but he's tolerating it and baked goods so that's actually very encouraging but if we get a perfect either with food allergy that's when we run into problems sometimes we'll work with a nutritionist and follow them more closely because of possible nutrition issues and I usually if someone's just like you know the allergy up all the blood work at least at least initially every year if someone's got multiple food allergies I may do it a little more frequently just in the hopes of liberalizing their diet there it's the heat may do it and also that's the quantity there are it need a pH of the protein it's not so much of an issue with the peanut it doesn't change that much the other thing that the heat does kind of separate from the milk and the eggs are this the places where we generally would think about it there's something called the oral allergy syndrome and there's a kind of there's a subset of patients with seasonal allergies primarily birch pollen to ragweed who when they ate certain raw fruits and vegetables get an HTML Apple pick fruits carrot cross-react with birch pollen bananas cucumbers watermelon the other melons cross create reckless with ragweed and so when they eat them they get an 18-ounce but if you cook them it denatures the protein and they can tolerate it so that's another place where that that may play a role we give them information about food allergy resource and education which is a great route group up in northern virginia we talked about MedicAlert bracelets and then we talked about the nut-free table which is really not a thing that i like because at least and once kids are in like first or second grade unless there's some developmental issues the world is it not free and so i think having the kids be able to advocate for themselves is a good thing but preschool is a little different so vaccines and food allergy this time of year is kind of a big deal the only vaccines that contain any appreciable amount of egg protein are the influenza and lay low fever MMR is fine it has no give your give all your kids MMR for the last two years and we've done this forever there's such a little amount of egg in the flu vaccine that we've never had a problem in the CDC doesn't really consider it a problem anymore so I dealer two kids can get their flu vaccine so I'm so we're going to go to a different subjects we're going to ask you about another famous surgeon William Halsted he begun a great great surgeon about radical mastectomies but what made him unique he considered camp optional he often saying his diagnosis while practicing surgery had a booming butcher shop on the side and that funded his research or he traded in his cocaine habit for morphine addiction he whose oh maybe I'll get you this time huh cutter yes he was is part of some research in cocaine he became addicted and then he swapped it out crackhead and working addict so we're going to talk now about how to introduce Pina into your patients diets this comes from the leap study from night 2015 and it shows that the early introduction of peanut containing foods high risk kids decreased the relative decrease the development of peanut allergy by 81% and based on this last year that ni I came out with the new peanut feeding guidelines and this way guideline one these are kind of the allergic kids they've got more severe eczema the fans or egg allergy so when they beaten eggs they've gotten hives and problems with that or they've got bad eczema and the recommendations for these kids is to start feeding them peanut as soon as possible four to six months and the recommendations are six teaspoons a week mixing it with their their formula mixing it with applesauce to get it in these are higher risk babies and so testing them for peanut allergy prior to introduction is not a bad idea and you can send them to us for skin testing I know the wait list is like forever so if you can't get them in or someone's in a fight out out in a place where there are no allergist you can do the cataracts a peanut specific IgE if it's less than 0.35 the options are to introduce the peanuts home or do a supervised feeding in your office the risk is fairly low at that level if it's higher than that point three five the recommendations are to have skin testing and then sudden the burden is on me in kids who have moderate eczema no food allergy there really the recommendation is to start the feeding early as well typically again by six months same amount no testing is required if mom is completely wigging out you can do a supervised feeding and that's kind of up to you how you'd want to do it in guideline three kids no eczema no food allergy start it whenever you'd like it probably isn't a bad idea to do it sooner just because of the data that we have but it really whenever the family would like yes so if you want it if you want to take that for a child and if there's a household put someone else in the household peanut allergic then repeat that the question was what do you do if there's someone in the family who is peanut allergic that's if it doesn't mean there's something of the logic families that keep you know the house will just be the baby the recommendations as far as they've got a kid whose older brother has peanut allergy the baby doesn't have any sign no eczema no anything that makes it look like a particularly atopic kid there is this like risk increased risk just based on previous studies but it's not addressed in the guidelines I actually just won a local pediatrician just call me uh two days ago with this question so it's not addressed in the guidelines I usually let the parents be the guy they listen the kids are still a pretty low risk there's no eczema there's no issues but some families are really really nervous and either checking the cat breast or giving me a call and doing the skin testing is a reasonable thing to do again it's not addressed in the guidelines but I think I usually let the paint parents decide and I've had this discussion with patients who now have a baby and you know the ownership does have food allergy and let them know that it's really they're in the driver's seat for that we're going to talk a couple of cases based on the new guidelines so a five-month-old comes to your office and hives and vomiting after some egg a couple weeks ago or last week on he does have some pretty bad eczema to the next allergy appointment is a month after never so what are you going to do love this blood test and what do you do if it's less than point one week because use food or CSL family wants to do this and focus exactly so you either introduce the food or see it make sure if the family is cool with that or if you want to introduce it in the office and what about if it's a 10-point to send them to me so another six month old boy comes in for a while child check a little bit of eczema and shrunken elbows examine history or otherwise normally he's eating egg just fine mom is concerned about peanut what do you tell her try it and if she's completely walking you can offer again if you if you'd feel comfortable doing it's just saying you know eat it in here this kid isn't a high-risk it then you can do that too I've been here nine years he's like his nine years ago and now they're big so that was Dustin now we're going to get into kind of the meat of the talk and of what we're looking forward to in the next year or so oral desensitization has been study for a long time West Berks was at Duke now he's at you and seeing he's done a lot of this work most of the date is for peanut and egg and we're going to go over to studies like I've mentioned what ah oops so allergy shots were actually tried in the distant past as treatment for food allergy but lots of people anaphylaxis without really kind of very oral desensitization is kind of like allergy shots because you start with a teeny tiny amount you gradually increase it over a number of months so you get to some sort of maintenance and it reaches that therapeutic maximum continued regular dosing ideally what we would like would be what we call sustained on responsiveness which is pretty much not be allergic you eat the food whenever you want as opposed to eating or dose of peanut every day but that doesn't happen very often and we're the first talk is going to there the first study that we're going to go over will talk about patients where that actually may be an option the goal is variable depending on the study maybe a half the group and if there's failure in them up to about twenty percent of patients and like I said eighty percent of patients with peanut allergy don't have outgrow it so that's a really good target and the peanut specific IgE will often rise over the first few years of life so that's a good target age to consider this as well and we're going to go over early intervention in the first study and then we're going to talk about a product that is kind of going through the FDA process and again may be released next year so it's oral desensitization peanut some tree nuts egg and milk peanut has the most bang for the buck it's got so many more patients and as far as financials go it probably is where the companies are going to make their money to so it's a good place to start again multiple studies the first one we'll talk about is it came out last year doing early oral immunotherapy in peanut allergic kids in the preschool age group and this looked at kids 9 to 36 months this is younger than most of the studies and they had positive wrath or skin test and they on average they were a little over two years and they went on it they challenged them with four grams of kina protein and if they were positive were randomized into low-dose getting thirty 300 milligrams or high-dose three grams and they were treated for about two and a half years and it was looking at sustained response unresponsiveness so they're stopping clean up for four weeks and then challenging them then and it wasn't looking at these sense nation because there have been so many studies on that as well 30 of the 37 were desensitize naturally few more on the lower dose were desensitized the higher dose for withdrew some of them have GI complaints there have been some reports of and we'll talk about the seasonal kassapa gitis developing and getting the oral desensitization and to fill the challenge of the 31 failed a challenge after avoiding it for four weeks but compared with the controls in the study their specific key not IgE was decreased and controls were increased and the lower dose was just as effective as the higher dose which is kind of exciting 78 percent of the kids develop had sustained on responsiveness and Warren Jeffs desensitize they were pretty much cured and again the lower dose would serve as effective as a higher dose and that in half the time and we're able to eat peanuts containing foods 19 times more frequently than if they hadn't gone through the session there were some side effects they were mild one kid giving it to you that's epinephrine at home there were some hives some sneezing some GI symptoms as well the thing with this is this is such this is a much younger group than most of the studies but it's also the most promising these are kids who are not going to have to continue eating the peanuts every single day or most of the days so ultimately this will be the goal but it will look at the next study and it's probably going to be a proof for older kids years to develop tolerance than just study when I was two and a half years correct so if it's approved downtown to age four and to be honest that's with the study we're going to look at next does what do we do with these these younger kids where it actually may even more effective and it won't take as much time and will be cheaper which is probably a reason not to do it for drug companies so the reality is there is this company working on through the FDA process to get it approved I think they had some big meeting in December again walnut are also in their pipeline we're just going to talk about peanut today it's in base trait studies in the pre investigational new drug phase for egg and walnut but again we're going to focus on the peanut the study that we're going to go over in particular is Palisades peanut allergy oral immunotherapy study of AR 101 which is the product for desensitization in children adults there I'll briefly talk about Ramsay's and Artemis as well but those are I'm going to just finish so we don't have the data on those yet palisade looked at 554 kids four to seven mostly male mostly white and eligible subjects reacted at less than 100 micrograms of peanut protein during a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge so these are really sensitive people and this is probably a lot more sensitive more sensitive than a lot of the other studies out there they underwent a dose escalation over six months reaching 300 milligrams a day which is about eight peanuts and then they exited with a double-blind placebo-controlled challenge again they started with 0.5 initials that they don't say that escalation was up to 6 milligrams they take the 6 milligrams at home for two weeks come in bed up to 12 and do the same over 24 weeks so they got to the 300 milligrams and this includes all the patients who withdrew in the people getting the study drug 76% got up to could tolerate six three hundred milligrams two thirds 50 tolerate 600 milligrams and half could tolerate a full gram and again much less in those to receive less evil in patience just finishing the study completely again nearly a hundred percent could tolerate 300 down to 63 percent who tolerated though one gram and again similar for the placebo because they weren't getting anything cool long and on the exit challenge couple kids did require epi who were in the study but if you look at you know over 50 percent required epi in patients who received placebo there were a few FA yz5 were reported were not related to the drug v discontinued one head one child did have a very severe anaphylaxis and he had a baseline high IgE to peanut 16 stopped due to GI symptoms and one was diagnosed with a OE couple others did have biopsies that were negative and of course this is 14% had receiving the drug and 6% three points percent receiving placebo had anaphylaxis which is likely at the Banta flex the Festiva most of them were mild and a few did receiving the drug did withdraw because of that so it's not benign people do react at the end of the study compared with those on the placebo the kids taking peanut had lower peanut specific IgE their skin tests were smaller and they had a lower peanut I GE died GG dude i GG 4 ratio which is associated more with tolerance so in patients highly allergic to peanut two thirds of them of all the ones going through the study could tolerate 600 milligrams so 16 peanuts s um compared with 4% receiving the placebo and a median how a rated dose entry to exit improves hundredfold in treated patients there were certainly kids who reacted but it was thankfully controllable and the safety was similar to previous studies that but done on peanut allergy so Palisades is the largest peanut be sensitization study ever completed and it did it was the only one so far to go to include kids who had life-threatening allergy for what's next right now they have their two other ongoing studies this Rameses is supposed to finish right about now if it hasn't it will finish sometime this month it's looking at patients in the US and Canada and it's looking word of real world setting without the initial double-blind placebo-controlled show because that's not going to happen in real life but there are too many of these in a in a regular practice that's just too labor-intensive and it's also looking at the safety of this product Artemis isn't going on in Europe that's going to finish up in February and it's also looking at maybe making it a little faster and just again trying to work out any bumps questions about these steps I think you mentioned in the first study there was a four-week follow up like they were taken off of you know for four weeks and there were dissipation tonight right is there any chance especially in young kids that they will have tolerance but then will redevelop the allergy farther down more than four weeks out in the hope would be I mean it might not be I think it would if it were to be six months or something like that it would be possible I think the goal would still be to keep peanut in their diet to some degree but it would be more along the lines of hey have a peanut butter sandwich every couple weeks as opposed to there would be again it's hard to know what the recommendations are going to be and further studies would need to be done looking at that long as but to be honest I mean a whole lot of peanuts but you know everyone's a lot I mean I ate it more than every six months and you know maybe maybe even less more than every month so to include Keenan and every month or so I don't think would be would be a whole lot less owner it's basically other questions so the seminary of which event is going to occur in 38 states do a little math either the first recorded influenza case in the 1819 pan edema the release of the first hockey movie the interval will run on a lecture in front or the millions Model T will rolling off the assembly it is yes no 11 o'clock on 1111 so what does this mean for our patients with peanut allergy Ross he's not here thank you he hugs him forever to get this data this is visit of a number of patients that I see a month with peanut allergy actually the slight increase but from in two years there's about 500 patients so in 2016 to 17 it was 234 up until May of this year it was 260 so again about 250 people a year and he divided it into locations where these kids came from most of them were from Roanoke County and Roanoke City a larger anyone over 10 the Franklin County bodhisattva's for Salem Henry County and Montgomery County were all over ten patients how are we going to make this work for our patients is the question if only half of the patients you know allergy decide to go under it and it's a big time commitment some patients are just completely freaked by it some of these kids are going to be 2 and 3 years old and it means only go down so for as far as being approved how are we going to address this our office is only so big it's going to be it's going to take a whole lot of manpower especially initially when we get this big in and I I've got lots of dreams about how this could be done but that the dreams and reality are on so it's going to require skilled nursing it's going to require space you have to be prepared for anaphylaxis and you're going to have to follow these patients to say hey you taking this daily because if they're missing five doses in two weeks then that's an issue so we need somebody who's going to be able to really follow these kids well ideally I would love to have like a thirst practitioner who could do this go from maybe add a postal a couple days by us maybe up in bada time but I don't know that that would be me like also like to win the lottery but I don't I don't know how feasible that is and so if other people have ideas about how this could be take care of you know would it be trained nurse and practices to deal with this but again if that would be taking a nurse away from other responsibilities I just don't know how to make this work especially initially because there's going to be a boatload of patients and their families who are going to want to do this and I don't want to lose them because they're going to go somewhere else if we can't offer this so if any ideas I would email me really I'm good for anything because I want to be able to provide this to our patients because it really is going to be life-altering for these kids and their families and again if any thought I really truly would love to hear them and this really doesn't have anything to do with food allergy this is just a few random thoughts on on ER doc area and again this is my Raschi kid he when he was four and this is when he was four for reasons that are unclear one day he said hey momma Mitch eek and I said oh you've been outside you got bug bites and the next day he took off their shirt oh my god you know it's a good step here you don't have bug bites you've got hives and he had hives for a month some days he had a lot some day be a little I didn't really get idiopathic urticaria he hadn't been sick sorry with humans for he was in preschool maybe he had a little sniffle and that was the trigger I don't know just for your own patience for your own practice when you're in the ER hi certainly can be allergic it can be the kid like our 15 month old who ate the peanut butter cracker but it can also just be Aaron who rashes easy and if you take that good history you know someone has hives for the last we don't have that's not allergic you know finding out that they you know week and a half ago they they had a cold that's huge and just in reassurance people don't guys this guy from hive if people are anaphylaxis now that there are other things that are potentially a problem you know into edema hypertension there are lots of things that can hit but hives in and of themselves are annoying they're uncomfortable but they're fits they're not really it's it's all you need to do with tips to try and find motivation comfortable if they're not allergic and related to anaphylaxis they don't need to be hospitalized and reassurance will go a long way and one thing is hereditary angioedema is always a concern especially people if you've got hives and angioedema actually that's really not that big of a deal because you don't it doesn't affect the airway but if you just have angioedema hereditary in Judea which can affect the airway and the gut and can be potentially fatal is a concern so that's but if it's if you only have an edema then that needs to be worked up and if you've got hives and angioedema it's also big stage csa on for the Curia questions about hi so food allergy is a huge problem especially in young kids the history is huge as far as your workup if you write a good history in epic it makes it film it I can it makes it so much easier for us and early introduction of peanut in the higher risk it decreases the rate of desensitization so using this guideline is of the utmost importance the oral desensitization is on the horizon and those studies have mostly included older kids the younger kids are actually where the most exciting part of this puzzle maybe because they made it develop the sustained tolerance compared to the old races so on to a couple of questions when do you recommend in terms of peanut introduction a four month old who got hives when mom said of a bite of scrambled eggs prescribed a key and sent an allergy or obtain specific I to eat a peanut and eggs prescribe epi stop the introduction of any foods until testing is performed perform race on an extended food panel or encourage peanut and ingestion of six teaspoons of peanut butter weekly hey yeah so this kid did react to the egg so it's a higher-risk kid so you would want to do the testing before you introduce so four year old comes to your clinic three he's had eyes for three days he's otherwise doing well he didn't have some shrimp till last week so what do you recommend spend them to the elegant muted customers the shrimp give him a injectable epi and offended him to the floor with epi at the bedside prescribed hydrocortisone cream in a floor bath or ask about recent URI symptoms treat with antihistamines reassurance see and finally the parents of a ten year old boy with significant peanut allergy wonderful ever outgrow it what's your response nope I'm sure he's outgrown it i prescribed a peanut butter sandwich no but oral desensitization is looking more promising no but subcutaneous desensitization is looking more promising and that is the end of my talk but before I end one of my favorite people is here today and and Bailey I just give daily hug on your way out she is wonderful and she's staying with us to help out for a couple of months but we will miss her horribly and we were questions of two questions um what is it about nuts that makes them so allergy inducing and are there parts of the world where nuts are a more important part of the diet and our allergies nuts more or less frequent there probably because there isn't all their canvases they may not be changed as far as the the protein itself is more the part that they're allergic you're allergic to does not tend to be it tends not to be you can't denature it as well it's usually it's not related on the shape of the protein it's related just so like with the milk in the egg so you may get small amounts and that can kind of lead to its own desensitization but maybe that but a lot of places and we talked about this the last time I talked about peanut allergy a lot of places where there was early introduction there's not as much peanut allergy and in the past actually in Asia where they boiled peanuts it hasn't been as much of a problem but now they've taken on a more Western diet and it's more of an issue so there is probably something about it and it may have to do with the configuration of the protein itself any other question you had another question didn't you what was it about this okay so back to the guidelines of peanut allergy so energy agonist eggs is an important role that has important role so what is there baby never ate egg or what if there is family history of egg allergy with the pain with the family history of egg allergy that's not addressed in the guidelines and technology does tend to be outgrown so patients may not remember parents may not remember it so that the other thing too is then you go by that eczema so if the kids got bad eczema you do it if the kid hasn't eaten egg and really has no egg allergy and any other thing to is easy to get eggs so there's a question online about how many kids have you successfully desensitized I have not desensitized anyone there are there definitely again the studies have done been done across the country I've not done it because you really need to have someone dedicated to measuring out these teeny tiny amounts of peanut protein and it also is an FDA approved there are elders who are doing it without the approval and they're doing well but it just makes me nervous I'm waiting for this so every August in September there's always a run on EpiPens and that's because school starting and there's been some proposals to keep EpiPens of like every school or keep you know five EpiPens but can you talk to any progress this is being made because right now it's every single child as a peanut allergy has an EpiPen at school so the school nurse might have 50 epi pens in the office and they all go bad after a year or two yeah it's there EpiPen was actually donating them to schools I'm not sure if that project is still in place it probably isn't now this is really the first time that we have been exploited because I've been doing this and I kind of wonder if it's karma when they try to jack up the price to a thousand dollars for ten a couple years ago but but this is really the first time it's been an issue as far as getting it the fed the AVI queue for our patients with commercial insurance has been huge because that I think has been a little bit they've been a little easier to come by but there are some patients right now where it is getting harder to find it hopefully that will improve which in their system or I'm sorry if you said this earlier but the association between egg and peanut I'm missing that Association but to keep referring to it the previous studies have shown that that they will often go together and there is a higher risk of peanut allergy just it's more a topic and that's an early introduced food again milk hasn't been shown to be quite as much but and there was also an early introduction of peanut in particular and actually to egg to some degree has been shown to be a good thing there was one study a few years ago that looked at like the introduction of all of the eight foods and so they were feeding these babies like swish fish and I mean they were doing stuff doing everything and really I mean it's like fish baby food so but they tried to do this with multiple multiple foods and the study was just garbage because it was to just try to try too much and so the big thing is spend this and in the peanut run together later to that question so there must be that there's some protein antigens that are similar like protein like milk and Stoli maybe not so much it's more just that they're common food allergens and there's there again pretty early foods that the kids are going to eat again for whatever reason milk just doesn't tend to go with them as much as between any egg but it's not necessarily the protein itself it's just they say this once run together any other questions or comments in the room we've got a couple minutes and a lot of people online so if you are on the line and you do not want to ask a question or make a comment please just place your phone on mute now the conference is now in talk mode see what happened okay is anyone on the line have a question or want to make a comment for dr. James yeah Laura this is my card I just quick question for you what are you recommending to if there's a very clear-cut strong family history of IgE peanut allergy given that leap trial in the bombuh experience so forth what are you telling moms during their pregnancy is that changed over the last few years in terms of no.8 whatever you want that's why I thought and as far as are you trying to get those kids earlier exposure you like the the bombuh experience you trying to is that what you're kind of reference at four to six months you know with the it doesn't that the studies don't address the family history the parents are often really anxious about it because of the family history so looking at the kid it doesn't look like in a topic kids in that case we will do the testing if it's not in a topic kids we let the family kind of decide if they want the testing will redo it but if they're comfortable feeding the baby peanut at home if you know they've eaten eggs there's no eczema I'm next I think that's a reasonable thing as well but we kind of let those families guide guide it I just don't want them the other thing too is because of the history a lot of them wants to do what's best as far as peanuts and so there they may be more likely to feed the baby peanut if they have the negative testing so I'll do anything what is the youngest center we've all taught to not to rest or skin testing before age 2 I think was what I was taught as a resident what is the youngest you've ever done a a Rast or a skin test on an infant in tests a couple months old and again it's mostly for foods environmental stuff I don't do a whole lot on babies I mean if you give me a one year old with a soupy nose chances are it's going to be a kid in daycare and so I'll do dog cat and dust mites just to make everybody happy but you know 9 times out of 10 or 99 times out of 100 it'll be it'll be negative and I'll just do that to make everyone happy because that's what they expect come to me but I don't go in I mean I mean to be perfectly honest if you're coming to the allergist and you don't get allergy testing or at least a little bit they are not happy and I'm not going to do more than dog cam doesn't in a one-year-old unless if I in that being said you know if a six-month-old had hives and vomiting with eggs I'll do egg and extra vitamin C nuts - thanks any other questions or comments okay thank you very much thank you [Applause] you", "odjU_3ELml4": "hey guys welcome back to my channel for those that are new welcome today's video can already tell by the title why don't we even say

her workouts and let me tell you they do help but obviously 90% of your results are going to be what you're putting in your system what you're eating what you're you know drinking and so on and so forth I'm sorry I'm out of breath but I'm gonna go ahead and bring everything inside and show you guys what I've been eating and maybe snacks and stuff that you guys can try out yourself so yeah all right guys we have made it back inside so now I'm gonna go ahead and show you guys what I use or have after my workouts and what easy snacks you guys can probably do to at home this is basic lemon water see - this helps just detox the body and just it's really refreshing so yes like I said pretty strapped with a mason jar whatever door you want pretty basic this is very generic now we're going to go ahead and cut up some lemon and some cucumber sorry I should okay so now I know this is a mess but this is like kind of my section of food we did just go grocery shopping not too long ago but I'm just gonna show you a few of the things I like to snack on when I'm hungry and what you guys can maybe try out too so I usually will grab one of these these are just the protein snacks I mean 130 calories per serving or about three servings per container these things are amazing so so good I'll actually link my link down below of like where I got them the site because you can't really get these in store these are only online and then also usually I'll try and have my protein drink mix in the mornings which that'll be like breakfast for me but have you been doing that often just gotta get back on that and then these are just Clif bars that I've been snacking then harder they are more protein-based for if you're working out or what not so and then these are organic mini cheese sandwich craft and also what I've been loving recently for snacking I also forgot to mention another whoa this lighting I don't know what's up with my camera um another thing I've been loving recently

you're kind of stumbled upon now how do you finish both I started in my kitchen obviously and then in 2013 I ended up finding this 32 foot trailer that somebody had converted into a department a health certified commercial kitchen Wow we found it out in Connecticut found on Craigslist we paid like 3500 dollars for this thing and $3,500 $3,500 and the person who he got it from was was going to

kitchen well you would spend many hours a day a week in their eyes oh yeah yeah yeah I I was I'd be out there it was right of my property I'd get up in the morning I'd go out there I'd be in the afternoon I'm not tired I think I'll go out there and do something there's a convenience factor there that you were able to work that into your lifestyle and have it work out pretty well well the good thing about it was the way started it is I would grow it my own you know and I built a little lab off the back of my house huh like literally like it was politician to the house it was a small lab so we would we'd grow it we'd extract it there we D carve it there the only thing we did was send it off into to be tested and then we'd make all the product there and it wouldn't leave the premises until it was done so it was the whole process right there and we had a couple places like that and then it just got too big that we couldn't do it like that anymore love is a lot of new flavors to come a lot of new things up and coming I'm pumped man I'm pumped", "djG-Z-lXIYo": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to just Jessica make sure you subscribe if you have an RN like and comment and let me know what you think about this video today I did the what I eat in a day I wanted to show you all because I've been asked a plethora of times what I eat in a day and normal day is for me people keep asking me how I lost so much weight I lost 44 0 pounds and the past 10 months this is what I eat in a day and the day that I recorded this happen to be one of my busiest days because I'm getting ready for an event at work it's just been kind of crazy it's been a whirlwind running around to different locations so this is what I ate today and I just want to let you know that I prepare all my meals the night before I don't prepare them a week in advance I just like to do it the night before I cook it with my dinner and that's what I eat the next day whatever I have for dinner is typically what I'm eating the next day it's easy for me it's mindless it's it's quick I enjoy my foods you know I also wanted to say that if you are craving something do not deprive yourself of it everything in moderation and realize that I didn't show it she meal or anything because I wasn't eating a cheat meal that day but if you are craving something have a taste maybe do a different alternative but don't so if you want a cookie have a cookie have a cookie log it if you log your macros or keep it in mind that I had a cookie maybe I shouldn't have an extra bite of whatever and then don't eat the piece of cake that's sitting beside the cookie or the pint of ice cream or the chips or whatever enjoy it but everything in moderation so without further ado here is what I eaten today and this is just Jessica so I made my cup of coffee it's just eight ounces of Dunkin Donuts nan I have all of my vitamins right before I took my vitamins I thought my water bottle and I put one scoop of Kate's muscle Hyde charge and one scoop of cage muscle BCAAs every single morning I do some vitamin C hair skin and nails cuz you gotta have the nails looking right magnesium this is so I stopped craving sweet stuff I am always craving sweets if I take one of these and it helps out tremendously iron I literally get bruises like it's no one's business and then this is my vitamin-a take two of those and then b12 so this is what my morning looks like so far and then it's breakfast time but next we're about to hit it with the members mark egg whites let's throw a little bit in this pan and get my morning started here we go so I again I barely measure anything fish kind of know on this so that's about six ounces so I just finished my egg whites I'm a foursome mustard on the side because that is the only way you should ever do condiments they should never be right on top your food then I stub my coffee that I haven't drink but this is water number two so this is second 24 ounce I've drank this morning and I've only been up 20 minutes Bon Appetit I'm in Virginia right now at one of our stores I packed all my lunches I always pack all my lunches it is around 10:45 I'm gonna run into this store of ours and ask the manager if I can use this microwave and I just have chicken rice cauliflower stir-fry and a little bit of sweet potato that I had left over this is meal number two I just went in there and spoke to my manager for a little bit today is a crazy day like I said I'm down in Waldorf Virginia and I have many meetings because I have an event coming up here for work so I'm on the go on the go on the go I scarfed to hone my food while talking to him didn't get a chance to show you but I use my net diary Pro to track all of my food so I can tell you exactly what I eat I had three ounces of chicken breast 1/3 cup sweet potatoes and then a cup and a half of my rice cauliflower from Trader Joe's Hodel it was like 232 calories and each my meals are about 200 to 300 calories and it just keeps me going and I it holds me over for three hours this is number four I usually drink about 140 160 ounces of water each of these is 24 so so far I've had about 90 ounces of water that's the go but I packed three other water bottles since I wouldn't be around you know our water cooler at work you always got to make sure you stay hydrated I have tons of water it fills me up and makes my skin better though it does not show right now you know that's just a part of being a woman I got to get on the road I have a lot of meetings to do so I guess up next we'll check in at meal three literally just bill my water everywhere I guess the top was all but perfect example why you always have extra water with you now my butt is soaked and I have to go into these meetings this is literally the epitome of my life so this is my third meal and I am actually on a hundred and thirty ounces of water that's about six of these I drink tons of water and I don't drink a gallon i gallon a half a day of my mouth feels dry and I just get headaches because I've just trained my body to need that much water this is my third meal about a cup and a half of mixed veggies and then a half a cup of sweet potatoes but like I said all of my meals around two hundred three hundred calories a day and I drink so so so so much water I stuck some caged muscle hydro charge in here I love a taste of it it's just really good and it keeps water interesting and fun I'm gonna enjoy this and then I'm gonna hit the gym soon let's see what's next also I just wanted to make him know that I don't have any protein in this meal and the reason for that is because I know this afternoon a little bit later I'm going to be having a ton of protein and if I were to have protein with us and that I would go over my protein intake for the day like I said I tracked my macros on my net diary bro so I know how much I'm going to eat it what a day and if ain't some now I'm just gonna go over and I don't need to and don't want to so that's why there's no protein but I would typically suggest that you have some sort of protein every single meal that you eat right we are done with our workout for I went I actually stuffed my face with one of these because I took longer than planned to get there and I started getting really hungry so I had a protein bar this is the lift builders bar I love them they're so good if you watched my last video they saw that I get them from Sam's Club great macros too so now we are about to make our protein shake for right after our workout alright so I have everything here that I'm using for my shake we will start out with obviously at the base what we're gonna use to make it a drink I have milked almonds I get this from Trader Joe's eight ounces of this is 150 calories 11 grams of fat 9 grams of carb and 5 grams of protein and typically I only use water but I'm using this because I was baking and I had then we're gonna do our page muscle micro cure whey protein isolate I love it or 25 grams of protein point 5 grams of fat 2 grams of carbs the best part about this is that it gets in your system quickly its rapid release so you're getting the nutrition and all that you need right after your workouts or my frozen bananas that I always have I'll do one banana about 7 inches or so and then we're gonna have some ground cinnamon I probably do a teaspoon or maybe a tablespoon also my simply nature peanut butter powder with cocoa this just has way better macros than normal peanut butter and you're still getting the taste for two tablespoons 45 calories 1 gram of fat 6 grams of carbs and 4 grams of protein let's get this makin alright let's get this bad boy on the road so I'm just gonna take my magic bullet and I don't really measure a little thing I think I've measured them enough to know about what it is do this much and then we're gonna take our bananas then you put your bananas in there next we're going to do our cage muscle Micra pure whey protein isolate of course just a little tips when you're making protein shakes or any kind of smoothie always put in your wet ingredients first otherwise we're just gonna get this all stuck to the bottom you do those are gain straight sick games coming out of the stuff then we're gonna do 2 tablespoons of the simply nature peanut butter powder with cocoa glass ourselves some some and off I love cinnamon so we're gonna go right there and now we're just gonna stick this on here stick it on the magic bullet and then we're gonna have a delicious snack and I'm so excited I definitely already start drinking it in a shake I just added more water and enjoy it it's so good this will hold me over till dinner and I'll have one more meal and then it's bedtime and here is my Center I literally exhausted it is 9 o'clock at night and I just wasn't feeling like eating so I have just four ounces of eggs a little bit of hot sauce aside salt and pepper and pepperidge farm ol green bread I'm still under my calories for the day this weekend Michael and I are gonna go see my parents so you know I'm saving up the calories for all the food I'm sure will consume but that's it for the day", "_HdQoneudL8": "14 Fantastically Healthy Foods For Diabetics When you think of managing blood sugar, odds\nare you obsess over everything you can't have. While it's certainly important to limit no-no\ningredients (like white, refined breads and pastas and fried, fatty, processed foods),\nit's just as crucial to pay attention to what you should eat. We suggest you start here.\nNumerous nutrition and diabetes experts singled out these power foods because 1) they're packed\nwith the four healthy nutrients (fiber, omega-3s, calcium, and vitamin D) that make up our Diabetes\nDTOUR Diet, and 2) they're exceptionally versatile, so you can use them in recipes, as add-ons\nto meals, or stand-alone snacks. 1. Beans\nBeans have more to boast about than being high in fiber (plant compounds that help you\nfeel full, steady blood sugar, and even lower cholesterol; a half cup of black beans delivers\nmore than 7 grams). They're a not-too-shabby source of calcium, a mineral that research\nshows can help burn body fat. In \u00bd cup of white beans, you'll get almost 100 mg of calcium\u2014about\n10% of your daily intake. Beans also make an excellent protein source; unlike other\nproteins Americans commonly eat (such as red meat), beans are low in saturated fat\u2014the\nkind that gunks up arteries and can lead to heart disease.\nHow to eat them: Add them to salads, soups, chili, and more. There are so many different\nkinds of beans, you could conceivably have them every day for a week and not eat the\nsame kind twice. 2. Dairy\nYou're not going to find a better source of calcium and vitamin D\u2014a potent diabetes-quelling\ncombination\u2014than in dairy foods like milk, cottage cheese, and yogurt. One study found\nthat women who consumed more than 1,200 mg of calcium and more than 800 IU of vitamin\nD a day were 33% less likely to develop diabetes than those taking in less of both nutrients.\nYou can get these nutrients from other foods, but none combine them like dairy does. Stick\nto fat-free or low-fat versions of your favorite dairy foods\u2014\"regular\" has a lot of saturated\nfat. How to eat it: Drink milk with some meals\ninstead of soda or sugary juices, have yogurt or cottage cheese as a snack or dessert, and\nuse milk to make oatmeal or thicken certain soups. 3. Salmon\nNutritionists can't recommend this seriously healthy fish enough. It's a rich source of\nomega-3 fatty acids (3 ounces provides as much as 1,800 mg), healthy fats that reduce\nthe risk of heart disease, whittle your waistline, reduce inflammation, and improve insulin resistance.\nSalmon is also one of the best nondairy sources of vitamin D around.\nHow to get it: Saut\u00e9 a salmon fillet for dinner instead of chicken or meat once or\ntwice a week (it's easy to season and toss in the oven), or add canned salmon to salads\nor omelets. 4. Tuna\nAnother amazingly healthy fish, a 3-ounce piece of tuna contains 1,300 mg of omega-3s\nand a respectable amount of vitamin D to boot. But tuna can be high in mercury, a compound\nthat may cause neurological problems in huge doses. To be safe, buy canned light tuna instead\nof albacore and limit your tuna intake to 12 ounces a week.\nHow to eat it: Make tuna salad sandwiches, pile on whole wheat crackers as a snack, or\nthrow steaks on the grill instead of burgers. 5. Barley\nOne of the healthiest grains you're probably not eating, barley is rich in a specific kind\nof soluble fiber called beta-glucan. Research shows beta-glucan can lower total and LDL\ncholesterol by preventing your body's ability to absorb it; one review found that consuming\njust 3 grams a day\u2014about the amount in a single barley serving\u2014can lower cholesterol\nby 8%. Thanks to its fiber abundance, barley can also help steady your blood sugar while\nfilling you up\u2014a weight loss bonus. The grain even boasts a modest amount of calcium.\nHow to eat it: Look for hulled barley, which isn't as refined as the pearl barley that\nsupermarkets typically carry (you may need to visit a health food store). Soak it overnight\nbefore cooking, then add to soups, stews, or rice pilaf. 6. Oats\nLike barley and beans, oats are a diabetes power food because of their fiber content\u2014a\nhalf cup of instant oats provides 4 g. Research shows that oat lovers can also lower total\nand \"bad\" LDL cholesterol and improve insulin resistance. All the soluble fiber oats contain\nslows the rate at which your body can break down and absorb carbohydrates, which means\nyour blood sugar levels stay stable. How to eat them: The easiest way is straight\nfrom your cereal bowl, but you can also sneak oats into all kinds of recipes, from pancakes\nto meat loaf to cookies. 7. Berries\nBerries are nature's candy\u2014but unlike sugary confections from the checkout aisle, they're\nloaded with fiber and antioxidants called polyphenols. A cup of blackberries supplies\n7.6 g of fiber; blueberries contain 3.5 g. Berries' antioxidants are also good for your\nticker: One 2008 study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that people with\nheart disease risk factors who ate berries for 8 weeks had a drop in blood pressure and\na boost in \"good\" HDL cholesterol. How to eat them: Wonderful alone, berries\nare also tasty when stirred into oatmeal, ice cream, or even salads. Fresh berries freeze\nwell, so if you're not going to eat them right away, store them in your freezer so you always\nhave some on hand. 8. Dates\nThese chewy fruits aren't much to look at\u2014plain and brown and a little sticky. But pop one\nin your mouth and you'll be rewarded with a sweet taste and delightful texture. Their\npalate-pleasing nature, combined with a generous supply of fiber (7 dates supply 4 g), makes\nthem a perfect diabetes-friendly snack. They're also jam-packed with antioxidants\u2014with more\nper serving than grapes, oranges, broccoli, and peppers, according to one study.\nHow to eat them: Stuff dates with pecan or walnut halves for a satisfying snack, or toss\nthem into breads and cookies. 9. Greens\nYou're probably thinking of lettuce, but this category of veggie\u2014a staple of Southern\ncooking\u2014is incredibly diverse, with choices such as turnip, mustard, and beet greens,\nas well as chard. All are outstanding sources of fiber (1 cooked cup of any of the aforementioned\nsupplies between 3 and 6 g) and calcium (100 to 250 mg per cup). Greens may also be good\nfor your heart, thanks to the folate they contain. This B vitamin appears to lower levels\nof homocysteine, an amino acid that in high amounts can raise heart disease risk. Research\nshows getting 400 mcg of folate a day can lower homocysteine by 25% (a cup of cooked\nturnip greens contains 170 mcg). How to eat them: Unless you've grown up with\ngreens, you may consider them an acquired taste, but prepared just right, they're delicious!\nUse them in entr\u00e9es, sandwiches, and salads. Or simply toss mustard, collard, or beet greens\nwith artichoke hearts and saut\u00e9 in olive oil. 10. Lentils\nLike their bean cousins, lentils are loaded with fiber\u20141 cup cooked contains a whopping\n16 g. That same cup also delivers close to 360 mcg of folate, just shy of the 400 that\nadults need each day. If you're not a meat person, lentils are a good alternative source\nof protein; they also contain a variety of vitamins and minerals.\nHow to eat them: Add to soups and pastas for extra texture, or enjoy as a side dish in\nlieu of beans. Feeling more adventurous? Try a spicy Indian dish that uses lentils as a\nstaple ingredient, like tadka dal, made with green chiles and garlic. 11. Flaxseed\nThey may be tiny, but the seeds of the flax plant pack a big health punch. Flaxseed is\nbest known as a source of fiber and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which your body converts to omega-3s\nEPA and DHA. In several large studies, researchers have found a link between increased ALA intake\nand lower odds of heart disease, heart attack, and other cardiovascular issues. These magic\nseeds also show promise for lowering cholesterol and blood sugar.\nHow to eat them: Add ground flaxseed to all kinds of food, such as oatmeal, low-fat cottage\ncheese, and fruit smoothies. 12. Walnuts\nJust 1 ounce of these healthy nuts (about 14 halves) delivers almost 2 g of fiber plus\n2.6 g of ALA, the omega-3 precursor. But you get about 185 calories in that same ounce,\nso count out a proper portion if you're watching your weight.\nHow to eat them: Aside from a stand-alone snack, chopped walnuts make a great topping\nfor salad and add a bit of crunch to cookies and brownies. 13. Runner-Up: Peanut butter\nBelieve it or not, some studies have linked peanut butter to reduced diabetes risk. The\nfiber content (2 tablespoons has almost 2 g) may have something to do with it. And since\nthis classic comfort food contains mostly monounsaturated fat, it's considered heart\nhealthy. The calories are on the high side, however, so pay attention to the serving size. 14. Runner-Up: Dark chocolate\nRich in antioxidant flavonoids, this deceptively decadent sweet may help improve your good\nand bad cholesterol and reduce your blood pressure. One ounce contains 136 calories\nand 8.5 g of fat, so nibble just a little. A great combination: shaved or melted dark\nchocolate over raspberries or strawberries for a light and healthy dessert.", "PKcaRhymD2M": "[Music] it's going on guys thank you for watching with Halloween over now I wanted to make a video to talk to you guys about the five candies that I would stay away from that I know all of you're gonna have stocked up in your kitchen because what do we do in America we over by people don't mind overspending on Halloween candy because why you get to nosh on it for the next month and what that goes into the holidays Thanksgiving you got Christmas New Year's and that's why people gain so much weight Halloween is the kickstart to that it's totally cool to indulge in your cravings for sweets once in a while as long as you're balancing your lifestyle but what do we do a lot of we over eat because these things don't keep us full for fun size candy especially you can't just have one but it's easy to kind of get carried away eating these things because they're fun size because you know you feel like you're just having oh a small portion of it when it's six wrappers later and you're like what did I just do my stomach hurts so let's get into it the five candies that I would stay away from starting right now number five is going to be M&Ms notice and even in a big bag of M&Ms not a lot comes in there I mean they're easy to eat they're very very small it's a cheap made milk chocolate what really gets me is the artificial coloring on the outside now I'm going to read you guys the ingredient list milk chocolate alright and then it goes into a parenthesis of what the milk chocolate is made of sugar chocolate skim milk cocoa butter lactose milk fat soy lecithin salt artificial flavour sugar cornstarch and then we get the less than 1% of love that corn syrup dextran coloring now this is the big thing here which is why I'm a nemesis number five members blue one late yellow six red forty yellow five blue one red forty Lake blue two Lake yellow six-link blue two and gum akasha it's a lot of lakes can't go crazy on these things because at the end of the day the truth is it's a lot of artificial coloring and we know artificial flavors and colors they're a detriment to our health definitely something you can intelligent once in a while if you want to satisfy a sweet craving I'm not shaming candy here but eating these things in moderation is best number four we got Reese's Pieces now Reese's Pieces don't even contain chocolate guys riddle me that why don't they contain chocolate if it's chocolate and peanut butter is what makes up a Reese's so Reese's Pieces to me seemed pretty fishy just in that aspect like M&Ms they're artificially colored on the outside as well we all know that Reese's are amazing it sucks because they're obviously not healthy for us and they cause weight gain but let me read you what's in Reese's Pieces though because there's no milk chocolate and that's pretty weird to me we got sugar partially defatted peanuts partially defatted peanuts partially hydrogenated vegetable oil which in parentheses has palm kernel and soybean oil reduced minerals way corn syrup artificial color in parentheses we got the Lynx yellow five lake red 40 lake yellow six lake blue one lake salt resinous glaze soy lecithin modified cornstarch carnauba wax vanillin vanillin artificial flavor as we know about ingredient lists the first thing that's on the list is what it's made up of most and in this it's sure and then partially defatted peanuts which I guess makes up the peanut butter but well jumps out to me are the lakes and that's just a common thing for me I just feel like the artificial coloring is what really causes me to steer away from certain candies that's why these things are making my list now that Halloween is over let's not reach in the candy jar for mmm so much more Reese's Pieces due to the fact that contains so many GMOs from sugar and soy and also so many artificial flavors and colors the watermelon sour patch kids are definitely something that's popular definitely some that's tasty but you know if you eat too much of these things your tongue feels like someone just took a sandpaper and scraped every taste bud off that's basically how I felt in the past after eating you know too many of the sour patch watermelons so I know the watermelons the regular sour patch kids we all like that sweet and sour type taste the thing about sour patch kids are full of artificial colors so you don't like artificial we don't like GMOs giving you the Reds the greens the crazy colors of the rainbow the biggest ingredient is sugar and then we got in Reverse sugar corn syrup corn syrup high fructose corn syrup that's a terrible type of shelf-life ingredient that causes things to last over a long amount of time that causes a lot of problems for a body when consumed in excess modified corn starch a citric acid we got tartaric acid which actually gives you that sour taste which is found in wine grapes so it's probably something that's not that bad for you it's not something that would like raisin red flag to me because it comes from a naturally occurring organic compound natural and artificial flavors what's natural in there tell me what I'd rather know what's natural like what do they mean by natural and then we got titanium dioxide so titanium dioxide is found in paint it's found in cosmetics we got things that go into paint and cosmetics and candies that kids are eating we're eating I think I saw something way back about how paint is in cereal so I'm sure it's used in a bunch of other shelf life foods just like when we eat too much cinnamon toast crunch like you would put your tongue and run it across the roof of your mouth it gets like gritty I don't know how it's not a best way to say it I don't know I'm guessing and trying to put you know two and two together that that's probably one of the reasons why our mouths you know get different feelings from eating the certain things that are in this because we're not supposed to be eating them we got red 40 yellow 5 and blue one so more artificial colors sour patch watermelons number three of my list of the Halloween candies we should stay away from after Halloween skittles sugar corn syrup hydrogenated palm kernel oil and then we got the less than 2% of citric acid tapioca dextran modified corn starch natural and artificial flavors and then we got the artificial colors red 40 Lake titanium dioxide red 40 yellow 5 lake yellow 5 yellow 6 lake yellow 6 lake is a good lake to go to in the summer with your family I've been going there for the past 10 years do a lot of banana boating it's a lot of fun yellow 6 blue 2 Lake blue one blue one Lake sodium citrate and we got carnauba wax to give you a little insight on carnauba wax it's also found in paint just like titanium dioxide also found in some household cleaning products and this is what they're putting in candy I mean that right there is enough for me to just say no and I just can't believe that they're pushing this to little kids think about a kids growing body that's eating candy that has things in it that going to paint that go into cleaning products you might as well just take a thing of Windex and just spray your mouth as your candy fix alright so we made it to the number one candy I want you guys to stay away from post-halloween know I could have put skittles right here easily could have put skills right here but once you hear what's in this candies ingredients you're going to realize why it's number one candy corn candy corn has 12 ingredients and it's got 4 different types of sweeteners sugar corn syrup dextrose and honey that's a lot of sugar guys for one little piece of candy it's also got all those food dyes in it the same thing that's been going with this whole list yellow 6 yellow 5 and red 3 I just you know I keep reading these things and they got all these like weird yellow 5 yellow 6 blue late one that's the problem I mean like no one really thinks about what's in these foods in these candies in yellow 6 in yellow 5 have caused tumor growth in animal testing so I mean if these things are carcinogenic and we're eating them and I don't want you guys to be alarmed but I'm just saying if it's happening in animals you know it's something that you have to think about when you're going to grab these types of candies to be eating candy corn isn't vegan and it's not even vegetarian it's made with traces of animal hides and bones which make up gelatin another reason why you just don't even have candy corn the vegans can't even enjoy it confectioners glaze comes from this thing called lap resin which is like a Lac bug it's this red bug from Asia that they use I guess blue one more color dyes all this stuff is just stuff that I would really not have so much of after Halloween especially other candies too I'm sure there can be a whole list of 50 candies that we could talk about that probably aren't good for us but I wanted to really spotlight the color dyes and the artificial flavoring that goes into these candies because not only are those ingredients bad for us but it's whatever else is going into them as well titanium dioxide the carnauba wax all that stuff that's used in household cleaners and paints so it's all kind of hand in hand with this list as far as what is in these candies and why there's someone healthy for us if we eat way too much of it if you want to enjoy sweets you want to enjoy things like candy regardless of what candy it is just make sure you're someone who's eating a healthy diet as well if you're someone who doesn't you smoke cigarettes you drink alcohol you eat fast food and you're eating candy and you know potato chips a lot of processed foods obviously you're going to be having an unhealthy diet and your body is going to show you that that does it for my list guys with Halloween now over you're gonna have a lot of candy at your disposal so try to keep it in mind when you're reaching over the next couple months let's not just keep it for January and say all in January I'll start worrying about my diet let's think about it right now especially with what's gonna be happening with food in all of our lives over the next months and if you guys are looking for healthier types of sweets it's always good to check out recipes that are made with natural ingredients especially the one I just made pumpkin spice protein balls I'll have that at the end of the video as a side you can click on but what are the types of candies would you guys be having instead of these candies were there any type of candies that I missed that are still terrible for us that you would have put on your list let me know in the comments below also don't forget to subscribe for more content and for another video my name is Brett Kap thank you guys so much for watching I'll see you next time [Music]", "fSGq7yNpGmM": "alright guys it is Kearney the next day and today I thought I kind of shared you guys exactly how I track my calories americo's on an app on my phone called My Fitness Pal so if you're brand new to tracking your calories or americo's and you have absolutely no idea how to do it this is the video for you because I'm going to show you guys exactly how I do it on my phone so honestly you just give you guys some context I've been doing this for I don't know how many years exactly but I've been doing it since ok I don't really feel comfortable saying this but I've been doing this since I was in grade 9 so I think I was like 14 years old then so yeah honestly like I do not recommend you guys to start when you're that young when you're that young obviously just enjoy your life eat whatever you want to eat unless you're obviously like obese but honestly you should not worry about tracking calories or macros ever that young however I do feel like it's a good life scald a half especially in the long term because obviously you don't want to be tracking every single thing you eat for the rest of you like however if you just know how many calories are in certain foods and kind of set yourself up to kind of eat intuitively for the rest of your life so again it's such a great life skill to have just kind of get used to it do this for like maybe one to two weeks then after that just kind of like eyeball things such as what I've been doing ever since and I seen great results so anyway I'm gonna show up now and let's get into it alright guys now the two things you need to know before you start tracking your calories are matter coats are number one you need to obviously know how many calories and microbrews you need per day because if you don't know that then it's like what are you doing and secondly you need a food skill I mean you can probably use like measuring cups these twelve words probably not that accurate so using a electric food scale definitely helped out a lot and there's only like 15 bucks at Walmart so definitely it's a great investment to make well alright so we've got the skill right here we're gonna put the bowl on top and now let's open up our pad MyFitnessPal app so it has breakfast lunch dinner snack so I just go for breakfast and now what I like to do is for like any meats I pre cook my chicken breasts I pre cook whatever meat I have then I'll just basically wade out precooked so basically you just go into search and search chicken breasts how about mine on warm on it so let's see there's Walmart chicken breast so I like to go for 100 grams so one on igano chicken breast is 107 companies we're just about right so what we're gonna do is basically we're gonna grab our chicken breasts know with the ball on top we're gonna put the scale on on Justin outside the zero right basically over gotta do is just some chicken breasts until we're just 100 grams so when our bread 3165 99 grams now with the chicken breasts I'm gonna be adding 200 grams of precooked rice so again jameth the chicken i precooked my rice as well so basically just going to MyFitnessPal this is what my your eyes so look for a pre cooked basmati rice and just look for it for 200 grams and just add that into your scale so we're gonna put the skill back to zero so now it's back to zero now we can out rice 172 one of you six about 200 grams of rice right here so that's super simple super easy way to track your chicken Reisman all right set it up the meal right here so 200 amps of rice and 100 mg of chicken breast everything is precooked and now if you look at the calories and macros of this meal 370 calories 25 grams of protein 61 grams of carbs and 3 grams of fats quick little solid pre-workout meal so I'm gonna eat this then we're gonna head over to the gym and yeah that's right okay so on my way to the gym or no and I'm actually gonna go stop by a supplement store because I heard of her knee they got the new HTML so pre workout and I heard a lot of good things about them so quickly drive over there and see what they got okay updates so I've pretty much been looking for like 10 15 minutes and I haven't found it so like I'm just sitting outside of parking lots just outside of the gym so I'm yeah I may have to go in there with no free workout which kind of sucks because I was expecting to have some stimulants inside of my body but I don't have any so that kind of sucks but I'm also sitting next to a grocery store so I may go in there maybe pick up some weird cheap pre-workout which doesn't really sound that good but anyway I'm trying to work out with no pre-workout that's okay that we're selling that smash it so let's go alright so I just came back from the mall and basically the social oh my phone exactly where it was because I didn't want to pay for stupid cheap Walmart the pre-workout so I kind of know where it is right now I'm not - sure but anyway we're gonna keep searching because I am determined to find that sore and get the pre-workout because like I kind of like I just want to do it man so we're gonna keep jamming keep searching for it and we will find it mission accomplished we got the pre workouts the pre HD and he gave me a free stringer bag and a shaker dollar shaker bodies mutant clubs were just pretty a nice gesture so sick anyway this is what I came here for the pre HD looks so so you got the sour gummy ther because I've heard a lot of good things about this you guys know I'm not a big fan of like supplement stimulants whatever but honestly like you gotta try it man so I never gonna try this one out right now now we're gonna finally go into the gym but I can open this thing okay this is pissing me off man open there we go okay why is this such a difficult task this is what's inside it smells pretty good so I was like sour gummies a scoop is pretty big like that's pretty big for a scoop so I'll definitely only be doing half about that so yeah that's going in here shake this sucker up dust not really good that's good really good so anyway drink this now all to the gym [Music] you want to get on with it breaking through that smoking is poppin trust see clear [Music] all right so the workout is done just did a poll workout so back and biceps and a bit of rear delts as well so now I'm gonna go back home I need some food oh and one more thing about the pre workouts okay to be honest the taste wasn't that good like it really wasn't was a bit like bitter didn't really have that I don't know if I mixed too much water in it or I put too much pre-workout in it I don't know just the taste wasn't it was a bit off its own seat and probably like five out of ten to be honest and I don't know what it was but I didn't really feel it it's like I took one scoop and I probably should have taken two which was I think the recommended serving size but either way it didn't really feel it that much which kind of sucks but yeah whatever poor guy so post-workout I'm craving something sweet so I'm gonna be making a protein shake here's how all right so you'll need is milk protein powder and frozen bananas now when it comes to foods that already have food they will zone them like as you can see here so for this kind of milk one serving this one cup we're just 250 millilitres that's pretty easy to measure so all you got to do for the liquid you can definitely use mic measuring cups for consistency I'm still gonna be using my food skills so really simple again all you got to do is just put your blender on top of the scale and then turn it on so now it's at zero right you know we got to do is just have 250 millilitres Oh No so I'll stop what if it's 250 I know when it comes to bananas you still got red bananas because obviously they're all in different sizes some are obviously bigger than others this is obviously bigger than this one for example guys keep in mind I don't do this every day I'm not too picky when it comes to these kind of things about just for an example to show you guys this is how you do it properly so we'll take one of our slogans banana so that's a pretty big one to be honest see how much it weighs a brilliant piece s so it blends easier holy that banana is 163 grams us a lot because a normal sized banana would be like 100 220 grams so that was pretty big protein powder guys these scoops a serving size for protein powder is obviously one scoop so it's here one scoop is 25 grams so if we measure that properly all right so this is about one scoop let's see if it's actually 25 grams because often it's usually a lot more so let's see that single scoop was 30 grams and set up 25 grams so yeah keep that in mind so anyway that's all you need really you can have like cinnamon or vanilla extract which have no calories so you can do that if you wanted to but I'll be gonna do nellis blend it up and drink it one by the way these flavor jumps I go from my protein as well and are absolutely delicious I got the vanilla flavor and easily gonna have zero calories so you can definitely put this in like your oatmeal your coffee or tea pretty much anything you want to sweeten up so yeah that's good let's blend it up also you can have some ice if you want to like make it like more volumous Paragon so as you can see this could probably make like two of these classes so yeah a lot of volume in the shake which is really nice if you're trying to lose weight because obviously it'll make you feel full with not a lot of calories so yeah scoop that taste test that's really good I used two salted caramel flavor from my protein that's so sweet so it definitely goes well on the shake but I mean anyway I'm gonna enjoy this and then see you in the next meal okay so these are all the ingredients you will need to make a super good sandwich so this is gonna be a tuna sandwich and they got some of this thread from Mayo pickles sriracha cilantro and - nose - all right so for this red pepper one serving which is 75 grams 210 calories longer methods 42 carbs 7 grams of protein so I'm gonna be using the rest of this bread so what you can do is actually a barcode right here which you can scan on my fitness ball so let me show you all right so obviously you're gonna be opening up my Fitness Hall again let it load so this is gonna be dinner go to dinner and that will top the barcode scanner thing try to scan it there you go see that matches up I mean it's like most of this stuff is gonna be kinda off most of the time but honestly like as long as you are consistent the inconsistent that's all that matters so basically it says for 75 grams is 210 calories that see how heavy this is let's go right here on top that's 152 grams for that so we're gonna put in 152 which is about 477 calories so yeah alright guys so this cameras about the dice so I hope I can finish this really quick so basically what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna drain this tuna is so I'm gonna be using the full count which is 120 calories then I'm just gonna be adding a little bit of this which has minimal calories and then once service of this mayonnaise which has 40 [Music] or goes I apologize my camera died there stupid sorry but I mean I'm gonna show you guys my last and final meal we're just gonna be my bowl of oatmeal and so yeah let's get into it so we got some oatmeal right here per half a cup 40 grams there's only 50 calories so we're gonna be doing two servings which is 80 grams Feenie gram just gonna be adding some water to that about that much and I've got some salt and now essentially all that salt really does it doesn't make the oatmeal salty just enhances the flavor so I definitely recommend you guys adding salt to your oatmeal because it just brings the flavor to life especially if you have like sweetness so like honey protein powder whatever alright so once the old meal is finished I'm gonna be adding one serving of these frozen blueberries so again really easy to poke on the back of the label and they'll see calories America lives right over here so for one serving hundred and forty grams I'm actually gonna be using half of a serving probably like 70 grams because that's a lot these are just serving sizes you don't have to follow exactly your serving size because sometimes they're a lot more than you want and sometimes they're less than you want so don't you just do it depending on what your calories and macros are because of course everyone's are gonna be different these are just like you recommend it serving sizes which I'm sure no one Falls but that's just a good guide to follow so we'll be adding ones through this salted-caramel protein powder so this is like a normal scoop and normal person would take right well let's see how much does this know twenty-five actually okay yeah last time I probably use too much but yeah both the serving is about 25 grams which is what they say right over there as well so yeah all right so now that the oatmeal is mixed all together one final and really important thing I want to show you guys is this peanut butter so how do you track peanut butter so per serving this 15 grams I'm gonna be using 30 grams with how do you measure that I'm gonna show you guys right now before I used to track my calories americo's I used to look at the back of this table and say for one tablespoon this 90 calories so I thought to myself okay one tablespoon this is how much I'd actually use right as I can double tablespoon that's about the tablespoon right it's like pretty normal however if you look at the skill right now it is 34 grams which is well over two servings so just a little bit of this it's two servings so yeah just keep that in mind guys and so that's how I would recommend you guys to actually measure any peanut butter jams nut butters whatever is to put your peanut butter on the scale put it on zero and then basically use the negative amount so if it's a negative thirty and they said you took 30 grams out of it so yeah there's a quick little tip for you guys want to be putting this into here all right so this is the final meal of the day and I'm gonna gather some cinnamon on top which is zero calories by the way so that's gonna wrap up the entire video I hope this video made sense you guys I hope you guys took something out of it because honestly it's pretty simple especially after you've done it for a while so honestly if you've never done before I would highly recommend you guys to try it for at least maybe a week or two just to get the hang of it learn about the calories of Marko's learn about the serving sizes learn about how many calories certain foods have learn about like just all these kinds of things and it's really important because once you know this you'll know it for the rest of your life and they're just really important to know especially when you're going out to eat out to restaurants to parties and you just look at something and say oh that has about 500 calories and oh this has like 300 calories let me go for a lower calorie option just like making Goods wise food options while going out to eat whatever is a great life skill to house so anyway I sincerely hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please be sure

i have my organic spinach all nice and clean and fresh here is my package super green blend also have blueberries tomatoes olives cucumber apples onions and feta cheese so here's also my packs for the blueberries and tomato also in the salad strawberries is so so good i would have added strawberries but i actually did not have any you can add hard-boiled eggs chicken [Music] anything that you need sorry that's my birth but don't be as scared of the fruit in the salad because i'm telling you it is honestly so so so good like literally it's delicious so i'm just gonna start i'm gonna throw the olives in there then i'm gonna go ahead and put tomatoes make sure obviously my hands are clean guys i already washed my we're going to add our blueberries we're just going to put all our ingredients in here nicely already chopped everything up real nice so it's easy for us okay and the salad is so good for your body it's going to kick your weight loss journey you're going to literally detox all the bad food you ate with the salad it's gonna make you like you're gonna have high energy high fuel highly nutrified after the salad i'm telling you ladies and then this salad right here if you don't like salad give this fruit salad a try fruit and veggies go together i'm telling you it's god's gift to us it's not weird i'm telling you it's so good and then the feta we're just gonna crumble it like this on the top okay so delicious it's literally so good put all our final ingredients in there [Music] but okay i like to season it a little bit of salt not too much just a tiny bit of salt a little bit of parsley and the regular mix right and then i would also add some black pepper but we don't have any black pepper so i'm not gonna add that right now okay guys and then i'm gonna show you how i make my dressing the dressing is very simple this is a very healthy salad you don't want to ruin it with a heavy dressing we don't want the ranch we don't want any of those highly highly sodium they have a lot of salt in them so we're just going to keep it very simple with our dressing and i will show you guys exactly how i make it just give me one second okay guys so we're starting off with just some olive oil this is about three four tablespoons so the olive oil we're also going to add a little bit more salt and a little bit more of that parsley [Music] and oregano then the most important and it's so good on your salad we're gonna need some lemon juice this is gonna make your salad topped here this is so good if if i had a whole lemon i would use it but i only have this tiny piece right now get all the juices out squeeze it really good you don't want anything to go to waste okay get all those juices out and then mix it up guys this is our dressing we do not need anything else if you like vinegar add a little bit of vinegar for me it's too strong so i like the lemon it's perfect for me then we're gonna just pour this all up in our salad and give it a good mix i'm not gonna pour this just yet just because i am um this salad is for later on and i don't want it to get soggy so also another tip if you are not gonna eat the salad right now always just keep your dressing on the side or cut your lemon leave it on the side and when you're ready to eat that salad squeeze that lemon juice put that oil so delicious guys i'm telling you okay i'm gonna mix this up and i'll be back with our next meal don't be scared to try to mix it up even with the feta cheese like sweet and salty it is so delicious guys i'm telling you okay give this one a try okay guys so for our next meal we're having salmon with broccoli moving on to salmon i put the salmon i seasoned it up both sides salt pepper oregano garlic parsley red pepper flakes cayenne and topped it off with pure honey from greece if you have pure organic honey that works too or if you just have maple syrup that works too whatever you got in your cabinet you can make it work so i'm gonna go ahead and pop this in the oven also if i had lemons i would drizzle lemon all over this and put some lemons in here while it's baking but i don't have any more lemons that was my last lemon i used for the salad so that's okay we're gonna make do but if you do have lemons go ahead and put that in here too it's gonna be so delicious guys so this is what we're having for dinner okay and i'm gonna show you guys how to go ahead and cook the broccoli now so just pop this right into the oven and you're ready to go honey [Music] all right guys after you see it's going to look like this it's getting a little crispy

[Music] you", "qBm24779au4": "the no fake channel checking in and during this historic time in our lives this unprecedented experience both here in the United States and across the world I know so many of my subscribers so many of you watching this video are absolutely just stressed to say the least you're not sleeping enough at night you're worried both about your finances and about your health I know so many of you who are searching for ways to boost your immune system there are companies out there trying to take advantage of that I'm trying to market false false you know cures so to speak so I thought today would be a good day to take a step back go back to basics and that's why on today's episode of the supplement review I am reviewing nutri BIOS newest formula their newest version of their beloved men's multi sport multivitamin [Music] on this series I review was supplement every episode to help you decide if it is right for your fitness goals your health needs and most importantly that hard-earned money during this chaotic time at for lack of a better term during this unprecedented time so many of you are looking for ways to boost your immune system to make sure that it is functioning at 100% and I think it's time that we all take a step back and make sure that we are just doing the fundamental things that we need to do to make sure that our health is as good as possible number one make sure that you're getting enough good quality sleep number two make sure that you are taking in enough water every day you should be trying to target one gallon and number three make sure that you were taking a proper mens multivitamin a year ago I review this top tier nutri bio men's multi-sport multivitamin and I loved it what do they do they made it better they put out a new version that is better than the previous version so I thought it'd be a great time to review it this thing is shocked with over 30 vitamins and minerals we're not going to go through all of them I'm just gonna go through a few key ones for those of you worried about your immune system nutri BIOS men's multi-sport has you covered 400 milligrams of vitamin C 1600 international units of d3 15 milligrams of zinc and a full spectrum of B vitamins it also has a number of powerful antioxidants including alpha lipoic acid and n-acetyl al cytosine for those of you who are stressed looking to clear away those mental cobwebs and improve that brain function nutria bio has Innes tall silica and choline bitter trait nutria BIOS men's multi-sport does two things that puts it on a completely different playing field than all the other multivitamins out there first it cares about absorption oftentimes with those box store tablets that you get it you get you you take them you think you're getting what's on the back of the label but your body's not absorbing those ingredients as we know with your paycheck it's not what you make it's what you keep and nutria bio knows this and they take that extra step they'll go they go the extra mile first and foremost they use the veggie caps that allows it to digest not only easier in your stomach but it allows your body to absorb more of those vitamins also new Chi bio uses the best versions of the vitamins possible keep in mind a lot of those cheaper multivitamins out there they specifically use versions of ingredients that are cheaper even though they know your body is going to have an extremely tough time absorbing those ingredients and another thing that nutria bio does is they purposely throw in ingredients that are meant to help your body take in those vitamins to fully absorb them into your body so that you use them fully nutria bio has put five milligrams of bio preen and a hundred milligrams of citrus bioflavonoids two ingredients that are going to help your body absorb those vitamins and minerals the other thing that nutria bio does with all of their supplements that puts them again at a completely different level a completely another playing field is that they make all of their own products here in the United States here in New Jersey they don't outsource it they are made in a GMP facility and they are made in Afghan spected facility and that cannot be said for very many of the other supplements let alone other multivitamins that are on store shelves today on the bottom of every one of nutri bio supplements is a lot number they have third-party testing to ensure what's on the label is in the bottle all you have to do is go to check my subs comm enter that lot number and you will see exactly what was in that lot proving that you're getting what you paid for if you head over to nutria bio comm you can pick up their men's multi-sport multivitamin for 90 cents per serving with my code no fate 24/7 then I get you 10% off of everything at nutria bio comm and it does help out this channel overall keep in mind one serving is four pills so ideally you're gonna take two pills in the morning with breakfast and two pills in the evening with dinner overall I want you to just stick to the fundamentals get your sleep drink your water stay calm and make sure you're taking your multivitamins if

every parent out there", "IGx0rN9YszI": "welcome to life habit week five okay this is where it gets really fun because I know that you're experiencing results because you've been following the program consistently this is my friend Betty Phillips and when she first started commit to fit three weeks and she checked in with me and she was so excited because she had lost 14 pounds and she was down two dress sizes and the first three weeks of commit to fit so I just thought I'd share those results there so many more oh my goodness I just wish I could share them all with you but I know that you're doing very very well so we're going to keep on moving okay what we're going to do for this habit this is the assignment to add omega-3 fats why are we going to do this okay omega-3 fats are essential for an overwhelming number of physical processes including weight management a lot of people don't know that's necessary to lose weight so how much omega-3 fat do I need to add 1,000 milligrams per day and that really is a minimum dietary fat 101 here's a little lesson on fat okay there's three main types of fat here that i'm going to point out there saturated fat and that's the fat from animals there's trans fats which are processed fat so they're manipulated chemically in production and then there's healthy fats from vegetables and fish so you might not have known that there's different types of fats but now you do so saturated fat from animals would be like cheese milk butter and beef all animal sources and then trans fats the process fats are partially hydrogenated shortening and that's in many many packaged foods margarine is a trans fat it's processed and deep fat fried foods also now healthy fats are omega-6 fats and omega-3 fats and I'm going to share a little bit more on those in a minute but here's the overall goal we want to decrease the amount of saturated fat that we have from animal fats we want to totally avoid trans fats those are definitely the worst to put in our bodies and so we're going to avoid those all together and then we're going to increase the healthy fats okay so we'll make a six of fats versus Omega 3 fats these are the healthy fats from vegetables and from fish and i want to show you here where we can get this high levels of omega-6 fatty acids are mainly found in vegetable sources and are essential for health high levels of omega-3 fatty acids are mainly found in fatty fish like salmon albacore halibut and in a few plant-based foods like flaxseed oil and walnuts now this is what I want to show you the ratio of how much omega-6 we have versus how much omega-3 we have is very important ideally we want a one-to-one ratio or two to one meaning just about the same amount of omega-6 as we have as omega 3 and the ratio that's in our body really determines the overall benefit that we're getting and we want that race should be pretty even so in Japan if you look at their health and we all know this a very healthy country and they have very very few problems in comparison to America Japan has a 2.82 a one on the omega-3 omega-6 ratio okay so they're just about even little heavier on the omega-6 the United States is 10 to 1 we have a lot of omega-6 and very very very little omega-3 we want that ratio to be more even and so the omega-6 is for the most part people are getting those through vegetable sources and other sources but it's the omega-3 is that we're going to concentrate on for this life habit so the average intake of omega-3 today is less than a hundred milligrams so what do we need to do we need to add omega-3 fats okay i want to point out AdvoCare product called o megaplex this is a great source of omega-3 fatty acids I love taking this it's so easy to swallow this because ideally I'm probably not going to be eating fish every day that's probably not very realistic for most people but if you do eat fish every day that's great but o megaplex is a great option now you can pull this information sheet off of advocare calm under their product frequently asked section and also under the product list in the store online and they're going to let you read through this but it's a great great source of omega-3 is very easy to get that in our bodies and you can read more about why omega-3s are so important you know they found that it can be connected to so many things like depression and just a lot of different things that we need to make sure we have omega-3s in our body because it's doing more for us than we even realize so this is what we're going to do we're going to choose from the following omega-3 healthy fats walnuts flaxseed oil flaxseed fatty fish like salmon halibut and herring and albacore egg yolks with omega-3 you'll have to look at the label to see if they've added omega-3 to them once they've been raised with omega-3 and then the omega-3 supplements so two capsules is equivalent to a thousand milligrams and megaplex is a very inexpensive product it's 29 cents per serving which is great in comparison to food that's very inexpensive now trans fats you remember these is the ones we would totally want to avoid well there's your picture fried foods hydrogenated fats that's found in processed foods like crackers process peanut butter like the Skippy peanut butter you see up there other nutritional bars coffee creamers and these are fats that are solid at room temperature that's another way to look at it to an animal fats are solid at room temperature as well but so are the trans fats then there's margarine shortening pastries muffins cakes pies processed cheese's most chips and most crackers have trans fats you just have to read the label and find out we want to avoid these trans fats so check the labels for partially hydrogenated fats that is the word right there that phrase that you're looking for and so you look here at the animal crackers they look pretty innocent but when you go through the ingredient list you see partially hydrogenated oil that means that that's a trans fat its processed so we want to avoid a food that would have this on the ingredient list now moving to the saturated fats from animals that's what you see here and basically just a reminder that we're limiting this ok we're going to limit how much animal fat we get in our body so here's how we're going to make it happen start by throwing out foods that contain trans fats that are in your home right now go through the cabinets refrigerator freezer pantry and all other places that you keep food and don't forget about the car and at work number two we want to grocery shop for a few different omega-3 fat sources of your choice number three if you take low megaplex supplements you can count 20 megaplex pills as your omega-3 serving just a reminder here in your metabolic nutrition system that you're taking and that's the strip of pills the vitamins the very last one that's a clear yellow dots Oh megaplex so you're getting one when you take metabolic nutrition system and two would be a full quota for the day for suggestions for getting your mega 3 fats would be to add flaxseed oil to your shake or add ground flaxseed because the ground flaxseed is where you're going to get the absorption of the omega-3s flaxseed just not ground up is not going to be as effective then use flaxseed oil on your salads and also cooked vegetables add walnuts to your salads or eat a handful as part of a meal and then salmon fillets are available at most grocery stores okay so here's how we get our point we're going to at one point if you eat one serving a thousand milligrams of omega-3 fat every single day or you can use a megaplex supplements and get your point okay so whether it's the supplements or through food you get your point that way but you don't get a point if you do not eat one serving which is a thousand milligrams of omega-3 fats or if you eat a trans fat food which is a partially hydrogenated fat or fried foods you lose your point so anytime that we eat any sort of trans fat or hydrogenated food or fried food or losing our point for the day okay that's it moving forward I know that we are all on pace here to get great results we'll see you next time", "DO9UorOAm1E": "hello and welcome my name is Jessica Aragona this is the alternative cannabis perspective today we're here at the 2015 shampoo in Las Vegas Nevada I'm about to go talk

stack the deck in your favor [Music]", "pULco-YUuQA": "for this week I decided to do a $25 mil prep for you guys less than $25 that's all you need and these are all the ingredients that you will buy to prepare your meals this is a very healthy and quick and also cheap meal prep so these ingredients I'm gonna put all their benefits and also the prices of each ingredient on the screen for the breakfast option you have a banana kale smoothie with avocados the second option is going to be the oatmeal option which is a protein nut milk and on will mix the third option for breakfast is gonna be a sweet potato and peanut butter toast option so all the these three you cannot exchange it based on what day it is and however you like or if you like the same thing every day then you can also do that for the lunch and dinner you have a lentil stew option and also we have the chicken breast that's gonna be cooked with some ground masala you only need a little bit of this so that one is gonna be the seasoning you will use a light coconut milk and you only need about half a cup of that some diced tomatoes and the can and then you're gonna need poop onions for the whole week you're gonna need two of these each of them have seven servings in them and they're very important to get your micronutrients in carrots you only need about three carrots and for the complex carbs the main sources are gonna be the lentils and the brown rice especially the brown rice we need a little more you can get one more bag of this but this is one pound and serums it has 12 to 13 servings the lentil by itself is a complex car which also is high in protein and from for each day we're gonna get 26 grams of protein per serving just from the lentils and it was just about a dollar all right so this is our all to thinking it pretty much that's it alright for the breakfast option I am gonna do a banana kale smoothie with avocados and the reason I use kale instead of using spinach or other vegetables is because it's higher in protein and fiber one compared to the other vegetables it's also pretty dense on other nutrients when compared to spare others and I also like to use some avocados because it adds creaminess to the smoothie and not only that but it's also pretty high in vitamin E and cake my hair has grown a lot since I started using the smoothie by the way and then another thing I like to do is add the banana to add the sweetness and it's also pretty high in potassium so put it in power just like this and then what you want to do is store it in the fridge and when you're ready to go you can just pull them out and that is pretty much it you're you're good right for the breakfast I like to use half a cup of oats with one cup of protein nut milk with ten gram of protein per serving and from the oats with half a cup of oats you get five gram of protein altogether you get a 15 gram of protein from just one serving of breakfast and what I like to do is microwave for a minute and a half I like to get the quick oats so that they cook faster after you microwave it for one minute and a half what you want to do is steer it and then you're gonna kind of like let it sit for about 30 seconds and put it back for another minute now when you get done make sure that you watching it so that way it doesn't overflow then it should look like this it's nice and creamy and chocolaty and its really tasty and it's got $15 protein per serving all right for the sweet potato toast so basically what you want to do is cut up your sweet potato in such a way I just get one sweet potato I'll get a fat one that is like kind of wide like that so just it's kind of hard to cut them but I mean it's worth it so just cut them like that into pieces and then what you want to do is bake them or you can microwave it so once you have it all ready just go ahead and microwave it or bake it and then you can top it off with anything you want you know you can do peanut butter almond butter some berries avocados tomatoes anything it's just like bread pretty much you knows because it's just a healthier version all right further side I like to do a lentil stew and for this you're gonna need some onions so you want to chop one onion and now put it in there with some carrot carrot is really high in vitamin K and it's really good for your eyesight so what you want to do is add in some black pepper some cumin and you want to let it caramelize in there with some chili and paprika along with some garlic powder as well and you want to do this about ten minutes on low heat and let it simmer this is very important you don't want to skip it because it's gonna flavor the lentils are really good so once you do that what you want to do is go ahead and add in the tomato the tomatoes you can either use regular tomatoes or you can just do the canned one it's only 98 cents so and it's no salt so it's really good and you want to let that simmer while you wash off the lentils and you want to soak them for about two hours at least before you start cooking them lentils are pretty high in protein and they're also really really high in fiber so they're really awesome and they cost only like 98 cents for the whole week so they're really really cheap and they also help you lower your cholesterol so what I do is portion them out like this into containers and there you're good to go for the other side I like to do side of veggies and so I use the $2 bags but you can also get three of the 80 cent bags like the green peas broccoli spinach whatever whatever you like and what you want to do is kind of cook it on the pan like this with some garlic and salts you can also add in some coconut oil and make a stir fry whichever you prefer more and just portion it out like this and so it's ready to go afterwards all right for the chicken I like to chop up some onions and caramelize that with some chili and paprika and the reason why I like to use onions and a lot of my recipes is because they're really good for you they strengthen your immune system and they're also very anti-inflammatory they fight off a lot of infections so they're really awesome you can add in some garlic as well in there if you want and you want to caramelize that for a while with some ground masala and cumin and I was a while that's caramelizing all you want to let it like be there for about 10 minutes on low heat and while that's cooking you can just go ahead and get ready with your tomatoes so the tomatoes I like to use the canned tomato and the reason is because it makes it easier you know you don't have to chop it up or anything like that I just buy the low salt organic Tomatoes and I use that usually I use about 1 cup of that and actually today I have some in the fridge so that's why you see that I'm adding that in there then once I do that I add in my the coconut milk in there you can use the light coconut milk if you want and I cook that with the chicken a little bit and portion it out just like this and you you make basically like twelve servings so these are my two biggest Mills one for lunch and one for dinner or you can have a pre and post your workout it's perfect it's got a really good macros in it and if you're a guy you want to use some brown rice on top of this and added one one cup of brown rice to it and these are the macros these are a few pictures of my clients

snack i've got my bowl of various snacks here i did um a little refill got a couple new things in here but right up top my local store started selling these quest cookies now back in the back in the olden days now back in like you know college post college you know working out doing that sort of stuff then i pretty much relied on quest bars for my actual bar you know protein bar supplement bar and i liked them at the time because one they had interesting flavors two if you wanted to get real crazy and heat them up for like 10 15 seconds in a microwave it actually was kind of nice that way with a couple of them and then three they had the highest protein count in a bar at the time like it was like 24 grams or 25 grams or whatever and that was substantial because everything else on the market was severely less than that and yes i'm not here to debate how many grams of protein your body can process in a normal day's time my point was is that i could get away with maybe eating a bar maybe not doing protein shake blah blah it didn't really matter so anyway quest makes a couple of other products now obviously they have their their protein powder line which i've tried it's fine um they have chips which at some point i'll probably bring on here too but they're they're a little pricey and then cookies so everybody likes a cookie i like a good nice like like crunchy cookie i'm not a huge like soft cookie kind of guy but i do like a nice a nice crunchy cookie that i can dip in milk and i just never had the opportunity to buy them i'm well i've had the opportunity i've just never felt like it but they were in my local store they had a deal on them and i figured hey i'll get two that sound interesting so automatically peanut butter love peanut butter cookies and then the double chocolate chip we're gonna do the peanut butter because peanut butter is awesome so here we go with the peanut butter quest cookie 15 grams of protein one gram of sugar and five net carbs that's the other thing too quest was always um really low on sugar and you know when i when i get a protein powder when i get a bar i don't want a bunch of sugar i want as little sugar as humanly possible i'm eating this as like a post-workout thing and and you know i don't want to pound sugar so here are some of the nutritional facts 220 big calories in that cookie and oh ingredients list is down below if you're interested in that let's go ahead and open this bad boy up kind of looks like a sugar cookie it doesn't have the crossing you know where you take the fork and you cross the peanut butter cookie what are they doing nice underside there that's dense hmm it's interesting um there is something there's something in there that's not quite nice i'm trying to figure out what it is i don't know if i'm going to be able to you know it's not that it's not nice it's that it doesn't feel right in a peanut butter cookie it's almost like cheesecake yeah i don't know i don't know how to describe that i feel like i'm a little bit of a loss for words um i wouldn't buy that again you know it definitely has a lot of peanut butter taste in there but there's something in there that is giving it a strange aftertaste or like a strange kind of like front end taste as you're really chewing into that thing and then there's almost like a fake sugar aftertaste you know like you get with like stevia i'm not gonna relook it might even have stevia in it but yeah i i don't know it it's it's trying to be a peanut butter cookie but it's not quite a peanut butter cookie amazing source of protein and i'm sure that there are a lot of people that would like that for me uh i'm hoping that the double chocolate chip is better that's what i'll say for that um yeah it's a little bit of a letdown but what are you gonna do so anyway folks hopefully you enjoyed please make sure to like comment and subscribe and we will catch you on the next one see ya", "2lV1iBIWhew": "hey everybody welcome to the cannabis kitchen today we're gonna be making like a barbecue baked potato thing [Music] hey gang welcome to a very special episode of the cannabis kitchen today is my anniversary with my girlfriend and i will be making us dinner so about a year and a half ago my girlfriend and i moved from birmingham alabama to kansas city missouri and i was new to alabama when we met and she introduced me to al's loaded bakers which is just like a giant baked potato topped with like all the normal baked potato fixings plus like more and unfortunately we haven't been able to find anything like it in kansas city which has left us with a huge void in our hearts and this is why i've decided to make this very special loaded barbecue fried chicken baker on this very special anniversary episode of the cannabis kitchen now let's do some math to infuse this starchy masterpiece we are going to use an infused sugar which we will make into brown sugar for barbecue sauce and then we're going to top the loaded baked potato off with that barbecue sauce you'll see it's a big giant thing so we're gonna be sharing one baked potato we're gonna be making a barbecue sauce recipe that will make three cups of sauce we will be using one cup of sauce on the baker and so we've decided to go for about 25 milligrams for each of us which means that we're going to need 50 milligrams of thc total in that one cup of sauce which also means that we need 150 milligrams of thc in total for the recipe so i'm going to be using a tincture that i made that contains 100 milligrams of thc per milliliter so i'll be using 1.5 milliliters for this recipe to start you'll need a shallow oven safe dish i really like this little lid for making sugar but as you will see it is not ideal for mixing the sugar and the tincture so maybe do the mixing in a separate bowl and then transfer onto something like this so then next i'm going to put my 1.5 milliliters of tincture into the sugar and start to mix i like to do this with my hands most of the time because a it feels cool and b it lets me feel when everything is evenly saturated with the tincture see this would have been a lot quicker and easier if i had a bigger bolt to mix in but it's okay just jam out and keep going until you get something that resembles wet sand and then once you're done decide that you have too much sugar for this dish and you need a bigger one you don't want the layer to be too thick or the alcohol in the tincture won't evaporate correctly and i didn't really eyeball this the right way so i'm going to go ahead and use this bigger pan and i want to spread my sugar out in a thin even layer and then get into the oven at 225 degrees for about 30 to 45 minutes checking it occasionally so that you don't burn it now the barbecue sauce that we're gonna be making is a thick sort of like kansas city style barbecue sauce that calls for brown sugar and not regular sugar so we're going to need to add some molasses to this now i'm going to add about half a tablespoon of molasses to this and then you have a choice to make should i do it with the spatula or my fingers oh with the spatula with the spatula mix that until the molasses is evenly dispersed throughout the sugar and then it is ready to go into your sauce now i'm going to get my chicken strips ready so i do not like white meat so you are rarely going to catch me cooking with it thigh is a superior cut of meat to the breast and i will die on that hill so now that being said i'm going to debone some thighs i'm going to cut them into strips and now at this point if you want to make a brine and throw your chicken in there for a little while then you can do that at this point but it's not going to ruin everything if you don't i don't want to hear it you chicken snobs yes the brine does make it better but i mean dude it's fried chicken it's delicious just like chill so now i'm going to be taking a little bit of a shortcut here on the baked potato by using the microwave forgiveness please but if you can't stand the idea of it then by all means use the oven so now i'm gonna start by getting four to six potatoes depending on the size so yes it's gonna be huge and excessive i've got to rest it and a few yellows so then you're going to want to find something like this little skewer that i have here and poke holes all over the outside of the tater like all over a lot and then after that you're going to get a considerable amount of butter soft into a bowl and then give all of the taters a nice lather on the outside and let that all those holes soak up that butter so then you're gonna cover it stick it in the microwave in five minute increments until you get a nice soft delicious baked potato now it's time to make the sauce so i'm gonna put about one cup of ketchup and one cup of water into a pot a third of a cup of apple cider vinegar and then i'm gonna add my half a cup of brown sugar that we made half of a chopped onion and two cloves of garlics which i probably should have sauteed a little before but it's gonna be fine then add one tablespoon of molasses and then realize that you didn't push record when you were adding the spices which are celery salt smoked paprika chili powder cayenne black pepper and oregano around like half to a tablespoon's worth each like i don't feel it out see what you think spices should be to your taste anyway so when you hit something that you're like that's really good then that's pride it's probably perfect at that point right so then heat that on medium until it begins to simmer and then reduce to a low heat and then keep it there for about 10 minutes so it'll thicken stir it occasionally but not a lot to bread my chicken i like to do a flour and an egg mix so i start by lightly beating one egg in a bowl for a wash and then i make a flour mixture with about two cups of flour and a tablespoon or two each of salt black pepper cayenne pepper oregano paprika garlic and onion powder and then if you want to throw a little bit of msg in there too that never hurt anybody like literally never heard anybody at all it's fine throw it in and it's awesome it's so good so first i get the chicken strip coated in that flour mix and then into the egg wash then after getting all the excess egg off the strip i transfer it back into the flour and then off to the side of the baking sheet and then i repeat it until the wrong time so next in a deep cast iron pan i'll get about a quarter to a half an inch of peanut oil up to around 375 degrees fahrenheit or about 191 degrees celsius for the rest of you and then i'm gonna fry my chicken for around eight minutes or until the internal temperature is 165 degrees fahrenheit or around 74 degrees celsius and no baked potatoes are going to be complete without bacon bits so into another cast iron pan while my chicken's frying i'm gonna add some i don't have any strips of bacon but i got these chunks of bacon and they're gonna do just fine so all the bacon and the chicken cook i'm gonna shred up some cheddar cheese to put over the top of it and throughout it if i had to call it a cup and a half i don't know just you know it's cheese man do you like cheese or do you not like cheese if you like cheese then make you know do some more if you don't then maybe don't do any but you know do some cheese so now once the bacon and the chicken are done we're going to take them over here and then we're going to cut the chicken up into you know like bite-size-ish pieces somewhere around there whatever you're comfortable with it's your potato it's your creation you do what you want i'm doing what i want and then for the bacon i'm gonna do again what i wanted some chunky bits if you want them to be a little finer than that and that's fine but i'm looking for some chunky bits and i found them so now that i'm ready for the plating i'm gonna cut the potatoes into half and then mash them into an even ish layer like surely there is an easier and more efficient way of doing this but by this point in the evening i had partaken in too many premier antics to produce such a thought does it look anywhere close to right yeah like i don't know why you're smashing it up like anymore like you're good i didn't i told you i just scored it okay and then you'd tell me you're gonna just still smash it so like it works so now that we got that taken care of i'm gonna pour all the extra butter from the bowl on to the taters because it's my anniversary and then i'm gonna salt and pepper the taters and then get ready to build our castle of love so i start off with a few initial dollops of sour cream throughout and then a layer of cheese then i throw the chicken strips on there then i pour the cup of sauce and make sure it gets into all those crevices you know help it out a little bit give it another layer of the rest of the cheese a few more dollops of sour cream our bacon bits and then garnish it with some green onions and chives and gang that's it there's nothing more to it that's that's a happy anniversary yeah for sure so we have to eat all of the sauce otherwise we will get hot oh no i think i can handle that all right

checking this out this very cheesy episode of cannabis kitchen all right love y'all [Music] bye", "zthDDFlea_c": "yes it's not I'm only making something that Eric from Texas sent us this is the h-e-b Texas sheet cake and it is the chocolate with frosting mix and nothing matters my calories but I'll tell you what it is one piece or one twenty-fourth of the cake is a hundred and seventy calories prepared so it's not horrible for K this is the agreed to be for everything I'm gonna go out that stuff in the cave on pay for everything yeah yeah one RJ you need two-thirds a cup of water but they're divided up into one thirty one thirty one stick of unsalted butter you need the cocoa packets in here the mixed packs in here you need a fourth of a cup of sour cream convinced you down and in for the frosting you're going to use five tablespoons of salted butter five tablespoons of water the frosting mix in the sugar packet so that's what you're going to need for that so my first directions are and I've got to follow the directions because they're they're kind of there's it's kind of confusing the way they lay it out so I'm just gonna just be honest with you I'm gonna read good three times so the first thing I want to do is mix kind of my eggs and my third the water I'm not third of the cup of water into a football let's bring egg in their mouth put one third of the water 1/3 of a cup of water in there I'm just gonna mix it up also have my oven on 350 and I've greased a 9 by 13 baking sheet so so you just want to mix that up and I'm just gonna lay my fork right there and you're gonna set this aside next thing I want to do is I want to get a saucepan some of that's going to hold you can get a small one like this a third of a cup of it's got a nut butter and the third of a cup of water so it's got a handle it's basically says to to cook the butter it says melted and get a small saucepan until it's golden brown I'm being careful it does not burn so that's what we're going to do oh my god while that's heating up I'm I open my box up okay I've got a frosting Coco so that's gonna go to the side I have cake cocoa mix which is while I'm mixing with that I have sugar packet which just goes to the frosting it feels like powdered sugar and then we have our mix packet which goes with the actual cake itself so so basically I'm just go with this melt this butter melt and get brown and then I'm gonna then I'll be back my butter is that I've never done this before that looks golden brown to meet you so I don't know so anyway you added your 1/3 cup of water and then you add your cocoa mix the yeah the cake cocoa mix I don't know where they give you a huge package because it was really literally only half okay so it's smooth and it says basically you put it back on the heat and bring to a boil and then once it becomes to a boil you basically take it off the heat again and let it set okay it looks like it's boiling today so I'm literally gonna let that sit I guess it has to cool a little bit that you let it sit there for a little bit it's really thick chocolate sauce it's almost like you've melted chocolate chips in it oh yeah so now we go to the next part we're just gonna let that sit so now we come back over to our eggs thing and we're going to add the contents to the of a mix packet to the egg mixture in the ball so that's this cake mix packet I've got four I guess that'll be okay actually man up getting a whisk for this too but the best thing whisk it together a little small metal whisk this all my record on quick notice um I'm just gonna cast throw this in and now we're gonna add the chocolate mix in there and this is pretty liquidy so it should fill it out quite a bit yeah now after you're retired you add your sacrum puckered in it with a mixer but it didn't say to do it with a mixer and you know get whisked up pretty easily let me get Terry to hand me the pan and just says put it up in it's a spoon yeah I don't think I need a spoon it in just make sure it goes into all the corners and you you're gonna put this in the oven now for 15 to 20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean so tell me it for the frosting what we're gonna do is we got five tablespoons of butter we're basically do the same thing we're going to put it in a saucepan and melt it and then once that's melted and golden brown whatever that means we're gonna add the third a cup of water and I'm not third cup the five tablespoons of water and the cocoa mix whisk it up bring it to a boil once it's boiled we're gonna pull it off the heat and then add the frosting powder so that's what we're kind of waiting to do one thing I notice is the barcode it's shaped like Texas so I'm basically let this melt and get my home I guess and and I'll be back all right so it's browned butter you can see the brown now so we're gonna pour the water in there and then I'm gonna take this cook a packet spur it in whisk it in then you put it on again I let it boil which it didn't take long and once it boils I'm going to take it off the heat and I'm a whisk in the contents of the sugar packet which again like I said still it looks like brown powder sugar stuff and try to do this with one hand if you want to tangy while I'm doing this Hank and show you what the cake looks like out of the oven can you see it you can go red turned out pretty good so I'm gonna continue to whisk this up and I'll be back alright here's the stuff and the cake is still warming it says to put it over a warm cake and it's kind of thick but I'm going to pour it and if I need to spread a little bit I'll use the whisk to kind of spread it around a little bit and have these little chunky pieces in there and that's okay because in the box picture - chunky bits in it - yeah you see the little bump the dots things like that so yeah this is buzzed as it's gonna get so it says to go ahead and cut it into 24 pieces and serve so we're gonna cut it up run it here's the Texas sheet cake cake cut mine's a little messy but that's okay wow that's I'm gonna know - Wow I love the fly brother mm-hmm I think that flavor that you're getting out of there is where you were had to brown that better twice these are not these four cones right no but the different flavor oh yeah it's unholy sweet cake either really that is so good Wow I don't think it's super sweet I'm in sweet it's not like syrupy sweet that's so good there's good I like them I'm assuming I forgot we're gonna do a walnut but there's a different flavor in there besides the chocolate besides the Nets and I'm pretty I'm almost positive it's where you had to brown that butter twice I think just it I smelled that why he was cooking it and then you can really taste it in that cake that is absolutely delicious so that helped a lot who's my cake then I guess you liked it - where's my cake I think you died yeah it was good royal Patrick so Eric thank you very very much for saying this does I've never had a Texas she gave before ever it's really good there's a lot of steps too but the outcomes really good yeah it's delicious so thank you very much and I hope everyone else enjoyed this so thanks for watching", "x4zxgIoHl54": "okay guys it's me Westby again and we're gonna do a little review here on these Hydroxycut super elite pills and I've showed them before in a previous video and they're but they work really good I'd say they're close to the same as what the Hydroxycut pro clinical is but they do give you a little bit more energy they are let me pull one of these out of here they are the ones though that are actually liquid filled now most of them that I've took are not liquid filled they're like this over here that I was also sent to review which are the hard for you late okay well the hard core elites let me get one of these are it makes it rough on one hand of course I have not gotten the tripod yet hopefully within the next week I'll have it not guaranteed but hopefully I do [Applause] okay now like I was saying this is the soup really and it is liquid inside of it this is the regular hard core and it's it's got the beads in it and the pro clinical which I can't get to it right now but the pro clinical is just a plain white pill okay well this one right here is super relate like I say it it works about the same as the pro clinical does there's no jitters or anything like that it you can tell it gives you good energy you get real good energy from it and for me when I take on I'll take it about 12:00 noon and I can actually tell that I've took those until like six or seven o'clock at night and I mean they're they're great honey they do exactly what they're supposed to do now in this one which is like I said the hardcore chelate okay this one works good and it gives you tons of energy but if you're not working out as soon as you get done taking it well I say within 30 minutes after taking this if you're not working out or doing some kind of exercise they will drive you crazy you will have so much energy that you won't know what to do you'll start getting jittery you'll start getting anxious and I mean it's just a whole different animal taking these here and like I said if you take them in 30 minutes later you do the workout then you're good to go you don't have the jitters or anything but if you take it and you don't work out after taking this pill then yeah you're gonna be running around like a chicken with his head cut off wondering what you're gonna do but there they act fast they got a fast response time to them once you take them not quite as fast as this one though that liquid it does start working quite a bit faster than what the hardcore or what the pro clinical does okay now there's not a lot more that I could really say about these it's just that they do work I mean they do what they're supposed to be if all you want to do is lose weight and trim them up these right here are the way to go like I said in the past video I've toke Hydroxycut for probably two and a half to three months off and on because you're not supposed to take them every single day you're supposed to cycle through them you can take them for like a week straight and then stop for two or three days and then take them again it doesn't say that on the package but that's what you're actually supposed to do with them if not there is a chance that they can have an effect on you but I've way from 198 pounds down to 176 pounds since taking the Hydroxycut pills so they definitely do what they were supposed to do okay now the other thing I was going to review on today is this it is the six star it is made by muscle tech it is the hundred percent we protein it is elite series which get that focused in on earth well it's got the sixty grams of protein but it's only sixty grams protein if you do the two scoops you only do one scoop is thirty grams but if you do two scoops it is sixty grams protein and it does have two thirteen point four grams of BCAAs okay it is gluten free and like I said it's that strawberry smoothie and I'm telling you that strawberry smoothie is probably one of the best flavors that I've planted this stuff it tastes really really good okay now I'm going to put some of this in my cup it goes to six ounces of water rather you do one scoop or two scoops it goes to six ounces of water okay I'm one of the for some of this into my shaker cup and get it ready and I'm gonna show you how it mixes up and everything so I will be right back with that okay here we go I was gonna show you what it looked like that that's the powder and it's a pretty good sized skate I'm only gonna do one scoop right now but all right there's one stew that's quite a bit but that is one ski okay here's my cup put it in there okay what I do that lead right there it is how the shaper cup that I've got has the lead like that on it and I have found that that lid works a lot better than what the blender ball does because I have some it's got the blender ball in it and to me I'm in the blender ball works good but it does not work as good is what this one does I don't know why there's that much of a difference in them but it is when shake this up real good you might see it six ounces of water most of the time this mixes up really good to someone that's there a little bit okay this out of the way for a second yeah I got my radios here on my day this is the only place I got right now to do my reviews because I don't have my tripod yet I'm hoping this backup just so you can see what it looks like mmm god I so good okay that's what it looks like mixed up which you can't see it real good because the bubble was in it but it does mix up it's really really good you don't have the big heavy Trump's in it or anything like that when you mix it up but it does have everything in it that it's supposed to have I mean it does work when I take this I do I can't tell that I've you know gotten a little bit of energy to me after taking it it does make me feel better after taking it now as far as getting the gains from it from a really good workout and stuff like yeah now I haven't took it long enough for me to say that it's the best or the worst or you know there's anything like that because taking it for just a week ain't gonna make that big of a difference but it's not hardly been a week yet but it ain't gonna make that much of a difference on the protein the protein is one of the things you got to take regularly for a little while before you start noticing anything but oh yeah say yeah that stuff's awesome it and it tastes just like it what it says it's my strawberry smoothie and it tastes great but how about this code that's the cup that I got smart shake okay you got it at Walmart $7.99 down on the bottom it's got two compartments right there that unscrew from it to keep your powder in it's got a long piece of gums in this one that hold your pills and stuff in it but what I got to say about this is you know it's it's good stuff I know it's not the most expensive it's not the cheapest I mean there is better that's out there but you know it is it is good if someone's on a low budget and they want to try this you know go for it because it will get you what you want they will definitely get you what you want sometimes you got to you know use it a little more or a little longer than you do the other stuff and I would recommend instead of doing one scoop I would do two scoops of it if you're gonna you know take it after a good workout I would definitely do the two scoops of it but like I said you can buy this at Walmart or you can get it off Amazon which that's where this one came from is Amazon and the products that I've shown here the Hydroxycut Hardcore the Hydroxycut soap early and this here I will have the links on the description of this video where you can go to it and order if you would like from Amazon where I got it from but yeah like I said I mean if you're into working out you want to tone up it gets you know slim it good muscle tone and everything use this stuff right here and I mean it'll get you where you want it where you want to be it especially that Hydroxycut like I said that's that's awesome it works very like I say this stuff here I would recommend doing the two scoops instead of just a one if you're using that as a post-workout shake I would definitely do the two scoops but yeah I mean it's this for muscle tape so you can't go wrong with it muscle tech always puts out a good product I mean it's not their main brand label with you know six star because I think their main brand label is the Nitro pet but this X star just something they come up with it's still really good stuff you can just get it for a cheaper price I say you pick it up just about any Walmart Walmart selves this and they also sell that the body fortress which the body fortress I would not recommend anybody because it's pretty much crap I cannot stand body fortress and it it doesn't do nothing and it tastes horrible it makes you feel bloated and I've seen at times where people was actually gotten fat from taking body fortress so I would stay away from it if you go to Walmart just get this right here but I'd actually recommend getting it from Amazon because you can actually get it cheaper from them but that's all the review is gonna be on for today the next time I'll be coming back for review on this which I showed you earlier before on the other video the nitro tape we isolate gold protein I will be doing that one next and I'll also do this one which is nitro tech we isolate it's the milk chocolate flavor and this one down here is the double rich chocolate flavor okay that'll be my review next he'll probably be a couple days and I'll do the review on these two but for now that's my review on these three and I hope you enjoyed the video if you want to stay tuned for more reviews subscribe to my channel please like this video leave your comments at the bottom tell me what you think about these products if y'all have tried them before and like I said I'll leave a link to each one of these three in the description of this video so you can go straight to Amazon and order this if you wish it's like I said it does work and it's good stuff but for now this is me where's P and this will be my review for today and I hope you enjoyed it so that's all for now now I'll catch y'all on a couple days everybody have blessed day", "wO7jAkK8I0k": "hey guys welcome back and if you are new here hi welcome my name is Melissa and today we are doing a full day of eating dirty keto and everything is also going to be vegan if you are also new here I have been on the ketogenic lifestyle I don't like to call it a diet because it has become a lifestyle for me for almost a year and a half I cannot believe at the end of July will be a year and a half that I have been on the keto lifestyle and like I said I am also vegan I was vegan before I was keto so I incorporated the two together and I have lost over 80 pounds I do have a whole playlist I will leave it linked right above here in the iCard so you guys can check out my progress from the past like I said year and a half and I'm hoping to do a year and a half update for you guys because I've never did my one-year update so we're gonna do a year and a half update let's get into what I am eating today alright guys so this is how I start my day every single morning and I know I leave with this video dirty keto but this is not dirty this is something pretty clean and it is really really good for you what I do is I use apple cider vinegar I always get the organic get the one with the mother it kind of has like the one of the stuff on the bottom of the bottle and you will see you have to shake it up really good and I also will use some fresh lemon juice as well as well sometimes I will pre squeeze all my lemons in heaven in jar today I did not but I wanted to let you guys know some of the health benefits of apple cider vinegar and lemons it is so good for your digestion your blood sugar levels it also you know supposedly helps you lose weight it helps reduce belly fat bloating blood pressure it is good for your skin there are so many more health benefits google it look it up there are so many great benefits to drinking like I said lemon juice and the apple cider vinegar so what I do is like I said I will screen squeeze my lemon juice into the my mason jar I always drink out of mason jars do you guys drink out of mason jars cuz I just love it and also it's always good to drink anything any sort of citrus in a glass because if you if you put it in plastic it will eat away at the plastic so like I said I just squeeze that lemon juice in there and I put some of the apple cider vinegar which you can see has you know no calories no carbs or anything so really great for you I usually will do two tablespoons you can do a little bit less if you're not familiar with the taste you know it is very you know very bitter taste I love the taste of it I'm gonna also sweeten it with a little bit of this I get this at Walmart it's a great value like stevia it's like a little squirt bottle and you just squirt a little bit in there you know make it to your tastes and then then I just you know obviously have some ice in there and some water as well and I put my little metal straw in there because we want to save the planet not use all those plastic straws and like I said you don't want to use plastic with lemon juice anyways so we're gonna start the day with that I'm also going to have my supplements as well this is a new addition I know my last recent video wanting add a video I had a different vitamin C but this is a newer one I just got and this is from the foodie soprano am I gonna sports oh my goodness I'll leave your hair right on the on the screen because I just totally forgot because I know they have the abbreviation on the bottle but here are the supplement facts it is eight thousand milligrams I usually will take one of these a day just to support my immune health this was a really great deal on Amazon I also have been taking these plant-based vitamin D threes from the same company for goodness gracious probably at least six months or more I love these as well I take them being that I am in the Sun more often now I don't take it every single day usually every other day and then I've also been taking these Rea wellness is the brand and I get these at Target these vegan at collagen I just recently started taking them so I don't know if I'm seeing any differences yet but there was a really great deal on the cartwheel and I bought us so I only got them for like $10 for the bottle they're usually like 14.99 I'll leave that video linked above so you guys can go check that out so I've been taking that and then as well as these Rhea wellness Beauty I was taking these last month I'm on my second month of taking them I don't have really bad skin but I do find that you know does seem like it is helping you know in any little bit you know any extra nutrition you can add into your you know vitamins into your body you know it's worth it so basically like I said that is how I start my day is my lemon and apple cider vinegar drink and I will take my supplements and then I will you know usually do a couple of my mom duties around the house and then I will do my workout because I always like to work out fasted and then we will be back in a little while and I'm going to show you what my smoothie of the day is all right so we are back and it is a you know late afternoon about two o'clock and usually I always like to have a smoothie after my workout so we're gonna use some of this xct oil from bulletproof I had been using the MCT oil for a while but I wanted to try the xct and see if there was any differences and how I feel I think they said the difference is with the xct it speeds up your metabolism as opposed to the MCT gives you I think energy hopefully I'm saying it right I remember which it was me if if I remember correct remember I will leave some of the information on the screen for you guys here and then I'm also going to use this ghost life protein powder I love this this is a one this is a new addition as a new flavor pancake batter a new flavor to me not to the company but to me so we're gonna try this out this is pancake batter here are the macros here you know the calories are pretty good there are four net carbs per serving which is really great I try to keep my carb count for my protein powders under like 5 or less be very careful because some of them have a lot of hidden sugars and carbs so be very very careful when you are looking for a good protein powder because you know like I said they can they it can add up and you don't want to you know you don't want to add all your calories in your carbs in a protein you know shake as much as I love them I'm also gonna use some of this simply almond almond milk this is my first time trying this actually the calories are really low if you're somebody who counts calories I don't really watch my calories too much and pretty much just count the carbs and the calories will work out in the end and then I'm gonna use some of this silk heavy whipping cream which has zero carbs and it's going to add some extra fats as well as you know to go along with the xct oil which will give me the fats as well and then I just wanted to show you guys this ghost life protein powder how they packaged it because this was the first time I was using it because you if you're somebody who uses protein powder and whether you order in a line to get it in the store you bring it home and you're digging through to get the scooper they leave the scooper right on the top they have it like hooked right on the top there so I absolutely love it you can do that every time so I'm just gonna add my simply almond milk used eight ounces which was only one net carb so I just added that to my little shaker pop than my silk whipping cream and here we go guys every video it never fails I'm always spilling something always seems like when I'm making my smoothies for you guys so I did two tablespoons of that like I said just to add a little bit more creaminess and some extra fats to that and then I'm going to add the xct oil I am going to use a whole tablespoon if you're not familiar with using MCT or xct oils be very careful use very little to start because it can upset your stomach I have been taking it for quite a while so I'm kind of my body's kind of used to it as well going to use that big scoop full of the protein powder the scoop on this is huge so you can't need a lot of protein powder in one scoop you can add a little bit more if you want then I just added some water and blended it up and there is my pancake batter a smoothie really cool it just it's such an interesting it's such an interesting flavor I also wanted to show you guys I got this lid from Walmart recently it was $5 for me I feel like that's a little bit pricey but I like you know I like it on my mason jar and just makes it easier when I'm walking around the house doing getting trying to get things done I also wanted to have a little bit of some crunch with my you know afternoon smoothie so I'm gonna have some of these Blue Diamond smokehouse almonds they're not the best thing to eat there is mellow dextran in here and this is what I'm talking about the beat the boot the dirty Kido this is a very curt keep dirty Kido I can even get the voice out dirty Kido item because there are a lot of other ingredients and I don't eat this stuff very often but there was a great deal on I bought on I couldn't pass it up so I had some of those and then I also had a few pecans as well and that was pretty much my first meal of the day and this is a lot of times how I do eat I'm not a big breakfast person sometimes in the mornings on the weekends I will have some breakfast but this is usually what I like to do is I like to work out fasted and then have a protein shake with a little light snack all in all this was about six-and-a-half net carbs and you know this is going to get me through till dinnertime and wait tasty dinner because dinner's going to be an epic dinner tonight I'm so so excited for this dinner so I'm going to go eat this and we will be back shortly and I'm going to show you what this epic dinner is going to be you're going to be amazed all right guys so it is dinner time and yes I know it's 9:30 don't judge me a lot of times this is how I eat I like to eat late at night when everything is settled down in the house and I also eat very intuitively so I usually only like to eat when I am hungry and that has worked for me I know they say not to eat late at night but like I said it works for me and I'm a night owl so I actually stay at quite late anyways but so what we're gonna do we're gonna make a burger and fries tonight for dinner and I am so excited so the for the fries because obviously potatoes are very high carb so we can't have potatoes which I do love potatoes and miss them sometimes we're gonna use jicama and jicama is pretty good on the net carb count so I did actually pre prep these in a meal prep video which you guys will see coming up hopefully soon and you can cut these ahead of time keep them in the fridge and take them out as needed so what I'm going to do is I'm going to put them in my airfryer not all of them just a few I like handful of them I just season them with some salt and pepper kept it really simple you can put other seasonings on there if you'd like some garlic powder paprika onion powder a little spice if you want as well I'm gonna put those in there for about 10 minutes to kind of get them started and while those are cooking I'm going to use my Giambi if you guys one of my regulars you know how much I love the beyond beef the macros on this are so great if you are keto with your vegan or not is very low net carbs you get some great fat in there as well and some really great protein per serving is 20 grams of protein so for the packages his four servings but what I did was I divided it up into three so I'm gonna make three burgers and I'm gonna portion two out I'm gonna leave two aside for some other meals which is you know it's always a great idea to you always sometimes want to prep things for a later date which makes your life sometimes a little bit easier especially as those moms you know and dads - I don't want to you know save dads aren't busy we're all busy so I put some coconut oil in my pan I also wanted to show you guys I know I've mentioned it I think one of my videos we were waiting to get a new stove oven I absolutely love my new one it's got the griddle in the middle it's it's I'm so excited to have this new addition to my kitchen it is so beautiful it has a lot of the stainless steel on it I know I didn't even show the front of it I just showed the top of it and as you can see right there it was nine through it's 9:30 at night making my dinner but you know I like I said that sometimes how we roll so we're gonna get these burgers in the pan we're gonna heat up that up that not olive oil coconut oil and we're gonna throw the burgers in the pan and we are going to let them cook and as you can see they do start to bleed it's it's kind of creepy is when you first make these the first time it kind of looks like real beef it is so interesting there is beets in it which you would do not taste the beets and that's why it does that so while those are cooking I'm going to show you guys we're going to use this zero net carb bread from I get this at alvey's I'm so excited my Aldi's finally has this back in stock I've been buying quite a few and keeping them in my freezer and here are the macros very low calories and there are zero net carbs now for the ingredients it's kind of dirty and this is why this is a dirty keto video because like I said these things are not the best for you so here are my jicama fries about after 10 minutes I do like them a little bit more crispy so I'm gonna pop those in for another 5 minutes and by that time my burgers were somewhat ready to be flipped as you can see they kind of stuck a little bit so they probably cooked a little bit they could have stayed a little bit longer before flipping and that's why you know it's just like real me if you flip it too much it's gonna stick but they just you know I wanted to get them cooking on the other side I did could overcook them slightly but you know because you can actually cook these a little bit rare just like real meat it's kind of it's very interesting so after my jicama fries cooked for another 5 minutes what I did was just to toast on my bread I put those on top toasted it up and we're gonna get this going so then we're gonna add some vegan mayonnaise this is the only one I can find out is it is the hummons vegan mayo this is 0 net carbs get some extra fat gonna put some red leaf lettuce on there as well get your greens in come on guys get those greens in we're top it with one of those burgers as well the beyond burgers which is now all nice and cooked and then like I said I'm going to portion the other two aside for another night and a bit make my you know other evenings really nice and easy and quick and here is what my burger looks like when it is all done does not doesn't that look like a real burger guys like if you have not had this beyond beef I recommend it and even if you're a meat-eater try it out you may love it so then I added my jicama fries here on the side they got all nice and crispy and what else you need when you have fries you have to have the ketchup guys so we're going to use this Heinz is that Heinz yes Heinz tomato ketchup this is no sugar added it is only one netkar before a tablespoon which I don't even think I use a tablespoon of just kind of drizzle that on there is maybe like a teaspoon because you gotta have your ketchup I know and even sometimes some people like to dip their french fries in mayonnaise do you guys like mayonnaise on your french fries I have to see I do from time to time but I had the mayonnaise on the burger so I just did the ketchup for tonight so there is my dinner so excited to have this epic dinner like I said it might have seemed like I didn't eat a lot and they beginning of the day but I was so excited to have this nice epic yummy burger it was so filling it's so delicious but we're still going to end our night with a little sweet treat so we're gonna eat this dinner up and we're gonna come back and you're gonna see what I'm gonna have for my little late-night sweet treat alright guys so we are back for our late-night snack and yes you are seeing this correctly I am going to have a cup of coffee and iced coffee I recently got these Starbucks cold brew for a great deal through ibotta I'll leave that plate that video linked above here for you guys so you guys can check that out but I'm going to have coffee and it might seem odd but I find coffee to be very soothing to have at night it's very relaxing to me I'm not the typical person that likes to have it or you know or needs to have it in the morning I find that the lemon juice in the water gets in the water in the morning gets me going more than coffee does but I find the coffee to be very soothing at night so I'm gonna have the Starbucks cold brew just be careful guys because some of these coal brews you can buy over-the-counter our or even when you go to Starbucks have some carbs in them so make sure you are accounting every single carb I'm also going to use some of this nut pods creamer as well which is zero net carbs which is always great you know to have something like that you know that doesn't add any extra carbs to it and this cold brew is actually concentrated so you do have to add a little bit of some water as well and then just to give it a little sweetness I'm gonna add some of my Jordan skinny syrup some caramel I was actually able to get two marshals the other day they finally opened ours and I was able to get some in store but you can order them online as well I do have a link I'll leave it linked down below for you guys you can go you guys can get I think five dollars off your first purchase if you're Marshalls is not open or you're teaching Max or you don't even have one and I'm gonna so that is my coffee like I said I added

channel and welcome back to another what's for dinner if you're new here my name is mandy in these videos i like to share with you what i make for my family of four i hope you guys enjoy our first meal is sunday pot roast from the magnolia table volume 2 cookbook what you need for this is a five pound chuck roast three tablespoons of olive oil one tablespoon of kosher salt one tablespoon of fresh ground black pepper four large russet potatoes peeled and cut into two inch chunks eight large carrots cut into two inch two to three inch chunks one white onion halved two garlic cloves two cups of beef broth a quarter cup of worcestershire sauce four thyme sprigs what i'm doing now is just rubbing the olive oil onto the pot roast and then i'm sprinkling it with some of the kosher salt and black pepper and don't ask why i didn't go ahead and do the pepper while i did the salt i have no idea i ended up having to just flip it and flip it and flip it i'm now putting my pot roast into my dutch oven i'm going to sear it on all of the sides for about six to eight minutes until it's nice and brown listen to that sizzle so here i'm just holding up the ends so i can get those ends nice and brown as well now i'm adding in the potatoes carrots onion and the smashed garlic and i'm just going to evenly distribute those around the roast so that we don't have just a pile of carrots on one side and potatoes on one side i didn't feel like i had enough onions so i went ahead and added in this red onion that i had in the pantry that needed to be used up so i just cut that up and added that in as well [Music] i'm now pouring in my two cups of beef broth and adding the quarter cup of worcestershire sauce now this is where you would also put in your thyme sprigs i didn't have any sprigs but i did go back and add a little bit of dried thyme so i'm just gonna cover the pot and placing the dutch oven into my oven that has been preheated to 300 degrees fahrenheit and i'm gonna just forget about it for about four hours until the veggies are fork tender and the meat falls apart i also made up some jiffy corn muffins and this meal was delicious okay so for dinner tonight i picked this up from aldi if you haven't seen that grocery haul i will link it down below in the description and i'll put an icard at the top but i picked this up from aldi thinking that it would be pretty good we could give it a try for dinner so that's what we're gonna have tonight i'm gonna make some rice in the instant pot i'm gonna go ahead and make double rice so we can just put it in the fridge and have it for lunch later in the week or something painter is an oxo container it's one of the press and seal i'm not sure what it's called but i have some linked in my amazon store i'll link it down in the description as well i love it i have a bunch of different sizes i get most of mine from tj maxx or home goods when i can find them on sale so but they're really good they're so easy to just put the lid on seal it and you have a good airtight seal they look really pretty in your pantry it makes everything just look so neat and organized okay so the instruction says to heat it up to a soft boil heat water to a soft boil and place the bag in the water this is what it looks like so you'll place the bag don't mind my dirty stove it needs to be wiped off but you place the bag in the water for about 15 minutes and then you remove it from the package let it rest for two minutes before opening the bag or you can do it in the microwave but i think the stovetop would be better that way you don't overheat it and it gets you know like rubbery or whatever so we're going to do it on the stovetop this meal was really good i'm not a huge thigh meat type person but this was really good the spices and seasoning they used was delicious so this meal was on a whim i did not have this on the meal plan i had no idea where i even came up with it i just got a craving for chicken and waffles so i took my chicken breast from aldi put them in the air fryer and then i did the waffles in the air fryer and i steamed up some of the edamame beans and dinner was done it was so good so for dinner tonight we are having um i was gonna say chicken alfredo but we're just having beef and pasta with alfredo sauce on it so i have my pasta here in the pot boiling this is a pound of ground chuck and i just added some minced garlic kosher salt and pepper and i'm gonna make my own alfredo sauce so here i have one stick of butter and some minced garlic i'm going to add in the parmesan not parmesan the heavy cream give that a good stir i also added about two tablespoons of cream cheese and i'm going to heat this up until it's just bubbling not boiling but just a little bit bubbling and then i'm going to add in a cup i believe it's a cup of parmesan cheese and just mix it until the parmesan cheese melts and add a little bit of salt and pepper and you have alfredo sauce i am going to go ahead and drain the hamburger meat and then i'm just going to set it to the side and once the alfredo sauce is done i'll mix it all together so then we can spoon it over top of our pasta it would be good to have some garlic bread but we really don't need it anyway so we'll just have that i do have some broccoli that we need to eat before it goes bad this meal was really quick and easy the kids absolutely loved it except for the broccoli of course but i need to make up some alfredo sauce and keep it in the refrigerator i wanted to share the next two pictures with you as well we did have this for dinner

welcome back to my channel using a Catholic or the chef with a specialization in functional nutrition and today I would like to share with you guys a few things that you might have inside your fridge they are stopping you from losing all the way you want before i'll show you anything i just want to make a point here that everybody really the house is extremely healthy and still you're going to see a lot of things that are hidden inside the food's always stick with the most natural form of the food because by doing so then you're eliminating all these industrial extra ingredients that you don't need so a very good trick for you is to read the label not a calorie part not the fat part the ingredient part the ingredients are always available in the order that they have the most inside is just to show you an example i have separate food from the fridge in three different groups the first one the product is exactly what it says on the label you can see here you could still recognize all the ingredients as edible the second group what I would take out of my diet right now just because I want to lose weight most of them contain sugar at the first or the second or the third ingredient I would replace this one for a full butter instead of having the mix different from the first one this contains sugar and oil sugar is the second one here here the second and the third our molasses and sugar so croutons I don't know if you guys know but you can easily do this yourself at home it's just bread cut up in cubes and dehydrated in the oven and look how many ingredients you have here sugar as a second ingredient salad sauce are the easiest things you can do at home which is use a little bit of vinegar and some olive oil the main ingredient on this product it's vegetable oil third and fourth are sugar and salt and the third group is the group that I would definitely not eat at all if you want to lose weight or not just because it contains a spare Tommy thats related to cancer and high fructose corn syrup that we all know it's highly poison for us it's very bad for your body st has no sugar but it has a spur to me oh my god run away from this one he has four different types of sugar honey corn syrup sugar and fructose second ingredient high fructose corn syrup first in second soybean oil and high fructose corn syrup same as the previous one besides a lot of sugar and vegetable oil this one contains a thickening ingredient thats related to cancer besides vegetable oil and sugar this one also contains concert so in America all the ketchup contains high fructose corn syrup run away from this one because it has high fructose corn syrup corn syrup and sugar I'm not used to say anything bad about a brand or who is shopping for food all this product here are very common unity evans house the most regular thing you came flying in the supermarket focus used to lose weight and i just want to exemplify to you how you can have a lot of hidden calories on your daily

allowed me to come in and inspect her kitchen to see if she's truly eating healthy are you eating healthy watch this video and see this is nicole my client and this is her kitchen and we're gonna go through and see if she's eating healthier okay so for the quaker oats old-fashioned oats it does say non-gmo and that's great but there's a better option and this is it this one is glyphosate free gluten-free sprouted rolled oats and it is organic and non-gmo and it has the authentic symbols right there packaging it says rich milk chocolate flavor that tells me right off the bat that that's artificial flavor the ant is sugar second one is corn syrup solids and if that's not enough to make your barf uh i don't know what is but it just gets worse as the list goes on so this is definitely not a product that i would have in my kitchen it's got the palm kernel and or i love when they say and or it's like just tell me which one it is soybean cocoa processed with alkali and then it has gargum what is that a luminol silicate that sounds dangerous okay so this is a definite no-go [Music] this product is definitely the better choice it's organic cocoa powder and that is it there is one ingredient in there and that is what it is cocoa powder non-gmo and organic i posted a link to the video that i made to show you how to make homemade cocoa using this or simple truth organic is a good brand honey is a great sweetener to use this is organic no artificial flavors or preservatives this is the brand of crackers that you would find in my cabinet non-gmo it doesn't say organic but there's only a few ingredients in these and so the fewer ingredients the better so all tea should be organic otherwise you're drinking a cup of pesticides organic peanut butter that looks good i have not seen this brand before no to palm oil see it says it right there so it's not just me it's even this company that's saying say no to palm oil rich time has a new ketchup out there that says no high fructose corn syrup but this one you see it a lot in restaurants fine out loud it's just tomatoes why does it have to have all that other stuff in there it doesn't this is real mayonnaise with cage free eggs soybean oil is the number one ingredient on here and this is not organic and then there's calcium disodium edta edta is a preservative and you'll see it in all kinds of other products skin care products and shampoo and stuff like that [Music] check these out instead you get your greens uh to be organic just again you want to eat as clean as possible and then the sour cream i do all all organic dairy for sure and i've cut back on dairy a lot apples again it's not organic this is a place where you can definitely cut calories by looking at your salad dressings again this has edta lots of processed food ingredients in this there's definitely healthier options to this you see it's called hidden valley for a reason they've got all kinds of hidden garbage in it that people don't recognize as garbage these ones are better they're organic they have better ingredients and fewer calories uh honestly the best thing to do is to just whip up your own batch with some olive oil garlic any herbs that you like salt and pepper is the best all right here's the freezer we've got organic coffee good dave's killer bread that's a good brand right off the bat i see the two labels that i'm looking for the organic and the non-gmo sometimes you'll see one or the other you really want to try to see both on the same product and what's this is this soup it's pie filling oh pie filling oh that's healthy full of sugar chicken fried rice and also look to see the how many ingredients are on a package and so this looks like there's a lot of ingredients and it's just fried rice so that is a red flag to me and maltodexatron is a no the soy sauce powder is a no for me again it repeats itself there's caramel color canola oil all of that stuff that would be a no a no and a no why doesn't it just say rice carrots and peas and then organic broccoli that's good [Music] [Music] again uh gluten free all right that's good it really is what they've done to it um modified cornstarch [Music] sodium aluminum phosphate aluminum that sounds delicious breast meat containing up to 15 of a solution of water seasoning [Music] and sodium phosphates [Music] so the corn starch is modified and that's not good doesn't say that it's organic all of this um there's got to be a healthier choice out there for this like maybe buying it i know it takes a little bit more work but it's your health

scoop or like a little bit less than half a scoop of the chocolate mint cookie in my coffee in the morning just to get some quick protein and just to make it taste good so that was technically my first meal a day it was it was just 10 grams of protein and then my first like meal meal of the day is this I usually have egg white at some sort of egg white like mixture concoction so today I did about 85 grams of asparagus about 50 grams of diced white onion a handful of spinach and then I usually do about three egg whites but I kind of over poured so ended up almost being for four egg whites which is roughly 200 grams and then I topped it with some avocado and Cholula of course and I don't need all of this at the very bottom I put some this rice broccoli in the church ease flavor so basically it's like broccoli that is made into like a rice texture and it's really good on macros for 85 grams it is only 0.5 shot five cards in a two protein decided 85 years of that just to have a little bit of carbs and some more veggies in there and it looks delicious and I'm super excited to dig it so that is meal number one macros for that meal we have 200 G calories 15 carbs 6 fat and 24 protein so I figured I would do a full day of eating for you guys since I have it really done one of those I mean I did one like purposely but I don't feel like it was a very good one because I was like out all day and it wasn't like a typical day of what I eat so I'm going to here it is through a full day and what I typically eat I want to have more time at home and more time to like actually cook foods and stuff like that and how I survive the struggles of a low carb day today my carbs are at 105 grams so I will show you guys how I make that work and what kind of foods I eat so as you guys enjoy school day of eating so I figured I would share what supplements I'm currently taking with my breakfast since I am eating breakfast right now so I'll start with this one it's called dim I just got it at the Vitamin Shoppe and it can be found in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli cauliflower Brussels sprouts stuff like that but if you don't really eat a lot of those on a daily basis and it's good to take it in similar form so I just take one of these and basically it's just really good for your immune system it's very good at citing infections and bacteria and it's also super good for your skin health so helps with acne and stuff like that next is just an ultimate probiotic that I also get at the vitamin shop I find it very beneficial to take a probiotic for everyone especially when you're on prep because your metabolism gets pretty effed up from all the you're putting it through so it's always a good idea to take one just to keep a healthy digestive system and just keep everything running smoothly these two are an absolute must I think everyone should be taking them on a daily basis from first form we have the so Omega which is your daily dose of omega-3s basically just fish oil and if you're not eating fish on a daily basis it's super smart to take these I do eat fish pretty semi often but it's always good to just take a fish oil supplement anyways because your body can't produce certain omegas and it is important to get them in no matter what so it's easier to just take the pill and just know that you're getting your omegas that you need and then the M factor goddess which is made specifically for females they also have one hero which is four males and this is just your daily micronutrient supplement so it's just your daily dose of vitamins and minerals that is just important to have and if you don't get it through Whole Foods which most people aren't usually getting I try to still eat a lot of you know Whole Foods just with that's packed with vitamins minerals stuff like that but I still like to take this just because I'm on prep as well I know my body is being put through a lot so it's important to make sure that I have all the nutrients that I mean so these are my four that I take right now my staples I take all of these one I take one of these one of these two of these and three of these and then I take them once in the morning if I'm training I will take another three of these a little bit later in the day if I'm not training that day then I will just take them in the morning so that's what I'm currently taking I highly suggest that you take some sort of if you are going to take any supplements definitely start with a fish oil and a multivitamin because those are super super important and get over first form because there's best [Music] so my next meal is going to be this hard crunch bar and there's an ice cream flavor actually I've only tried this flavor like one time I think I usually don't get it but I think I'm going to try it today because I feel like pushing it up my favorite flavor is the cookies and cream I also really like the chocolate because it just helps with like chocolate cravings it's super chocolaty and my new favorite is actually the salted caramel one which I don't know if it's ending flavor or if they've had it and I just didn't know about it but anyways the salted caramel one is extremely extremely good so if you want to try one of these just try that one I usually put them in the freezer just because I like eating them frozen I just think they taste really good but you can also like them normally or microwave and they just like a cookie like wafer things so I love I love these because they are even though they're a little higher than five they're low in carbs so like this one's only eight carbs usually they're around like eight to ten 13 5:14 protein so for a protein bar that's like amazing for low carb day it works really really well so definitely give these a try they're like one of my favorite protein bars out there so I eat that and I'm going to go grab Starbucks because I'm extremely tired just look up from a nap and that's why I'm not showing my face right now because I am tired so I'll see you guys I'll show you my Starbucks my coffee and so what I get is a venti iced coffee two pumps of these sugary cinnamon Dolce sometimes will also get the sugar-free vanilla but lately I've been really liking this women Dolce and and I get light almond milk so lately I've been adding my own almond milk when I get home just because I think Starbucks is a little bit higher in macros and I like having control over how much on milk I put in it being this this close to my show so because I'm going straight to Old Navy I just got a little bit as like almond milk in there and all milk is going to kill you so I do not track this at all it might be like 1 or 2 cards or something like that because of the syrups but it is sugar-free so it's nothing extreme honestly I just don't track it so it's kind of up to you if you want to go to that extreme but personally it's coffee so can I head into Oh maybe and see what they have to offer so for those of you who have never had PD fit it's peanut butter powder see Brigida macros it is 1.5 fat for cards and 6 protein for 12 grams which is that so it's good amount and then you just mix it with water well too much though because you don't want it to be watery so just like a little bit at a time you stir it up and it makes peanut butter and it's actually really good so that is what it ends up looking like and then I'm doing one of the chocolate crunch rice cakes these are a little bit higher in carbs but I freaking love them they're so good so it does have one fat and twelve carbs and then one protein the regular rice cakes have like seven or eight parts so yeah these things are a little bit higher but totally totally worth it so I just put this on the top and then it's like chocolate and peanut butter like a Reese's so good there is the finished product look at all that peanut butter of course it's not real peanut butter but it's still good and it works when you're dieting so there's my little diet Reese's for you all I'm gonna eat this put my laundry in the dryer and then go do some rinse just finish up 30 minutes of rinse on the treadmill I feel amazing that was working hard I know if you guys can tell how sweaty I am but the sweat is real right now they're really really great just to fill you guys in really clear on what I'm doing for cardio now for the last couple weeks of prep I feel like I've kind of hit a little bit of a plateau so I'm really sick of right now so I decided to increase my cardio a little bit and also just because we're going to click the Showtime like why not just increase it a little bit so I was doing I started doing 20 minutes of hit cardio then I kind of started doing like 25 in the past like two three weeks so now I'm doing I'm gonna start doing 30 minutes of hit cardio so all together with the warmup I usually warm-up for like five minutes and then I'll do sprints for 30 so I'll end the Sprint's at 35 minutes and then I'll do a pulldown for at least 10 minutes like walking because it's pretty tiring and then for a steady state I'm doing 45 minutes now I'm going to try to do 45 minutes every day at least so I'm just going to switch off between those two and do 30 minutes hit and then the next day for doesn't it study state the next day 30 minute hit the next day for examine at study state and just go on like that and just switch off yes I'm doing cardio every single day even if I take the day off of the gym I will still do cardio I'm also going to I'm trying to break up my sessions my cardio and my list in the two different sessions because I just find that it's a lot easier that way I can just focus on one thing at a time and I put all of my effort into that thing instead of having to think about going to the gym to do both things and it stresses me out and then I end up getting starving in the middle of it because I end up being there for like three hours and it's just like a mess so as my new regimen as now that I'm going to be doing in the next two weeks and then it is peak week so I'm going to switch things up a little bit for peak week not too much but I will keep you guys informed on what I will be doing I am a absolute sweat fest right now so I'm going to stretch shower and then probably start making my next meal it's my pre-workout meal because I'm going to head to the gym in a few hours to do some legs today's my piyo day so it's going to be a lot of high intensity type of stuff so got a few up for that I will show you guys what I'm eating next because yes this is still a full day of eating even though I just rambled on forever about cardio so I'll see you guys in the next clip for my next meal so I'm starving and I Soni my pre-workout meal yet so for my next little snacky type of meal I just measure about 3 ounces of grilled chicken breast it's already made I'm just warming it up in the pan and then I put it one whole egg over it I actually got this idea from Amanda poochie's it's supposed to be like chicken I guess I guess if you put the eggs like over the chicken so we'll see how it turns out and this is just going to be a 2022 protein and six fat all right and here it is it actually smells really good it kind of smells like chicken I guess so I can see why she said it's kind of similar to that I am not really a fan of ketchup but I know a lot of people put like Rudy's hot ketchup on here I'm polish gonna eat as is I'm trying to think maybe put a little hot sauce yeah a hot sauce always goes I put a little bit as this this is my favorite Cholula chilli garlic it's so good so I'm going to eat that and then finish up a few things and then I will make my pre-workout meal okay so I'm making my pre-workout meal I have to feel shidae and it was super super yummy plus I feel like it fueled me pretty well to my workouts so I'm having it again so I'm doing my carb source here which is one pack of the better oats full meal it's only 18 cards for the pack so I put like extra water in it and then I cook it for a minute and a half and then I add some grated zucchini and cook it some more so and make some more volumous so I'll show you guys what that looks like all right so I take the oats out get a grater and then about half a zucchini and then you just grate it into the oats I don't measure because it's literally like one carb I just estimate it's about 50 grams so it accounts for like one to two cards but to me it's a veggie so it's good for you anyways so we have a bunch of zucchini in here I stir it up probably add a little bit more water you want it to be like somewhat liquidy so that way it'll absorb the water so I'm just going to add a little bit more not too much though because I don't like watery oats so stir it up and then put it back in the microwave for about two minutes or so it's kind of just up to you however long you feel the need to put it in for I usually do about two minutes in the meantime I'm going to making my other part of my pre-workout meal which is a smoothie I just use spinach one of these card master yogurts today I'm using the strawberry banana and then I usually just like a handful of blueberries almond milk and the best to one-up protein coconut ice creams was so freakin good and smoothies and then ice all right so O'Neill is done it's nice and thick and it's a lot more voluminous than it was I also add a little bit of snickerdoodle protein usually I'll do half a scooper but today I can't do you will have soon because I would go over all my protein and I don't need that much because it already has a flavor so I'm just doing about 9 grams perfect and then that makes it even more sick also adding the protein so now it's like a nice thick oatmeal super volume in so these are the prep pack of getting through low carb day you just add a low carb thing zero meals such as zucchini it may look weird and gross but it's actually really good and you like can't even taste the zucchini plus you're getting in some greens at the same time so it's a win-win usually I would add about to send them into this as well but I just found out today that cinnamon actually has like six carbs per tablespoon and I do not know that so I think I'm going to just cut that out of my diet for the rest of crap just to be safe because I don't like need it I need a help but whatever so my pre-workout meal here I have my green smoothie full of protein a little bit of carbs here and then my oatmeal full of carbs a little bit of protein perfect for pre-workout it's probably the highest card meal I've had today and pretty high in protein as well so for both of these combined oats so for both of these combined see we have 31 carbs five five and thirty two protein so perfect for pre-workout you always want to do a higher carb and higher protein meal before you workout a little bit lower in fat because fat big longer to digest so I'm going to go enjoy this and wait about an hour and then go hit the gym I'm home finally from the gym I'm exhausted it was it was brutal today super brutal guys starving so my last meal what do you know protein ice cream is going down ice cream sandwich level 1 plus chocolate man cookie formula 1 equals heaven and I'm topping it with strawberries Oreos and peanut butter as per usual so I don't have energy to like explain everything it's pretty much the same I seem that I had last night just a little bit left peanut butter off that I had a whole serving of peanut butter today I'm having like a little bit less than half so I'll show you guys the finished product in the macros so you'll see that in the next clip there it is a last meal of the day going down post-workout and pre bed meal is literally my favorite meal of the whole day gets me through my day gets me through my workout it's amazing and super filling super super satisfying macros for this meal are going to be 32 cards 13 527 proteins so high you're in card because it's post-workout I'm pretty good on protein because this workout and a little higher in fat because it is before bed and I don't like waking up hungry in the real tonight so that's why I have the peanut butter for the extra fats so that's going to conclude my full day of eating and my macros were on a point let's see my macros are 105 carbs 45 fat and 135 protein so I went to curbs over protein one gram over fat and one gram under carb which is fine I like to say between one to like three grams that and like one to five grams on carbs and protein because it's really not going to make a huge difference so yeah pretty on point numbers are good and it was a great day of eating so I had enjoyed it I'm going to go and demolish this ice cream now and shower and head to bed because I'm exhausted thank you guys for watching another video I hope you guys enjoy it at my full day of eating if you have some good low carb ideas for food and stuff like that and I will catch you guys in the next video these guys you haven't liked the video all I could stuff alright I'll see you guys later", "_C7rlm9vc78": "energy bars without caffeine not only is that possible sometimes it's desirable going to talk about that and a whole lot more coming up in two seconds welcome I'm John John health and fitness and today we're gonna review red energy bars that's radiant energy deliciously delivered before we go any further I'm gonna time stamp all the sections of this review down in the description so you can jump around the sections you're interested in I'm gonna start right away with the highlights on this one highlight number one it has no caffeine now a new whoo energy bar mixer drink the first thing you think of is caffeine or some other stimulant but as I pointed out in a recent view of energy drinks and ways to make them better I'll throw a link up underneath the eye up there real energy comes from nutrients caffeine and guarana and other stimulants can't play an important role stimuli can kind of boost your workout it can boost mental acuity it can get you through a really long afternoon of conference calls and meetings but real energy comes from nutrients and sometimes that's all you need or sometimes you've already had enough caffeine for the day or even as your cup of coffee and all you want is that nutrient and that's what I use these bars for in fact I'll find myself sometimes leading say a group fitness class and my legs are just feeling heavy caffeine's really not gonna help with that what I need is just some real energy some nutrients and these fit that bill but know if you're looking for that pop of energy that's not what you get from these in fact these used to have caffeine monster mountain they took it out Holley number two these are 200 calories and north depending on the flavor so these are a substantial snack not big enough to be a meal replacement but a sizable snack and again terms of a pre-workout bar that's enough to get you going that's kind of like the sweet spot I think of a pre-workout meal you don't really want a lot of food or a big meal in an hour before a workout I want to add some lasagna about an hour and a half before I how to lead an admittedly vigorous group fitness class that did not turn out well not for anybody highlight number three I'm gonna get into great detail on this a little bit later it really matters which flavor you get and a lot of these bars the flavors are definitely different but there's a consistency to it you kind of either like that bar and two three four words flavors or you don't this one's quite different all right so let's get to the macros these also vary among flavors but it's going to be 200 220 calories there abouts facts tend to be 10 11 12 grams of fat equal mass of protein again 10 11 carbohydrates anywhere from 24 to 30 or so carbohydrates sugars in the low-to-mid single digits typically three to five one thing to know it has a substantial amount of fiber among those 24 to 30 grams of carbohydrates often a third to a half of that is fiber 11 12 13 grams of fiber that's as much as a third as you might eat in a day which is pretty impressive even more impressive and somewhat disturbing is that's often more than half what the average American gets so this one Baro packs of five per punch in fact I'd be a little careful for very low fiber diet and you're trying to work that in I'd be very cautious taking an entire bar of this right off the bat and then going to a workout in particular try that make sure it agrees with your system that fiber is primarily tapioca fiber I found that very agreeable to me but still definitely proceed with caution if you have a very low fiber diet 11 grams all at once in this little bar that you might notice so even though that fiber even relatively the low amounts of sugar I wouldn't necessary call this keto friendly I wouldn't necessarily call it low carb although it's pretty close that's a decision you have to make on your own let's move on to the ingredients these vary quite a bit from flavor to flavor as well it's a pretty long list but that's partly because it has these superfood blends in it now I'm not big on single-source superfood I mean really acai goji berries chia seeds these are all perfectly good nutrients but no no then we're gonna make you an Inca warrior now they're gonna make you invincible and I'm gonna make you live forever I've just been up and down that road too many times but I do believe in a variety of nutrients and this has a huge variety of nutrients truck which I do think is attractive nothing to notice no unnatural anything as far as I can tell I know some people might have some trouble with some of the ingredients the palm oil the company does say it's sustainably sourced on the label but elsewhere if that's an issue for you but overall this is natural so no artificial sweeteners colors flavors or anything like that quick word about the protein that's all plant-based P hemp and pumpkin these are all very good sources of protein should provide you a decent complement of amino acids the factors are a lot of protein that except for me anyway one more thing about the ingredients is it includes 1 billion of probiotics now I know a little bit about probiotics in fact I'll throw a link down in the description to my blog microbiome bulletin where I discuss a lot of these kinds of things but first of all 1 billion is not that much so don't get super excited you have 39 trillion bacteria living in and on you oh and don't freak out that their buildings a bacteria crawling all over and you well I could there are going to bacteria crawling all over it in you but it's ok by design most of them are friendly most of them tens of billions of them are friendly so I need billions not a big deal and you probably have a thousand different species down there this part has one single species of straining bacillus coagulants so why Pasillas coagulants does it have special energy producing properties know the social islands is very popular and packaged and processed foods because they're very resistant to heat it survives that manufacturing process it's nothing it's a bad probiotic by definition a probiotic has to confer some health benefit for example it can be useful in the treatment of travelers diarrhea and I suppose you could argue that travelers diarrhea could SAP your energy and doesn't so that bacillus cweigand is a really big selling point and maybe for traveling but otherwise I would not put a lot of stock in it so let's move on to taste and texture and this is an important one there are some of these flavors I do not like it all and some I actually do like something you should know about this one I think the fact that has a superfood blends particularly that mushroom blend gives it a little bit of a funky flavor it's not necessarily off-putting but it's not particularly desirable so let me start the oatmeal flavor like typically really like oatmeal flavor I like the flavor of oatmeal but this oatmeal flavor because oatmeal is a subtle flavor I think it's a little overwhelmed by that weird funky background taste it also has some this cocoa liqueur in it that a lot of these bars have I don't know wipes in the oatmeal it's it's doesn't seem to belong there but any case that was my least favorite this one I tried was chocolate so if you like shots I think you'll like this too chocolate more or less masks that funky flavor and it's a nice deep rich chocolate like like peanut butter the peanut butter kind of masks the funky flavor and again like peanut butter you might like this now I say all those three none of those like knocked out of the ballpark do not like the oatmeal and the chocolate and the peanut butter were good but not like my favorite chocolate bars of all time and that brings us to salted caramel and chocolate mint these were very good not just good for these red bars these are just good overall in fact the salted caramel is the best salted caramel I've ever had I'm keenly disappointed by energy bars and meal replacement bars that say they're salted caramel and they really don't come up to par this one has a deep rich caramel flavor I think in any of that funky background tastes from the other flavors this if I buy this bar again it's gonna be salted caramel they do that good a job on it I think if you like salted caramel full disclosure I'm a huge fan of caramel I think the world would be a better place with more caramel and butterscotch why are more things flavored with butterscotch butterscotch an old timey flavor good Laura I saw my father talking about licorice chocolate mint likewise it's way up there on the list nice pronounced mint flavor and I already like to chocolate chocolate they do a good job on that so those two now it's all coarse personal preference so I would suggest if your student trying these bars you want a non caffeine energy bar and you're looking for a bar these kind of nutrient profile get the variety pack that's exactly what I did and I'll have a link to that down in the description all right so what about texture let's take a quick look at that it's your basic rectangle bar not surprising I would put it in kind of the chewy cakey category not super chewy not stick to your teeth chewy but a nice soft kind of texture to it to break apart breaks apart fine holds together just fine see some of that I think this little chocolate liqueur spots into it this is the peanut butter flavor nothing objectionable about the texture that I find so to sum up this is a perfectly fine energy bar I have used this pre-workout and I do think it's readily available nutrients it seems to help it doesn't jazz you up like caffeine but it does help the flavors are very particularly depending on your taste and the flavor you choose in this bar if you like one flavor does not mean you're gonna like the others and vice versa so again if you want to give it a try definitely I recommend the variety pack if you ever tried these bars could you let me know in the comments I like to feel what other people have to say or any other kind of bar you think works well two I'm constantly reviewing these things in fact if you're interested you hit that subscribe button in the alert Bell if you don't need the alert Bell you will never see me again it's just how YouTube works we do not only nutrients and reviews but we also do exercise and motivation so thanks very much for watching and do take care [Music]", "3HjzHQBUePk": "[Music] good morning everyone as you can tell from what is behind me I'm here with the majority of my enough letters and I thought I would do a case of all of them with some oatmeal that I made this morning since most people like to eat nut butter with oatmeal so instead of having my usual breakfast bake I might have oatmeal instead I organized them into are like the protein butter and these are being non-routine nut butters I'll rate all of them in terms of taste and consistency texture I don't think I can really do consistency because as you know I like to have the oil separate from the bottom so that when I use a nut butters I'm only in that disk part then I'm usually interpreted with yogurt or like I'm kinky right so I like the six part because it marks like his let's line it for your cheeks is fun part you're not eating it with um feet but wheel but when I first open them I did have an all consistency so I can give you a rating based on what I remember so I decided I know this is not count as like a protein of Hood and I've talked about it a lot the consistency of this one is extremely liquidy at Miami nutritive it's only one ingredient on roasted almonds and a salt no sugar this takes it this is definitely a 10 out of 10 out of all of you know hundred even error also fancied this one is still my favorite severe Newton upper a new to the network world this doesn't want to start with this affront ah so next up we also have the Trader Joe's crunchy almond butter alphabets in a version I then open that one yet and intellect what a difference because it contains less than 1% of drivers in cashews I guess that 1% really contributes to differing the taste but a lot of people recommended the crunchy ones so in the Nestle I think assault one might taste different it doesn't have as much as a pureness has left your almond butter and I'm even definitely more of a sweet version because the crunchy bits sort of getting your teeth it's argument a nine point five out of ten to perseverance now we'll get into the actual protein education the first one I have it from reliance choice and it was the medical device tax this is the spread toast peanut butter and the consistency has favors are pretty interesting like it's not smooth because you can see chunks of peanut mix like all chunks of peanut peanut just chunks of peanut but they're very small and they're kind of in this vicious liquid not a liquid is a vicious oil in our minds the French toast super is not my favorite I dedicate that it just tastes like a little peanut butter it doesn't taste like french toast I think that's another problem with a lot of method they have fancy names but they don't actually taste like that so I'll be rating I'll give you comments on that as well the six point five out of ten next one is like the label is kind of gone but this is Alliance choice birthday cake on peanut butter have to say consistency at the rhythm and I definitely like this flavor course it's kind of almost a puzzle I was saving the last bit for this video no Alliance twiddlin very nice because apparently your syllabus like super food is a biotic will have a much fresher taste in such a birthday cake I don't think it tastes like birthday cake but it definitely doesn't taste like an average peanut butter it tastes like very sort of a millage seven point five out of ten now we're moving on to the box one and I made biology's eyes on the pump Nicholas didn't give away that's why there's all of them recep is white chocolate and personally I got these I'm a very conceive of a difference between a white chocolate red velvet and the chocolate spread but I realized the rest of the white chocolate one it has more creamy like milky taste on the table pick one has a much more defined chocolate flavor and the red velvet has just unlike something in between and all of the buffets ones they have a case like this I think it's the type of way that they use they just have like all the protein nut butters depending on the brand have a certain taste and the texture of all the fuss big ones is sort of pretty the pended you like that my sometimes it feels like you can taste the sugar crystals or but otherwise if you stir it well is pretty creamy white chocolate I wanted you get used to the protein cake at first I didn't like it by gradually a kind of customer and I'm relatively like it now in terms of rating it only in the buff based section the white chocolate one is probably my third favorite maybe as overall I would give this a 8 out of 10 FFP have chocolate chip butter insistent cookie form and it was really delicious this one tastes like it has melted chocolate in it which isn't the same place to go Kay with both I think my taste better would like a banana eight points lie on I like this one equally with a white chocolate line I used to like cement about the time to my Christmas steps is a red velvet and this one with a creamier this is pretty average like if you're exciting on which chocolate one to get out of these three you can either if you're really like into chocolate I reckon this one if you're really into white chocolate I'll get this or if you're somewhere in between I would get this one just to the point five houses in I made one and it's not needs to be my favorite or to do with my oats well I don't like crazy now the cinnamon raisin flavor is actually really good in this month I'll give it at eight plus five out of ten is my least favorite of the peanut butter ones it's a pumpkin spice one still completely school and I had one it was unpleasant I would try it again like the pumpkin spice and kind of bitter maybe since I boats are updating it will taste better I don't like it maybe you like it not as bad as remember it is just not favourable next up we have a second doodle I'm going to say this does not taste like snickerdoodle it does not taste like a snickerdoodle cookie although there's maker doodle cookies that they make like a fortune cookies that taste like executed it went to be put a regular on the letter but left here and more gritty seven out of ten hello with the buffeting was baked to earth tend to like stick security but likes a little like gritty sings excess we have the cookie almond butter I thought it was going to be something - a cookie butter but it's more like a chocolatey almond butter because it does have to be chocolate chips in it so it's not really cooking whether it's just chocolate almond butter pretty average of argument line 6 2010 necklace it's a birthday cake logical life design because it actually seems like birthday cake or a lot better in our life choice it has a very weak taste like if you smell it it's not like lemon like that crunch birthday bars but it actually have section of like birthday cake now what is my extruding it just like a very very sweet vanilla taste and are something a birthday cake juice 8.5 out of 10 because it doesn't a job of the flavor but it's not like a personal favorite okay I think this is my least favorite along with the pumpkin spice it's the coffee being on and butter and it has my little coffee granules inside but it's just unpleasant I don't it's also flaw and I don't like it at all it's extremely bitter as well our gifts is like a one out of ten except we have our beautiful Lincoln because it's relatively lower in fat high ranking and proteins this is the salted caramel any salted caramel toffee crunch are their most popular flavors I think they taste pretty similar and the consistency well it's obviously separate but these are like very very smooth and well blended however in the dark and I bought some them you can taste the crystal level defuse the verge of Iowa call it can be nice it's fun to do you want to like spice the sugar crystals in happen also that if you want something a bit smoother yeah absolutely like these doesn't really trick myself in caramel so I give this one an 8.5 out of 10 it is poppy crunch I think I need to like copy crunch more than how comparable I first tried it I think this one tends to its tablets they all have a little shimmer let me just look at the bottom to Jory I just really like this one more than this well Carol is more buttery and it does have been talking flavors I really enjoyed that 9xn lastly we have the sesame cranberry most ages underrated it has like Stephanie seeds and the cranberries I don't like cranberries I also just take them out it's a very nice combination like I didn't know Stephanie cran butter with the thing but I like this music so it's interesting combination I wouldn't say I'm wild about it it's all hung up that day out of 10 so Alden dusted more ones toffee crunch estate it has less we have you natural and pretty slim if you need brownie batter and Tuscan tiramisu granddaughter this is almond butter and it is a peanut butter and these are all begin ones and they do keep poking so as I was saying how all of the brands have their own cheese because they get different proteins this one has a more icky not like piece it just has how I describe more plants like grass doesn't taste like crap but it just tastes more nutty even though it's not obviously but nuts but it takes it has a distinct I not I'm sorry but like a very satisfying chase that I like so for the brownie batter one it doesn't taste like brownie batter makes happy vanilla maple frosting one this is probably my favorite along with this more flavor this month just tastes like a chocolate version of it eight out of ten and they all have an extremely creamy like extremely clean television premiere than the cost so all in butter is just so smooth and like very pretty and this has been Tuscan tiramisu it doesn't taste bad I did have a strange cases on the paper tiramisu either I don't know what to test cutest for but I would give this one a 6.5 and this is a vanilla almond butter hi this is a new job I haven't opened it but I've gone through this very fast and I think this is one of their most popular flavors and everyone really loved it it doesn't have a maple flavor but it kind of has a consistency about frosting and it's sort of immediately given on consignment in so if you're new to these Naturals I would recommend either the vanilla one or creamy smart you smell it it just happens I can smell pee protein it just fill my sin and the consistency is like extremely and amazing it also doesn't taste like s'mores but it has been very smoky it has kind of a clubbing as with marshmallows you don't really get the peanut parts don't think you would be able to tell that a peanut butter I would give this one a nine out of 10 I also really love this later it's not to Karen off it actually makes my salted caramel online but after more time this one pairs really did with oats I just have this every day with my vote Neal I guess at bright next is legendary foods this one is not exactly a protein peanut butter but it's kind of circling in that community of like fitness community on Instagram I also have the pecan one becomes top I want it nice a little jar and their thing I like about legendary food is there a cure is very during week extremely true to flavor to it and like I usually all my life starts is very crisp well I just smells like Cinnabon like if you walked onto Cinnabon in the US in a wall this is what this is what hope I post blueberries like cinimon bib on plus a blueberry not I disappointed you have blueberry cinnamon but like I just know this forever I wish I'd like to handle that with this flavor some people like to say how's it going consistency and I would agree that it does I used to like a big spoonful of this is my yogurt and I but I think it only tastes good and small now because you eat like a lot of it at lunch or you don't pair it with something it starts to get extremely doughy and let plus and then if you have you know small bite I think you missed it well we for help it it would have a more creamy consistency it looks very smooth but when you taste it you can taste very small strips of cashews so this one can attend moving on to our non protein that butter perfectly has been naturally more a hazelnut chocolate spread and they come in a nice sweet I like to take you on traveling and it's like I'm skipping us I'm not to open it but it's like super delicious it doesn't exactly if you'd like to tell them to tell us a bit over on overwhelmingly sweet but this is like a very good job of copying like cool chocolate hazelnut things this is very smooth and creamy and liquidy as long as we need it well but there are like pieces of slack lights just watch the whole black page inside which is a bit weird if you don't like to have them plastic stuff in your teeth but otherwise I'll give this like a 9 point a tension since we have our well friends so we try is the sugar cookies kinda fun the while friend ones are all very creamy and if you make friend well I did thing with a sugar cookie one it doesn't taste like a sugar cookie it's actually like version of video imagine it being born light and vanilla tea but this one too well you have cinnamon in coconut but it is more heavy and comfort and because it's like the seasonal edition it changed my life as didymus you might have cut that sticker noodleness just a more cinnamony cinnamon cookie like a sort of like a cookie butter but not entirely like it's still a peanut butter together then we have the other seasonal flavor which is needed spread peanut butter I think this one only tastes good when you pair it with things that are related to Gingerbread just like my top tip on peanut butter oatmeal is have it with pumpkin pancakes I think in origin like this one you have to really last each risk because the gingerbread player like the gingerbread spices they're extremely strong you have too much it can be a bit bitter but well these are baffling I make cookies with this once if you make cookies with them so it is really been to the gingerbread is very very accurate 8.5 out of 10 then we have a few punches slice 1 and the chocolate chip has been quite peanut butter is my favourite well friends flavors a lot like when you first open it there's tons of peanut chocolate chocolate chip they melted so as you begin during the oil and the bottom part together they just incorporate into this super creamy mixture so the color of this one is darker than normal pumpkin spice butter you can see um this one is so much richer and just perfect and then it so it's been a boost and I really like the something spiked with this one because it's not overpowering and I feel like sometimes if you try to make pumpkin spice plus between flesh chocolate or you try to combine two flavors it's hard to distinguish one from the other while at the chocolate flavor gets lost but this one you can actually still taste the chocolate in it and the pumpkin spice this one gets 10 out of 10 this is the pumpkin spice one this another stronger flavor of the peanut butter probably gets a 8 to 5 of 10 moving on to will be a lot to pursue spreaders this one is the blueberry cinnamon and walnuts I are going to like the kalam ones because they're not your average like flavor like vanilla chocolate they have interesting fruit and nut combination and they're not just one type of nut my this one has the element butter and walnut even though you can't take your mama I think I really like blueberry muffins because this one along with the legendary seedless there is we have a blueberry muffin like Merry Christmas it's just so comforting it's like a spice booth earring up it is and have a thin amount like bakery type bakery start as we ran off and chase but the spice of different is spiced very well nine point eight out of ten next we have the fruit and cashew butter by talking strawberries and chips and this one if you smell it it's not like strawberry jam but you like for our jam that you're using it kind of has the creaminess of the white chocolate but it doesn't taste like white chocolate you just to eat like a white chocolate bar but ah I [Music] can't really taste that hazelnut or Amna but earnest a bit one but if you like coffee then I think you would like you more than I do i unit is my photos next up we have the gene all homemade hunter and this one is the cashew nut cashew butter this is just like they're regular cashew butter just with a bit of vanilla at first I wasn't accustomed to the taste the cashew butter because I never had cashew butter before and just tastes like your typical cashew butter not very vanilla Eenie give us one in eight out of ten and their other cashew butter is cinnamon molasses I'll try at this one so there are good actually I'll understand one because I mean if you just wanted a cashew butter you just go by like the cashew butter from Costco and I appreciate with a sprint sandwiches one that at least four nasty molasses of ground cinnamon flavors it's not as pronounced as like cinnamon molasses kind of flavor but you could get a hint of spice so I would do this one a nine out of ten did I get this one okay I'll give it a nine point five higher than my eight to one since we have the this is their peanut butters it's the bourbon pecan peanut butter I first opened it it has like chunks of stick on like the peanut butter is smooth it just has the chunky to conduct I'm also not sure what Cervantes like I think then it comes with the huns add a nice flavor but if you don't eat the pecans it it's sort of keeping your normal peanut butter serologies like Ravana sings of alcohol peanut butter is pretty good like you are just to rate it as when compared to other peanut butter selectively it's on a seven point five out of ten when fighting is the wedding as well crunch peanut butter and this one how to chop those pretzels in it too even though these two are both peanut butter it's another superb peanut butter flavor and it's a bit more bright and surprising I guess that's what weddings are for unique chrome TV arnesto and Nestle is one of my favorite brands because it's like this licorice is so good right now I don't have them to beat them all but I have to have the original creamy original crunchy also the peanut creamy and being very very cool I'm very psyched up reporters witness oh I got this last year I think I've been painting it ever since I just love it they want the nuts no butter it's the scrunchie one and the smooth one they have even other negative thing nuts they have a different flavor which i think is really awesome and their cottage is not exactly crunchy just has I thought the speech this person sign onions well this one I say like 10 out of 10 for taste texture here super crunchy and also just nutrition wise you have all of your hand if you're allergic to peanuts different create I thought that's how the jar upside down the next up we have the chocolate one it's one right now it's pretty hard but we microwave it it will smooth in there like smelt of it put the chocolate inside and it's been pretty much taste like a chocolate version of the soup point of this I think like all of the methyl ones you can't go around like the peanut one if you don't know why peanut butter I would recommend the next man because it the steam has a few names but it's not so pronounced because I know sometimes the peanut butter should have a strange like peanut he came like you've done a nut it has like it's not as pure at almond butter let me go I know this is like Tennant also I'm running out of batteries but really quickly this is the Nicole lock top top a deluxe red pin this one has like warm this one is more similar to Nutella and tempers the texture and length macros but if organically also a dairy-free version this is being treated just except better and it just um it's in this rut our selection or not so but it that still has its own unique flavor it is funky it tastes more like almond butter mixed with other nuts with contrasting I actually this line must be extremely creamy like no matter how much you don't mix it this one August and I [Music] really really love it honey your at Trader Joe's take the front up I think this one is cheaper than the Nestle we have our lonely coconut butter any one time I tried to microwave it so it was students but then it ended up turning the whole thing brown and you get bird inside of the microwave but then it had like a nice toasty flavor now like a roasted coconut you don't eat just one actually but try it anyways super creamy and like super rich which is like why yes it is coconut oil it tastes like coconut oil didn't like white chocolate form there's only if I talk about they're just so rich in puny I've just won a nine point five ten and lastly we have this one which I haven't opened yet firm but it's the naturally nutty peanut butter and chocolate butter toffee on a time real quick yeah completely full it's not sort of like the original depositor [Music] this one executed a similar to the bus bake cinnamon raisin peanut butter I don't think it take very chocolaty Tati I think that nothing more does the background as a coffee flavor I'll give this one a super point flat okay okay that's all for now I actually have a bunch of other nut butters but they're kind of just the almond butter cashew butter peanut butter like a whisper friend and some can be fit also like a bunch of cookie butter - butter just really good but I need occasionally because it's not lutein free so I get with lega enzyme help me digest better and I hope you guys enjoyed watching this pepper collection I think I'll do some more in that photo reviewing because I'm a hydrating operative you don't taste it but now I get to clean up all of these so you guys want to enjoy watching this video give it a thumbs up comment down below what your favorite nut

one's ever gonna measure out this much everyone's gonna gain weight and get addicted to peanut butter and it's gonna be a vicious cycle and we're gonna sell millions of dollars of this stuff screw you peanut butter manufacturers I want to eat this much actually I want to eat this much it's like they want us to gain weight eating this stuff", "o8wN4p0mJ5o": "what is up you guys welcome back to my channel and if you are new there my name is Kendra and in today's video I am just going to be showing you guys for healthy snacks that I normally eat so just the veggies some pretty cut and pre-wash celery and it was really really good this brand that is by and I think I'm worth about 250 at the grocery store eat healthy and these are the nutrition effects you guys see those yeah so there's only 15 calories per two sticks and Gardena some zero except for theone starting out which is also very low in the sugars all you want protein why and with the Saudi I just simply pair this nitro box almond butter which I ordered it from the nature box website and it is really really good it is a little bit pricey but it is extremely delicious and that's how many tutos phones serving don't mind I'll stay ahead in my lunch pail and I guess I don't have to let's move on on the right so no oil but you know what so basically it's it is really smaller though so well but basically is just 2 tablespoons per serving and it is 16 grams of thick and as far as the protein is just by grams but sweet almond is healthier than regular peanut butter and it is not super straight at all as far as the sugar it is on the two ramps but is really delicious and you must refrigerate it after you open it but yeah also I have some scary and basically they're just like carrot sticks and their butter plant called Bolthouse farms and I just basically just pick out a couple but I used three actually for this video Wow usually about two but I just took three days out wash down here with them cut them a half and I just prepare it with this Boathouse five cucumber wrenchy over dressing to me this is very healthy as I make 35 calories and also is on a tool and grams effete the sodium maybe kind of high to some people but yeah and it is two tablespoons servi I don't get a lot of dressing so for me it would be like a little bit less but I'll show you guys how I package all of this stuff up shortly and I just have these Wheat Thins veggie toasted chips these are really really good if you are someone who don't really care for vegetables and you eat their communities for a corner hair um 120 calories the sodium is not too high so yeah the carbs not extra high either if you feel more comfortable you might have of these and go ahead cuz it is a lot they see what these look like and these retail for to come around but usually when I buy them their own stuff for like 250 and you don't also find them for a little bit less if your stores having like some kind of promotion sometimes you will catch a coupon but yeah there's a one percent whole grain as you guys can see and so I'm gonna take you guys over to the other section and I will show you guys find it's like packaged all these up and I'll also I'm going to be showing you guys to horse neigh so right here you can basically see how I put everything together so right here I just have the weekends toasted chips and I have it in my little stores Canada came by my pill and it has like pre-made measurements I'm sorry I don't know if you guys might see it but this has like the actual but it's has like half a cup and like one cup and this isn't it like exactly one cup but as you'll see you get a lot well actually once there's a lot is what I'd like to say oh yeah and they're very fairly site so yeah good nice decent amount and as far as like the force to make also something that's by night robotics like and when I look if you're someone that likes a lot of light sweet stuff this is like a good website to order formally comes light sweets and this is just the blueberry on the quinoa bites and I come on a package like this and these are viewed nutrition facts you get 3/4 cup I just like the camera and hope echinus eat out a few I will say part of like after like three or four you will be satisfied but it's depends on who you are is this 7 grams of fat and the carbs are not that bad I mean 15 grams of carbs which is only 5% of your daily value at a protein is four so it was really really good they're just like little bite-size literally you can just pop them on your muffin you'll be good and like I was showing you like this is how I did the celery and I just cut off the little tips of them because because at first they would not fit into the container but that's how do you look and to me this basically equals two whole stalks of celery so it's four pieces in here I got two underneath there you guys can't really see it that well but it's just two at the bottom there to stack on top and then this one I think here like with the lid closed and everything as far as I feel like the the big squirrely over the actual square container but once you get ready to eat it you can this your little dipping storage container onto the side and you put exploit some raisins on the side like get a video a thumbs up if you guys make ants on the lock when you were a child or still part eat it to this day I didn't have any raisins but that'd be something good to like put on the sty right here when you get ready to serve and also like I said this will come out once you actually put the lid on top of your vegetables but just like a little storage container that I use to how the almond butter you put like your dressings in here and stuff like that so that is how the almond butter looks you guys and the good thing is that these are like stackable so you can like stick your little different cups on top of each other and the others like click into each other so that's a good thing and I just like this the convenience like its you're just using way less space and yeah you got your dip got your snack and you're good to go and these are to carry it so like 40 carats um I just cut those in half and I just met him to that side so you probably give up a good 3 bites out of it and I just cut up I suppose you guys about the reason I said you look and in here I just have the yogurt dressing and here and I just picked it up like halfway you probably won't use it all I can and tell you if this is exactly 2 tablespoons but you probably want to use it like you don't know how many carrots to use all this if you are a heavy dressing eater then you may want for your home have a container up but obviously if you're the only person that is dipping out of this convenient is pop it in the fridge and have fresh veggies with it next time you have a snake oh you don't have to throw it out like that's gonna be what I do since I am the only person will be dipping in my coat so I just keep it so yeah but if you like sharing with a friend we all know that rule you know you did both ants don't sing you guys to turned out with it so therefore you can share with your friends yeah aww you got the same Cup just dip both hands so when you bite it you won't be sitting there tough some ohh just step up and get it over with so you guys these are the four healthy snacks that I have once again tonight robots and blueberry almond quinoa bites some weak things toasted ships and they're the garden veggie flavor and then I have some celery sticks with some nature box almond butter then I have some carrot sticks that we couldn't have with the boathouse go redressing and the flavor of that oh my god I can take because I think you like this so much ricotta no it's the regular cucumber orange so yeah that is the flavor that's not travel cuddle is also really good too but I think that has like way more fat and like a little bit more calories but anyway you guys these are snacks and I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you guys want to see more videos like pertaining to fool a not arrested at good stuff then make sure you guys let me know down below give this video a thumbs up and make sure you subscribe and I'll see you guys next time bye", "QjWZc5_GkGM": "hello everyone welcome to our webinar hosted by pro can app presented by me faith root Lama so who is Pro Kenna founded in 2013 Pro Kenna Laboratories has been on the forefront of cannabinoid research and development providing controlled dosage applications of its medicinal products we're continually studying you know the different ratios with the different cannabinoid formulations as well to further advance medical initiatives hemp and CBD have shown to contain many medicinal properties and is the fastest expansion segment in the natural products industry as we all know you know if the 80 plus known cannabinoids CBD is the most prominent it's non psychoactive and shown to have a great medical efficacy as well we have tons of research and studies which we'll go over in a few minutes and then also linked on our website as well broken has over available in over 600 stores nationwide ranging from health food stores to mom-and-pop stores vitamins sports supplement stores to independent pharmacies what is cannabidiol CBD CBD is a non psychoactive molecule that can be derived from either cannabis or agricultural hemp and it plays a vital role in holistic treatment extensive preclinical research and some clinical studies have shown that CBD has strong antioxidant anti-inflammatory anticonvulsant antidepressant antipsychotic antitumoral and neuro protective qualities before we dive deep into the science behind CBD let's cover some ground with the foundation the endocannabinoid system or the ECS which has been recently recognized as an important modulatory system in the function of brain endocrine and immune tissues the endocannabinoid system regulates numerous physiological processes including intestinal function glucose metabolism energy homeostasis and lipid synthesis endocannabinoids go in reverse direction traveling from post synaptic neuron to presynaptic neuron this process is known as the retrograde feedback and enable control of neural transmission within the ACS is a series of cell receptors that naturally respond to the cannabinoids by cb1 and cb2 receptors cb1 receptors are located mainly in the brain and the central nervous system and mainly responsible for reducing inflammation regulating movement and posture control as well as sensory perception memory and cognitive function while the CBT receptors are mostly found in the peripheral organs especially cells associated with the immune system and they're found throughout the gastrointestinal system where they modulate intestinal inflammatory response they are also involved in mediating analgesic effects of peripheral nervous system now that we have a brief overview of the basics let's dive in a little bit deeper the clinical endocannabinoid deficiency the easiest theory of disease is termed clinical endocannabinoid deficiency when the body does not produce enough endocannabinoids or cannot regulate them properly one is more susceptible to illnesses that affect one or several of the functions mentioned above CEC D could underlie the pathophysiology of migraine fibromyalgia irritable bowel syndrome and other functional conditions alleviated by CBD cannabinoids have similarly demonstrated the ability to blocks spinal peripheral and gastrointestinal mechanisms that promote pain in headache fibromyalgia IBS and related disorders there's a link on there you're welcome to click on it after the webinar to read up on the study more in detail cannabinoid receptors are Co localized with dopamine receptors suggesting that cannabinoids affect the release of dopamine perhaps this is why we have had such great positive feedback in our surveys in regards to anxiety and depression moving along let's cover the signs behind cannabidiol how CBD works with the endocannabinoid system CBD works like a switch to turn on the regulatory endocannabinoids system as it helps the ECS maintain equilibrium it prevents the breakdown of endocannabinoids is critical for neuromodulation and homeostasis thereby making it more available to the body unlike THC cannabidiol does not attach directly to any of the receptors but instead indirectly activates endocannabinoids signaling by suppressing the enzyme fatty acid amide hydro zillah's f aah CBD also stimulates the release of other endocannabinoids that activate both the cb1 and cb2 receptors so in a nutshell when we take CBD we are supplementing a naturally occurring cannabinoid system so how does CBD interact with receptors it has an indirect effect on the cb1 receptor by stopping the enzymatic breakdown of n + amide allowing it to stay in the system longer and providing medical benefits CBD helps to mediate the release of cytokine from the immune cells in a matter that helps to reduce inflammation and pain CBD includes stimulation of vanilla pain receptors trpv1 receptor which are known to mediate pain perception inflammation and body temperature as well CBD may exert its anti-anxiety effect by activating adenosine receptors which play a significant role in cardiovascular function and cause broad and anti-inflammatory effect throughout the body at high concentrations CBD directly activates the v h t1 a serotonin receptor thereby conferring an antidepressant effect it's also been found to be an antagonist in the new third cannabinoid receptor GPR v v which if simulated may contribute to all stuporous CBD use has also been researched to be beneficial for kidney fibrosis inflammation metabolic syndrome overweight obesity anorexia modification of osteoarthritic and other musculoskeletal conditions our source and process resource are raw materials from Europe use regular co2 extraction and

appreciate our consumers feedback and experience from taking pro Kanna and encourage everyone to fill out a survey on our website we have a few surveys from some naturopathic doctors and from some general users as well we have doctor in Texas who uses the CBD balance eight milligrams for some of her patients who have digestive and anxiety issues and a doctor in Virginia gave his wife some CBD complete for anxiety and reported she felt amazing and felt tension disappear and stress relieved a doctor in Oregon has had a patient with rheumatoid arthritis you know for over five years and had never experienced such amazing relief after taking just one CBD complete 20 milligram soft gel in our general user surveys we have a user in South Carolina who said his mother who has stage four cancer has been using the CBD complete 20 milligrams for about a month and a half and has found a great relief and then he started using our eight milligrams for anxiety and noticed it really helped him so now he wants to start offering it as an online vitamin store and I also received feedback recently from a consumer who had been in pain management for over 15 years they said they started taking the CBD complete for about less than a month and were able to reduce their pain medication by about 70% I personally use the CBD complete 20 milligrams you know when I have the occasional cramps anxiety PTSD I'm you know not only experienced great relief but fully functional as well and focused let's cover some studies and research behind CBD GW Pharmaceuticals in Washington conducted a CE study and found CBD to be highly effective in the treatment of pain and inflammation the department of neuroscience did a study and found CBD reduced anxiety in patients with social anxiety disorder and PTSD as well as OCD the University of Saint Paulo and the National Institute for Translational Medicine found that CBD may be better than antidepressants because it acts quickly and does not cause side-effects or withdrawal symptoms now cancer we have multiple studies regarding cancer on our website which I highly suggest you check out one study by the California Pacific Medical Center suggested that CBD turns off the gene involved in the spread of breast cancer they found that CBD inhibits I D - 1 an action that prevents cancer cell from travelling long distances to distant tissues therefore CBD stops the metastasis of cancer cells some more studies relating to CBD the department of psychology and neuroscience in canada found that CBD produces its own antiemetic and anti nausea effect this could be very helpful for you know patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment then the Department of physiological chemistry in Johannes Gutenberg University Germany you noted to study relating to CBD and gastrointestinal health in Italy at the national research council they found that CVD can be employed to [ __ ] beta cell damage in type 1 diabetes there was another study related to diabetes done in Maryland where they found that CBD possesses potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in diabetic and diabetes complications now let's cover some research regarding seizures and neurological disorders such as autism and the University of California and Davis CBD effective in the treatment of autism they found that CBD regulates emotion and focus acting as a neuro protective against further brain degradation and then there's several studies regarding epilepsy and seizures this particular one is from the University of Reading in UK and they demonstrated the potential of CBD as a novel anti epileptic drug in the treatment of generalized seizures then also here we have the department of neuroscience in Brazil again where they found that patients treated with CBD Parkinson's disease patients expressed significantly too I mean total scores and well-being and quality of life and then there is a journal of neuroscience one regarding Alzheimer's as well thank you everyone for attending our webinar you are welcome to download the digital version of this file to access the study links as well as the FA cues we are our website feel

edibles or tko in general they also they're a black market company they make edibles and also cartridges um i'm not a fan at all of their carts but uh i think their edibles are pretty decent um nutritional facts nine servings per container serving size one square um it comes in a three by three row um you can pause it there for all the rest of it 0.7 grams of stuff because the serving size is so small tko extract oil 35 milligrams per um little square you can pause that there for the ingredients if you need to i've reviewed these before and i believe last time um this packaging was not black i believe it was white but now it's like a matte black with a shiny silver tko and 315 written down because um total milligrams is 315. and i'm a big fan of this chocolate chip chocolate dipped cherry flavor um it honestly is mostly just milk chocolate but the only really difference is uh you flip it around as you can see there's some crispy crispy chunks in there um i guess i'm assuming there's probably cinnamon on them or something but yeah there's another one right there i'm honestly a big fan of this flavor uh it's kind of reminds me of like a crunch bar or something i definitely like this flavor more than some of the other tko ones i've tried but yeah they definitely work efficiently but you never know uh make sure you get these from someone you obviously trust and everything and be very careful with the dosha dosage just try one wait a while and then try more if you need to but um you never really know i forget if they have test results for these or not but um you never exactly know um from bar to bar i'm sure they're not exactly 315 milligrams each some might be 300 some might be 330 or something so if you're sensitive to edibles definitely um take less than you need to and then go from there and on on the front of the chocolates um got tko just just this bottom corner one says tko and the rest just say 35 mg with a raindrop but um if you tried these let me know what you think of them let me know your favorite flavor my dog just tried to get in there i'm sorry but um let me know what flavor you like out of all of these because there are a lot of tko flavors um i have a ton of videos like this on my channel and yeah peace out", "hbjvNpQ8B4Q": "our do deliveries presents the review of Corolla edibles coming in five different potencies for their

at Bristol Wellness Center a great head of", "O8EtzXZvhcI": "okay so tonight we're going to be talking about osteoporosis so osteoporosis is it all about milk what is osteoporosis and is it only about drinking more milk who is at risk and how can you minimize your risk and what do you do if you don't want to or don't like to drink milk okay so are you at risk so here are some risk factors that make you the most at risk so if you're 65 or older if you're underweight if you have a family history of osteoporosis if you have early menopause if you don't get enough calcium and vitamin d in your diet or through supplements if you smoke if you have too much caffeine or alcohol if you have certain medical conditions such as celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease or if you use certain medications such as cortisone prednisone or other glucocorticoids for a long time how can you prevent it so getting enough calcium but that doesn't mean it has to be all from milk so because osteoporosis makes your bones thin and brittle having enough calcium in vitamin d helps to keep them from breaking so up until our adult years our bones are forming so it's even more important for children young ones to get enough calcium so they build up those stores so how much calcium is needed so on average and average adults about a thousand to 1200 milligrams does a baby need the same calcium as an adult so definitely not so infants zero to six months need about 200 milligrams the maximum would be a thousand milligrams 7 to 12 months 260 maximum 1500 and then you can see how it shifts as adults as we get older so adults 19 to 50 years need about a thousand milligrams and the maximum is 2500 and then a little bit older adults 51 to 70. need about a thousand to 1200 and the maximum is 2 000. so there is a maximum so keep that in mind too much is not always a good thing and is there a maximum yes so too much calcium can be harmful and what what is the reason why well too much can cause kidney stones it can put you at risk for heart disease especially if if it's from a supplemental form so is it true that taking calcium supplements can give me a heart attack so in recent years there have been several studies that have seen a link between the use of calcium supplements and a higher risk of cardiovascular or heart disease so yes it's true there is a potential risk the research suggests that taking calcium supplements this would be high amounts of it of course can increase calcium levels in the blood leading to a buildup of calcium and blood vessels but they aren't certain if it's from the supplements alone or is it because women with osteoporosis are usually advised to take calcium supplements and these women are also more likely to have heart disease because of the well-known association between bone health and heart health so osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease they have many shared risk factors including smoking lack of physical activity and an unhealthy diet so the research isn't isn't clear but at the end of the day i always recommend if you're able to get it from food first if you really do have to take one i would suggest take no more than 500 milligrams a day from supplemental form you don't absorb more than that much at a time anyways so try to take it in liquid form as well especially if you have any stomach concerns the liquid form tends to cause less constipation less irritation for those with sensitive stomachs try to get one with k2 vitamin k2 to help the absorption and if you can get one that also has vitamin d so that's just less pills to take so you don't have to also take a vitamin d so this is for example one that is out there that's a liquid that has the calcium and k2 and also magnesium because the magnesium helps to prevent the constipation it helps your bowels to work more softly so what are the foods highest in calcium so there are a number of them besides just milk like sardines dark green vegetables certain nuts tofu [Music] so here's an example of how many milligrams so if you compare for example a cup of milk a cup of milk is about 300 milligrams that's the highest source of foods that we think about but it's not the highest of all foods because if you look at six ounces of plain yogurt it also has six hundred three hundred if you look at a can of sardines it's also 300 if you look at calcium fortified almond milk it's also about 300 calcium fortified orange juice firm tofu half a cup of firm tofu is also about that amount pink canned salmon with bones about 200 so still pretty high and then there's other foods that have moderate amounts but they do add up so if you were to eat a diet with lots of green vegetables let's say a couple cups a day you would be getting a couple hundred milligrams there as well so a thousand milligrams of calcium what does that look like in a day so for example let's say in the morning with breakfast you had a cup of plant-based milk with your cereal or your smoothie or just on its own so that's 300 milligrams let's say for your snack you had a serving of almonds a serving meaning like 10 to 15 almonds a quarter of a cup that's 100 milligrams then let's say with your lunch or your dinner you cooked some broccoli or collards um that would be about 150 milligrams then for your lunch maybe a cup of spinach with your salad 200 milligrams your afternoon snack maybe you included an orange 50 milligrams let's say in your tea or in your coffee you put a tablespoon of black strap molasses that's 75 milligrams and maybe for your lunch and your sandwich you had some sardines 200 milligrams so that would be example what a thousand milligrams could look like so what if i don't eat meat so what are some vegan foods high in calcium so we talked about collard greens and some of those green vegetables also sesame seeds tahini swiss chard brazil nuts celery they're not high you'd have to eat a fair amount of things like celery but each of these has about 100 milligrams per serving so it does add up so for example um here's a label of almond breeze almond milk so something like this wouldn't be an a a naturally high source of calcium but it is calcium fortified so when you look at the label you'll see 45 percent calcium so that means about 45 of your daily calcium needs are met by drinking a cup of this almond milk so you're probably getting about three 400 milligrams right there so similar to the cow's milk that we talked about so can't i just drink three cups of almond milk well i would say choose your plant milk wisely almond breeze for example is a more highly processed one compared to some of the others so to get some insight as to where those nutrients come from take a look at the ingredient list so for example this one includes calcium carbonate potassium citrate vitamin a pulmonary vitamin d2 and natural vitamin e so the high amounts of vitamins and nutrients are not from the almonds but they're added so those are all added nutrients but when nutrients come from real unprocessed or minimally processed foods they are accompanied by many non-essential but beneficial nutrients such as hundreds of flavonoids minerals antioxidants that you can't find in supplements and additives so nutrients processed in isolation into pills or additives are much less effective than from food itself that's why i always say food first if you're able to so it's almost like there's a certain synergy when you eat the food with all its vitamins and minerals so for example if you want vitamin c benefits it's much more beneficial to your body to eat an orange than to take a vitamin c pill and same thing goes for calcium so going for a natural source something coming from whole food rather than a source where calcium carbonate is added during the creation of that food will help your body to absorb it much better so if i am choosing a plant-based milk what should i look for so i would say first look for an unsweetened um almond milk or plant-based milk the unsweetened versions still have a very delicious sweet taste but without too much of the added sugars so what to look for is 10 grams of sugar or less ideally enriched nutrients so to make almond milk nutritionally comparable to the beverage you're substituting substituting it for like dairy milk the best almond milk brands will fortify their drinks with calcium vitamin a d and e and shortest ingredient list as possible so try to find an almond milk or plant-based milk with a shorter ingredient list and fewer ingredients added to it so while it's normal and totally safe to have a few stabilizers in there more than two or three is for the most part not necessary and if you can carrageenan free care gaining we don't know too much about it yet but it's a potentially inflammatory ingredient added to foods to thicken them to increase the shelf life so we're just not sure yet the safety of it long term most research has only been done on animals but still if you're able to find one for example califia farms has carrageenan free it would be a less processed option so so many plant-based milks it's making my head spin there's so many options so my choice for the best one i mentioned kalifia farm so this brand here it's my personal favorite first of all it tastes very creamy it doesn't have that artificial taste it's very smooth there's many options oat milk unsweetened almond milk cashew soy they even have a lower sugar eggnog so these you can find at a few different grocery stores whole foods choices save on foods and then we have our sunshine vitamin vitamin d so what is the role of vitamin d in in osteoporosis vitamin d helps your body to absorb calcium health canada recommends that all adults get at least 400 international units of vitamin d a day and unfortunately there's very few foods that have enough vitamin d in them to make an impact on your diet so the ones that do things like fatty fish like salmon tuna herring or sardines do egg yolks beef liver and fortified milk but those aren't foods that we eat every day in large amounts and you would need to drink four cups of milk per day and you would still be short so therefore most of us need a supplement of vitamin d and fortunately it's a very inexpensive supplement and if you're choosing one choose about a thousand international units a day is a good goal do i have to take vitamin d every day and what if i forget well the good thing is vitamin d so it's fat soluble so therefore it doesn't come out in your urine the way vitamin c or the b vitamins would so i know in long-term care facilities for example seniors are given 10 000 international units of vitamin d a week so that way it's just given once a week and your body stores it in in your adipose tissue of course this is different if you live in hawaii or a very tropical condition where there's a lot of sun but here in vancouver most of us aren't getting enough so if you want to take it weekly and that's easier for for you um you can do that because it's getting stored in your adipose tissue it isn't excreted out like the water-soluble vitamins so b12 it's also important for osteoporosis so get enough vitamin b12 if your levels of vitamin b12 are low that could increase your risk of osteoporosis so find food sources of vitamin b12 and aim for about 2.4 micrograms a day most people would be getting that amount through a varied diet but keep in mind if you're over the age of 50 our body absorbs less vitamin b12 so most people over age 50 would need potentially either a multivitamin with b12 in it or a b12 supplement on its own especially if you're vegan a vegan person would most likely need a b12 supplement and skip the salt shaker less salt for osteoporosis prevention so if you're at risk try to limit those high sodium foods eating high sodium foods can reduce your bone density so what are high sodium foods those would be those highly processed foods so things like cheese are very high sodium high salt deli meats uh pizza different sauces like gravies ketchup things like that soups salad dressings so remember when you're reading the food label the way to know if it's lower in sodium you'll see the percent dv that's percent daily value so look for five percent or less daily value for sodium and that's how you'll know it's a lower sodium choice so caffeine and alcohol so if you're at risk for osteoporosis try to limit caffeine doesn't mean to avoid it altogether but have no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day that would be equivalent to approximately two to three cups of coffee for adults and why mainly caffeine too much of it can leech calcium from the bones and smoking if you're at risk try it if you can to avoid smoking because at any age smoking can increase your bone loss and how can smoking affect your bones so it affects the body's ability to absorb calcium which can lead to lower bone density and weaker bones also nicotine has been shown to slow the production of the bone-forming cells that we need for healing and smoking also breaks down estrogen which is a key ingredient to building and maintaining a healthy skeleton so here's just an image of how your bones suffer when you smoke so it just shows how it um it almost slows down the hormone calcitonin which is what builds the bones it increases the hormone cortisol which leads to bone breakdown it can damage some of the blood vessels which interrupts the supply of blood to the bones and it can also nicotine can kill osteoblasts which are the cells that help to make bones so in all different ways it can can harm bone production what about caffeine how can caffeine affect our bones so some studies link caffeine consumption with negative effects on calcium metabolism and possibly that's related to caffeine increasing the loss of calcium in your urine and decreasing calcium absorption in the body so over time having less calcium available in the body can cause bone loss but if you get enough calcium in your diet then there's less need to worry so if you have a good calcium and vitamin d intake there's little reason for concern about moderate caffeine intake on your bones so emphasis on the word moderate of course so does this mean no more lattes for me so definitely not you don't need to give up your favorite drinks but maybe just change up your drink a little bit so if you find you're going over your limit for caffeine maybe a decaf version for less caffeine um you also get 300 milligrams calcium from the milk in the latte so maybe try having that decaf latte or try chai tea latte because chai tea would have tea has much less caffeine than coffee or you could try a coffee alternative altogether so there's a lot of different alternatives out there now for coffee for example like mushroom coffees they still have a small amount of caffeine but much less calf lib it's made from chicory root so there's no caffeine it comes from a plant source and it doesn't taste exactly like coffee but it it's somewhat similar gives you that same taste dandy blend is another one it's also made from from chicory root and barley roasted barley so it has somewhat of an aroma and feel of coffee and staying active so stay active and find something you enjoy you're more likely to stick to it so regular physical activity can help bring build strong muscles and bones and improve your balance so try to choose activities that include weight-bearing exercise that's the key for osteoporosis so weight-bearing would be things like running walking hiking low-impact aerobics dancing things like zumba tennis golf even resistance activities like lifting some light weights or push-ups stretching like yoga tai chi even qigong things like that or maybe joining an exercise class through the healthy body healthy mind program there are exercise classes which just like this are free so there's body fit delta move different ones you can enjoy on your own time and those are free and i've just included some high calcium recipes and you can always be in touch if you're interested i can send these to you but just an idea so something like broccoli kale or lentil soup so these recipes are found on cookspiration which is a website with some great healthy recipes so for example this one uses some onion garlic lentils and the broth has spinach different green vegetables so this is a great way to get a lot of those dark green vegetables which are hard to eat a lot of but when you're putting them in a soup it's sometimes easier to eat larger amounts of them because they're they're cooked and they're simmered down overnight oats so that's a way to get a lot of calcium and also a high fiber breakfast and it's very easy so basically it's one part rolled oats one part milk of your choice one part greek yogurt you mix them together store them in a container overnight and you can add cinnamon or chia seeds or any toppings you like in the morning calcium rich energy balls so this is a fun snack you can make with little ones if you have or just on your own so basically it's almonds dried apricots some type of nut butter almond butter or any nut butter you enjoy some sesame seeds which are high in calcium and then just some spices like cinnamon ginger and vanilla and basically you just roll them up and roll them in the sesame seeds and they make great little healthy snacks so in summary osteoporosis it's a complex disease with factors closely related to heart disease so keep in mind it's not only about drinking milk but about all those other factors that you would need to keep in balance for heart health as well because they are so related so if you had to choose two things i would say try to focus on maybe adding one more calcium-rich food to your diet maybe experiment adding sardines maybe a handful of almonds maybe a tablespoon of blackstrap molasses to replace your honey or sugar maybe having overnight oats and also make sure you're taking vitamin d the other thing i would emphasize trying to focus on is move move in a way that keeps you strong that you enjoy and that can help with your bone health and overall health as well so something to think about what is one step that that you can take to help prevent and maintain your bone maintain good bone health so any questions you have as usual you can always email them to me i'll open up the chat box now for any questions you", "cz2Dnsi8-90": "hey guys welcome to my

know what you wouldn't want to walk anywhere far on this Oh walk anywhere on any weed well yeah like some people are like some young people or like oh well go smoke a joint you know so-and-so's house and then we'll just go walk down to so on says those but that walk is gonna take you a long time to get there after you smell - George hmm if you don't feel like you feel like going Slovak sinks and that you review yet you do like kind of tons about attends yeah what do you intend on like my like my well I did it so I can read it so it's gonna be a tense everybody knows how the rating system works Donna would you guys understand what she was saying ten means it was good and one is not so good she said what number do you pick for the taste no just for the whole thing around Oh what are you gonna rate every little detail yeah I don't think anyway if you want no I don't know anybody wants you here nobody cares about the taste I think it's more about the hi I don't think when I buy my weeds I'm working so with the high over the taste the taste is always good but I'm working so with the high I like the meat you get really [ __ ] up if you're going with just a taste next time have some shitty weeds I'll give you that you can taste the [ __ ] up tonight okay well I would biggest seventh a seven so anything higher than a seven I guess you'd have to actually throw up yeah so Donna throws up and means it's good weeds that's pretty [ __ ] way of looking at it but no like I go I like how it makes me feel and if when we get to like this part and if you go beyond like like this part like it you get scared and stuff like that baby I just and you just wanna go to bed but you can't cuz like even when you close your eyes you get a little bit dizzy you know like that oh no I don't have any of those feelings that you're talking about you got different different feelings in me I feel nice and [ __ ] up and I like it and I don't feel like going to bed I feel like doing more bong tokes and I got the munchies and I'm thirsty and I was drinking pop but Donna was drinking and coughing the [ __ ] dinner and when I say coffin the [ __ ] - there yes that makes sense when she was coughing in there and yeah you can have that now I don't want that back I'll get a different drink anyway I'm gonna go and get something to eat cuz I got the munchies and did you have anything else to say about your joy no okay well I'm gonna get something to eat and I'll be right back you gonna let me out I'm stuck no you didn't know what do you think I was gonna walk through the [ __ ] wall I'm not gonna tell you what I thought takes a little trapped you're [ __ ] we've got some peanut butter and jam toast if anybody gives a [ __ ] anyway you should go check out my patreon page it's in the description below you could have checked this [ __ ] video three days ago you behind you gotta catch up um I see we got some new subscribers secret holder to is [ __ ] um hey lastwords Donna before we leave what do you got this far in right like this Oh since you smoked a joint so it's been like maybe 15 or 20 minutes 15 or 20 minutes Bella ten minutes I don't know hasn't been that long well been long but not long you feel like hitting the sack don't hit me in the sack like a you just want to like lay down and oh and if the bed was cold it would be even better yeah I don't feel that that's not what I'm feeling [Music] [Music] anyway there's a [ __ ] are you doing you forgot anyway [ __ ] him anyway we're gonna [ __ ] off out of here and [ __ ] smoke some more weed eat the rest of this [ __ ] smoke some more weed watch some YouTube videos that keep on smoking weed so until next time like subscribe and [ __ ] off hey [Music] [Music]", "fMx7n7iFibQ": "I wasn't originally going to do this but I've been seeing so many people posting and so many people posting videos and I'm starting to realize that the bigger concern that we might have here over the next I don't know a few weeks is probably going to be inflammation related I'm seeing so many people stocking up on the wrong things so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna run to Costco right now since they're still open and I'm gonna identify some foods that are a higher calorie that would be good to have just in your pantry we're not talking about just regular pantry staples I want to find calorically dense things we're talking things like macadamia nuts stuff like that where they're high-calorie and you could essentially feed an entire family if you really needed to so the things that I just think should be stocked up on but also things that are going to be inflammation modulating because if you're sedentary you're not getting vitamin D because you're indoors and you're eating a lot of preservatives you could be running into a pretty big longer-term issue with inflammation so let's head to Costco I'm at the house right now I'm gonna head over there I'll see you a minute I'm not gonna get toilet paper I don't even know if I could find some if I wanted to the goal here is to find high-calorie nutrient-dense foods let's see what we find this is a little bit different normally I have jr. with me to be able to film my every move but I'm just gonna snip what I can and film what I can so it's gonna be a little bit cutty for the Pens with his blog style it's not my normal style feel we're just an observation there's plenty of high-calorie nuts still here which doesn't look that anybody has touched more on that later I have a whole separate video on that okay so it's kind of interesting people have wiped out the bread section which kind of makes sense in theory however that is going to be one of the most calorically I guess vacant foods you're gonna find if you are not doing a low carb diet if you're doing some kind of a regular diet I would recommend going for some kind of gluten-free granola okay at least that's in the deal that gets you something in the way of nutrients but still gonna be extremely cool or clicked unseen if I can find something okay here's one that I found a green for you NOLA check this out flip the camera around here okay so the first thing that I want to point out with this whenever possible if you're trying to stock your home if you're trying to actually get true emergency food you're gonna want to get things that do not have any form of sugary whatsoever any blood sugar spike roller coaster ride he's going to throw things off but I will say this is a grain free granola check out the ingredients there we've got almonds organic honey pecans toasted coconut sunflower seeds coconut canola or sorry coconut oil vanilla extract salt cinnamon in the world of granolas that are grain free this is one of the cleanest ones that I've seen but one of the things that I'm looking at here the most 1/4 cup is going to be 160 calories so ordinarily this would be super high-calorie that I would not want to get it all but in the case of trying to get calorically dense foods this one out of all the granola is out of all the cereals out of all the breads probably one of the only grain things that I would recommend getting and it's technically not even grains so anyhow just food for thought there it is a little pricey though so I'm just encouraging you don't think bulk here don't just think how much volume of food can you get look at the caloric density if you're really thinking about emergency foods and prepping that's what's going to matter no there's a couple things that my mom taught me when I grew up backpacking right okay if it's gonna be emergency food or food that you hold on to it needs to do two things it either needs to be extremely calorically dense like macadamia nuts or something like that or it needs to be something you would never touch unless it was an absolute emergency don't get tasty things that are gonna make you want to eat more of it okay in the world of peanut butters the world of almond butters a world of all kinds of different nut butters doesn't surprise me that people are wiping out the peanut butter obviously it's the most cost effective and I understand that but let's take a look at what's in this stuff compared to some of the other options that you have what's gonna actually keep you satisfied check this out get Skippy alright sure calorically dense yeah but it's also got a bunch of sugar in it you know that's a good amount considering how many tablespoons there are but then look at this ingredient here hydrogenated vegetable oil that literally means that they've taken oil added a hydrogen molecule to it to make itself stable so is it shell stable absolutely but is it something that's going to trigger inflammation within your body and cause issues down the line okay when everything blows over when we get through all this and what's gonna happen we're gonna end up with people that are very unhealthy and have long term conditions because they're developing bad habits I don't think that a few weeks of eating like this is gonna kill you they're gonna develop bad habits so then the question comes almond butter or nuts in this case I would go with in Matsoukas look at the ingredients here cashews almonds so let's flax seeds chia seeds hazelnuts pumpkin seeds and Celtic sea salt there's a reason behind these ingredients and why they'd be on my list in this case okay it may be more expensive but the flax and the Chia is actually going to satiate you plus you're getting at least somewhat of a source of omega-3s now we're talking about something called alpha lineage assuming alpha linolenic acid which isn't like a true omega-3 like you would get from say fish for example but it's at least going to get you a little bit of the omega-3s it can get converted in a hot tip if you have a little bit of turmeric along with those omega-3s for getting from flax and Chia you can end up absorbing more of those Omega threes we're all trying trying to fight inflammation here so that's the goal the flax the Chia are a soluble fiber that at least help you flush out some of the toxins and preserves that you're getting from some of the other food plus extremely calorically dense definitely makes the cut get the nut so over the almond butter definitely over the peanut butter okay I just found something that I'm super stoked to see that people are picking up now sardines over here definitely running on lower supply here so that means people are buying them not as many people seem to be buying this salmon but let me show you about the salmon because the canned salmon is actually really good stuff one of the only times you'd be able to get wild caught salmon at this price check out wild Alaska pink salmon 520 milligrams omega-3s per serving the big common denominator took a lot of the foods that were consuming when we're looking at anything shelf-stable is that it's going to be high omega-6 profile why because the shelf-stable fats are usually gonna be cruddy omega sixes that's why you don't see fish just sitting on the shelf just not me refrigerated right but when you get it in a can that also is BPA friendly you can get those on mega threes look at you can come out of this whole situation being healthier there's also a couple hundred calories in each one of those cans I mean that's enough - that's realistically if we got into a really bad situation that's gonna feed you for a day one of those cans is gonna feed you to your family members and you're gonna be fine okay now take a look at this sardines this is sardines in olive oil normally I would recommend sardines just straight up eating waters that you're getting the main benefit coming from the oil in the fish not the oil that's added but at least these guys add olive oil avoid at all costs costs excuse me if it comes in cottonseed oil or soybean oil you just don't want to have it they're definitely a good catch and one of the most calorically dense things that you could eat now let's see if we can find some more stuff okay soup's chili beans things like that everyone's going for the beans really quick my concern is if everyone switches gears really quick and all of a sudden starts having a bunch of beans a bunch of chili when their bodies aren't really accustomed to it first of all you're not gonna absorb those nutrients second of all that's a lot of havoc on your body so let's look at the soups that we got here there's one in particular that I would recommend during this time in the Amy's soups surprisingly a pretty darn clean check this out okay they got the lentil soup pretty calorically dense 300 calories in a can let's take a look here we've got filtered water green lentils celery carrots organic onions potatoes extra virgin olive oil soot the fact that they're using olive oil is pretty phenomenal here again in this one a little bit more complex onions lentils carrots celery extra virgin olive oil once again garlic balsamic this is totally good to go and yes it's a vegetarian is it keto no it's not but who cares okay if you're in a situation where you're just trying to get good calories in the sodium is actually pretty low two four and fifty per can because these are the lighter sodium ones so this wouldn't be a bad emergency food people stock up on the most interesting things like chicken stock there's like no caloric density there it's nothing it's just broth might as well get something that has a little bit of life to it plus the lentils although they can be hard to digest are going to be rich in zinc and rich in some of the minerals that you may become deficient in that can't ultimately help combat some inflammation okay don't bother with the soybean oil obviously I doubt people are going to be loading up on that don't bother with the shortening if I were to load up one one I would say probably coconut oil would be the best it looks like people are loading up on right now it is very important that you take care of your gut microbiome here's what's going on we have a hundred trillion little bacterias in our debt they dictate a lot more than what we think if all of a sudden we are not outdoors as much okay we've held ourselves up we might end up seeing a shift in that but more importantly if we shift our food a whole lot we're no longer eating a bunch of greens we're not getting the buter day the butyric acid that we normally would get in the gut things are gonna change the guts gonna change so if the guts gonna change we're gonna change our serotonin is gonna change our moods gonna change so at least if you go with coconut oil over any other oil you at least get the Mauna Lauren and the Lord acid conversion which means that inside your gut it's feeding some of the gut bacteria has a probiotic effect so out of all the oils to be the most shelf stable and most long-term in terms of overall health benefit inside your gut I would probably opt for coconut oil I'm a big fan of avocado oil olive oil of course but in this particular case I think coconut oil might be the safest thing in terms of a high calorie food to stock up on in terms of the frozen section I don't want to touch a whole lot on that stuff right now just because so much of the frozen stuff is just loaded with preservatives but I think there's a few things I shouldn't touch on I'll just grab one or two random things that I think are gonna be helpful out of the frozen section outside of veggies always go for your fruits and veggies frozen they're gonna save some money but also quite frankly they are usually higher-quality there is a study out of UC Davis that found that like frozen broccoli frozen peas all those things had more nutrient value than fresh or at least to the same simply because they're frozen immediately so you end up preserving stuff so load up on the frozen veggies at least that way you can maintain your gut biome of it one of the things I've been stocking up on at home actually is yogurt now Costco's yogurt is all pretty low calorie I would opt to go for the higher dairy fat yogurt let me show you something okay so the Greek yogurt obviously not a whole lot of calories in it but what we're after here isn't so much the calories it's more so the probiotic content but you want to go with the higher fat dairy believe it or not the dairy fat is actually quite healthy there are studies that show that higher consumption of dairy fat ends up leading to less risk of cardiovascular disease and it has more to do with a fat being a specific kind of fat that can be used by the body including conjugated linoleic acid which is really good for fat loss to more of the actual negative effects in terms of cardiovascular disease come from the oxidation that occurs because of all the sugar consumption now the bigger issue that I have with dairy is more sort of kinds of protein that are in it you usually want to go for goat milk or goat yogurt whenever possible I stock up on goat yogurt but it's not exactly the easiest thing to get simply because it's going to be a different kind of protein called beta casein 8a - which is much better sorry I'm fretting out of it here not crashing the people so that's usually what I want up for while very yogurts good regular Greek yogurt is close second and then after that you can start getting like almond yogurt coconut yogurt stuff like that like cauliflower stir-fry but there's just no coal or density to it it's not exactly something you want to waste freezer space stocking up on right now plus it's really there's not much nutrient value in cauliflower and you get D and old methane you get some of the indole-3 carbinol conversion really just not the best you could stock up on fruit but I would argue that you should stock up on frozen veggies more than that let's see what else we can find as for cheeses if the cheese's are in the regular refrigerated section I would try to avoid them spend a little bit more money get the cheese in the quality age section we'll go over there in a minute and talk about it let's see what they've got here actually these Bell brands these big adult ones these are actually okay the issue with them is there's not a good bang for the buck again caloric density but because they're wrapped in wax they last a little bit longer I came across the big one people ask me about the Kirkland Signature protein bars all the time so let's cover these for one second because I've got quite a bit of things to say but at the end of the day they're not all that bad let me just rip them apart a little bit because it's what I do these guys have done a pretty good job of making a healthier knockoff of a quest bar let's take a look at the ingredients record okay first thing I want to focus on milk protein isolate not the best way that I would start a protein bar okay milk protein isolate means they just have straight-up milk solids okay whether it's the protein but also everything else then we've got whey protein isolate which is great fiber from tapioca starch it's going to blow you like crazy cashews I wish they would have used something a little bit lower carb and a little less inflammatory unsweetened chocolate then they use erythritol which I understand cocoa powder natural flavors cocoa butter sea salt sunflower less fun and stevia actually pretty darn clean the only thing I don't like is the milk protein isolate in there I just wish they would have changed that into something different or start with just playing up the way but in terms of feeding the masses and stuff like that it's actually a pretty good product now let's see this one's a little bit different these are just different flavor combinations looks like it's the same thing a protein blend milk protein isolate tapioca starch peanut butter erythritol peanut flour pretty low inflammatory if you ask me now erythritol is going to bloat some people I would give this probably a good 7 out of 10 if I really trip I mean it's really not bad but the caloric density it's not bad either so I would like to see people stocking up on these in terms of emergency food that actually tastes good the problem is they taste good remember what I said anything that tastes good should not really be an emergency too however if you learn to be healthy see the taste good is good okay I want to check out the pure protein bars look at these what time and that's worth mentioning at this point milk protein isolates seem kind of thing whey protein concentrate okay I usually run away when I see white protein concentrate just because that's really low quality whey hydrolyzed collagen that's cool glycerin they're using that as a binder it's pretty compliment at all okay we don't want that molten salt molten salt syrup fractionated oh gosh okay this is garbage pure protein is garbage definitely want to go for the Kirkland brand in that case it's been a lot of time in the bars there's just more healthy things to give you did time bars yes pretty solid but still punch a serving up these are all this knockoffs of kind Nature Valley stuff is one of those way okay we just got into the nut Isle now I did a full video literally up to sip Costco talking about the best nuts to get if I was in a true true serious emergency situation I would want to be stocking up on nuts and seeds I want the minerals I'd walk busy I want things that I would really need to keep me going for a long time and if any of you anything is there are so many nuts and so many seeds that are just on the Shelf if they're not wiped at law everyone's about the toilet paper everyone's bought the bread everyone's brought the rice and the beans like they're gonna go into hiding for a decade I mean realistically we need things that are keep us going for a few months or worst case scenario like a year if supply chain is damaged right so let's check out some of these best ones that we should choose and some best practices when we're getting out nuts I'm gonna make this super abbreviated but macadamia nuts definitely take the cake okay they're not the highest omega-3 profile but they're the high or the lowest omega-6 which means you can't eat a lot of them if you had to live off of them for example and not go into a serious omega-3 imbalance probably the only nut that you could do that with plus they have a really unique fat in them called palmitoleic acid which is an Omega 7 which makes omega-3 is more readily available in the body so highly recommend that pistachios also not a terrible choice they're a little bit higher carbohydrate so yes you can develop a little bit more of an issue there but one of the things I'm concerned most about is these have if you can see this yeast extract which is msg so they basically have added MSG to those so you eat more of them I don't like that the Kirkland pistachios are just not a good bang for the buck like you're gonna spend you see nine point two six per pound see what the ingredients are here I mean good ingredients just pistachios and sea salt yeah I mean they wouldn't be terrible I would just opt for something that's a little bit more nutrient-dense pumpkin seeds for example extremely high in zinc so one of the best things you could eat in 8.6 four pounds so a little bit better they're organic sprouted pumpkin seeds which means they're sprouted which means they're gonna absorb better within your body sprouted means they've soak them in water for at least 24 hours to where it breaks down what's called the phytic acid it breaks down what are called the anti nutrients so you can actually utilize the nutrients let me explain something here there's a reason why when you look at animal droppings you see pieces of nuts and seeds in it because the nothing seams don't break down they have anti nutrients that are designed to not digest so that they get passed through the feces and can continue to sprout and continue to grow it's just a natural process so funny the way people look at me when I'm holding up a phone talking to myself but I'm used to having a cameraman with me so that's what you want to get them sprouted sprouts gonna allow that process to not occur as much you can actually assimilate them and absorb them a little bit more so the next best one let me show you real quick you want to buy them in the baking section because that way you're not paying for all the extra roasting and you're not paying for all the extra marketing and everything that goes along with it pecans high omega-3 walnuts high omega-3 I would say pecans are a little bit easier to digest so I usually opt for them there's something here that does make me feel kind of warm and fuzzy inside gives me just the nice cozy feeling and that's this check this out the junk food aisle the cracker aisle actually quite vacant people know not to just buy a bunch of sugary snacks which is really refreshing to see what's interesting is that they're flocking to things that are seemingly healthy which is exactly why I'm doing this video I want to kind of debunk some of the common stuff out there where people are just making the wrong choices and I thing is when we look at the actual legit just cracker and cooking in sweet aisle well people aren't reading the stuff here just a really refreshing thing to see I think we're actually starting to make an impact this is really cool one of the things that people tend to overlook because it's just generally seen as unhealthy it's going to be precooked sausages there's some good options now okay there's some good ways to preserve things without adding well preserve this so high calorie foods are gonna feed your family for a while where you don't have to stock up on garbage let me show you this one Sabich penis I've actually never personally try the flavor this but the ingredients are pretty solid check this out okay organic chicken organic basil and then two personal s the following roasted garlic onion powder garlic powder sea salt organic vinegar organic black pepper oregano and calcium agitating the casing which is perfectly fine that's just a derivative of calcium essentially so really really clean the only thing that's a bummer is the sodium content is very very high if you're doing a low-carb diet that works out because yeah you can keep your mineralization but what I like is 160 calories for a link okay if I had this in a handful of macadamia nuts I could maintain an Aikido genic state for a number of weeks before I would have a nutritional deficiency of any sort so this brand is really good at clean then you compare it and even what's doesn't I'm just gonna guess okay pork the hydrated pineapple and his sugar of course yeast extract there we go msg that'll be careful there citrus extract that's not a big deal paprika yeah straight up in mustard okay we don't want to be having that's one of the worst things you could have right now during this time normally I would say to try to get like a wide diversity of nutrients in terms of protein but I try to get your chicken in try to get your beef try to get report and that still stands but I will say you're probably gonna get more quart density from beef right now and you would from chicken if you have chicken and you're getting high-calorie chicken that means you're getting chicken that's high fat and chicken fat is much lower quality than say fat from beef so I just want you to keep that in mind if you're not normally a beef person it might be the best way for you to just kind of satiate yourself however I don't need a ton ton of beef this is a good time for me to stock up on beef because I will only eat it if I really really need to otherwise that will offer some other things right let's see what else they've got over here if they're organic Oh perfect look at these are a great option if you had to choose between wisps moon cheese and these parmesan crisps good these are 14 little bags so you pay more money for packaging moon cheese although it's clean it's just cheddar cheese in which leaves a lot to be desired okay now it's not terrible but then when you look at parmesan crisps we've got Parmesan cheese ooh Wow okay I just got debunked I was expecting this to be good okay here's the thing I would opt for parmesan because parmesan is a much cleaner cheese lower lactose easier to metabolize aged better enzymatic function parmesan in general is really good in the body but these guys I'm disappointed made in Sonoma that's literally where I grew up - I'm from Sonoma this kind of makes me disappointed Sonoma Creamery hopefully you someone from your company sees this and you can make some changes why do you have to put brown do I have to put a grain in there not only one grain but you put organic oat bran organic quinoa oh yeah what just frustrates me keto people just really upset with that in this case I'll probably go for the moon cheese cuz check this out twenty-three point five servings per container seventy calories per serving six to seven little nuggets of these guys seventy calories nothing you want to load up on cheese for your calories but again why aren't people grabbing that it's not even a bad price nine bucks and that's 23 and a half servings you have to look further than just how much you're getting in terms of volume okay if it was a giant bag for $8.99 I'm sure people would just be buying it all like crazy they're not reading how many servings are actually in it try to stay away from the dried fruit okay just going to be a big instant spike and something to note about dried fruit obviously it's concentrated fructose and let's learn about fructose fructose does not get stored as a muscle glycogen in most carbs you eat can store in your muscles like you go for a run you work out you need some carbohydrates skim store in your muscles and that's fine it's not gonna go to fat fructose rides a different bus in terms of metabolism okay it gets into the liver but we can only hold like 35 40 grams of fructose in our liver and then it spills over in turns to fat but what happens when you have a concentrated amount of it in some kind of like a you know if dried fruit right well you're gonna have a to those snacks and it's gonna start going into de novo lipid Genesis and go through spillover so anyhow just something to think about okay so cured meats bacon salami things like that there's a few things you need to know pork fat isn't the best fat in the world but if it is the saturated pork fat it's a little bit better than say the polyunsaturated fats are normally important pork has a high degree of those polyunsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats although good they are very very fragile so I'm going to show you something after they close attention to the visual here I'm a piece of salami this pork see how it's all marbled in there okay it's tough to tell but you know usually when you're getting a cut that's heavily marbled that way it's usually also high in the polyunsaturated fats now we can see for sure here yep look at that okay here's a good way to tell seven grams of total fat two and a half of which are saturated that leaves us with four and a half grams of fat that are probably a low quality polyunsaturated in this case now this is a total guess here so let me see but if I go with like a Parma ham or prosciutto haha there we go right three and a half grams one and a half grams which is saturated fat so I'm left with well it's a little bit better not a whole lot better but still what that means is that we cover more of the sachin fat and less of the polyunsaturated fats and just quick math that you want to do you'll always want to have a higher ratio saturated fat compared to the remainder that's going to help you out in determining the healthiest quality meat they're similar thing applies for smoked salmon we think just based on theory that like smoked Salmons gonna last for a long time but it doesn't it actually goes bad pretty quick like if I'm looking at them right now it's mid-march this is expiring at the end of March it's not that great but let me show you a little something what you need to pay attention to either way with smoked salmon if you are gonna freeze it or anything like that try to avoid the Norwegian stuff yeah that's been shown to be pretty contaminated what I want is wild Alaskan sockeye today the reason I want wild Alaskan sockeye higher in what it's called astaxanthin what makes it pink is actually an antioxidant so think about this salmon are swimming upstream crazy-fast creating a lot of oxidative damage within their bodies okay exercise creates damage and we usually have to fight it well they have to create their own built-in antioxidant to help it defeat that which means that antioxidant Chris Erbs the polyunsaturated fats that are in Sakai whereas something like this see how it's all pale compared to this you always want to go for the Sakai yeah and come on get real when it's smoked it's so salty anyway you don't taste the difference okay this one's a little fattier but what good is fat if it's not gonna get you anywhere right okay the fat cut on my middle look it's a higher fat content in that than it isn't that definitely go for the wild sockeye expiration on this let's see April 16th so it lasts longer too so I can have that in the fridge for a good month or I could just put it in the freezer and have it for a while just something to note there quick touch on the cheese section okay you learn that cheese is obviously they're gonna last for a while but you also want to get cheeses that are gonna be in lower beta casein 8 a 1 ok which is complicated sounding but we want better quality proteins in our cheese okay we want good quality stuff aged so we want to go for goat cheese you want to go for blue we want to go for feta let me just show you what we got here Costco is a pretty good deal on feta crumbles okay and these are gonna be good throw June 19th there's a high sodium content in here but also these are pretty caloric okay one ounce is gonna give you 70 calories okay so this is great now this isn't sheep's feta but still pretty solid stuff I would definitely go for feta as an option crumble gorgonzola would be a good one too blue cheese depends how long it's been aged I wouldn't really recommend stocking up on it right now but I would go for like some aged cheddar okay this stuff let's see reading up here missed the organic yeah and when we got a one-ounce cube is gonna be 120 calories yep there we go cows that are free to roam and grass fed that is super super important we definitely wanna be paying attention to that now I will say once again anything you can find with a wax coating he's gonna preserve and last longer so wow I don't know let's see Mimolette thing I think I'm saying that right in salt like it starters okay this one's pretty age too so that's not a bad one okay pass on those okay now we're getting into some of the other stuff okay so these are like more than ooh here we go spreadable goat cheese sorry this is just cool calories here one ounce 70 calories this is gonna be one of the higher quality cheeses that you could get here might be the only goat cheese that I see oh no yep this goat cheese right here wow that's a bargain 6:59 for two things of goat cheese fresh goat cheese that's how you know this is real okay calories 80 calories for one slice which is about one ounce pastor s coats milk salt bacterial culture and microbial enzymes definitely would get this now also it's good until July 5th because it's in this package right you could also freeze it and nice thing is goat cheese doesn't denature as much when you thought out other cheese gets really weird if you freeze it and then thought out goat cheese just for whatever enzymatic reason seems to hold itself together unfortunately fish is just it's a bad time people are still wiping it out because I think they're gonna freeze it but I don't know if I'd recommend just getting a whole lot of fish right now it's probably just not the best time corned beef this is interesting looks nobody's gonna be celebrating st. Patrick's Day right now let's see what else we got in the way of commuting stuff remember stock up on the beef go easy on the chicken if you are gonna get the chicken and get the chicken breasts okay that way you're not loading up on the chicken thigh which I know is higher calorie but this is all about getting the right calories if you're gonna eat calorically dense foods don't just eat any co-worker than scoots get the calorically dense foods that are actually gonna give you some value that's what's important right anyone can grab a Snickers and need something caloric intense I'm trying to teach you the right calories yet Costco has some good options when it comes to beef but this will probably my favorites the Bison it's $7.99 a pound technically which is pretty steep but the nice thing about bison is it's generally grass-fed grass-finished which plays a big important role so again with beef I would usually recommend going leaner and the nice thing is is that grass-fed grass-finished naturally is that mean you know believe it or not but it's also a higher omega-3 content so again trying to control inflammation trying to not have an issue with inflammation as you're changing up your diet rapidly so try to go for the bison that's probably the best beef source at Costco right now let's see 11 grams of fat 4 of which is saturated which means you're left with you know roughly seven grams of mystery fat could be monounsaturated fat could be polyunsaturated fat but really caloric density you're gonna get most bang for the buck there I don't recommend getting big fatty steaks unless you absolutely know where they're coming from because the fat is where the toxins and everything is stored in the grains the soy everything they concern for those of you that are interested I did put a link down below for butcher box that way you can get grass-fed grass-finished meat and delivered to your doorstep they are still shipping during this time I've just ordered like 25 cuts myself so you can use the link down below there's a special discount and especially right now because things are just a little bit insane so you can use that link and you can get grass-fed grass-finished milk delivered to your doorstep whether it's beef chicken fish scallops pork you name it so go ahead and use that link I do have a good partnership with them they are supported this channel they are a sponsor this channel put a disclaimer but I am saying right now and during this kind of hectic times it is a good way to stock up on some of the frozen meat and might be better than braving Costco and getting some of the lower quality meat that you're generally going to find at any grocery store so I highly recommend you check them out down below in the description after you finish watching this video save a couple bucks that way too let's jump to pork for a second once again the thing with pork loin is you can usually or pork chops too you can usually trim off the fat so look at see how the fat isn't a nice thick layer that's what we want that way we can trim it off and we're not getting a lot of marbling we can get a leaner cut of meat the protein within pork is actually really good it's just the fatty acids that we're not a big fan of ribs again try to avoid not the best kind that you'd want to be bringing in lamb not exactly the most cost effective thing to be bringing into your house right now I will say though lamb mutton although I'm not the biggest fan of it ethically he is one of the best fatty acid profiles that you can find okay let's go take a quick look after you ready to drinks and the protein powders really great because I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing to stock up on right now again if you're trying to maintain a music healthy lifestyle you're working out at home doing what you can that's gonna be the last thing that I check out before this looks familiar like you did a whole video on this that's been check out the whole entire protein video that we did at one point there the ready to drink liquid proteins at Costco are not really good to go let me point out the ones that we're gonna grab one that I would recommend okay the grass-fed clean protein shake and the flip it around sugar they call it a grass-fed protein shake I'm just gonna touch on this really quick grass-fed milk protein concentrate okay again just in case you haven't watched my videos before we want isolate not concentrate concentrate means that they've just concentrated the protein and they haven't isolated any of the good quality whey then we use agave which is pure fructose remember I told you about fructose fructose is sketchy because it goes straight to the liver and it can only hold the body can only hold so much high oleic sunflower oil not the end of the world anyhow the point is relatively low quality but believe it or not I would opt for the plant-based one if you were looking for an RVT you know not a bad thing to stock up on just in case I just don't know if the price is really conducive okay we've got filtered water pea protein alkalis cocoa high oleic sunflower which I have other videos on it's really not that bad rice brand not the best trisodium phosphate is okay try potassium citrate so k gellan gum monk fruit that's a plus vegetable blend actually pre non clean so all the RT DS and I've talked about this in other videos this organ RTD is not bad still not the best though and definitely not the most cost-effective I'm gonna save you guys a bunch of time the Kirkland brands the premier brands are both the garbage and it comes down to the RTD let's look at some powders really quick okay your game keto a lot of people talk to me about this one it's clean it's just you're getting collagen proteins you're not getting like actual protein protein which I'm not opposed to collagen but in the case of really trying to I don't know maintain muscle mass during this time not really the go-to okay a quick whey protein 101 you always walk away protein isolate not whey protein concentrate so we have two very similar ones here I'll show you we have whey protein isolate and we have whey protein isolate as the primary source which means check this out protein blend whey protein isolate wafer didn't concentrate oh and whey peptides natural artificial flavor less than acesulfame potassium which is highly insulin and genic it does spike insulin causes a cephalic insulin response and we sucralose which is going to destroy your gut biome you need to be avoiding sucralose right now it is not the time but then we have whey protein isolate same exact brand which is whey protein isolate cocoa trust process of alkali natural flavors which is questionable still but lecithin salt stevia leaf extract and xanthan gum infinitely cleaner significantly cleaner go for this one and right now as of March 21 bucks or 22 bucks that's a really good deal this combat it tastes amazing but a total garbage take a look at it micro filtered protein blend whey protein concentrate isolate definitely not good but I think someone broke into this cigarette containing okay that was loud sorry about that so anyhow then when we get look at the plant-based ones gonna make this quick here let me show you your again probiotic one is not bad organic protein we've got a few proteins brown rice protein chia seed and it's got a creamer base which is made from organic high oleic sunflower oil that's been dried all that high oleic is is it basically means that they've taken the oleic acid which is quite a good component out of some of the polyunsaturated fats to make it a more stable shelf stable fat cuz all they've done but it's much better than hydrogenated I'll explain a little bit more about what it is okay so oleic acid is found in things like olive oil avocado oil stuff like that you're gonna see it a lot okay it's very very good for you what they'll do is they'll take those components and they'll industrialize them to basically make a certain oil even soybean oil higher oleic so what they've done is they've taken a polyunsaturated fat that would normally be very unstable and it made it a monounsaturated fat this is a good thing but it doesn't really make it a better fat soybean oil is still soybean oil and even the studies that take a look at people that consume high oleic soybean oil versus regular soybean oil they still offer all the negative health effects all the issues the only thing that changes is a slight change in the instance of obesity rates and it probably just has to do with the fact that maybe they're not consuming anyhow just something to note so really the way protein is gonna come down to the top through nutrition whey protein isolate and probably the basic or gain probiotic blend and possibly the or gain plant-based ready-to-drink will be the only high-calorie ones that I would really recommend take your protein powder and add some coconut cream to it in fact that's one more thing that I want to show you to stock up on here in the canned food section I almost forgot it would have been a bad one if I forgot some of the stuff in the canned food section and the thing is is for those of you that are watching this entire video you get the sweet treat because this is a big one okay okay mayonnaise at Costco is all soybean oil again trying to fight inflammation right soybean oil boom not what we want sometimes you'll see a primal kitchen here but doesn't want you to have it it's a lot of their canned goods are just gone well well let's find something else instead if you do want to give yourself a high-calorie treat at least these four 500 fives are really good really good clean pork rinds they're just easy eat a ton of them pork rinds salt coconut palm sugar which is a little bit of a bummer because you never really want to be combining carbs and fats but I had to show you something since they were out of what I wanted to show you which was coconut cream you see if you get those big cans of coconut cream or not in a big can but a can of coconut cream in the baking section like for Thai food or coconut milk in a can super high caloric excuse me high calorie very caloric but also high in the medium chain triglycerides same stuff we're getting from coconut oil you can mix a little bit of that with your almond milk and it's gonna make your almond milk tastes almost like milk it's delicious but you're also getting in that probiotic effect that lauric acid the mono Lauren conversion within the gut it's gonna help support that gram-positive bacteria again all about gut health that's gonna happen how you maintain your levels of you know well good immune balance that you're not immunocompromised and set your inflammation levels aren't flying through the roof yeah I'm gonna head out again and lines a little bit too long you can brave right now but at least wanting to share some good content", "OOQEej8pyqc": "hey guys good morning not really morning it is 11:40 - let me show you it is 11:40 - all right I had to show you guys my drink because it looked kind of creamy today so I'm gonna put this in a six six tablespoons of cream just to be safe I'm going to show you guys how I put it on my face power but a diary and I did not have the same thing as yesterday so I had my Starbucks there was a half CAF heavy cream iced americano I like to look at it first just to make sure that it doesn't have anything that's hidden because there's really nothing in that so I'm going to do that one then clear that out yeah I'm not sure which heavy cream they use but I like to use the verified ones which is right there I'm gonna put 60 ml spoons cuz it wasn't like a little bit do that check and I would came home and put some stevia so liquid organic liquid stevia Trader Joe's and let's click that I did like 13 drops because it's huge put 13 that's like nothing and as all I've had so far so well what I do when I look at this is I see that I've had 336 calories and I see how many I have left which is 1,300 and then if I want something if I'm craving something I'll just plug it in and see what it's at but I'll show you if I do that later go to nutrition and then I have three protein three carbs and 33 fats so that's pretty good I saw all kinds of stuff to go since I haven't eaten anything yet and it is 1:55 p.m. hey guys it's going on it is imma show you what time it is oh my god everything likes busting my butt today it is 5:40 and I haven't eaten yet because I filmed what I'm going to eat right now because I really wanted to eat it but I'm like oh maybe I should film it too because it's something I just kind of came up with after seeing like a similar type of video as far as like wrapping things and cabbage as like a roll or something so I made some our normal call me I guess Asian spring rolls but it's with a peanut a spicy peanut dipping sauce and yeah so let me gonna show you what it is okay so this right here I'm not gonna really go into detail but it's just like a sweet peanuts spicy like Asian dipping sauce and these are spring rolls basically that I made like I don't know what to call them yet I guess just like rap rolls like Asian inspired but I may take a bite of one real quick I haven't had any yet and I'm starving okay so that dip looks pretty damn good mmm that's the inside really good chicken mushrooms broccoli and the other thing is that I will tell you about yeah so basically when I do put that recipe video up I will link it in the description box down below of this video as soon as it's up so I won't be in there right away but it'll be in you know probably next week or so this is my beautiful mother Karen say hi hi would you think mom yeah the rolls I didn't know probably awesome totally awesome totally off I love you before I forget don't mind Ryan to do bag of jelly bean starburst things I'm going to I've been drinking this since yesterday so I'll probably finish this today it's a Key Lime stater brothers it doesn't have ideal sugar or sugar substitute in it but zero carbs and I noticed that when I do drink a lot of carbonated drinks I get really bloated so I buy bottles that I can cap and drink them throughout the day and you know over a couple days or whatever so that's that last little lonely roll going on my belly my mommy too so this will be my fourth one okay I'm going to attempt to put this in so go to My Fitness Pal a diary down here at the bottom and then see what's going on and then I'm gonna go down two more and my recipes and foods and I'm going to the plus sign right at the top and enter ingredients you manually if you can't see that I'm so sorry so it says when you type in the name recipe name and we'll call them Asian rolls because I'll know what that is and surf's how many people I'm gonna put these in as individuals so I made six so let's do that do six and then add ingredients chicken breasts raw and this one right here has a green check you always want to try to get those and I did else's and I put in 10.1 ounces that's exact so we'll do that and then you just do the whole check mark checkmark and that's one ingredient and you just go down the rest of your list and not going to show you guys because I made a video for this so you will see it next week okay at this point I have it all done and all I have to do let's check out the nutrition facts I haven't even I didn't even look normally I would know but this is like a recipe I just made up so the car was pretty good so for each one to almost two clubs each so that's not bad considering how many vegetables we're in them save and log it and log it I'm just gonna put it under lunch because that's why very next one and since I had I made the serving size six and I made six I ate four we'll do four of air 7.87 herbs for that meal not bad but I have to add in the peanut butter sauce which I totally forgot to film for the video but I might redo it anyway let's add so far i'm melina 747 calories if you guys have a lot lower of a calorie count than I do then intermittent fasting might work for you considering I didn't even start eating until way later today because I just got so busy so animation fast you might work for you because honestly to eat a lot more calories in the next you know a few hours might be a little tough so nutrition nutrients and I got 53 protein 12 net carbs because I have 19 carbs - 7 is 12 so I have 12 net carbs that I've eaten so I got 8 net carbs left sugar 9 grams fat 49 hey you guys somebody was just asking me on one of my videos I believe what I eat for snacks whenever I snack I don't snack that often but some days all I do is snack so let me show you guys some of the things that I snack on sometimes I will have some flavored sunflower seeds I have not tried these ones yet I usually get the ranch you could always do pork rinds that's one other thing that I do also I don't have any cooked right now but I'll usually cook a whole pace a whole up piece Oh pack of bacon at a time and I will do that or I like to have celery I get it I chop it all up and then I put it in water after I rinse it off that way I can just eat it or dip it in ranch or something like that and then I have usually when I get my produce I will bag up my lettuce after I cut and clean it there are some broccoli right you know some veggies here some tomatoes jalapenos mushroom and a me and everything I like to keep it prepped that way whole bunch of cheeses in here these are pretty good little salami pepperonis these are all things that I snack on so yeah I just pulled these out of the freezer they are fat bombs they're thin mint fat bombs that I made I don't know probably like a week ago and I'm have one of these so we're going to put that in my Fitness Pal right now eat this while I boil a couple eggs I'm going to take a couple of these if I have like three olives these are a large just pitted black olives from stater brothers and I'll have three of these so I entered these into My Fitness Pal - all right to go with that back on that just a time like craving some milk so I'm going to do one two three four five drops of stevia and I'm going to do a cup of the unsweetened almond milk and this ins macros are really good - it's good 2.5 grams of fat zero carbs zero net carbs one car but it's fiber and one gram of protein so it's like pretty awesome so about a cup of that yeah Cheers I wanted to show you guys where I was that on my calories right now I am only at a thousand calories a thousand twelve calories and I have quite a bit to go at least 600 because I do breast with my daughter I don't like it to be very low at all because it will go away but um this is where I'm at right now I did have two of those Thin Mint fat bombs and I made they're really good and then I had those four olives and one cup of the almond breeze with let's add the stevia and they're really quick 295 drops right now I 56 so I can get a little bit more protein and some fat I got some more carbs but I really want to focus on the fat so what I'm going to do is probably make some eggs egg salad so I'm going to go to dinner and I'm going to add eggs to eggs and then we're gonna do mayonnaise I don't make my own but I would love to start so I'm going to do 3 tablespoons of mayonnaise I know it seems like a lot and then mustard yellow mustard a teaspoon of yellow mustard okay add three this is where we're at for dinner two eggs mayo mustard I'll just salt and pepper in there too but I'm not gonna add it and then now we'll check nutrients we got 68 protein 25 carbs 11 fiber and 115 fat so we have 14 net carbs right there so I can do a little bit more carbs if I want I'm pretty close at my macro goals but I do have really low calorie still 14 which is great because this is great for some of you guys cuz a lot of people have like lower calories like this if I wasn't breastfeeding my calories would be about 14 or 1500 so I might just stay at this for today and drink a whole bunch more water we'll see it's been like a super long day and I feel like super productive and I did like so much today it's 10:41 and I started eating really late today so I'm trying to like cram it in but I did decide that with my egg salad I am going to do like a cheese crisp it's basically just cheese cooked on a pan and then you kind of absorbed the oil because what makes it a little more crispy the more oil you absorb the more crisp the crisp is so I'm going to show you guys how I do that and but first let me show you what everything looks like on my fitness pal okay so here are my stats for dinner we got two eggs three mayonnaise one teaspoon mustard and then I'm doing a quarter cup of the shredded cheddar jack cheese let me show it to you I'm too tired and lazy and I do like this cheese I know that there is like little the ingredients or starch to keep it from binding together you guys can you look for yourself you see there's definitely start in there but it's one carb or 1/4 cup and that's what I'm going to do or into a quarter cup there's my 1 cheese crisps to go with my egg salad you this is the final meal you guys I have my third bottle of water I need to like really get on that I'll probably finish this one and one other one one other one one other water before I go to bed with my vitamins but this is my last meal this is the egg salad I made and the cheese crisps it's not that crispy I don't let it cook long enough but if you let it cook long enough I'm just like in a hurry so but I like my chili cheese here's a final look at the macros I am under on my calories at which I just had lowered yesterday from 1850 which is what I've been doing or my my limit was so I did 1532 calories there's my americano this morning my Asian rolls that I made for lunch and then my egg salad that I'm just about to eat and then my snacks from today let's go ahead and go to the nutrition and this is why I tell people not to really pay too much attention to the percentages because unless you hit your calories exact this is not gonna matter you can get a good idea you want the blue one to be tiny and the green one which is protein the Blues carbs the green to be like you know small like that and then you want the majority of it the pie chart to be red which is fat but this is what really matters you go to your nutrients and then you see your protein you want it to be within the range for your body weight for your lean body mass and mine is so about 75 grams right there for carbs I mean for protein for the day I have 26 total carbs 11 fiber so that brings me to 15 net carbs for the day and 124 grams of fat so that's a pretty good day you guys I'm pretty happy with that oh my god I'm so sorry for the crazy terrible lighting but I just wanted to say thanks so much for watching this video you guys I love doing these videos I can't do them like a whole lot because it is very time consuming especially with all the kids but I love doing them and I will get them up for you as often as possible but if you guys like to give it a thumbs up subscribe share and I will see you guys in my next video", "huc90PBngC8": "hey everybody we're back with another recipe I might lean with wizard Labs and I'm Krista with wizard labs hope everyone is doing well today and tell them what we're doing today today I don't even know how to pronounce this but II very it's it looks like it's pronounced canary coulis cool very cool Asst yeah at work for me it's about Co ul is kalus coulis however you want to pronounce it it's fine so there is a very reputable eliquid company out there called Charlie Noble and back before all of the regulations and all that wonderful stuff he had some really good juice out there he still does but this was one of my favorite recipes that he had and it was not included in the August dates filings so he's decided to release the recipes it is readily available on his website it is the not so discontinued series and he's released three recipes so far the way he's put these things together is amazing he he breaks down each flavor and why he chose that flavor over another one why you really can't substitute something on and on and on but it's so good so what flavors are in this let's see so in this we have pretty fruity cantaloupe my flavor West which is flavors all over here how many flavors let's see one two three four five six seven there's eight flavor well actually seven flavors going in seven slavers and you're gonna have a I'm gonna have eight because I like menthol for all you people out there that like the menthol and that cool feeling yeah we're gonna menthol hers yeah we're gonna menthol mine up so the first one on the list is cantaloupe by flavor west this is a 10 mil sized bottle you can get any 10:30 and 4 ounce bottles from us you can always get larger than that now we do offer a wholesale section that does have 16 ounces and 32 ounces in gallons available for some of the more popular flavors but if you want bigger than a 10 mil it's available on our website so cantaloupe my flavor west and he's using it at 5% and we have like okay so it's a mix of we have flavor art flavor the flavor apprentice how many different mixes apprentice and flavor West I'm flavour us so we have three different um yep okay so next one is honeydew by TFA and we're using four percent of this okay again available in three different sizes next we have papaya papaya by TFA on a liquid recipes it's also known as TPA a lot of people that are just getting started in this don't realize that the flavor apprentice was previously known as the perfumers apprentice because they have a perfume side and a food flavoring side so there's the perfumers apprentice and there's the flavour so they separated it now they separated it so flavors that have been around a long time you might see under TPA okay this is papaya a third flavor papaya and we're adding a 1.5% of papaya philippine mango we're adding its by TFA and we're adding 3% okay and then sour it's gonna taste a little bit of my yeah I like that it's sour by TFA and it's half a percent then we have red summer watermelon by flavor art this is a really good flavor that's very juicy tasting right and it's also at three percents so a lot of flavorings going on we're gonna mix I'm gonna make some by email okay so and I got my 30ml right here to candy one percent right and then your menthol okay my menthol right there I'm gonna mix my month off so we're gonna suit up now and put our gloves on you want to make sure when you're working with nicotine that you are protected right not necess it yes it's not necessary if you're having a liquid that is not not enhanced with nicotine however if it does have nicotine in it I highly recommend which we are doing the minimum of gloves yeah and we are doing nicotine yes but you know there's other things you can add to this mm-hmm Finnish operatic oh right you can switch out flavours I mean this is you know it's always good to start out with a base recipe yeah and then one of your favorites and yeah and then tweak it from theirs so you find a recipe that somebody's already put together okay that they really you know you you like but it could just choose a little extra just like this you like it grab this you really like it but a little extra is gonna be by adding them as well for you yes so that's your way I can do it without menthol for some reason I just like that cool feeling so and that's not a bad thing yeah so are these enough for both of one will run at a time anyway dude you're gonna make shears and I'm gonna mix money and I'm gonna mix mine you're gonna okay so let's get at it okay so yeah so we're gonna mix with syringe say not by weight yes obviously yes we're both doing it yes so leave ER today let's start out with adding the flavors first okay and then we'll add the nicotine at the end because that's the most expensive component so if we accidentally tip the bottle over yeah we're not losing the nicotine okay so today I'm cantaloupe by flavor West and you're gonna add 1.5 milliliters okay five yeah now this does have a little dropper top on it so I don't know there's only would be sir one yeah if you're gonna do any one and then point five yeah pretty much the whole thing right it's almost know you had bubbles in it to do this that's okay nope no I'm your next time you'll do point six okay cuz I went to 0.9 all right so now you're gonna do point six which will total that's a little coupon so it's hard to see what these glasses is that is that right oh okay need to make sure that Oh got it okay yep okay okay okay that's my first flavor which is cantaloupe yeah and I'm gonna add the same amount to my by like sons I was just gonna run down through all of them like now we're sharing here right well it this way I can put the lid back on the bottle and that smells good it's not oh it's very strong cantaloupe is a really strong flavor it's a nice summer juice yeah these tooth Kate you want to rinse that one out I put this bottle back together okay and yes you do have to put the little dropper tip back on the ball because the dropper tip there's a little ball on the top of the cap so that makes sure it's sealed okay okay open all these so we'll be writing right well nobody gets billing oh that's true that one's really gonna make a mess when it's not always about like preparation and prepping puffing okay so this is cotton candy so you're gonna you rinsed your syringe off right yeah it's all set how about we go out to the next see if I can get this to get off now that one's not bad okay that one's easier this way I was come so what do I need with that is cotton candy and you're gonna add point three milliliters one three see better without these I know but it's not completely I know I know I'm gonna be very very slow and careful point three I'm still you're going with this I'm still new at this you're getting better though yeah I haven't really done many I just you know okay so I've got the honeydew in my hand which is the next one back on nope oh and you need it you need it that's right okay so there's the honeydew you're gonna add one capellini do did you rinse your syringe see that's why I need you around there are many of these things okay and the honey do I need a honeydew you're gonna do 11.2 milliliters 1.2 oh I'm looking over here yeah one point see right there point two okay so I need a hole one has to stop there right got it okay honey do for you okay honey here's your papaya oh yeah we're going to need 0.45 milliliters yeah that's not much so wow I guess that is strong the papaya is really strong it is a DFA it's TFA but it is really strong very strong it smells nice it's gonna be a very fruity juice here it's tropical yeah kind of like those what are those candies that you buy at the movie theater sour sour patch kids sour patch kids about and love those things that's what's smelling like it's gonna oh my god it's gonna taste gonna be I want to taste it well as soon as you done shakin that's all about see if it tastes like a sour frat kid right okay so you need papaya now right I need papaya and you need Philippine mango mango yes okay and I need point nine zero of Philippine that's almost one you need the main go now yeah then I need the sour which is not much of the song it's only 0.15 right so yeah I would think you wouldn't want too much sour in your juice no it just gives it enough of a bite you to where it's like oh okay this is this is more of a fruit cuz sometimes when you eat fresh fruit they have a bite to them um I know I mean look right here not even right it's it's in between the point one and point two like that yeah yeah it's just like four drops right yeah it's not much and in all fairness that's about the same amount of men thought you're gonna add to it okay to start what if I like it cieariy month.i and drops and you can add more but remember it's easier to add more menthol mmm we're making away then to take it away right like with you know food recipes and it's the same with the nicotine you know it's you can it's easier to take it away than it is to add more yeah just like with food I mean you want to add salt but not too much because you can never take away the salt right everything once once you're what there's in it's in it's in yeah and you can't take it out you know it's all about diluting at that point you know exactly and then you just yeah might as well just start over exactly okay so you need the you do the redsetter watermelon um yes I'm like smelling it with it oh wait um point 9 I don't think you did I don't think I did either you're right there's so there's like so many there's how many different flavors uh two four six seven flavors really good recipes and and that's why I think this one is really good it you can tell there's a melon in there you can tell there's a lot of things in there but you should you should only be able to notice like the top three ingredients yeah and a recipe and you so which are the top three ingredients in this recipe thing um camel oh uh huh Philippine mango and watermelon yeah okay well honey dunno it's cantaloupe honeydew and mango and watermelon my kind of I love watermelon so I'm gonna like this but when they start blending together you're not really gonna know tonight which watermelon tonight's mix yeah and the other ones that we're adding are just enhancers mhm so it's really an enhancement of the juice that you're you're making yeah and now you're gonna add your mouth so okay I would start I mean I I usually tell people to start with a drop per milliliter juice you're making so that would make like 30 drops I would start with say weights a nice hour i 10.15 on the sour so maybe just I I would start with 0.25 0.25 because you can always increase it you know like we just discussed but you mean you take back all right okay great well and you know the methyls here so tactically he says this recipe takes like a 10 day steep but they all fruits so I'm really not sure automated testing is the one I've read um it usually takes about two to three days isn't it fruits are usually within it's usually good to go right out of the gate and then it gets better and better over the next three to five days now we're doing PG and I'm making a mess on myself and we're gonna need a bigger syringe for this yeah he's going up on the syringe size there yes we're gonna add 2.7 milliliters it's not so good okay I'm gonna menthol with fruit flavors I'm just such a mad person how much did we out of this two points okay and now we're doing the BG and want to make sure to rinse your syringes too in case you didn't notice that we're doing it so VG I don't know if you can tell but I'm actually holding it with my fingernail it's very very thick so um it is 70 what 73 degrees in here do you want me to put the PPG in yours no I already did oh you did okay yeah I already trying to get the head got a tater okay so how much PG are we going with VG we're going with 21 milliliters okay and then do you want to grab another big ranch like this and put this needle tip on it hmm as soon as I get my 21 milliliter girl in with mine uh yeah that's what I'm thinking yeah because I am getting close and that's the almost well well we imported yeah in 18 and then we're done yeah so um give us some suggestions on you know what flavors you'd like to see be made yeah I mean if you've got a juice and you'd like us to make it we can you know we can make it online or on video yeah what how much of this I got one e1 milliliters now remember I use my fingernail to kind of I pulled pulled pulled and then I clipped my fingernail kind of on this thing it is it's just really so I'm happy I'm still trying to get it out of the syringe now that it's in this is why a lot of people measure by weight because measuring by syringe especially when you're doing larger amounts it gets really frustrating don't hold to hard what happens if you pull too hard then you could actually dislodge the plunger and then you have to start over yeah with your measurement yeah next time we'll measure by weight another option because you know you see how easy it is for me to pull water in here another option when you're doing vegetable glycerin is to get a graduated cylinder that's an easy way to measure for and you just pour it in there so it's really easy because it's so thick is are you gonna get these you're not gonna get the exact measurement well you can always over for a little bit yeah BG and you are diluting if you're doing it in a commercial situation would ya right yeah too much okay I mean this Jase is for you is that mine yeah okay now that we're done with the vet whoops I'm done with little-to-no 14-gauge is the largest waste okay oh yeah I mean there is larger gauges it's harder they're harder to find because they're not commonly used I mean we are using stainless steel needles where we're doing everything we can to try to make it as easy in low-cost again actually this smaller needle is probably more controlled so well and that's actually considered a large meal this looks like it's all we got nicotine and then we're done okay okay so the last thing we need to do is add the nicotine and one thing I like to do when I'm adding when I get nicotine because there's no hole you know this is a sealed container so I'll just take the syringe pop it right in I'll pull everything I need to pull out much c4 that way yeah knock it over and spill it you don't want that happening and I am only adding 0.9 milliliters okay to my mix all right point nine got it and I personally put our tops on already so you can just stick the little tip in now make sure you put your cap on got mine with month off pearl without shake six two six six six now a couple of things you can add to this before you put the cap on and seal it you can add we have multiple offer multiple different kinds of hemp extract it's very high in CBD this is our Onyx this is our platinum and this is our gold all different strengths same size bottle the different strengths and abilities strongest and we also offer Rick's mix which is 50 milligrams per milliliter so in your illiquid calculator you would measure it at 50 milligrams strength in order to get the amount you would want to add to your 30 ml or 50 ml or whatever size a bottle you're doing but you can add that right to this e-liquid even with everything else in there and get yourself some added benefit of the CBD exactly and you and you can add it to the CBD and lotions and we're gonna talk about that later on but you know yeah I mean I'm I'm interested in making a CBD lotion cuz I'm not old and my arthritis in my hands is killing me well I have one at home and I use it on my lower back because I have a very very bad lower back so and it and it works so you know you can use it and lotions tinctures and even in food I made a what

not kidding this a dangerous campaign here equally with salad and the pork roast so the first thing I'm doing this morning is I'm getting some vitamins going for my honey because he's got a cold so see I've got his vitamin thing out I'm actually gonna give him the l-lysine which I've shared with you about my want to get a cold sore but I'm also gonna use it for him today for his cold plus of course vitamin C here it is in the package vitamin C the other thing that's happening this morning is I'm putting on a pork roast so it's about a 10 pound roast on this side I've got the Lowery's seasoning salt and on the other side I've got just salt and pepper I'm actually gonna cook it fat side up and I've got the oven set to 450 until it gets to temperature and then I'm gonna turn it down like 225 and cook it at 225 hold a just a very low and slow and then we'll eat it later tonight this is where my water ended up yesterday full full empty empty so I had 50 ounces and I did not take my supplements yesterday today is actually a fasting day so I'm gonna fast today until tonight when I have the pork probably six o'clock I've been up so it'll be like let's see probably an 18 hour fast so I've been up now for four hours I haven't had anything to eat or drink I need to drink my first quart of water I'm not gonna eat again until tonight and I'll tell you along the way how it's going I'm fasting days you know usually I'm a little bit more emotional and I have a few more issues because under my normal circumstances I'm kind of eating down my emotions fasting they're my emotions kind of Ardmore to the surface so we'll kind of see how today goes it's 11:30 I'm hanging in there I've had my first half a quart of water I'm gonna go finish the first quart right now because drinking while I'm fasting helps to 130 I'm super flushed my cheeks are super red I'm doing okay I need to go and drink some water I've got if it's one 32 33 34 35 34 and a half hours before I eat again one of the things that I really have to deal with during fasts fastings and my emotions just as much as stuff is stored in my body emotions are stored in my body to it I have to do some emotional release to be able to make it through my fasting so I'm gonna be doing some writing this afternoon to try to get out anything that's there that needs to kind of work through me because I really believe that keeping emotions inside my body is not healthy for me the other thing is the flushed cheeks so I went online and said you know like why do you get flushed cheeks when you fast or what's about the flushed cheeks and the fasting I really couldn't find anything I still believe it's from dehydration as I drink more than the flushing the flush cheek seems to go away so much fasting it is 2:30 now I can't show you the clock because I'm in the middle of a riveting game of jungle speed and if you haven't seen this or you haven't played it I will link it below you can give it a try it's a lot of fun see here's the card and you use that totem as part of the game we're back to jungle speed so apparently we're writing the rules down and we're calling them our house rules and we've got a my little sticky notes going for another round and we've got Lee here and my fasting is going good it's 4:30 I feel fine my cheeks are good I've been doing lots of water and that really helps me I feel great okay Lee so far what do you think about the game general speed it's a really fun game but sometimes it comes with injuries we're supposed to grab the stick right here multiple of us grab the stick comes at a cost it comes at a cost I love the game okay would you recommend it I would recommend it not to young children under five but would recommend okay great thanks for the recommendation you are not kidding it's a dangerous game pal here where's the totem so they too are like they're not oh my gosh yeah okay that's this is a painful game I mean I think it's a good game but it seems to be kind of painful all right here we go count three two one three two one discard when we all did so she should only have two in her pile why don't you flip your discard uh-oh flip my discard you had them all sitting here and we both flipped darts under there are certain consequences that you have to put it into your draw pile I didn't ever have that concept I think you're being a cheater that's what I think but read the votes you made up the room no I just copied him in a way that's more understandable that's not true 4 3 2 3 2 color we didn't explain after u s-- we just start keeping track of when leaf favors a person okay I'm gonna be a charge of that no no here hand me good thinking on admin it things to be bigger laughs oh my god okay so that means that you have to take my card yep simple 3 2 1 3 2 1 I just figured an awesome thing so this is my cheese slicer and I'm just taking off the cucumber stuff with the cheese slicer I'm gonna show you watch look how easy that is so now it'll be like a really nice cut too much of it but it'll be a really nice looking celery slice that's something new for me I love it go good it looks ok it's time to end my fast it's 6 o'clock I have already had three quarters of my water see 3 empties my other one is still full but I really do feel good and I think a big part of it is I've had lots of water today see my face is nice it's not all flushed or anything and we are having this pork roast for dinner I'll show it to you how it looks now just cut good and then we're having salad with lettuce eggs tomatoes and cucumber almonds broccoli that I cooked in my Ziploc sipping steam bag of course which I love I will link that below because that stuff is perfect and fast is over this is the final version broccoli with salad and the pork roast looks good what do you go for our dessert tonight we're having all this so delicious vanilla bean coconut milk non-dairy no added sugar and this is the details of the back yeah and then I put in here I put raspberries you know how about the antioxidants with the raspberries and some milk that's my dessert looks good super big news big big news it is 8:30 at night and guess what has happened today empty empty empty empty I was already doing pretty good with my water but we were over in the living room and Lee came over and walked my last one over to me and I just drank the whole thing so I feel like this drank drinking one like just just get it down really makes a big difference what do you think Lee well I just think if you have water next to you and you know that you're doing the windy wacky straw challenge that you'll drink more water so I think that's your two and then what have you had since you've been here today this will be my third glass of this about the same size about the same size yours yeah so you getting some good watering I have other news which I kind of hinted at the other day but April is picking me up tomorrow at 4:50 in the morning to go to the gym to do like a body pump class Wow that should be fun but it should be scary and I will record as much as I can remember and Lee tonight told me like I had that dessert with the the top yeah mihaela top and the raspberries and he said oh you should report that you should record that you know I don't feel like as good and recording all my food as I am sometimes like some days I just nail it other days it's like a completely forget so he reminded me again that I need to be recording all my food so I got to get back to that I gotta make a commitment on that so thank you for for reminding me of that oh no we're all just one big communities in this community if oh you know we should talk about you for a minute about me yeah let's talk about you for a man I'm single yeah yes that's that's a good thing to know also how much weight have you lost about 30 pounds 30 pounds do you want to tell what your before waiting on us and your weight now we'll keep it suspended for a next video [Laughter] okay well you're here please wait that may be a little bit his weight loss story in another video today see you tomorrow tomorrow you", "-v_Esyj8Z4M": "welcome to healthy how to's YouTube\nchannel let's get started with the video vitamin b6 also known as pyridoxine is a\nwater-soluble vitamin that your body needs for several functions it's\nsignificant to protein fat and carbohydrate metabolism and the creation\nof red blood cells and neurotransmitters your body cannot produce vitamin b6 so\nyou must obtain it from foods or supplements most people get enough\nvitamin b6 through their diet but certain populations may be at risk for\ndeficiency consuming adequate amounts of vitamin b6 is important for optimal\nhealth and may even prevent and treat chronic diseases here are the health\nbenefits of vitamin b6 number one vitamin b6 may improve mood and reduce\nsymptoms of depression vitamin b6 plays an important role in mood regulation\nthis is partly because this vitamin is necessary for creating neurotransmitters\nthat regulate emotions including serotonin dopamine and gamma amino\nbutyric acid GABA vitamin b6 may also play a role in decreasing high blood\nlevels of the amino acid homocysteine which have been linked to depression and\nother psychiatric issues several studies have shown that depressive symptoms are\nassociated with low blood levels and intakes of vitamin b6 especially in\nolder adults who are at high risk for B vitamin deficiency number two vitamin b6\nmay promote brain health and reduce Alzheimer's risk vitamin b6 may play a\nrole in improving brain function and preventing Alzheimer's disease but the\nresearch is conflicting on the one hand b6 can decrease high homocysteine blood\nlevels that may increase the risk of Alzheimer's vitamin b6 may prevent a\ndecline in brain function by decreasing homocysteine levels that have been\nassociated with Alzheimer's disease and memory impairments number 3 vitamin b6\nmay prevent and treat anemia by aiding hemoglobin production due to its role in\nhemoglobin production vitamin b6 may be helpful\npreventing and treating anemia caused by deficiency hemoglobin is a protein that\ndelivers oxygen to your cells when you have low hemoglobin your cells don't get\nenough oxygen as a result you may develop anemia and feel weak or tired\nstudies have linked low levels of vitamin b6 with anemia especially in\npregnant women and women of childbearing age\nhowever vitamin b6 deficiency is thought to be rare in most healthy adults so\nthere is limited research on using b6 to treat anemia not getting enough vitamin\nb6 can lead to low hemoglobin and anemia so supplementing what this vitamin may\nprevent or treat these issues number four\nvitamin b6 may be useful in treating symptoms of PMS vitamin b6 has been used\nto treat symptoms of premenstrual syndrome or PMS including anxiety\ndepression and irritability researchers suspect that b6 helps with emotional\nsymptoms related to PMS due to its role in creating neurotransmitters that\nregulate mood some research has indicated that high doses of vitamin b6\nmay be effective at decreasing anxiety and other mood issues associated with\nPMS due to its role in creating neurotransmitters number five vitamin b6\nmay help treat nausea during pregnancy vitamin b6 has been used for decades to\ntreat nausea and vomiting during pregnancy in fact it's an ingredient in\ndye Klages a medication commonly used to treat morning sickness researchers are\nnot entirely sure why vitamin b6 helps with morning sickness but it may be\nbecause adequate b6 plays several vital roles in ensuring a healthy pregnancy\nvitamin b6 supplements in doses of 30 to 75 milligrams a day have been used as an\neffective treatment for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy number six\nvitamin b6 may prevent clogged arteries and reduce heart disease risk vitamin b6\nmay prevent clogged arteries and minimize heart disease risk research\nshows that people with low levels of vitamin b6 have almost doubled\nthe risk of getting heart disease compared to those with higher b6 levels\nthis is likely due to the role of b6 in decreasing elevated homocysteine levels\nassociated with several disease processes including heart disease one\nstudy found that rats deficient in vitamin b6 had higher blood levels of\ncholesterol and developed lesions that could cause artery blockages after being\nexposed to homocysteine compared to rats with adequate b6 levels human research\nalso shows a beneficial effect of b6 in preventing heart disease a randomized\ncontrolled trial in 158 healthy adults who had siblings with heart disease\ndivided participants into two groups one that received 250 milligrams of vitamin\nb6 and five milligrams of folic acid every day for two years and another that\nreceived a placebo the group that took b6 and folic acid had lower homocysteine\nlevels and less abnormal heart tests during exercise than the placebo group\nputting them at an overall lower risk of heart disease vitamin b6 may help reduce\nhigh homocysteine levels that lead to narrowing of arteries this may minimize\nheart disease risk number seven vitamin b6 may help prevent cancer getting\nenough vitamin b6 may lower your risk of developing certain types of cancer the\nreason why b6 may help prevent cancer is unclear but researchers suspect that\nit's related to its ability to fight inflammation that may contribute to\ncancer and other chronic conditions research on vitamin b6 and breast cancer\nalso shows an association between adequate blood levels of b6 and a\ndecreased risk of the disease especially in postmenopausal women number 8 vitamin\nb6 may promote eye health and prevent eye diseases vitamin b6 may play a role\nin preventing eye diseases especially a type of vision loss that affects older\nadults called age-related macular degeneration\na.m. studies have linked high blood levels of\ncirculating homocysteine with an increased risk of AMD since vitamin b6\nhelps reduce elevated blood levels of homocysteine getting enough b6 may lower\nyour risk of this disease a seven-year study in over 5,400 female health\nprofessionals found that taking a daily supplement of vitamin b6 b12 and folic\nacid b9 significantly reduced AMD risk by 35 to 40 percent compared to a\nplacebo while these results suggest that b6 may play a role in preventing AMD\nit's difficult to tell if b6 alone would offer the same benefits research has\nalso linked low blood levels of vitamin b6 to eye conditions that block veins\nthat connect to the retina a controlled study and over 500 people found that the\nlowest blood levels of b6 were significantly associated with retinal\ndisorders vitamin b6 supplements may reduce your\nrisk of age-related macular degeneration AMD additionally adequate blood levels\nof b6 may prevent issues that affect the retina\nnumber 9 vitamin b6 may treat inflammation associated with rheumatoid\narthritis vitamin b6 may help reduce symptoms associated with rheumatoid\narthritis the high levels of inflammation in the body that result\nfrom rheumatoid arthritis may lead to low levels of vitamin b6 inflammation\nassociated with rheumatoid arthritis may lower blood levels of vitamin b6\nsupplementing with high doses of b6 may help correct deficiencies and reduce\ninflammation but more research is needed to confirm these effects however it's\nunclear if supplementing with b6 decreases inflammation in people with\nthis condition those were 9 benefits to vitamin b6 most people can get adequate\nvitamin b6 through their diet in some cases taking higher amounts of vitamin\nb6 from supplements under the supervision of a doctor may

what I eat in the day you're probably wondering this is a beauty Channel why you doing this lately I have found that my passions for what constitutes beauty have changed a little bit my interest in makeup I still have a huge interest in makeup but my interest in health and fitness and how to live a healthy lifestyle have just grown exponentially over the last six months to a year however I do have a weight loss story video I believe on my channel already but I am due to do another one but for those of you really quickly you don't know I did lose 70 pounds once prior in my life I will insert a photo here for you for a point of reference I for the record I am no longer as lean as I am in the after photo of this photo but that is also because I've dedicated more time into putting on muscle and putting on good weight not fat but muscle and just really getting into the gym going 5 to 6 sometimes 7 days in a row and I'm really putting a lot of my passion and energy into that and healthy eating and what I do to maintain that loss so to speak and that lifestyle and to never go back to being unhealthy the way that I was not to say that if you are a heavier person that you are and healthy but I was living an unhealthy lifestyle you can be living a healthy lifestyle at any size I'm just to be clear but just to start showing you a little bit more of what I'm into beauty is however you want to see it there will still be makeup videos on my channel but you're gonna see that it's going to be a little bit more of an authentic lifestyle channel for me and my channel and hopefully we can all grow together and that I want to keep my beauty girls here and maybe bring some my Fitness girls along the way my health girls but my girls would love to cook that's me too so just segue into this new phase of my channel here is my healthy when I eat in the day the video check it out good morning YouTube that's an accurate start to my day oh me running okay hi YouTube welcome to this eat in a day video I'm sorry I keep staring at the screen because I'm not used to not using my vlog camera and this iPhone 10 makes you look like a gorilla monster anyway at the encouragement of my friend serene which she has her own channel I'm sure you already know it the five of you who are watching this video it's called trust yourself happy check her out serene will have the link down below how come she told me to do it ins a video because she came over my house and I was telling her about all my healthy eating cool things and she was like you are really passionate about health and fitness you should incorporate that into your channel so here we are so we're gonna start the day off with my coffee so this is what I happened I just used my little Keurig single-serve which can be a pain in the ass and then awesome I'm not saying this is the healthiest in the world because it's not but this caramel macchiato sugar-free international delight is bomb normally you can only find like hazelnut and sugar-free vanilla I tend to go for sugar-free instead of fat-free cause I think a little bit of healthy fats is important and getting your carbs from something that's just gonna be pure sugar to me is not worth it a lot of people don't believe in sugar-free foods but alas I'm not one of those people and I'm gonna tell you do whatever you want to do so there's two grams of fat for one tablespoon which is plenty because this is like super creamy it's not like using milk or I thought I need a lot more less than one gram of carb and no protein so it's practically I don't really count this in my macros to be honest because on the program that I follow which is run out sounds periodization Olympic down below as well if it's under four or five I think for any one of these for all three then long as you're only doing one serving you know half the counting which is great but if you can find the caramel macchiato I find it at Walmart this shiz is the bomb that's usually how I start my day I am not really huge on eating right when I wake up it's really hard for me actually which ends up making my five to six meals that I try to get in a day difficult but usually if I think a little bit of coffee that will stimulate my appetite so if you have that same problem and you're trying to fit in all your meals for the day most people probably don't have that problem and they have no problem eating right away or they have no problem eating and the problem is we may just start too late I wake up too late I start too late after I wake up and then it's just hard to recover and then I end up eating like two meals at one at the end of my night as my boyfriend one of the test when I bring all these foods into bed with us this is my first meal not really it's not really no but this is how I get my day started food wise and if you are looking for something to make your coffee taste here there you go hashtag not sponsored hashtag who would sponsor me hashtag I would take a sponsorship from I use a food scale you can buy a basic one like this it's not bad it's a little small but it's not bad but the best thing I can possibly recommend to you and one of the things that I was trying to screen about because I'm so obsessed with it [Music] it's like a bajillion dollars if you buy it on Amazon but there's a better Bath & Beyond version that I can't tell the difference and it's like 30 bucks after the coupon but you will literally weigh the food and it gives you the macro count right and you're wondering how does it do that and you just tell it what food you have an app where there's also a book that they give you and then you put in the code for the food and then it gives you the macro count for that food and you're thinking well what about my item that I it's definitely not in the book you can make a custom one put in all the information and then you'll have to do it once and then I just keep a track of what the code is that I create for that item and then it tells me exactly what it is so for things like pasta and stuff it makes it so easy I can just throw it on and then it'll tell me if I'm meeting the carb count or the fat count or the protein count that I'm aiming for and it just you guys if you are into health and fitness in tracking macros this is the best freaking invention in the history of life I promise you some other worthwhile purchases are a really nice blender because I make protein shakes and I like having them with ice it makes no frothy or it makes it feel like I'm getting more bang for my buck mass wise like it ends up being the same nutrition wise but it just feels like it's more because it's more aerated I love my ninja I got this at Costco for like 60 bucks which was a great deal I'm not sure if it's a Costco exclusive this design could be Costabile tends to do that but I really really really recommend this it's also really cool my boyfriend introduced me to this he did not do a good job washing this because it's variable if still from his pre-workout but it's Cola pro-mix I'm not endorsing this so much only because I've had two and they both broke on me but his is lasted forever so maybe I'm just a bad pro-mix owner I don't know but you can put any sort of I and that's a good B you could put any mix in here like protein pre-workout what-have-you and it blends it right up for you which is really cool it just was a little automated thing here my brother I got one for him for Christmas he loves it so if you're into stuff like that these are really really handy just to keep in your gym bag and then you can mix with water at the gym what have you just a couple of cool items that make my life and my boyfriend's life a little bit easier right now you're thinking why does she have a bunch of broccoli in a cup of water well let me tell you why I have a bunch of broccoli in a cup water when my vegetables tend to go bad or they're starting to go bad and I can tell they're starting to get soft please excuse my horrible nails right now I cut off the stems this works for carrots onions broccoli celery pretty much anything that's in that similar vein and you let it sit in a cup of water this will rehydrate the reason why they're getting wilty and gross even though they seem more watery it's because they have lost water so when they lose the water they are no longer firm which then it makes them soft and squishy if that makes any sense so all you need to do is make a clean cut and you can do this over and over and over and submerge the ends and water and they will reform up these were really disgusting yesterday so this is kind of the eating plan that I follow today I'm gonna be working out after only one meal there's because I have my schedule works so basically this is broken down like this and then it tells me when I should be having so right now I need to figure out their demographic carbs half of a sort of a healthy fats two intervals of greens and only 30 ounces that friendly so what my God made I'm not even sure let's figure that out okay this is what I think I'm gonna go for I think I'm gonna make an egg sandwich with this oven roasted turkey breast fat-free cream cheese this is the best bread in the world this is the Dave's bread the 60 calories then sliced ones my boyfriend thinks they're too tiny but I like on and an egg for my fat normally I don't have egg whites but because I haven't happened earlier fat's today that's what I'm gonna get him because I love me an egg yolk something fierce now the way I know any carbs is I count net carbs because I think that if it's not staying in my body and it's not processable in my body and i Jesta ball then why am i counting it is my philosophy a lot of people might not agree with that but you do you I do mean that's all I'm saying so for me that means subtracting the fiber from the count so for each slice it's 12 grams minus 3 grams equals 9 grams and for whole-grain I don't count I only look at the carbs that's how my program works that way I don't have to think about adding everything if your My Fitness Pal person you can just put in all skin this and put in all the ingredients yourself if you're counting every single macro I only do it per sort of category of macro if that makes sense as long as it falls under the approved foods and whole grains bread does for me anyway so I'm only worried about the carb count on this but if you are into that it's not super high protein bread but it's definitely better than most and it's really delicious I love this bread so 9 grams would mean that have to have more than 3 slices there's a little bit of carbs coming from this turkey so I'm gonna be ok with just having 3 slices I'm gonna go sandwich and then I'm gonna have one extra piece of toast maybe with some laughing couch Oh or maybe I just put some fat-free cream cheese on it with some of the best seasoning in the history or the world are you ready it is the everything but the bagel sesame seasoning with salt garlic and onion from Trader Joe's this is basically everything bagel seasoning if you can see that can you see that it's delicious and that's probably what I'm gonna do today I put that on my sandwich and on my extra piece of toast for my pre-workout meal and as long as I work out within three hours then this meal will definitely be perfect for my pre-workout meal so I'm gonna get protein from this protein from this guy carbs and my fat from this guy as well so we should be utilizing and then I'm gonna use a tomato and some bell peppers on the sandwich but you're gonna take out some of my veggie counts that's gonna my meal I'll show it to you when it's all done alright so here we are the cream cheese bagel spread on the Davis bread the egg is hiding under there and as the yolk is ready to pop by egg and then I got the turkey on here and then I have some bell peppers and some seasoned heirloom tomato on top I'm gonna put that together and then this extra piece of bread it's let me get some more on that fat-free cream cheese and the seasoning and I might put a little bit more tomato in there as well and that is meal number one can't believe anyone could possibly find this interesting but serene tells me the news this isn't meal - but it is what I'm bringing with me to the gym for my intro work out protein shake this is the ghost whey protein in do it I test a pastry I do like this flavor the only thing I don't like about it is it has chunks of like pastry in it I don't know who wants like chunky like bit siffredi stuff in their protein so ghosts if you're watching which I know you're not I like the flavor but those little bits are kind of weird not gonna lie to you you can kind of see them or hear them at least in there so I'm gonna have this and I have a few about 7 to 8 sour patch kids during my workout as my intro workout carbs and that's coming with me to the gym dog hey y'all quick little ditty I drink this at the gym or anything I just feel like I'm a little bit it's basically them you know your wallet this is me apple flavors pretty good muscle recovery of energy in scope basically you can have it anytime except before bed I wouldn't recommend it but here is the back of all the wonderful things that are in it it's only one gram of carbs and I just find that it gives me extra pep in my step throughout the day I like to do it during my workout because t see me and encouraged me to keep drinking water basically optimal nutrition is a really good brand I tend to frost on most things again not sponsored which I was hey y'all so I just finished my workout and it's 6 o'clock so I've literally only had one meal today and at 6 o'clock I'm supposed to get 6 meals in today technically my workout carbs and protein shake is milk - so I'm supposed to still have 4 meals today and it's 6 o'clock um I went to Trader Joe's and picked up a few of my favorite healthy items let me know if you want a healthy items that I like at Trader Joe's they do cuz I'll do that for you if you like umm okay so for dinner I'm making baked barbecue chicken so I like to just take chicken thighs and I trim them even though they're for listen skinless so they say there's still a lot of skin and other extra stuff that I trim off I like thighs better they are tastier they have more fat content than breasts do but the macros are still really good and I'm going to put some sugar free barbecue sauce on this now that it's pretty much baked through so that I know that it's cooked all the way sometimes with barbecue sauce on that you can tell and for salad we have red onion tomato reduced-fat feta and dried cranberry with romaine and a little bit of sesame seeds and I just make my homemade dressing with balsamic vinaigrette and some seasoning garlic etc for a healthy kind of homemade dressing there are separately lower fat dressings if you don't want to use olive oil that I would recommend I'm one is from Trader Joe's and it is this one this is Green Goddess salad dress and it has avocado green and again lemon juice chives basil and garlic and it is in the refrigerated section I'm super healthy if you are looking for something a little bit lower fat than a traditional dressing but for this I have some facts coming my way and for the sugar-free barbecue sauce tonight we are going to go with this guy guy is award-winning barbecue sauce bacon I'd order this online you can find it I bought it on nutrition calm but check that baby Oh compared to regular barbecue sauce this is a dream yummy got some brown rice going in a pot and then I'm gonna take some fat-free Greek yogurt and mix it with a little bit of this ranch seasoning this is the trick if you love creamy dressings just by the seasoning and mix it with I don't mix it with a mocha mayonnaise I mix it with Greek yogurt and it is so good you can use that for dips anything I'm gonna make sort of like since it's barbecue I think you're like ranch with a little bit of perfect with my barbecue chicken and however I don't know how I'm going to make it into all my meals today as usual you no I've been really bad and they saw three meals to eat left so I was a snack calorie-dense tiny snack I have my start working a half of this protein popcorn and I make my final move before bedtime I have this before to the shower this is the icon meals protein popcorn banana split flavor it's not my favorite flavor these icon those popcorns or my favorites probably either the chocolate or the mint chocolate but these are not really tasty I buy them at GNC when I'm serving in half should give me my macros for one more meal it doesn't have any of the veggies that I require but that means to an end this is kind of what happens on a lot of days I just wait too long and then something comes up and I don't eat for a while and here we are again so it really is a typical day for me okay this is a very typical last meal of the day for me it usually ends up combining what I'm supposed to have four meals five and six um my boyfriend calls this mud but it's Susan I read a bedtime it consists of my casein protein which I'm supposed to have was my last meal casein is great for before bed it's supposed to away they're both derived from milk but casein is a slow digesting protein and it means that your body is working to digest that all night long so it's always working even when you're sleeping which burns calories and is very good and it says Siri says our so your body always has fuel even when you're not eating when you sleep so I'm gonna come on scoop of this about a cup of nonfat Greek yogurt from Costco a little bit of unsweetened almond milk around Trader Joe's a little bit of dark chocolate cocoa powder and sugar free and almost a couple sprinkles though sugar free chocolate chips about these on nutrition as well sometimes if I want to be a little bit more sweet then I'll add a little bit of this shorter fruit or honey peanut butter syrup in addition to my fat source which is my Trader Joe's creamy unsalted peanut butter it's really important when you have peanut butter to get something where the ingredients literally just say peanuts sometimes it'll say salt it's not insulting so it doesn't but you don't want something like no offense this stuff like my boyfriend likes you can see in the ingredients list sure and palm oil peanuts already have oil you don't need something that has added oil and it doesn't make any sense that adds to the carb Channel it's funny because it says natural but there's all these extra thing isn't it this stuff is literally just dry roasted peanuts oh yeah there's also a lot of fiber so of seven minus three equals four I'm supposed to have four tablespoons of nut butter before and these two meals combined it would be two for me on two for another but I have two combined them into this one meal so all this ends up coming into my little mud and I'll show it to you but additionally I would put this in a very tall glass so I can stir it very vigorously and get it all incorporated but for the purposes of showing you the word I put it in this bowl but I might transfer it to a mug just so it's easily just like and it wouldn't spill everywhere okay and that's my finished mud with my little sprinkles of should I buy chocolate chips on top right now just too great but a lot of people do not like KC they have an aversion to it I guess this is good way for me to get it down and kind of just sense it mean kind of like pudding and that's my final meal for the day I'm supposed to have 20 grams of carbs so with the cocoa powder and so with the cocoa powder and the carbs that are in the dairy which I do have to count I didn't really create an ending to this even a day it was my first one to be honest a little strange they will get better over time but don't forget to Like and subscribe this channel if you are supportive of me and my new direction in my life cetera if you're gonna stay please like that in the comments I love the little tiny community that we have here already and I'd love to keep all of

we're going to be starting unit 3 on environmental chemistry today we're going to be talking about vitamins and nutrients so by the end of today you should know what a macro molecule is you should be able to identify a carbohydrate a lipid and a protein and no properties of them you should be able to explain the difference between organic and inorganic molecules and know the difference between vitamins and minerals we might also talk a little bit about fertilizers today which are nutrients for plants so nutrients we need them for our bodies to be maintained okay these are certain chemicals found in foods this is a picture of the canada food guide that was put out a few years ago and it's not quite as prescribed as the old one used to be it's a little more general but basically we need lots of fruits and vegetables in our diet about half of our plate we need protein which comes from things like meat we have some tofu here this might be like some greek yogurt or something there's some eggs there's some fish some beans some nuts and seeds and then we have whole grains so whole grain noodles and rice whole grain bread maybe this is some quinoa or something like that okay so we need nutrients to have energy we need nutrients to grow and for our muscles and ourselves to build and repair so when we talk about energy this is mostly the job of carbohydrates okay when we talk about growth building and repair these are mostly the job of proteins now the process of taking in nutrients when we actually put them into our mouths that's called ingestion and then digestion is the process where our food is broken down in our stomach and our intestines into smaller molecules and these molecules are then absorbed into the bloodstream in your intestines and then they circulate throughout your body giving these macromolecules and these chemicals to every cell in your whole entire body so nutrients can be divided into two major groups we have the organic and the inorganic so organic nutrients are those which break down over time and they contain carbon okay this is the element carbon c okay these include carbohydrates lipids proteins and vitamins so that is an important point to write down and make sure you know they contain carbon inorganic are not made from carbon and an example is minerals so these are things found on the periodic table that you still need in your body like [Music] iron like sodium okay um so here we have a picture of sodium here we have a picture of all different types of proteins from our organic section here we have a picture of some vitamins these are actually the vitamins that i take you can find them at costco if you want now vitamins are not a replacement for eating whole foods but they can help us get the maximum doses that we need especially for example since we live in canada and we don't get as much sun in the winter taking a supplement or a vitamin a vitamin d can be a good thing because you're not going to get that through the sunlight and you can't eat vitamin d in food okay so sometimes vitamins are important but we don't want to rely on them instead of eating actual foods okay so let's talk about our macro molecules now so these are our macro molecules and we have carbohydrates proteins and lipids lipids are our fats okay so carbohydrates are our energy source okay there's things like rice grains potatoes fruits and vegetables okay and if you remember from that picture that's going to be basically three-fourths of our plate because this is the half and then this is the other quarter okay then we have protein so proteins are involved in those repairs and buildings of tissues and muscles they're using chemical reactions in the body and they are a structural molecule okay proteins are found in meats fish um eggs dairy products nuts okay and then we have lipids and fats and these are um used as storage in the body for that unused energy so that we can store it for a later date okay lipids and fats also insulate our organs so that they are protected in case we bump into something or we fall okay and some examples of lipids and fats are vegetable oils some dairy some nut oils and sometimes we eat these as part of our meal like if we have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich but sometimes we use them to cook with so maybe we cook our vegetables in an oil okay now we're going to talk about vitamins so remember vitamins are still organic okay there are 13 essential vitamins that our body needs and these are called essential vitamins because the body doesn't make them it can't produce these on its own so they have to come from food or supplements and like i said it's better to get them from eating a wide variety of food but let's say you have an allergy to something that's really high in a certain vitamin maybe you'll have to supplement that with um like a multivitamin or something okay in our category of vitamins we have water soluble vitamins such as vitamin b and vitamin c and then we have fat soluble vitamins such as a d e and k now water soluble vitamins if you have too much of them you'll just pee it all out if you drink too much orange juice and you take some vitamin c supplements you'll just pee out the rest of it if your body doesn't need it but we have to be careful when we take vitamins like a d e and k because those would be stored in our body we don't just pee them out in our water okay so if you're taking vitamin a d e or k you have to be careful on your dosage that you're not taking too much because too much of anything is not a good thing vitamins also need things called enzymes to help speed up the rate at which they're absorbed into the body okay so enzymes just help vitamins get into our body okay then we have minerals so these are inorganic substances and then we kind of two categories of minerals as well so we have trace minerals so we need less than 100 milligrams of these a day so these are things like iodide zinc fluoride so sometimes there's fluoride in tap water just to make sure everybody gets enough of it because it's kind of hard to get from food and that just keeps your teeth strong and your bones strong and when you go to the dentist sometimes you may get a fluoride treatment on your teeth so that you don't get get as many cavities um iodide usually when you're at the store you buy salt that is iodized iodized salt and so that is more than enough if you're having a little bit of salt every day you're getting more than enough iodine okay then we have macro minerals which you need more than 100 milligrams per day and these are things like potassium magnesium calcium and these are in lots of food so i'm sure you can think of potassium there's a picture up there bananas then we have calcium which we know is in milk and dairy products and magnesium i think magnesium is in um dark green veg vegetables so these are things that it's easy to eat a lot of them and you just have to make sure you're eating a good variety of food to get all of them and if you don't think you're eating a good variety of food to gain all these macro minerals then maybe you need to take a supplement here we just have a picture so these are all foods that contain a b vitamin there's lots of different kinds of b vitamins there's b b6 and b12 um yeah sometimes i've noticed that if i take a b12 supplement um i feel i feel better i don't feel as tired i don't get as many canker sores so i don't know how scientific that is but that's just my own experience so make sure you always talk to your doctor before you start a new supplement okay so here we have a chart of some of the minerals and vitamins oh there's no vitamins on here these are all just the minerals and you can see their symbol and this is from the periodic table because they're all elements and these are their roles in the human body i'm not going to go through all of them but we might do an assignment where you can look back on this page and it could be helpful for you okay lastly today we're just going to talk about plants and nutrition so plants are actually really good at extracting nutrients from the soil because of their extensive root system so all these minerals that we've been talking about the soil is full of them and that's why plants are such a good thing for us to eat because when the plant grows it takes up all those minerals from the soil and then they are trapped inside that plant and so when we eat the plant we get those minerals in us and plants are really good at this because they have these tiny hairs on their roots that increase the surface area oops that increase the surface surface area and so the roots can come into contact with lots of soil and lots of water where the nutrients are found and then like i said once the roots go once the minerals go into the roots then it can go up to the other parts of the plant and sometimes we eat the leaves of the plants sometimes we eat the roots of the plants it just depends and so when we're eating a carbohydrate like a carrot we're actually eating the root of the carrot and we're getting all those minerals that the carrot got from the soil as well so just like us plants need minerals to survive when the soil is bare from minerals then we have to add fertilizer to the soil to get them back into the environment and if any of you know a farmer you'll know that they have to do something called crop rotation sometimes because different plants need different minerals to grow really well and so let's say if they plant wheat in their field one one year then they might plant peas on it the next year because those plants need different minerals and so if the wheat took all of one mineral out of the soil then that one's depleted so then they shouldn't plant wheat there again and so maybe they'll plant peas the next year because that uses a different mineral in the soil and it'll allow that other mineral to build back up um if that's not the case though they could add fertilizer okay so in this guide we can see what the different minerals do for plants so we can see that um when we are deficient in calcium maybe our leaves don't grow as big they have stunted growth when we are low in magnesium the leaves turn yellow maybe when we're low in uh phosphate the leaves are darker than normal and they fall off so if you're struggling with a plant in your home sometimes the color of the leaves or the shape of the leaves can help you understand which fertilizer to go by and use for your plant to make it feel better so commercial fertilizers usually have three main minerals that they're going to add to the soil and these are nitrogen phosphate and potassium and so we use their element symbols n p and k from the periodic table and that is the order that they are in on fertilizer bags so sometimes a fertilizer it won't tell you that it's npk it'll just have these numbers in this order and you have to know that the first one is for nitrogen the second one is for phosphorous and the last one's for potassium and depending on the fertilizer you want to buy what the need of your plant is you can buy different amounts so this one's a 5 10 15 but maybe maybe you'd want a different percentage if your plant needed some more phosphorus maybe you'd want a 5 15 5 fertilizer okay so here again is kind of what those minerals do in the plants and that is it for today so make sure you know the order of the fertilizers make sure you can identify those macromolecules make sure you know the difference between organic and inorganic substances and the difference between vitamins and minerals thank", "Ph389rdC7AE": "[Music] good morning my friends today is gonna be a full day of eating I don't know why I haven't done this yet to be honest I think it's just because it's a lot of effort and I always like little film a couple meals and I'll be like us could definitely be a full day of eating and then I'll forget two meals and I'm like up the window a joke so I always have my coffee first thing journal first thing this is the best self journal and I do have a cold for it now you guys saw one of my last videos I was like hoping I could get a code for it because I just genuinely loved this and I think it's it's giving me so much clarity so the code for this is description box below guys do you want to get your hands on the best self journal I'm excited about that and I'm starting my day here but I've been super stressed I'm not gonna lie I just have had so many tasks I haven't sat down to map out my week and it's Tuesday and so I'm behind on some stuff and I'm like but the best thing that you can do if that happens to you is not to let that continue to roll into your whole week but to sit down and actually write out all of your tasks like every single one even the ones that seem like nitty gritty I have to meditate otherwise I just can't deal with all thoughts in my head and then map out your week and delegate tasks for certain days the worst thing you can do is have all your tasks and accomplish like one of them and then feel like that feeling of stress cascades into the next day's so that's my best advice right there I'm fasting until twelve so there's not going to be much food to be eaten until later today so I'm gonna get moving on my day but I will see you male 1 I'm super freakin impressed with myself I just got so much done I have tried to give myself accomplishable to-do lists like I was talking about I just go to a space where I can focus and I will lock in for like three to four hours it's amazing I haven't been able to do this and so long like not even it simply College usually my attention span is a lot shorter so you're not alone if that's you too while I was sitting I wanted to kind of curb my hunger a little bit so I just had some almonds it really helps me to have a high fat meal first and almonds are easy because each almond is just about one gram so I had about 12 grams of almonds and now I'm gonna have my first meal of the day just gonna be delicious and I'll explain in three seconds boom you actually still to this day one of my favorite meals so normally um this would be a little bit more decked out but because I'm out of some things I don't have it looking as pretty but we have whole egg on avvocato toast took three egg whites with a bunch of veggies and some cheddar cheese hopefully we will have a running total of my calories for the day going hopefully you appreciate that that dig so much real one going down [Music] that was me too I think which was oatmeal protein and fruit and peanut butter it's like my all-time favorite meal and now it's really good that I'm doing this full day of eating because I've been wanting to just like snacks I've been home for a few hours this helps so this is actually meal 3 pre-workout meal but I just made this and all friends the house down but we got looks so pretty right we're on the chicken hundred grams of potato wedges some zucchini and then this was two rice cakes with 20 grams of peanut butter ate it then we're heading to the gym and maybe I'll have the Edit of this workout right here and then I'll actually see you guys same day back for the last meal and I'll be like goes all one thing you'll be perfect oops it's okay [Music] [Music] starting with major compound movements whenever have a major compound movement in my list I always try to do that first and or elastic I the principle focus but if I'm trying to build strength and something I'll do that first I'll build up my strength with each fatso paramedic great as I go so today overhead press big compound shoulder moving or a little bit because you have to keep it for stable keys with this or at the bottom your forearm should be parallel with your body that's one you need to come all the way to your clavicle if you're trying to do the full range of motion for overhead press some people will go to here pretty here put like a military press or like a strict press I come all the way to my collarbone try to really get can you push it all the way to the top don't push the bar behind your head or in front of me and try to go straight up over here we do but sleep any look who came to join me this time who are you nice to see you good what are you lifting but what but what what are we lifting your training shoulders [Music] with this next movement trying to hit back with the shoulder burn in the back over hard once you get it [Music] [Music] you [Music] right [Music] so finishing off with pulldown so we need to up down we've been pushing and pulling hits different parts of you track them so this is it for this work thank you guys so much for watching you're new make sure that you subscribe [Music] so we are back from the gym yes it is a different day it is the same day as the beginning of this blog but different than the footage that you just saw I just ran glutes and hamstrings you guys just train shoulders and triceps I'm gonna make the same post workout I have every single day of my life which is protein ice cream and today instead of a pancake I really just want cream of wheat so I'm gonna make them of wheat but I'm gonna show you guys how to properly make cream of wheat and then we'll wrap up at the end bear with me and take notes [Music] the key is to blend the ice and the liquid first and then put it in the protein key now the key with cream of wheat is to stir often I cook it for a minute I take it out when I start and put it back in for a min and a half give or take depending and this one I put way too much water in so I'm answer like five minutes normally it's not that long and when it starts to bubble up that's when you know it's almost done otherwise it will not be done so that is what it looks like when it's almost done I definitely put too much water in it but if I stir it enough it should be good so that is what beautiful cream of wheat should look like like a huge so lastly to end this full day of eating guys normally I would put a ton of toppings on both of these but we only have sugar-free syrup and blueberries so we're gonna work with what we got right now and maybe some cinnamon and that'll be it so this is final meal of the day I will pop up macros for this and my total of our hearts for the day I feel like I'm a little bit under but I also did have some bites of things so they're not on prep and I'm not as strict as I would be on prep so this is the end thank you guys for watching make sure you like and subscribe as you've been prompted to this whole time I appreciate every single one of you and I will see you guys in the next video", "Vf2qG2SiJVc": "hello everyone and welcome to wheats I've got the

see also on the front they also let us know that it's got no preservatives added and it's good for and it's made with cage-free eggs so good for them so yeah this is uh looks like their standard or shoe brownie but with M&Ms fair enough anyways I've reviewed two of their products in the past and I found them both to be quite tasty but also quite underwhelming or not again not underwhelming just on the low end of average in terms of their potency I don't know if I mentioned earlier but this one is a hundred and fifty milligrams like the other two in case you haven't seen those you can go back and watch those as well okay here we go so here is the brownie no well a slightly donor just this white we donor nothing that's gonna setting off any alarm bells let's give it a taste that's a good

four or five times I think it's the most potent edible I've had from them yet but it's still not mind-blowing not terrible not terrible just not not outstanding this one is purely in the average range average of average if you see it at a dispensary near you and it is if it's cheap there as it was for me and taste is important to you go ahead and grab one I don't think you're gonna be disappointed but if you're looking for the most potent edible for your buck you might want to look elsewhere with that being said that's about all I had to stay for the trichome treats dripping treats chocolate

increasing your waistline our Renee Inc talks to a healthy eating expert to find out how take a look the more I dig into the food supply the more red flags I found about toxins in food a bonbon began studying healthy eating after three of her family members who are in their 30s were diagnosed with cancer that trigger made to study the food supply in the United States kiss for me only people in their 60s a 70 would have cancer the toxins a bonbon found weren't common foods that you most likely have in your pantry like fig newtons or peanut butter i just want to show you that underlay bow it says 0% trans fat and in the list of ingredients you will see hi Joe generated oi which is trans fat she says according to the FDA we shouldn't be consuming more than one gram of trans fat per day but it's easy to go over that she says diets high in trans fat contribute to heart disease and serious illness another common toxin she found is in something many Americans like to eat with her fries ketchup and when we flipped her label over it says high fructose corn syrup as the number two ingredients she says that syrup is a cheap sweetener used in foods like sodas cookies and cake mixes eating too much of it can contribute to diabetes and obesity read everything in the ingredients not on the top it's the bottom what are some ways that people can eat healthy and use ingredients are not harmful to their health go back to the old fashioned days by preparing meals at home themselves it's not that hard and be sure to include pure organic ingredients you can even do that for holiday cookies and help out a very jolly man that comes by once a year if you plan to leave Santa some cookies this Christmas you might want to try these they're healthy and they're going to help trim this waistline the how the alternative will be to bake the cookies from here and good ingredients with less sugar like organic raisins and semi-sweet chocolate that already have some sugar a bonbon also uses organic oats and coconut oil and fat seats has a lot of omega-3 and it's good for you if you do plan to eat out at restaurants a bonbon says you can always ask what kind of oils they used to prepare your meals she claims even high-end restaurants will use hydrogenated oils which are trans fats because they can be used in friars many times before they degrade for these tips and more on

guys um in that Court it's for my airfryers and stuff on top of my refrigerator see anyway my son had had an eye doctor appointment this morning at 10:30 and I went with him just to make sure because with with our insurance um you have like a certain amount to spend and so he just wanted to make sure that I was there so I can you know make sure he didn't go over that $600 for everything yes everything like your eye exam your lenses all of that go in that 600 and so I had today off anyway so we went to do that but those his birthday and I knew he wasn't he's gonna be with a friend later on today actually he already left that doesn't live here and so he's gonna be gone the rest of the night basically and so I took him out to breakfast for his birthday and he didn't want to cake her anything that's what happens when your kids get older I'm just an even lucky that he's even still at the house you know because he turned 20 today and so um that's my baby but anyway so we went to breakfast had breakfast went to his eye doctor appointment went to the store and then I came home realized I forgot something at the store so I ran down to the mini-mart and picked that up we stopped picked up coffee because he can get a free coffee at Dutch brothers so this is a americano iced with heavy cream and sugar fruit vanilla and I have missed iced coffee I don't drink it a lot in this time of year I just not that I don't felt like I don't have it because it's winter time it's just I get so cold so easily that I don't have I said nothing I miss our smoothies and I really think I may have a smoothie today because I don't think I'm gonna eat lunch because I'm still pretty full from breakfast Oh breakfast was amazing and I feel so proud of myself you guys this is probably the one of the first times going out that I just decided to stay completely keto a lot of times when it's just me my husband having a date night I just I make the decision to have a plan meal usually it's just one meals not the whole day I mean when I go out to lunch with my coworkers most the time I stay pretty keto but sometimes it could be you know hit and miss what I decide to go with but this time I went completely keto so I had an omelet I snapped a picture so I'll put the pictures up here I had what they call a counselor California omelet which had tomato turkey spinach cheese and avocado on top I said no hashbrowns no toast and then I had a side of bacon very proud of myself and it was amazing and I feel so full so I don't think I'll probably have lunch today I'll probably just end up like I said doing a smoothie because I kind of miss smoothies and I have a bunch of those powders and stuff that I might as well just use um and actually we got me thinking about it is I'm gonna be doing a recipe video and it's kind of a video for beginners but those I think everybody will enjoy not just beginners I think it's gonna this Cup I want to have a place I want to start doing some videos that's kind of I wanted to try to talk about my channel goals as well but I want to have a like place where I can have like a certain video especially for beginners I say hey you know I want to know how to make X X and X or I you know how do you make a keto version of something and I want to have one place to point them to versus like oh it's in this vlog somewhere and I have to try to find it today I'm filming one of those and one of them uses protein powder and I got me thinking like gosh I haven't had like a protein smoothie in a long time and so I think I may have one for lunch today this was disgusting I think I showed you guys this on Monday I also have not been doing very good Monday was the last day I had my Apple I did so good for like four or five days in a row and it made me feel so good today I feel puffy and I haven't even like gone off plan but I still feel puffy and yucky and I think it's because I was drinking this and I was feeling so good but not this I was drinking my own apple cider vinegar lemon lemon juice and I and I bought this stuff to put in it and I haven't even used it which by the way I found a cheaper version of this stuff at Walmart so don't be spending the $5.99 on this Walmart has a liquid version of the pure sweetener that I use in my coffee that would be perfect in that and it's like 274 or something this was six dollars at Grocery Outlet um anyway this was 99 cents of Grocery Outlet so I don't mind wasting the 99 cents to not drink this this was disgusting I took one drink and you guys there's so much apple cider vinegar if you like apple cider vinegar you will like this I just the one tablespoon I use in my 32 ounce jar is about all I can handle I think so let's just go into channel goals I um want I feel like my videos have not been as good a quality as they could be I feel like they're rushed and maybe that's just me because I know I'm rushing to get them edited and uploaded and it has been too bad while I've been off these last two weeks but when I go back to work on Monday it's gonna be back to the same old grind you know I leave the house at 7:00 in the morning don't get home until after 5:00 have to make dinner have to clean up after dinner somewhere in between there you know what to do some house working on everything so I want to start figuring out how I can get some better quality videos for yours plus I have been really lacking on the extra videos like I've been having so many requests for recipe videos my meal preps have been really rushed and I also haven't been succeeding very well with mill prepping and I think that's one of the reason why I'm finding myself like totally not staying on my meal plan either and that is one of my personal goals as I want to waste less food I want to spend less on groceries and to do that I need to stick to my meal plan because what's happening is I'm going off on my meal plan I'm picking up things at the grocery store at lunchtime I want to spend less money I want to spend less time shopping during my lunch hours so I want to spend more time getting you guys quality videos and also want to get back to some of my recipe videos and some of these keto beginner videos and things like that I feel like now that I've been done keto for six months I have really gonna have all the basics under my belt you guys are gonna see a video on Sunday that is giving you five tips for beginners and it's things that I learned as I started keto and things I kind of wish I had known before started keto and I'm hoping that's gonna help those of you that are new out there so I want those kind of videos that I want to start you know creating I also want to do more recipe videos I want my meal preps to be more comprehensive and that's for me as well as for you guys plus I'm going to do a couple extra things with those my plan is I think I'm what I'm gonna do is like I said Saturday you still have the grocery whole meal plan Sunday's will probably be more of a either recipe video or maybe another keto beginner video that it can film earlier in the week and then Monday's will be meal prep and then when I'm planning then is to record my food and that's another thing I want to do some weekend recording as far as just my food to be only food I'm also kind of do thinking and doing a Monday Tuesday and getting up on Wednesday and it gives me time on Monday to get you know things edited Tuesday I have time to kind of work on it so that's kind of my plan I think I may do Monday Tuesday goes up Wednesday Wednesday Thursday goes up Friday and then I pass and I need something you know then I think that gives me Tuesdays and Thursdays open to get those through a recipe video in there or just have those days to edit so that's kind of my plan where I think there just be two vlogs up every week but it's gonna be a combination of two days in those vlogs and I'll have food I'll have you know just random chitchat anything exciting I'm going on books that I'm reading that I want to tell you guys about hopefully that all makes sense but my plan is just I want to get more quality videos out there more helpful things out there like I said the printable meal plans the printable recipes whenever I do give a recipe printable meal prep plans that kind of thing that is really kind of my goal that I want to do for you guys and then like I said more beginner stuff but more places and easier access to the recipes is really what I want to do so I want to try to do some more separate recipe videos but I want you guys to think anything's really going to change on my channel it's all gonna be there still gonna be blog still gonna be recipes so gonna be a grocery haul still gonna be meal prepping I'm just trying to add a little bit extra to it and I want to give myself a little bit time to do that so I just wanted to give you guys an update on that as far as personal goals go I do want to start tracking again every day I feel like I need that I also want to keep a kind of a journal of sorts I think I'm gonna get my clever Fox planner back out and use that kind of as my tracker I put a post up on Instagram I think yesterday basically saying that I'm tired of my own BS I feel like I am using what happened in the last basically six months of 2019 with my husband's health issues I think I've been using that as a crutch and as an excuse to not stay I'm playing every single day which it has been but here's the thing is that those things are not going away until we entirely have 100% answers until we know even if we do get answers that may not it's not going away there's gonna be other situations that are gonna be added on to that and I need to learn to get past that and not use you know food and stress as a crutch for this you know emotional time and he's not stressing out about it he's stressing out about being off of work I'm stressing out about what's wrong and he's just kind of like you know whatever it is it is we're just gonna deal with it and we work together and he's so like positive about that and me I'm just like a nervous wreck about it and I feel like if he's not nervous wreck about it then why am I being a nervous wreck about it why am i using that as an excuse to eat a bunch of food that I shouldn't be eating to comfort myself when I could just be using you know we can just comfort each other and I also think that if I write about it then I'm going it'll be a little bit I can just get it out in another way so that clever Fox planner which I'll show you guys as I start using it it has like a daily thing where normally I was recording my food before but I think I'm going to just kind of write my thoughts out for the day and then it has other areas where I can keep track of my water so don't think I wanted to start tracking my water again also I took my measurements yesterday I'm gonna start doing measurements once a month because I feel like that is really important to do when you're in Quito I talk about that more in my five tips for beginners videos going up on Sunday also far as weighing I'm going to weigh every day but I'll report it out once a month when I report out my measurements so that'll be a thing starting in February so you guys will start seeing that the first whatever the first like probably I don't know whatever day I decide to do it on it'll probably be one of those open days that I have either like a Tuesday Thursday or Sunday those are kind of my open days I think if I look at my schedule I think that's what it's gonna be so one of the whatever the first one of those is that falls in when I have the stuff and I'll just start doing them once a month I think it's just I think I need to do those measurements for my own kind of like peace of mind to know that something is happening even if the scales not moving but I will weigh every day but just not report it out until once a month that's kind of a personal goal is to just try to figure out ways to get past all this and I think journaling it and disky and the and the mitt and the weighing and measuring food as well I really haven't been doing that as well I want to start doing that a lot better and so I'm tracking accurately and that's just my own personal thing you don't have to do it when you're on keto it's just something that sometimes if I think it's gonna help me because I am in this kind of a spot right now where I'm just trying to figure out how to handle the stress and I think that seeing everything on my planner which I use car manager by the way seeing that you know where I'm at for the day will really help me set some goals for myself it's not I know for some people tracking frustrates the heck out of them it it's triggering for people it makes them feel like they're it makes them at a lot of stress to their life and so I definitely so suggested if that happens that does that to you it does not do that to me never has I sometimes it's just annoying basically it's just like oh I didn't track that and then he's like oh I forgot the butter I put in the pan I always forget the butter I'll tell you that right now always always when I'm making something I forget to ding butter that I used in the pan and another thing I want to try to look at is maybe using less like heavy cream I don't think it stalls me but I really want to watch how many calories I'm kind of putting in I I don't know because I never I don't really think calories have mattered for me on this journey but I really want to look at maybe using more almond milk and I'm thinking about making my own nut pods because I do have some coconut milk and is really just coconut milk and almond milk together and then trying that on my coffee because it's pretty creamy so there's just some personal things that I'm you know thinking about doing as far as meal prepping like I said I want to go back to my old school meal prepping where I was prepping all of my ingredients prepping everything just like next week I plan eating a lot of omelets you know you guys the omelet thing honestly is like real like I am so obsessed right now but it's almost like the best vessel for using leftovers you guys don't even know the kind of omelets I've had those last few days I had some leftover rotisserie chicken I made an omelet out of it I had some leftover sausage like I had a sausage link and this time making an omelet actually made a scramble out of it I had some red pepper leftover I had I mean I used what it else did I use that one that you guys saw at the steak the there was something else that was kind of random I didn't know if it would work and it did but it's just so crazy it is like the best thing and so what I plan on doing is prepping all my ingredients for those omelets and I can maybe even have them for lunch and I can prep it before I leave for work and just there but anyway I plan on really just going back to prepping all the individual ingredients because that really helped me with making dinner it really helped me with my lunches and I just I want to really get back to staying on track so I just want to go back to kind of back to how I was before a lot of this craziness started happening and I think it's gonna help me be a little bit more positive a little more happier I was kind of looking back at some of my blogs and you guys are so amazing and understanding but y'all I mean I can tell I have not been happy and it's not unhappiness like it's not let unhappy in life it's just there's so many things going on I'm stressed that's the thing stressed to the max and I don't want to portray that and I feel like it's been turning into negativity and you guys know how much I hate negativity like I despise negativity I hate it in the workplace I hate it at home I hate it within myself it drags me down and makes me feel like a terrible person and I do not want that anymore I just want to be positive and happy and you know like I like my husband says we'll just work through it and we will and there's no reason to let all this I mean especially now that I know like the doctor bills have all come in we've been very blessed that the double coverage insurance really helped help with that $30,000 hospital bill so I don't have that to worry about anymore I mean we may have some more upcoming ones but we'll deal with it as we go along payment plans go a long way even if it's only paying like right now I'm going to be paying the hospital they let me pay them $45 a month until it's paid off and so you know just little things like that I mean I gotta do what I got to do and I want to be happy about it so anyway I'm gonna go ahead and get these recipes done if I when I have my smoothie which will pie bean or a little bit I will show you guys how a month roll that together and then dinner tonight I don't know what I'm gonna have I have some chicken wings I need to cook up I made you chicken wings and Caesar salad the family would make taco casserole but I may do something that sounds good chicken wings and Caesar salad that may be what I do for dinner I don't know you guys don't see what I end up doing okay guys it's 1:30 I have been I think it was just right at 12:00 when I talked to you guys last right and I have been baking up a storm for this keto bread video that I'm doing is just all about keto breads and have been making them all look at this plate they turned out as Aaron would say fantastical and I am excited to share those with you guys and all in one video I'm actually gonna put clips from other videos that I've done just to show to really highlight different keto breads so I cannot wait for you guys to see this I have a lot of editing to do though because I am incorporating so many different clips and I messed up a lot today when I was talking it was just a rambling mess I think just because I haven't done a lot of recipe videos lately and I want to get back into it but now my kitchen is a mess look at this look at this craziness it is crazy my whole entire kitchen is just a mess it's a bad thing about having a small kitchen is that everything is just it gets crazy because you don't have a lot of space to put everything so anyway I'm gonna get cleaning up I think I'm gonna go ahead and make me a protein smoothie I think that way I can drink that while I am cleaning I'm going to put a Lifetime movie on do some editing and I kind of promised my husband I'd make him a cake about that okay yeah the cake will be made eventually anyway I'm gonna go ahead and get my smoothie stuff out well I have a mess I might as well just make a bigger mess right and yeah oh I got a box I I didn't even order anything I don't know what it is so let me limit let's open that together hurry my phone is dying I don't even know what this is I didn't order anything oh it's from high key it's a pure thing so I didn't even know they're sending me anything interesting so this is some of their pancake mix Wow so it's 25 grams of fat 713 how many of you guys tried this carbs we have 2 grams of net carbs I'm glad they did the math for me because simple math right now is not working so 2 grams of net carbs for this pancake mix my husband always has perfect timing he calls always okay so we got the pancake mix have you guys tried this let me know I'm curious and then we have cauliflower mash I've never tried this from them either they actually the only thing I've ever tried for them is their hot cereal which I love as you guys know and their cookies which is kind of a love-hate with them I like them when they're cold but I don't like them when they're not home they have too much of that kind of cooling effect to them so this is called flour mesh savory side dish cheddar in Asiago for net carbs 20 grams of fat little grams of protein and then we have with this brownie bite we may have to do it on camera taste test these are too net carbs is that for this entire package no those two servings per container so six pieces is to net carbs whew I cannot wait to try these there's three bags in here and then oh I haven't tried the maple and brown sugar hot cereal it was I can't remember what kind it was but it was super good you guys know I loved it so this is three net carbs and then we have some brownie mix chocolate chip fudge this is two net carbs for jets and how many servings is in this twelve servings so it's gonna be kind of a small serving anyway I am so excited okay this is the size so you can have six of them I think that's what I said mm-hmm is there good does not have that cooling at all that the chunk chocolate chip cookies have that's a nice snap and you got the whole bag from four cards so if you wanted the whole bag mm-hmm I like that I will link and this came from Amazon I will look go on Amazon and find all the links for all of this stuff and link it down below number I have only tried these so and that I've had tried the hot cereal I may use this in my truffle shuffle we make Charles in them the waffle maker but I have the waffle bowl maker I have not used somebody gifted it to me and I've not used it yet I may go ahead and use this in there this weekend yeah okay guys so I've not had my MCT for the day so I'm gonna go ahead and put some of the MCT powder in there I usually have this in my coffee in the morning but since we left so early I have not had that yet so I'm gonna use that and use one scoop at this you guys know I prefer the keto or the I think is preferred keto brand but I'm out of that's well almost out of it I want to savor it until I have the money to purchase some more I've had this in my cupboard this is the perfect keto chocolate base it's just exhaustion escy tones is what it is I had it when I first started keto and realized I really don't need to be purchasing the stuff that I want to use it up since I did purchase it a long time ago might when I first start keto so I'm at this chocolate flavors on this template one scoop of that and then this is the protein powder I got this off my Amazon I'll link it down below this is a zero carb it's just unflavored because I use this in baking but they do have zero carbs of this in like vanilla chocolate and I really like how this works for baking so I think I'm going to start getting it for protein smoothies I'm gonna get like a vanilla and a chocolate eventually I don't know how much it costs I think this one was pretty cheap because it was unflavored but I'm not sure how much they all cost I'm also going to put in two tablespoons of almond butter because I love almond butter and it's only two net carbs for two tablespoons so you know it can't go wrong let me find my tablespoon I'm gonna put my brains in first with my peanut butter is gonna get stuck on the bottom so this is just a mixture of spinach kale and Swiss charts so I'm just gonna kind of pop that in there so there's probably about two cups in there and then we'll put our peanut butter on top or almond butter apologize and yes I should be measuring this out because I just talked about measuring but my scale is buried somewhere I know excuses excuses but we're good I don't have hardly any carbs today it's crazy when I'm busy like this I'm not hungry like I'm not even really that hungry right now but I know that I will be once I stop and I sit down and start editing I know I'm gonna be ravenous and I don't want to go there you know and then I'm gonna put in some of this almond milk this is my favorite almond milk from cliff iya farms it tastes so good and sweet in vanilla it's a little bit more expensive but I think it's just worth it I've had some of the other almond milks and it's just not as good again I know I should be measuring this I'm just gonna pour about a cup in there and this is one net carb for a cup okay I'm going to blend this up and then enjoy this yummy protein smoothie oh I'm going to put a dash of salt just so I have you know some of my electrolytes in there as well it's a disgusting color but you know what is good hey you know in the comments you guys if you have tried frozen avocado in your smoothies I've heard that it thickens up your smoothies kind of like bananas did since we can't really have bananas then let me know about avocados I think I might start freezing my avocados and trying that and they say you can't taste it in there or anything but so here's my smoothie okay I need to charge my battery because I'm getting the low battery so I'm gonna go change into some comfy clothes I have my boots on I don't know why oh my it's okay look look at the kitchen you guys I am like the worst with leaving my cupboards open I could never tell my family closed that cupboard because I'm the worst at it well put some comfy clothes on it charged my camera drink my smoothie and clean up my kitchen start some editing I think I decided I am gonna do the wings for dinner so I think we'll do wings and Caesar salad so you'll see that next and that will probably be the end of my talking I don't know if I come out of here and say goodbye yeah I can't not say goodbye so anyway I hope this isn't too long of a video but a lot of been here a lot of info to give you guys hi guys so it's the end of the night I think I'm gonna go ahead and close up this vlog you saw my dinner it was very good I just tossed the wings in some melted butter and some garlic powder onion powder and a little bit of parmesan and it was amazing with that Caesar salad so I think I'm just gonna go ahead and edit this video get it ready to go and upload in the morning and yeah so this is my last week off before I go back to work in a way I'm kind of glad because I want to get back to normal a normal schedule and everything and but I'm sure once next week starts I'm like oh I wish I would have done more with my time off but you know it is what it is have a lot of editing to do the next few days but if I want to do a whole vlog tomorrow I think I'll just record what I eat and just added to like Saturday and Sunday and just do a whole like three days of what I eat on a keto to kind of just restart and energize myself and get going for the new year so anyway I look forward to talking to you guys next week when I'm back on a regular schedule I look forward to you guys seeing my meal prep for this next week so stay tuned for that for Monday and grocery haul and meal plan on Saturday so I will see you guys all then thank you for hanging out with me today and if you're not subscribed and you would like to please take a moment to do so and I'll see you guys in the next video bye guys", "g1kkWO5LZvs": "what's up guys boogie Fitness boogie the trainer back again and in this video I'm gonna show you everything I buy when I start my weight loss journey all right so it's been quarantined I'm not in any shape you know I've put on you know lots of fat I'm probably at the wrong 25-30 percent body fat right but uh I'm ready to get back in shape I'm ready to lose this fight ready to kill it in the gym to build my muscle back up I've lost mass or - I mean trust me guys four months of not lifting weights and lifting weights is everything to me all right I wanted to make this quick video to show you everything I buy when I start my fat loss journey right so I'm getting back in the gym starting Monday I know I know so many people struggle to find out the foods they need to buy the kind of foods to get good fats to get good protein to get good good carbohydrates and so I decided to make this video I just went shopping now I was gonna go shopping I was gonna take you guys shopping with me but you know so many people so much noise I decided to buy everything and then I just show you everything I bought and why I bought what I bought okay alright so but before I show you everything I bought you guys need to understand one thing when you start your fat loss journey it takes planning it's one thing to make up your mind that you want to lose some weight you want to lose some fat or you want to get back in the gym and it's another thing to actually plan the whole thing out okay right now I know when I'm gonna be working out what days I'm gonna be working out which kind of workouts I'm gonna be doing I know how many days of kardi I'm gonna be doing I know how many minutes of cardio I'm gonna be doing how many calories I'm looking to burn when I start you know working out the thing most people fail to do is plan and if you don't plan ahead of time you plan to fail so everything I bought I literally had to write down everything I bought and why I'm buying everything I bought okay I already know my macros I know what I'm going to be eating in the morning in the evening and pre-workout after the gym snacks and everything of that sort okay so everything I bought I make the plan first and then I go to the to this grocery store I usually go to Walmart and buy everything so I planned the foods I'm gonna eat when I'm gonna be eating how much I'm gonna be eating that will when I go to buy I know exactly what I'm buying okay so I'm gonna show you my meal plan and then I'm going to show you everything I bought all right all right so as you get you guys can see I made my meal plan you see that pre-workout two pairs post-workout lunch snacks dinner I know exactly what I'm gonna be eating these rice right there oatmeal fruits peanut butter two slices of bread and everything so the first thing your it should do is to write down everything you need to eat when you're gonna be eating so you are already ahead of time okay so we so iced I went to Walmart hours buy some chewing gum you know just I'd like to chew gum after having a meal you know just to cleanse my mouth so on my meal plan I had rice now this is prepackaged rice which means I can easily put this all well precooked so which means I can easily put this in the microwave and then for 90 minute 90 seconds okay so for 90 seconds in the in the in the microwave to be ready right now the reason I did I usually just buy the usual raw rice and then I make the rice myself but you know just for the food for time for the sake of time because I'm gonna be busy making more YouTube videos working on other projects working out now you know I wanted to save a little bit of time but I usually buy the usual raw rice and then I make the rice myself and then I've put it in the different plastic containers to keep it and then I just put it in my refrigerator right there okay so I went out and bought rice because it's on my meal plan so I bought rice okay I bought more I bought so I'm gonna be eating one of these every day for lunch and you know the markers are not so bad full serving or one whole packet of this is gonna be like 86 86 grams of carbohydrates six fights ten protein okay because each packet has two servings okay and then obviously water so that I bought more water so guys I'm just showing you just a few things I bought I did I didn't I didn't have enough room to show you everything I bought on this table so I bought three of these and typically what I do is when I'm going to the gym I take one gallon of water with me I drink some in the gym maybe half or something and then when I get back home I have the water bottles okay which I'm not showing you but I just for the sake of the video I just want to show that about I buy water too now as you see you guys on my new plan I have bread but now I buy the whole grain bread guys whole grain bread not white bread all gray and wine whole grain because whole grain bread has fiber see that right there fiber now the fire by hopes with keeping you full and helps with your digestive system okay but also instead of eating the crazy snacks like candy and other simple sugar snacks I would rather have two slices of bread which will be just 40 grams of carbohydrates okay and then this is my go-to in the morning usually after I work out oatmeal oatmeal is a staple for my fat loss journey why aren't meal because oatmeal is better than regular cereal just having a cup of oatmeal is gonna give you see right there 20 just gonna give you that's gonna be 50 50 54 grams of carbohydrates just one cup and I usually don't eat more than one cup because one cup is gonna fall fill me up so much and remember oatmeal is all full of fiber too which is gonna keep you full for at least two and a half hours okay the point of of knowing what you're gonna eat and buying the right kind of foods is to keep you full most people don't eat all the time because they eat the wrong kind of foods if you get if you eat the wrong kind of foods you are going to constantly feel hungry and you feel feel hungry and you keep eating the wrong time wrong type of foods you are going to run the risk of being way too over your coloring in for example I'm gonna start off with around I remember I think 2700 calories but if I don't know what I'm gonna eat ahead of time I may end up eating 3000 calories which means I'm not gonna be able to lose weight in a timely fashion so if you know the color is that you're gonna eat make sure you buy the right foods so you can eat the right foods and make sure at to hope you don't go over your calorie intake trust me guys to lose fat you have to be in a calorie deficit which means you have to eat less than what your body needs to maintain okay I repeat to lose fat you need to be in a calorie deficit current deficit means eat food less than what your body needs to maintain your current weight okay so but to be in a calorie deficit you need to eat the right kind of foods food that has good nutritional benefits food that has fiber and food that's gonna fill you up okay now with oatmeal I like to eat on my oatmeal with whey protein now this is j.f whey protein shout-out to Chris Jones and these are scoop so you can eat some people use this protein too as a protein shake but I like to use this for my to mix it with my oatmeal in the morning after workout you know to keep me it really tastes good now this whole team of whey protein lasts me about a month and a half why cuz I use only just a scoop a day and has 72 servings I can use a scoop a day or maybe two if I want to you know do one extra an extra shake in a day okay so I just mix whey protein oatmeal in the morning with water okay so we have looked at the rice we've looked at the bread we looked at the whey protein we have looked at at the water okay and then now as you guys can see I have carbohydrate sources bread rice oatmeal and then I have protein sources which is whey protein powder peanut butter I'm gonna talk more about this and then chicken these are drumsticks I bought drumsticks because I just season them put them in the in the oven bake them for you know 30 40 minutes and I'm good to go good protein source also guys don't forget fruits fruits a good snack but I also eat these before I go to the gym I can eat like two pears just to give me that energy push for the gym okay and these together are around 50 or maybe even 45 grams of carburetors this together and this can fill you up and keep you up for at least an hour and a half of energy rather than eating candy which one candy you may have to eat like four of these to you know to get to some calories in candy so guys make good food choices okay so as you can see I have my carbohydrate sources I have my protein sources okay I have my water and then for fights I like to go for with with nacho peanut butter you know some people think fats are bad but you need fats for your joints okay you need fats for your joints and for your overall health the point is to have healthy fats and to have them in moderation as you can see just one scoop one uh one serving which is two tablespoons gives you 15 grams of fat okay with just eight grams of carbohydrates and seven grams of protein now I have around 60 grams of fats every day oh that's what I'm gonna be having when I start my fat loss journey the chicken has some fights everything has some fights apart from I put from the from the pears right so everything I'm gonna be eating daily is gonna give me around 60 grams of fats which usually you don't need more than 60 really fair healthy person you need around 50 to 60 depending on your fitness goals but that's the usual so guys this is everything I bought from Walmart I didn't buy this from Walmart I bought this at a long time ago and everything here this is my my shopping list well my shopping receipt as you can see I bought everything from Walmart and if you guys want to see the total there you go $56 okay so as I go on with my fat loss journey I'll be reducing the amount of I eat of each so if I've been eating two pairs maybe I could go to one pair if I've been eating a full socket of rice packet of rice I'll probably go to maybe half of it if I've been eating three slices of bread daily I'll go to maybe two slices of bread daily so as weeks go on I don't do quick dad fixes most people like to just starve themselves but the thing about fat loss you should start small and then slowly go on reducing the food that you're eating okay if you have any fitness questions just comment down below all on this video or hit me up on Instagram and then we can talk about what you need to eat so as you can see as I told you I spent $56 on everything there's much more I didn't show you i swifty six dollars so that's gonna be fifty six dollars almost weekly but with time this price comes down the 56 the 56 the 56 dollars comes down because I start to eat less and less and less I don't go from eating three slices to one slice no all the weeks maybe of every 3-4 weeks I reduced what I'm eating so the price comes down now this cost me around $55 right but this takes me through a month and a half so the point is guys if you are really trying to lose fat you have to invest in yourself you have to invest in food you have to invest in time in the gym and you have to invest in consistency those are three things that you have to invest in when it comes to your fat loss the way you invest time in watching movies buying movies paying for everything buying shoes buying clothes if you can invest in things that you don't really need you can invest in your health spend money on the right kind of foods it's not that cheap but it gets cheaper when you're healthier when you're healthy it's cheaper than being overweight and then you pay more to take care of your body later in life so invest in yourself save some money buy the right kind of food for your body for your fat loss and I wish you success in your fat loss journey most gyms are opening up around the world so guys let's kill it comment down below like the video subscribe to this channel if you found this video very helpful alright and I'll get you guys well next time peace [Music]", "QgQP2Go3YmE": "Zach you know me pretty well what's one of my what's one of my favorite things to do the answer was to kill two birds with one stone and because start over all right eat your coffee is a really amazing brand that just came out because they what they did is they took coffee and they put it in a like a nutritional breakfast bar mm-hmm okay and why is that awesome it's like you can have your breakfast and have your cup of coffee now all in one place all in one place you can eat it so this company eat your coffee and I was hearing how they started very cool this company started by college students in their dorm they were grinding up some coffee beans realized yeah realize that they could except for not in college but but realize they could put ground coffee and stuff and it was edible so they put it in a bar and they can eat ground coffee I don't know we'll have to ask that okay cool one of the owners his name is Johnny he's a good guy and then they started a Kickstarter campaign rate it raised enough money to launch the brand and now they're one of the the hottest nutritional brands in the market you know which one they started with first what was their first flavor I don't know their first flavor but I do know that you get a full cup of coffee in one of these bars why and if I can cool got real quick to the the bars and what they look like it's if you can almost see like the the coffee grounds yeah in it yeah you know they definitely have the normal bar look like those those but I would I would say that there's something about them and it's I think it's a small tea they're very strong very potent very strong they are they're vegan they're non-gmo they're Fairtrade which means they don't employ do you know how many milligrams of caffeine a full cup of coffee so I think a full cup of coffee is 80 or 90 milligrams caffeine and I believe that these have to have that okay okay all right you ready to try yeah okay we're gonna go down the row it's in this order so number one is fudgy mocha latte so that's unique oh yeah this one right here okay okay just break a little piece like little piece off here oh I taste a lot of things salty sweet the soap you came afterwards those are great great little addition come don't party in my mouth that's nice now I look good I like that I'm not even a macchiato person I like that alright the next one peanut butter mocha mm-hmm well I like the peanut butter this is one of their top sellers the paper what people are doing everything right tell them ask the coffee a lot master coffee a little too much for me actually I do like it but you could see where people are like I don't really want like a coffee bar yeah no this is uh toasted coconut and while you eat that one I'm gonna say how many grams of protein it has on it sound good yeah don't let me stop you six grams six grams are broken it's not a ton of protein but enough to get you going and with the caffeine level do we have anything on here no caffeine Oh may have cut it off listen kind of makes you like you know when you're in a meeting and you're like you had too much caffeine you're like rubbing it yeah definitely has a coconut almost a buttery flavor coconut buttery flavor look like that Huntress what is Alex smoked it's like something I got jelly bean jelly bean butter the butter the butter one buttery gentleman yes that's what it tastes like exactly exactly probably put it in there yeah a little like smoky edition and then last one salted caramel macchiato okay really you can tell they're almost better flavored like coffee drinks mm-hmm which is a kind of a play on their branding Oh caramel macchiato which is your which are your tongue you knew I was gonna say that like the first one really like the second I do like these the problem with this one is that you got me on the butter jelly bean I've just never gonna fail it does it kind of has that hint of it to me I'm not really upon these ones but these two are really I really enjoyed actually especially this first one I really liked cuz it actually I'm actually a good I like coffee yeah so now one had the most straightforward coffee flavor to it which I liked and peanut butter is always good oh these two hey if you're looking for that butter taste or that caramel very thick and caramel you're gonna like that for sure alright would you purchase these yeah yeah yeah cuz you won't give them to me he's not gonna I like caffeine so he's not gonna yeah he's not gonna do this if you want to support a great company this is definitely one that we recommend some young guys started this and it's doing really well yeah coffee coffee sandwiches link below if you want to purchase or you can check our website it's in it's in our Facebook bio as well thank you thanks and Josh", "BJpQNzdP9cY": "So welcome back to the second week of this\nparticular course, which is on Life Cycle Assessment. In this week we will be looking at some of\nthese risk assessment concept and how it relates to the life cycle, and as you know for every\nweek we have 5 videos of 30 minutes each. So, this week again we will start with the\nfirst module of the second week and where we will cover the basics of the risk assessment. So, next around 30 minutes I will try to give\nyou brief overview of what is the risk assessment, and how it is done. We will have an another video coming up later\non where we will look at in some details, but here we will cover \nthe basics. Sustainability issues are complex, and understanding\nof the interaction of the complexity. Water, food, energy all are complex and that\nso that it is an equally complex engineer system. So, and understanding their interaction is\nvery important. So analysis framework is necessary. One of the important concept is the risk assessment\nconcept. So, when I say something is bad how bad it\nis, What is the risk from that, Whether it is an affordable risk whether it is a manageable\nrisk, if it an unmanageable risk. So, we have to come up with the risk based\nframework to characterize as well as to prioritize the environmental issues; Life cycle frame,\nworks in terms of characterizing and understanding sustainability which you will see in this\nparticular week during the discussion in this week. So, what is risk? So, risk is defined as the potential of for\nan individual to suffer an adverse effect of an event, and the concept of risk is used\nin all analysis those of you are familiar with the financial you hear that financial\nrisk assessment or financial risk, and you talk about the share market many times you\nhear that share market this this shares are it is a risky share like a high risk high\nagain, or low risk low again kind of a where this is really a good company you invest here\nthat return will be there. But may not be very high some companies are\nthere which will give you a lot of return, but then at the same time you have a chance\nthat you may end up losing your money so that is a concept used in the finance. In engineering risk we talk about an engineering\na risk as well when we design like a road safety issues, any issues that we have we\nhave some risk associated with that essentially the potential for an individual to suffer\nan adverse effect from an event there is a health risk; so in the precise definition\nof risk and where it depending on the application. So in terms of understanding the language\nof risk and the tools to quantify the risk, and the use of risk in the regulation; so\nwe have to understand the risk framework, and how it can be potentially employed for\nenvironmental and sustainability issues. So, that is what we will try to look at as\npart of this particular module; So here again lot of slides since you will be getting a\npdf version of these slides I have left those text in there, but do not you do not have\nto try to worry too much about kind of reading those text right now, while you are listening\nto this video. It is environmental risk can be grouped into\nthree general categories and you just look at those bold points that has been made here,\none is the risk involving voluntary exposure. So, that is where you do it voluntarily say\nyou want to go for a bungee jumping, and the bungee jumping is skydiving mountain climbing\nthose things these are the risk you know the risk is there, and your risk is obvious, but\nyou want to take it is your free will to do that. But then there are risk associated with natural\ndisaster; that could be flood that could be earthquake, hurricanes and some kind of meteorites\nhits other disaster be these are beyond our control in a direct sense, and these are and\nthere could be some exposure to certain natural disaster, and this is what is going may happen. So, that is the risk associated with natural\ndisaster as very self-explanatory, then risk involving in voluntary exposure that is what\nwe are kind of talk about. When you are talking about chemicals released\nin the environment, when you are talking about different air pollutants those are not those\nare involuntary, say you and me does not want to inhale toxic fumes in the gas in the air. But or like in received in industrialized\ntowns, the towns with big lot of vehicles especially the metropolitan towns in the country,\nif you go to Delhi gets lot of news on air pollution issues; say if you are living in\nDelhi you do not really want to inhale those toxic fumes or toxic chemicals which is present\nin the air there, but the problem is you do not have any other option, you have to inhale\nand exhale to survive. And to inhale you will get all these potential\nharming chemicals in there. So, that is your involuntary exposure, same\nthing the world think about the workers working in the industry those who are they are working\nin the industrial setting which has lot of chemical things being released into the environment\nbecause of some leakages and other stuff, and then they are exposed to it. So, and we cannot have directly control on\nthe exposure, because we can put some mask and other stuff but even after that there\nwill be some exposure. So, that is what those are our involuntarily\nrisk involuntarily exposure from risk coming from there. So, that and how this involuntary exposure\ncomes because of the release of chemicals to the environment. And the chemical gets released to the environment\nbecause of the release to the atmosphere, release to surface water release to land. And when we talk about the environmental risk\nit is the function of hazard and exposure. So, if you like a mathematical equation for\nenvironmental risk, it will be a function hazard and exposure are your two variables. So, if some chemicals are there it is a very\nhigh hazard potential. But the exposure level is very very low, you\nmay have less environmental risk. But at the same time some chemicals are there\nwhich is has a hazard potential like a medium level hazard potential, but the exposure is\nvery high. So, you are exposed to it say 5 6 7 8 hours\na day, then your risk is pretty higher from that even although the hazard is not that\nhigh, because it is the function of the two it is a hazard as well as the exposure that\nis all your the environmental risk is calculate. So, risk is the likelihood again as we said\nearlier likelihood of harm, it could be both short term as well as the long term if you\nhave read any of these books you know the short term we call acute and the long term\nwe call chronic. So, it could be both acute as well as chronic\nthere could be and there is a chronic effects and the effects on human health, and the quality\nof human life also the ecological systems, economic systems because if you have a unhealthy\nwork force. So, work force you will have an unhealthy\neconomy, your work hours will go down and people you will have an impact on your economic\nsystem as well. So, the risk assessment what we do we use\na process by which the form dimension and the characteristics of the risk are estimated,\nand I think the week sorry this particular week on the third module you will hear you\nwill see some of the details of how that is done. And we utilize both qualitative as well as\nthe quantitative approach; if you do not understand the difference between qualitative and quantitative\nquantitative is with the numbers, qualitative is where you have a feeling of whether it\nis a good or a bad, but you do not you cannot say the numbers associated with that. So, we are many times we want if you cannot\nhave quantitative information qualitative information is good but we would like to have\nquantitative information more than qualitative ones. And then if you once you assess the risk you\nhave to manage the risk; sometimes you cannot really what you can say you cannot really\ntake out the risks. So, you cannot really like a remove the risk\nfrom there so, but whatever is the risk you are trying to manage it, you are trying to\ncontrol it, you are trying to reduce it as much as possible. And it is a many it is a regulatory decision\nrisk are based on regulatory decisions, there are if it is a cancer say some of the risk\nfor example, for Marcie or from cyanide from other stuff if it is a cancerous, carcinogen,\nbenzene for example, if it is a cancer in point usually we use a risk of one in a million. So, we want to go down to the level. So, for example, arsenic drinking water standard\nis 10 micrograms per liter right now. Earlier, it was 50 micrograms per liter, but\nwith better science we have reduced a drinking water limit to 10 micrograms per liter right\nnow. So, the 10 micro grams per liter is based\non the principle of one in a million cancer risk, now what does that mean? That means, that if our drinking water has\nless than equal to 10 micrograms per liter, and if somebody is consuming that water throughout\nit is life there is a chance of one out of a million population that person will have\na cancer because of this. Since a cancer can happen with many other\nfactors as well, but it just from the arsenic exposure there is a chance of one in a million,\nthat is based on some of the work that is done with other species like a rat, guinepigs\nand all those mice and then you extrapolate you do some testical analysis and you do an\nextrapolate those values. There are epidemiological basis for human\nrisk calculation as well, if you have the epidemiological data; epidemiological data\nmeans data from exposed population. In case of arsenic we have the exposed population\nin Bangladesh, we have the exposed population in part of West Bengal we have this exposed\npopulation in Vietnam Taiwan and several other countries. So, we can get the data from there that is\nfrom the real like the real field data and we can correlate we can see how our lab data\nfits with the field data, and then we can learn from that and we can come up with a\nbetter to risk assessment of that. Animal testing is done as I said earlier where\nhuman data is unavailable, most data are animal testing data except in those rare situations\nwhere human exposure event has been documented; and where you have this human exposure even\ndocumented that is called your epidemiological data. There are risk is there and everywhere there\nis a reference point as I said it is one in a million, below which USDA does not considered\nrisk from a food additive to be a concern. If it is a minimal risk is considered 10 to\nthe power minus 10 to 10 to the power of minus 12, that is a minimal risk very high risk\nis 1 to 0.01 So, 0.01 to 1 is considered high risk; and there are risk associated with different\naspect like if you take shower in a tub drowning in tub per year it is around 10 to the power\n5 minus 5 to 10 to the power minus 6similar to death in an airplane crash. So, we do hear from time to time the airplane\nhas crashed, but the risk is pretty low based on the aero plane technology as of today. Automobile accident it depends on which place\nyou are, but automobile accident as you hear in Indian context lot of people die in every\nday we have people dying because of the automobile accident, it is around 1.7 10 to the power\nminus 4 death by lightning 10 to the power 3 to minus 4 again death of from a smoking\none pack of cigarette per day 3.6 times 10 to the power of minus 3. This as you go down you see different cancer\nfor one liter of beer per day for a year, cancer for one peanut peanut butters and wichpeanut\nbutter sandwich actually many people in the world especially in the western world, they\nhave peanut butter energy. So, that kind of leads to that cancer from\nchar boiled steak cancer from drinking water with 80 microgram per liter of ChCl 3 per\nday. So, there are as you can see there are different\nrisk out there which people are used. The basic principle of risk assessment is\nfirst of all we need to determine the probability that a adverse effect will be produced, and\nall human activities will have some risk concern mostly with the risk from exposure to chemicals\nthat is why we are following up, then risk assessment in terms of the extended definition,\nit is a methodological approach where your chemical exposure are identified, you look\nat the analysis for the dose response relationship and then you try to quantify. How we do that you calculate the amount of\nchemicals absorbed into the human body, then compare the absorbed dose with the EPA safe\ndose for known carcinogen for non carcinogen it is a reference dose, EPA does not recognize\nthe safe dose for carcinogen. So, any level of exposure has some kinds of\nrisk from there. So, risk is specific dose is used to EPA to\nexpose. So, basically based on if you know what is\nthe chemical absorbed into the human body, and then for the non carcinogens if you know\nwhat is the safe dose, we can calculate it we find out what is the risk. So, carcinogen again we have a risk specific\ndose is used for EPA to expose to come up with the risk factor; this is a typical curve\nwhich you may have seen in your previous some of the courses as well it is called dose response\ncurve, as you can see from the bottom of this curve over here on that on the x axis you\nstart from zero, and the line of kind of gets up after this threshold dose, you see the\nincreasing effect showing up. So, initially there is no affect up to this\npoint. So, no effect up to this point means you keep\nthat is called the no effect region, and many times you hear the term NOEL, no absorbed\neffect level and then this will be your first like when you start seeing effect and then\nyour effect goes up and up and then you have a maximum effect and after this even if you\nkeep on increasing the dose, your effect does not go up. So, it could be the final, it could be what\nis the maximum effect it could have. So, in the middle is what is the range of\nincreasing effect with increasing dose. So, as you increase the dose effect goes up. So, here you can calc also calculated what\nconcentration you will have 50 percent of the inhibition, 20 percent inhibition and\nall those things can be done on that pic on that like with this data. Usually this data is generated from testing\nthose like lab species which we talked about earlier. So, this is your typical dose response curve\nit is also known as s curve as because of the shape of the curve and this is used a\nlot in terms of a risk assessment of both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic. In the history of epidemiology only a few\nagents have been repeated. So, linked to the human cancer for example,\ncigarette smoke, there is lot of data on cigarette smoke alcohol, ionizing radiations, some drugs\nsome occupational carcinogens asbestos solvent benzene some virus like hepatitis B, human\nT cell leukemia virus human papilloma virus. So, these are some of the viruses some of\nthe stuff on the cancer risk, which has been reported. So, you can you will have some of the epidemiological\ndata associated with that. So, many epidemiologists require increased\nenough increased risk by a factor of three to take new cancer risk seriously. So, anything more than three to take it is\nseriously; anything less than three we do not take it seriously anymore. So, for example, of risk high cholesterol\ndiet and you see here gender in the middle for male, high cholesterol diet there is a\nrisk ratio of 1.65 for the colon cancer, very fact that it is for the female around this\nratio of two for the breast cancer vasectomy, there is a chance of 1.6 for the prostate\ncancer, if you have a tap water with chlorine 3.3 liters per day, you have 2 to 4 risk ratio\nfor the bladder like a cancer risk psychological stress for both male and female 5.5 that can\nlead to a colon and rectal cancer high saturated fat diet. Again you will have for the female sex, for\nthe nonsmokers, for the lung you have a lung issues red meat 5 times a week for both men\nand female a chance of 2.5 is risk ratio got it should be 2.5 should show up over here\nin the colon is the side. So, this got switched a little bit on that\nside that is your; so, again, these are some of the risk ratio just to give you some examples\nof different risk of a different stuff. So, in terms of the risk definitions there\nis an applied dose you saw the dose response curve. So, applied dose is the amount of chemical\nin a medium that is available for update. So, how much chemical is available absorbed\ndose is the amount that chemical get absorbed, whatever you chemical you apply this does\nnot get absorbed. So, that is why when you take a medicine say\nif you get a prescription drug, so when you go and buy this medicine you have a 100 mg\ntablet, 600 mg tablet your body may just require say 10 mg or 60 mg, but you are using a 100\nmg tablet or 600 mg tablet because things only part of it will get absorbed in the body\nrest of it will just go out of the system. So, related to the fraction of the applied\ndose that is absorbed you need to consider out of exposure, some will you can have a\ninjection you can take the food through that the medicine skin, that is another way you\ncan get some absorbed that have exposure to certain chemicals inhalation you inhale something. So, the reference dose is the dose of a non\ncarcinogenic that is believed to be safe for human. So, you take the animal toxicity data, and\nthen you extrapolate it to human using some statistics with that. Now, we have a risk specific dose; the dose\nat which one person in a million exposed will develop cancer that is for the carcinogen\nthey were one made in a million cancer risk, when we calculate hazard index which is the\nratio of absorbed dose to the RFD. If the hazard index is less than equal to\none it is ok it is an unacceptable situation, but if the hazard index is greater than one;\nthat means, a chemical concentration needs to be decreased. So, that is where the risk management comes\nin picture where we have to factor this risk assessment and then look at ok what are the\npossible alternative action. How much chemical exposure can be reduced,\nand what could be the cost associated with that what is the cost benefit considerations\nassociated with that, what is the need for the consumer alternative chemicals. So, then how best to regulate exposure to\nthe chemical should we have a better personal protective equipment, sometimes it may not\nbe possible to reduce some of those chemicals in a factory setting. So, in that case you need you will probably\nuse better personal protective equipment, so that it you as a worker in they are not\nget exposed to it. So, in terms of the risk assessment process\nat site with say for the drinking water, first of first thing we need to do is to find out\nwhat is the hazard, what is what chemicals are present, what chemicals are present and\nwhat is the concentration of the chemical. So, towards the end of this week that was\nthe later part of this week I will tell you how we can analyze for these chemicals, and\nhow we look at this concentration and some of the statistics associated with that. So, the first thing for any of these risk\nassessment processes say in terms of what is the hazard. What chemicals are present at what concentration,\nwhether it is a carcinogen non carcinogen then you try to come up with that dose response\ncurve with the animal data mostly with the animal study data, and you come up with the\ndose response relationship probably you may have to repeat the experiments for the data\nvalidation compare the day effects and similar chemicals have been studied elsewhere, compare\nthe count results discover the RSD, RFD or the RSD data from the animal studies which\nwould be used. Then once you have the animal data you need\nto ex make some assumption because in the absence of epidemiological data, we need to\ntake the animal data and extrapolate it to humans. So, for example, in the drinking water scenario\nwe need to make some exposure assumption. Important exemption exposure assumption ok\ncould be that how much water an adult will take per day on. So, upon an average 2 liters per day adult\nweight around 70 kg, assume that water has a 0.5 milli grams per liter of zinc in the\ndrinking water. So, point five milligrams per zinc 0.5 milligrams\nper liter of zinc in the drinking water, an adult consuming 2 liter per day with it is\nwith his weight or his or her weight being around 70 kg. So, we can calculate the dose where you have\nwhatever is the load coming in 0.5 milli grams per liter multiplied by 2 liter that is the\namount of zinc that goes into the system through the drinking water source, divided by 70 kg\nis the weight. So, in terms of this liter this will go away\nso you have a round 0.0143 milligram of zinc per kilogram body weight per day. So, then we need to say whether it is a we\nneed to compare this number with the reference dose number, which is already been most of\nthe most of the non carcinogenic you will have find the data already available at certain\nwebsites VPN and other regulatory websites; then you can do the risk estimation. So, compare the dose to RFD clean up required\nif the risk is greater than one in a million for cancer or hazard index is greater than\nequal to one for non cancer for zinc for example, RFD is 0.2 it is a non carcinogen. So, you find you try to find out hazard index. So, 0.2 is safe, the dose you are providing\nis 0.0143 number comes out to be 0.0715. So, the hazard index is less than one. So, no cleanup is required. So, water assuming that no other significant\ncontaminant is present. So, this is how you will do the risk assessment\nprocedure. So, in terms of development of this reference\ndose we just now in the previous example previous problem, we use the reference dose number\nfor the zinc. Where this how this reference dose number\ncame in, a reference dose came numbers comes in from that dose response curve which you\nsaw earlier in the slide in the presentation. So, in terms of the dose response you have\nthe NOAEL and LOAEL, NOAEL is the last no observed adverse effect level and then your\nLOAEL is the lowest observed adverse effect level. So, you divide this NOAEL or LOAEL by an uncertainty\nfactor; why uncertainty factor because you are going from animal species to a human species\nand there are other things as well as is listed at the bottom of the slide, there are uncertainty\nfactors if the data uncertainty a high to low dose extrapolation, and then we have a\ninter species extrapolation you are going from one species to another, then there are\nextrapolation between routes of exposure and for protection, then another factor of 10\nfor protection of sensitive individuals because for the same for example, right now if you\nhave change in a weather and some people catches cough and cold very quickly when there is\na change of weather. So, for the same change of weather other person\nmay not catch cough and cold, because different people have different immune system. So, some people are sensitive. So, to take care of them we put a protection\nof them and over there as well. So, if a dose has no adverse effect on a mouse\nat 0.5 kg per 0.5 milligram per kilogram per day, then divide by 10 to the power of three\nfor safe human dose you get 0.00005 milligram per kg per day. So, that is how you calculate the RFD. For like a maximum contaminant like a maximum\ncontaminant level goal for drinking water for carcinogenic problem carcinogenic we have\nat 0, for non carcinogen we have a drinking water equivalent level divided by the slow\nfact. So, this is what we use here and a category\nthree if you have no carcinogenicity no impact we do not have to worry about that. So, in terms of how will you calculate this\ndual and MCLG drinking water limit? So, you establish NOAEL from the literature\nor from the experiment, you calculate your RFD which is the NOAEL divided by the slope\nfactor, dual assumes no carcinogenicity and exposure medium in water. So, you have RFD body weight and the little\nof water; for the mcl this is for carcinogen we have zero, for this we assume a food intake\nbesides water. So, based on that you need for MCLG for whatever\nthe drinking water number, minus the food contribution, minus the air contribution;\nso that is what you get for a basis for second type of contaminants you multiply the drinking\nwater contribution. So, that is how you calculate it. So, again if you look at this particular in\nterms of calculation, we I will kind of rewind like a I will go over this like one more time\nto make it to give you one more explanation to make it more clear. We have two categories you can say three categories\nof pollutants; category one is a known carcinogen or probable carcinogen. For which we do not want any of these to be\npresent in water, for category two which is your some sort of impact is there, but no\nif they are not carcinogens. So, there we take the drinking water equivalent\nlevel and then divide by slow factor. Slow factor is a simply I have your risk factor\na factor of safety; then category three where no evidence of any carcinogenicity where you\nhave goal is equal to the drinking water equivalent level. So, we are at that particular level. So, how you do that you establish NOAEL and\nLOAEL from the literature, multiply it by the slow factor and then you get that number\nRFD number, calculate your drinking water equivalent level based on what is the body\nweight on the liter of water ingested for the different categories you find out, and\nthen water is not the only source you have the food contribution and air contribution\nas well, similarly like a for like the second basis where no such impact we can take in\nterms of the percentage drinking water contribution from there. So, with this we kind of cover this particular\nsegment of this module, where we have looked at in terms of a quick summary we looked at\nthe basics very fundamental aspects related to the risk assessment; what is the definition\nof risk assessment, how we go about and doing for a carcinogenic chemical non carcinogenic\nchemical, how the data come from and what are the issue how you go from animals animal\ndata like a rat, guinea pigs and those data to the human data and some of the calculations\nassociated with that in terms of the drinking water limit. So, drinking water equivalent level how you\ncan calculate whether something is you know the dosage, how to calculate the dosage at\nthe same time if you know the dosage how to find out whether it is a safe you look at\nyour hygiene index, you also look at other factors associated with that and then how\ncome up with your decision. So, that is summarizes the basics of risk\nassessment we will again on the third module of this particular week will kind of go a\nlittle bit of more detail on the risk assessment part, but for now. Thank you and keep watching this video.", "hDX_Q5zl1Zo": "I recently lost 50 pounds I'm gonna tell you how I did it step by step my weight loss regimen consisted of three disciplines that I slowly mastered i call it kiff k is for keto or ketogenic diet I is for intermittent fasting and F is for fasting or longer-term fasting fast that lasts 24 hours or more let's take a look at each one closely first keto it's actually pretty simple way of eating to lose weight you avoid sugar and eat the proper ratio of protein fat and carbs I ate 70% fat 25% protein and 5% carbs a day specifically 22 grams of carbs or less per day when you eat this way your body changes from burning carbohydrates or sugar for energy to burning fat for energy this metabolic state is called ketosis it takes two to four days to get into ketosis it's a way for your body to burn stored fat look down at your belly is it big if so you have stored fat that needs to be burned so why do we store so much fat these days I believe that it has to do with how often we eat and what we eat with modern-day grocery stores and restaurants we have access to a ton of food often 24 hours a day do you think early men ate so much food so often did early men eat lots of baked bread and sugary snacks or did he most likely eat some protein fat and low carb leafy green vegetables whenever he was likely to gather or hunt them I think the answer is pretty obvious so when you were doing the keto diet how do you know if your body is burning fat instead of sugar how do you know if you are in ketosis it's pretty simple you pee on a test strip that measures ketones in your urine I'll leave links to all of the items I talked about in the description below in case you want to check out anything that I refer to the keto diet Stix basically turned darker as your ketone levels go up it's an easy way to know if you are in ketosis and burning fat for energy so what can you eat on a keto diet basically you avoid sugar and high carbs that are in foods like pasta bread chips and most processed snacks you want to eat protein from sources like beef pork chicken and fish for example remember keto is not a high protein diet so don't eat too much protein it may hinder your weight loss results you also need to eat fat from sources like avocados olive oil butter and cheese for example in fact you will eat a lot of fat that is the component of the diet that will make you feel full and satisfied don't worry the idea that fat makes you fat is a myth good fats are our friends it's also important to make sure that you are eating some carbs on the diet from vegetable sources like broccoli spinach green beans cucumbers Brussels sprouts peppers asparagus cauliflower and mushrooms for example I'll leave a list of keto friendly foods in the description below these vegetables are rich in vitamins minerals and other important nutrients don't skip eating these low-carb foods your body greatly benefits from them my daily goal is to eat 22 grams of carbs a day or less when I first started my diet as I lost more weight I increased my carb count a little and added some fruits like raspberries I just never go over 40 grams of carbs a day if you go out of ketosis while increasing your carb intake simply decrease the amount of carbs you eat until you get back at to ketosis fat mode if you want to maintain your weight I suggest eating around 50 grams of carbs a day it's just a matter of how you do on the scale if your weight starts going back up go down on the carbs so how did I make sure that I wasn't going over 22 grams of carbs a day and then I was eating the right ratio of 70% fat 25% protein and 5 % carbs that seems like a nightmare to keep track of and calculate right actually it was quite simple there's an app for that I used one called carb manager eventually I didn't need it but at first it was a lifesaver I installed the app on my phone which goes everywhere with me anyway I would simply click on the meal like breakfast and enter the foods in their quantities that I was eating at the time the app does the difficult calculations for you let's look at a typical keto day menu for breakfast I ate half an avocado 2 scrambled eggs cooked in butter with sauteed mushrooms and diced green peppers on top for lunch I had a chatter cheeseburger without a bun with mayo on top and some green beans cooked in olive oil on the side a french fry replacement for dinner I ate salmon with broccoli and spinach saut\u00e9ed and olive oil in some cucumber salad with oil and vinegar I even had some macadamia nuts as a snack I discourage snacking in general time between meals without eating is important but snacks once in a while are okay as long as they're Quito friendly it's a myth that eating many meals a day is healthy for you or will improve your metabolism this way of thinking has made a lot of people overweight the food I ate that day was nutritious yet kept me in ketosis it also made me feel full and satisfied but I was still losing weight a traditional low-fat diet never did that for me it always left me feeling hungry and caused me to eventually give up on the diet overeat and gain more weight if we look at the numbers provided by the app I was pretty close to eating 70% fat 25% protein and 5% carbs that day it's not a big deal if the ratio isn't 100% perfect just stay within the ballpark your main goal should be to stay at or under 22 grams of carbs per day here's the exact breakdown I had 21 grams of my 22 grams of net carbs target one gram under is completely acceptable by the way what our net carbs the term net carbs simply refers to carbs that are absorbed by the body to calculate the net carbs and whole foods subtract the fiber from the total number of carbs to calculate the net carbs and processed foods subtract the fiber and a portion of the sugar alcohols luckily the app does all of this for you if we continue looking at our daily numbers from the app I also had 139 grams of my 136 grams of fat target slightly over no big deal and finally I had a hundred five grams of my 109 grams of protein target also completely acceptable after entering all of the food that you ate on that day the app has a button labeled I'm done logging today if you did a good job like I did when you click the button confetti will fall on the app screen it's a good feeling and keeps you motivated and accountable one important thing I should mention when doing the keto diet it's essential that you drink a lot of water I keep my water bottle with me wherever I go sip often and refill several times a day if you are not good at drinking water get an app that will remind you to drink and will track your water intake it can be very helpful I also recommend taking some electrolyte supplements especially when you first start the diet when in ketosis your body naturally flushes more fluids which can cause unwanted side effects such as muscle cramps fatigue and headaches electrolytes like magnesium calcium sodium and potassium can help prevent those symptoms the first week of keto is the toughest as you are breaking your carb addiction drinking a lot of water and taking electrolytes will make you feel a lot better adding a little extra salt to your food or drinking full sodium chicken or beef broth will also help broth warmed up is like drinking soup after week 1 your body becomes a fat-burning machine and you should start feeling much better if you don't give it a few more weeks everyone is different I also recommend getting a scale app so that you can track your weight loss it's up to you how often you want to weigh yourself it's natural to have weight fluctuations on a daily basis so weighing yourself once or twice a week at the same time a day like first thing in the morning ended up working the best for me looking back at your weight loss over time and seeing it drop is inspiring as far as staying on the diet here's some advice that helped me keep losing weight if you cheat on the diet make it a rare occasion and I mean rare and then immediately get back on the wagon but better yet and I can't stress this enough don't cheat at all instead find the keto equivalent food that is making you want to cheat and eat it because keto is so popular now you can buy ready-made foods like keto cookies keto cake keto chocolate chips keto pancakes with syrup keto tortilla chips keto Pizza and even keto ice cream I'll leave links to these items below you shouldn't eat these foods all the time you should get your nutrition from fresh foods but if these processed foods will prevent you from cheating on the diet by all means eat them on occasion the next phase of my diet included intermittent fasting it simply means that you eat in a smaller window of time during the day a popular version of if' is 16 8 where you eat within an 8 hour window and fast for 16 hours straight an easier way to look at it is to just skip a meal like breakfast eat your lunch at 11:00 a.m. for example and then make sure you are done with dinner by 7 p.m. from 7 p.m. to 11 a.m. the next day your body is fasting for 16 hours straight it's as easy as that intermittent fasting takes some getting used to but it's a good thing to do when your weight loss slows down and you want to rev things back up or if you just want to lose weight faster so how often should you do intermittent fasting everyone is different but most people do intermittent fasting a few days a week or every other day I've read where some people just eat one meal a day known as Oh mad I've tried ohm at a few times but it wasn't something I felt like I could sustain the final element to my weight loss regiment was fasting unlike intermittent fasting where I would just skip a meal a day this type of fasting would last 24 hours or longer in fact my preferred fasting time is 48 hours yours may be different in the future I may experiment with longer fasts but right now 48 hours feels good to me these longer fasting times are said to have the following benefits slowing or reversing markers of aging improve digestion cancer prevention improving heart health and weight loss note it's also super important to drink a lot of water while doing and extent it fast adding a little salt to your water is beneficial as well one question I get from a lot of people is do you feel like you are starving when you're fasting the answer is a little complicated sometimes I do experience hunger while fasting but after drinking some water and waiting it out the feeling goes away it's a revelation to realize that the hunger you sometimes feel is not entirely real it's just in your head that the feeling will pass and that your body will be ok in fact while fasting I often feel levels of high energy and mental clarity one tip is to keep yourself occupied while fasting to keep your mind off of your belly rumblings I love to go for a walk and listen to a good podcast or my favorite music the other key is to build up to the fast I didn't start keto and then immediately do a 48-hour fast I first got my body used to keto eating three meals a day then I introduced skipping breakfast with intermittent fasting a few days of the week eventually I tried fasting for 24 hours and then weeks later I did a 48-hour fast it's about mastering each step and growing trust me it gets easier with practice you will be amazed at what your body can do people often ask me if your body starts eating muscle while you are fasting I tell them that while fasting your body actually produces human growth hormone that protects your muscle when fasting your body uses up your onboard fuel and then uses your stored fat which makes sense why would your body store all of that body fat and then when it needed it eat away your muscle instead that makes no sense after completing a fast it's important to gradually reintroduce food that way you avoid over stimulating your gut which may lead to bloating nausea and diarrhea I go back to my keto diet foods of course I just make sure I don't over indulge on my first meal back eat slowly by the way your food will never taste better than what you eat right after a fast fasting teaches you to appreciate what you eat I do my 48-hour fast once a month or once every two months depending on my schedule I try to do these longer fast when I have some free time available and I'm not under a lot of stress I feel like these longer fasts are like pressing my body's reset button you have to experience one to appreciate the physical and emotional benefits I haven't talked about exercise during my weight loss journey yet other than walking that's basically because I didn't do much of it at first I was so heavy that I didn't feel like it honestly that being said as I lost the weight I did start to have a natural desire to walk outside more often and eventually lift weights a few days a week maybe I should have exercised more often at first I will tell you that it makes you feel great and I highly recommend it but I don't think that there's any harm building up your exercise routine as you go I started with walking then riding my bike then lifting weights learn to take it one day at a time so that's how I lost 50 pounds using kiff Kido enter minute fasting and fasting I hope this information helps you remember I'm not a medical doctor so I would talk to your physician before starting any type of diet especially if you have any health issues or are pregnant or on medications this is your body so play it safe best of luck to you I wish you good health and longevity thanks for listening until next time [Music] you [Music]", "B8jmdbNCRIs": "is my multimedia presentation and nutritional

B's basal metabolic rate or BMR is 2028 calories the daily caloric intake needs to maintain a remain at his current weight are equal to three thousand one hundred and forty-three calories therefore to lose the 20 pounds he is desiring his daily caloric intake will need to be 3143 calories with a moderate exercise rate of three to five days a week there are 36 grams of total fat in the big Buford burger dietary fats are important for optimal functioning of the human body dietary fats are not just a source of and they function as structural building blocks of the body carry fat soluble vitamins and are involved in physiological and biological functions in the body fat is the most concentrated source providing 9 K Cal's per 1 gram consumed which is more than double the energy content of protein or carbohydrate fat should contain for no more than 220 to 35% of each day's calories 1 gram of fat provides 9 calories if you assume a 2,000 calorie diet the figure typically used for nutrition labels 20 to 35 percent equals 400 to 700 calories dividing these numbers by 9 calories per gram results in an ideal consumption of roughly 44 to 77 grams of fat daily saturated fats contribute to the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke saturated fats raise LDL which is bad cholesterol blood cholesterol levels there are 18 grams of saturated fats in the big Buford burger a meal with too much saturated fat is not a best food choice for a meal mono saturated in polyunsaturated fats both tend to lower LDL blood cholesterol levels when they be placed saturated fats in a diet trans fats also behave like saturated fats in the body the big Buford burger contains 1.5 grams of trans fats therefore in addition to watching your saturated fat intake you should also monitor your trans fat intake there is 30 65 milligrams of cholesterol and the big Buford burger cholesterol is a lipid cholesterol is known as a sterol because it is made out of alcohol and steroid cholesterol is in the production of hormones cholesterol is also used to help the liver create bile which aids in digestion changes and cholesterol function and levels can affect our body's ability to metabolize and produce energy the USDA recommends consuming no more than 300 milligrams of cholesterol a day sodium is one of the major minerals that work to keep your nerves ability to transmit signals properly sodium also works to maintain proper fluid balance sodium is classified as an electrolyte meaning a chemical that conducts electricity when mixed with water there is 1090 milligrams of sodium in the big new food burger general sodium recommendations by dietary guidelines are not to exceed 2300 milligrams per day one meal should not contain greater than 500 milligrams of sodium a deficiency in sodium can result in fatigue moodiness nausea muscle cramps irregular heartbeat stomach pain loss of appetite and constipation the sodium content in the big Buford burger is very high according to dietary guidelines calcium is a major mineral in the body the big Buford burger contains zero percent calcium calcium is used by our bodies 99% to keep holds and teeth strong and support skeletal structure and function calcium also plays roles in cell signaling blood clotting muscle contraction and nerve function a calcium deficiency also known as hypocalcemia increases your risk of developing disorders like osteoporosis and osteopenia recommended daily dose of calcium is a hundred milligrams iein is a trace mineral which means you only need it in small amounts a trace mineral signifies you need less than 100 milligrams a day the big Buford burger contains zero percent iron iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency and the leading cause of anemia in the world iron deficiency can result in poor memory poor cognitive skills and poor performance in physical activities carbohydrates are important macromolecules that consist of carbon hydrogen and oxygen they are the most abundant living organic compounds in living organisms and account for one of four major biomolecular classes including proteins lipids and nucleic acids there are 31 grams of carbohydrates in the big Buford burger carbohydrates provide energy store energy and build macromolecules and stay protein in fact for other uses daily carbohydrate intake should be between 150 to 200 grams per day the big Buford burger contains 31 grams which is an adequate amount to consume in one meal there are two types of fiber in the body soluble and insoluble and soluble fibers have many functions including moving bulk items through the digestive tract and controlling pH levels into the intestines soluble fiber binds with fatty acids and slows down the time it takes to empty the stomach in the rate of sugar absorption in the body soluble fiber also reduces cholesterol especially LDL the big Buford burger contains three grams of dietary fiber recommended daily amount of fiber for men is 30 grams based on the recommended daily fiber allowance the big Beauty burger contains adequate fiber for one meal proteins are large complex molecules that do most of the

pounds I'm gonna tell you how I did it step by step but first let's discuss why I needed to lose the weight in the first place not too long ago I was at my highest weight ever I felt terrible I didn't sleep well my stomach was upset often I had frequent heartburn and my energy levels were low not to mention I hated the way I looked despite all of these things which I've been dealing with most of my adult life I had never been diagnosed with any serious health issues that was until I met with my doctor a little over a year ago at a physical exam I was told that my blood pressure was high and that my bad cholesterol levels were also high my doctor didn't think I needed any prescriptions yet but he said that I needed to do something about my weight or I would be headed down that path and could face serious health issues in the future like diabetes and heart disease to name a few I left the doctor's office feeling depressed I'm a father and a husband my wife and son depend on me I need to be healthy for them and I want to be and my wife and sons lives for as long as possible they mean the world to me that's when I began a new way of eating that helped me lose 50 pounds and changed my life in so many positive ways after the weight loss at my next physical exam my doctor said keep up whatever you were doing your weight is down you look great and your blood pressure is normal we also looked at my blood work report together he showed me that my cholesterol levels were back to normal as well that made me happy of course but I didn't need to hear that from him I felt it I felt great with a ton of energy honestly I felt like a kid again and I could easily keep up with my young son running and playing with him just having a lot of fun he's six and a half years old now and weighs about 50 pounds sometimes he will fall asleep on the couch at night and my wife or I will have to carry him upstairs to his bed we were always amazed at how heavy he feels now which made me think I used to be 50 pounds heavier that's equivalent to carrying around my son 24 hours a day seven days a week no wonder I was so unhappy and sick that weight was a huge burden on my body physically and emotionally so how did I shed the 50 pounds my weight loss regimen consisted of three disciplines that I slowly mastered i call it kiff k is for keto or ketogenic diet I is for intermittent fasting

better if you don't give it a few more weeks everyone is different I also recommend getting a scale app so that you can track your weight loss it's up to you how often you want to weigh yourself it's natural to have weight fluctuations on a daily basis so weighing yourself once or twice a week at the same time a day like first thing in the morning ended up working the best for me looking back at your weight loss over time and seeing it drop is inspiring as far as staying on the diet here's some advice that helped me keep losing weight if you cheat on the diet make it a rare occasion and I mean rare and then immediately get back on the wagon but better yet and I can't stress this enough don't cheat at all instead find the keto equivalent food that is making you want to cheat and eat it because keto is so popular now you can buy ready-made foods like keto cookies you know cake keto chocolate chips keto pancakes with syrup keto tortilla chips keto pizza and even keto ice cream I'll leave links to these items below you shouldn't eat these foods all the time you should get your nutrition from fresh foods but if these processed foods will prevent you from cheating on the diet by all means eat them on occasion the next phase of my diet included intermittent fasting it simply means that you eat in a smaller window of time during the day a popular version of if' is 16 8 where you eat within an 8 hour window and fast for 16 hours straight an easier way to look at it is to just skip a meal like breakfast eat your lunch at 11:00 a.m. for example and then make sure you are done with dinner by 7 p.m. from 7 p.m. to 11 a.m. the next day your body is fasting for 16 hours straight it's as easy as that intermittent fasting takes some getting used to but it's a good thing to do when your weight loss slows down and you want to rev things back up or if you just want to lose weight faster so how often should you do intermittent fasting everyone is different but most people do intermittent fasting a few days a week or every other day I've read where some people just eat one meal a day known as Oh mad I've tried o mad a few times but it wasn't something I felt like I could sustain the final element to my weight loss regiment was fasting unlike intermittent fasting where I would just skip a meal a day this type of fasting would last 24 hours or longer in fact my preferred fasting time is 48 hours yours may be different in the future I may experiment with longer fasts but right now 48 hours feels good to me these longer fasting times are said to have the following benefits slowing or reversing markers of Aging improved digestion cancer prevention improving heart health and weight loss note it's also super important to drink a lot of water while doing an extended fast adding a little salt to your water is beneficial as well one question I get from a lot of people is do you feel like you are starving when you're fasting the answer is a little complicated sometimes I do experience hunger while fasting but after drinking some water and waiting it out the feeling goes away it's a revelation to realize that the hunger you sometimes feel is not entirely real it's just in your head that the feeling will pass and that your body will be okay in fact while fasting I often feel levels of high energy and mental clarity one tip is to keep yourself occupied while fasting to keep your mind off of your belly rumblings I love to go for a walk and listen to a good podcast or my favorite music the other key is to build up to the fast I didn't start Kido and then immediately do a 48-hour fast I first got my body used to Kido eating three meals a day then I introduced skipping breakfast with intermittent fasting a few days of the week eventually I tried fasting for 24 hours and then weeks later I did a 48-hour fast it's about mastering each step and growing trust me it gets easier with practice you will be amazed at what your body can do people often ask me if your body starts eating muscle while you are fasting I told them that while fasting your body actually produces human growth hormone that protects your muscle when fasting your body uses up your onboard fuel and then uses your stored fat which makes sense why would your body store all of that body fat and then when it needed it eat away your muscle instead that makes no sense after completing a fast it's important to gradually reintroduce food that way you avoid over stimulating your gut which may lead to bloating nausea and diarrhea I go back to my keto diet foods of course I just make sure I don't over indulge on my first meal back eat slowly by the way your food will never taste better than what you eat right after a fast fasting teaches you to appreciate what you eat I do my 48-hour fast once a month or once every two months depending on my schedule I try to do these longer fast when I have some free time available and I'm not under a lot of stress I feel like these longer fasts are like pressing my body's reset button you have to experience one to appreciate the physical and emotional benefits I haven't talked about exercise during my weight loss journey yet other than walking that's basically because I didn't do much of it at first I was so heavy that I didn't feel like it honestly that being said as I lost the weight I did start to have a natural desire to walk outside more often and eventually lift weights a few days a week maybe I should have exercised more often at first I will tell you that it makes you feel great and I highly recommend it but I don't think that there's any harm building up your exercise routine as you go I started with walking then riding my bike then lifting weights learn to take it one day at a time so that's how I lost 50 pounds using kiff Kido enter minute fasting and fasting I hope this information helps you remember I'm not a medical doctor so I would talk to your physician before starting any type of diet especially if you have any health issues or are pregnant or on medications this is your body so play it safe best of luck to you I wish you good health and longevity thanks for listening

my food and by Thursday I'm gonna show you what I eat when I'm looking for a college student let's get here's what I got start off with my chicken so I usually just get the protein that's on sale for the week this time it happened to be chicken breast sometimes I do ground turkey as well you can get that for pretty cheap and it's also pretty lean I just stick with my milk almost fortunate you're gonna have like three four glasses of milk a day some people are they think dairy you know isn't good for you and things like that everything works for me and here we got our peanut butter got to always have our peanut butter something with bulking that I do is I just try to include a scoop of peanut butter and everything I can oatmeal protein shakes things like that just give you some extra calories it's always good to get your calories what I'm trying to put on weight and then we got our outfit these are really good you look at the macros on it 18 grams of carbs 3 grams of protein 2 grams of fat only a hundred calories I usually do 2 packets of this it's a little more expensive than buying a cup of oats but the good thing about it is they're already in packs and like measure it out for you so you don't need to measure it out and it's just convenient in the morning when you're in a rush just throw in some cinnamon and throw in some peanut butter on the cinnamon is good because it's what it does is it allows you to use your carbs as energy instead of throwing them as fat so that's always good try to include cinnamon in everything protein shakes oatmeal on toast whatever it is and I also got my eggs I always have eggs I got this I get the 60 count because I probably eat like 6 eggs a day I have four in the morning along with my oatmeal and then I have two eggs in my protein shakes see I got the 60 count hopefully that lasts me about a week week and a half and then I got some salt because we were all out and then I got my Frank's redhot because I put that OH okay guys it's currently Thursday October 20th 608 let's get today start okay guys so first meal of the day I'm we're going with four eggs I'm also gonna do two packets up my outfit that I showed you guys I got at the store yesterday I'll show you the macros on that let's do it okay guys so we finished making breakfast and I'm here with the eggs we have about 25 grams of protein we also have about 27 grams of fat so in the morning I like to get it like you know about one third of my fat intake in and then we also have two packs of the oat fit my oatmeal and then my oatmeal I put the peanut butter for the extra calories about two tablespoons and then I also added that cinnamon and that's 36 grams of carbs so a good way to start off the day okay what's up guys just come back from class there was something I forgot I want him to tell you guys what I do it's not really eating in terms of food but what I do is I drink a gallon of water a day you can pick these up in the store for like 89 cents and they usually last about a week until they get kind of gross and you don't want to use them after that but basically there's a lot of benefits drinking a gallon of water a day it helps with acne it helps flush toxins out of your system and helps with digestion especially when you're bulking and you're taking all this nutrients and all this food it's hard on your digestive system so water is gonna help that helps with hydration helps you perform better in the gym if you're hydrated and it also speeds up your metabolism which is also gonna help so you don't store as much fat so you guys made my protein shake for the morning it's the optimal nutrition serious mass so with pretty much all mass gainers the serving size is gonna be two scoops so it's hard for your body to absorb a lot of nutrients at the same time so for better absorption what I do is I break it up one in the morning at around 10 o'clock usually in between breakfast and lunch and then I have another one right before I go to bed so in this protein shake I just put skim milk I'm one scoop of the serious mass I did spinach I did ice cream to get extra calories yes you can when you're bulking that's on your body type actually and how well you can put on weight so just know your body type but yeah it's always good for extra calories and I put in creatine just a creatine monohydrate unflavored um you can pick it up for pretty cheap I also put in two eggs and some cinnamon for your metabolism and in just this one shake 2.2 grams of fat 126 grams of carbs and 25 grams of protein with 625 calories the UFC's coming up this week we actually have chick-fil-a going to chick-fil-a pop in so I got two grilled chicken sandwiches macros on these is five fat 40 cards and 30 proteins so both of them together 60 protein 80 carbs and 10 fat what about I'm gonna do some stuffs so do shoulder dumbbell press we got some phenox TM no patent-pending but we got the Bettencourt nutrition with testosterone bigger lighter pre-workout so I just got back from dinner with the family I go to school in San Diego but I was able to come home tonight and spend the night with my family in Corona California so we went out to dinner I got the chicken fajitas on those it was 25 grams of fat 25 carbs and 24 proteins 410 calories so yeah that's what I had for dinner okay guys so 8:50 I'm about to go head over to my home gym 24-hour fitness arena some shoulders and arms so we started out our shoulder arms workout with overhead press something I'm doing through this book is I'm starting with one heavy compound lifts for everyday stuff it's like chest it's gonna be bench press or lady's gonna be squats so overhead press here doing 135 I did nine reps and then I worked my way up to 155 and was doing sets of five on that notice I'm pushing my head through on the reps and my thumb is over the bar I feel it more of my shoulders when I do that and then right after that we went into this big drop set of lateral raises so first off I'm doing 32 and a half pound dumbbells and I'm going for a set of eight on this one and then we're gonna drop the weight no rest in between just go right into it and then right here I'm doing 25 pound dumbbells I'm hitting that lateral deltoid and something about being seated on this movement is it's gonna help reduce your swing so that way you're able to focus more on that lateral deltoid and get better mind muscle connection and then we went right to the last one no brakes 15 pound dumbbells especially on this last one I'm doing 15 pounds 15 reps so I'm really focusing on the form and really focusing on getting that mind-muscle connection since the weight is lighter and I can get that better focus get that better isolation yeah so right after this one I'm gonna do another superset so this is a super with upright rows and curls we're using the EZ bar if you notice my grip on these upright rows my thumb is like on top of the bar I'm just pulling it with my fingertips that way I'm not really using my forearms I'm just focusing it all in the shoulders so I did about like 10 to 12 reps with that that's 35 pounds on the bar on each side and then we went right into the superset of curls with the outside grip on the EZ bar with these ideas about eight to ten reps I'm doing twenty fives on each side I'm focusing on bringing the weight all the way down and I'm keeping my abs and my glutes really tight to help reduce weighing as much as you can however I'm still getting some cheat reps in but I'm just making sure I'm being careful with it and then right after that we went right into these lateral raises then these are a little bit different not your usual lateral raise if you see I'm using a weighted barbell it's just 20 pounds but what it does is it helps you like get that stability in your shoulder you're gonna feel you have to balance the weight try to keep that barbell straight also I'm holding on to the rack and my feet are close to the rack to help reduce my swing and reduce momentum so I can just focus on that lateral deltoid yeah I did both arms for that first sets of like 12 and then we went right into a superset of rear delt fly's rib delt raises and I did about 15 reps I'm just going 15 pounds on these and notice that my grip is my palms were facing in that helps it hit the rear delts the best for me and then right after that we went into kind of like a try set we did three things in this so we started off with the cable front raises I'm using an under group on that and I really feel it in my front delts I like it a lot keeping the abs tight keeping the glutes tight just focusing on that front delt and I did about 10 reps on that and then right we went right into curls and just using the same bar I did for the front raises really focusing on my form not really doing a lot of swaying or anything like that I think I'm using like 120 pounds and yeah I'm making sure I'm going all the way down and I have my thumb over the bar on these as well and then no break we went right into tricep pushdowns with the rope I think I did like 15 reps on this I'm using about a hundred twenty pounds um also I'm trying to pause at the bottom just for a second to get that it's gonna help stimulate growth in your tricep also what I'm doing too is I'm flaring my hands out at the bottom and it's gonna help hit that that outside head of the tricep and that you're gonna really feel the difference if you flare your hands out at the bottom of the rep just finish shoulders it's currently 1106 shoulders and some arms just gonna finish up the night with my protein shake and head to bed okay guys so once again have my protein shake in that protein shake we have 126 grams of carbs I'm 2.2 grams of fat and 25 grams of protein 625 calories that's gonna end it for today I'm tired going to the Laker game tomorrow check it out check it out but uh yeah I'm gonna head to bed so that concludes the video thanks

Nutella is a very real thing with weed legalization happening in various states the use of cannabis and foods is becoming a more publicly common thing from gummy bears to vodka people are putting their weed in just about anything that they can consume but particularly foods that satisfy their sweet tooth this now goes for Nutella or cron tella as its officially known at $23 a bottle cannabis makes it possible for you to be the proud consumer of Nutella containing 300 milligrams of THC extract the jars are also small so you won't get too carried away according to vice in addition to its weed infused Nutella the same company also makes weed infused peanut butter and jelly as of right now you can only purchase it in Canada but with how nice everyone is up north we're sure they'd be more than happy to discreetly mail you some oh man that sounds [ __ ] awesome chron tella happenin", "wDEe9C5786s": "[Music] you show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking our fourth look third look at a syrup lien that is I think the kids are calling it lien these days which i think is a take-off of when you used to do scissor with codeine in it this is not codeine this is just weed just good old-fashioned THC straight from the earth the good stuff none of that none of those opiates or opioids or anything to get you addicted so this is a pro methylene liquid syrup two fluid ounces watermelon flavored and it proclaims to be 600 milligrams of indica THC I guess they're saying it has 1200 milligrams of syrup total and half of it is indica of course we're gonna be doing the entire bottle 600 milligrams is a dot I'm not gonna do 600 milligrams right from the get-go although I'm pretty sure this might be another scam so I picked this up very cheaply I think it was 35 bucks for a 600 milligram syrup which is a very good deal if in fact is true but let's take a look at this bottle and just see what kind of red red flags just sort of pop off look how cheap it looks just a gross little cheap sticker poured out on there you can barely read what is you know what's on there because the printing is pretty awful shake well every use it's very muddy muddy is the adjective they use fair enough in THC We Trust so again this little bottle it proclaims that 600 milligrams hc' but I am skeptical because of the price because of the size because of the packaging all of that leads me to believe that this might actually be a another scam but I am certainly hoping to get quite high off of it and I realize I probably should have brought something to drink with me in case this thing tastes truly wretched which it might very well so let's go ahead and take a look at this Pro methylene liquid syrup let's shake it very well because it's muddy now it suggests that for a beginner to do half a teaspoon it says for an expert to do 2 to 3 teaspoons or 4 Club meanies whatever the hell that means 4 to 7 teaspoons which is what we're gonna be doing I have no idea what Club MIM is is maybe you guys can help me figure that out come on let's focus camera there it is 4 to 7 teaspoons tablespoons rather Club em I am eyes II don't know all right so our muddy stuff is shooken oh it smells really bad and it looks really gross look at the top there ah oh it is muddy as they said it is muddy well maybe I should go get something to mix it with [ __ ] it here we go 3 2 1 down the hatch see how much we can get down ooh ooh we got a lot of it down we got most of it there yak it's actually not super super gross it's not good tasting by any stretch but I'm gonna finish it off I'm gonna give my second self a second to let that percolate through my stomach and then I will be back to you guys like all of our reviews I'm coming back to you guys in two hours to let you know how this promy Faline what a dumb name is actually hitting because that's the most important part of this edible review you don't really care how it tastes because you're gonna CAC it down no matter what it does if it gets you high so we'll find out soon guys I will see you in just a bit thanks for watching wheats see you soon welcome back to wheats guys it has been two hours since I had the pro me feeling whatever it's called I don't need to say their name anymore because I don't need to give them any advertising it is a bunch of gar [ __ ] 600 milligrams my booty look at those eyeballs white as the winters snow I fell feel roughly infinity more times hi doing a cannabis 100 milligram syrup than that six hundred milligram syrup from Pro methylene and my buddy squids here to join us hey squiddy so yeah do not give them any money just like I thought it was a total total scam an absolute trying to fleece you for your money there's nothing in there it tasted terrible at the bottom because there was a lot of like ground-up plant matter or whatever in there it was disgusting I don't know what it was probably wasn't actually weeds I certainly don't feel hi disgusting I at the very bottom tasting does didn't get me high at all an absolute it's like I took $35 and lit it on fire an absolute travesty of a product do not buy it if you see it at a dispensary tell them not to carry it because they're just doing their customers a disservice by carrying this [ __ ] that is Pro methylene I think I'm not going to look again because I don't want to if I have it wrong great they don't need the they don't need the endorsement they don't need the free advertising but I wanted to share with you some little message of positivity something something something to look forward to so I even though normally in these quick short bad reviews they don't come with the cherry on top this time I think I'm gonna go with a give you guys a little cherry on top a little something that you can take with you uh something to enjoy over the next week or so just that can be enjoyed with or without weed something that will just bring a little bit of a joy or a smile to

watch well hi just let the videos rule and and learn some cool stuff and that guys is gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats sorry it was such a

this month's brew box are flying high edition brew box and soon enough you'll see why josh actually uh started his own company cbrd i super excited for him to let you guys know about it and now that ties in to craft beer so josh tell the people what's up all right yeah so thanks for having me dennis um as you said i'm josh i am the um co-owner of cbrd which is a four milliliter single serve hemp shot uh that you can instantly infuse beer with a hundred milligrams of cbd so here's a little you know little little promo for us that i hand out to people um basically yeah there you go yeah got our got em yeah they're they're itty bitty um essentially you know the idea behind this is um you know cbd beer you can't really have um you can't brew cbd beer so this is sort of a workaround to be able to do it which is exciting um pour it in it disperses immediately and then sometimes you have to stir it for just a second yeah give or take depends on the beer and voila you've got yourself a cbd hemp infused with right under 0.3 thc beer and it is amazing i will say i have you know for market research purposes of course i tried this on a few different occasions with a few different styles of beer and every single time it did not disappoint it is amazing i know you know i know it affects everyone differently um with me what i did after a grueling you know few days of hitting the gym and working out i was like okay i want a beer let me go ahead and try this uh hemp shot and everything in there so i tried that and i felt relaxed and now i started reading you know different things and i personally my personal opinion i'm not a doctor a scientist or anything uh but it felt like it sped up recovery for me i slept a lot better i was so relaxed um some of the lactic acid buildup that i had seemed to dissipate a little faster these are by no means official claims uh by first hit brew box or c b or d certainly yeah well that's fantastic that's sort of the experience you've had um and you know we found people that um you know some people use it actually you know for that reason more for that you know uh relief purposes um and you know there's a lot of benefits for doing that but you know we found that a lot of people use this more for the fun you know they like to either realize they like to feel good and you know we pack it with um you know right right at that legal amount of that right at that legal amount of thc to where you're able to really enjoy it and moreover it's you know uh something that you can have at a brewery or at a bar or something like that and it feels a little more um i guess uh worth you know you don't want to pay six bucks for something at a bar and go man i didn't feel anything from that right right no yeah i felt it that's awesome [Laughter] without doubt uh i know on your end josh can you let the people know where you are and what beer are you enjoying today yeah so i um so i live in minneapolis minnesota um right in south minneapolis uh i don't know 10 minutes from the airport the business on all of our manufacturing and my co-founder is actually based in greenville south carolina so we are um you know so i'm fully remote and every other member of our team is based in south carolina so i go back and forth a good bit and then live up here i just like being up north more than in the south um i'm drinking a long route peanut butter porter which is excellent um it is by empyrean brewing company which is based out of lincoln nebraska um i got it just down the road in the uh beer store right down the street from me called elevated beverages which always has the best beer ever like no question like it's awesome they've got they get like crowlers delivered from all over town uh i can if i want to drink at home i'm certainly getting taken care of and they have a really good scotch selection i don't know if you like scotch oh yeah i'm more of a petey scotch fan so you like lagerville and laphroaig yeah aardbag like those guys like something that some people either love or they say it tastes like a campfire so it's like one or the other i want to drink i if i want it to be like a campfire that's just as smoky as pot i want to feel like i'm getting smoke in my eyes while i'm drinking my is what i kind of call it man do you and do you like smoke beers i do now what are those roush beers i believe they're referred to as like brodzitzki's is a popular style they're not super common i think it's an underrated style and i get it it's an acquired taste not everyone is gonna have a smoked beer and absolutely love everything about it but i think there is definitely a niche out there for it i just wish i saw more especially locally in uh pittsburgh and western pennsylvania but i just don't see that many smoke brews i don't see them here either the best one i've had is live oak brewing which is a really big brewery in austin texas yeah and they it's like 3.2 so you can like you know it's like you could drink like eight of those and you know his first is drinking like a 15 ipa or something crazy right yeah um right yeah so it's pretty sweet and then gosh i was in salem massachusetts for a sales trip and they've got a i can't remember the name of the brewery but that place that's all they did was smoked beers it's kind of like wonder how that marketing you know with that damn it yeah man go back up there yeah for real but you know just a whole brewery you know they was more than just that like lighter state like smoked browns and smoked porters and all kinds of stuff it reminds me of oxbow i want to say was that in portland sammy yeah portland and they specialize in everything says on like almost any kind of saison that you can think of they had there and i love places that have those specialties i like variety as well but it's always refreshing to you know someone who you know they just harness their craft so much in a particular style that every single one just knocks your socks off um speaking of that so the brew that i'm going to be digging into is gamehedge from insurrection ale works they are located in carnegie pennsylvania this specifically is a double dry hop double ipa i was feeling like you know sliding into some of those ibus today a little bit of bitterness but it comes in at eight percent abv really really tasty good color there good head retention very aromatic oh i'm definitely excited to get into this but again josh thank you so much for jumping on i'm excited to have a good conversation cheers and absolutely cheers i'm looking at carnegie right now just where it is because i didn't know where it was oh yeah really right outside of pittsburgh um but without further ado are you able to let the let the folks know like how did you get started in in the company that you have now see see beer the it's gonna take just for everyone out there knows i've been mispronouncing it for since may so for months i've just been saying see beard which is wrong josh let me know at cbrd um like so how did you get that start and what made you specifically think okay we need to start pairing these with beers like how did that start all right so gosh where do i even begin so i i would all of this sort of started with an interest in travel and um entrepreneurship which are two very don't have anything to do with beer and cbd so um so i'm a big craft beer guy always you know i'm pretty i'm 27 so i've been at it for like six years something like that yeah um yeah legally right yeah there you go i never touched it before that man no way and um i used to be a teacher so i have a master's degree in music um and used to be a music music educator and still you know still jam and play and do a little bit with it here and there um after i've always been interested in business guys you know i've experimented with all kinds of stuff selling t-shirts online and uh trivia um gosh what else have i done i tried to create like a travel agency one time and that was a brutal failure and then i got into um into music instrument rentals learned a good bit i worked with uh my mentor and boss there was a harvard business grad um and really legitimate guy and you know really knew how to run and i learned a lot about what does it take to run a company et cetera um and so switch from that and then started my own um virtual um basically digital marketing company and so um my niche was uh music stores i'm still working with a few of them now just a little bit here and there um to go and do things on my own um and my goal was to um do that and travel full-time so go around to europe and asia and all kinds of stuff like that and just travel around and work for my you know live that like digital nomad lifestyle kind of thing that you hear about like on the internet i thought it'd be pretty cool um in the process of doing that so my business partners name's joey he's my cousin um and he everyone has a cousin joey i feel like yeah absolutely yeah and so he um you know taught to me about you know we've always been close obviously since i've been born and uh he you know approached me about the idea of doing a cbd business and so um i said yeah sure that sounds great um we started with tinctures and i don't know if you know a whole lot about cbd but basically tinctures is sort of like the standard that and gummies are sort of the two standard ways to take cdd products we figured out right when launching a tincture brand we got a pivot this is so we got to do something different because if we you know the ten thousand five hundred and one tincture brain is not gonna succeed um i was in spain when we really started doing all that marketing and he was doing all the manufacturing i was a weekend i was like i can't do this i gotta come back this isn't gonna work so came back um and then while i was i was visiting some friends actually in pennsylvania we were sitting around our brewery and they were like we were like man i gotta come up with a cool idea they're like what if you at first they were like what if you do cbt and mix it in t i was like that's kind of cool and they're like what about c beer d that's kind of a fun name cbrd i was like i like that name and i looked it up and the domain name was available and i was like all right i'm buying it yeah we're doing this and so you know at first we thought about doing this as like a um like a 15 milliliter you know like a half size thing that you like sell and you put your beer and then we figured out like a different you know went to the drawing board and created a formulation that where it does that infusion process because if you take a tincture and you pour it in it's going to rise to the top and crystallize and that's not you don't want that in your beer yeah that's that'll be gross in your beer um and so you don't want to do that and so you know that's joey what he does he's the science guy and has the um you know he has a big facility from other businesses that he owns and so worked through that and you know came up with the right thing and then the you know signature four milliliter you know the little mini single serve shots um and you know that was really what we thought would be a game changer because it's at a price point that somebody will walk in somewhere and be like oh cool this looks kind of neat i guess i'll buy one for right right yeah you know it's something that fits as an impulse buy so you don't have to like a customer doesn't have to feel like they have to commit like 80 bucks to you know no one on earth is going to go into a liquor store and pay 80 bucks for some random thing they see on the counter that's not rival but something that's six bucks yeah it's like oh i kind of like getting a little crossfaded while i drink yeah sure i'll try one right so they they go and get that and what you know and kind of voila that's what we've done from there and we've pivoted around so much you know having just him to learn how on earth do you sell cbd on earth do you sell beat you know talk to beer people how do you talk about brewery owners and you know man it's just i mean it's a hustle but you know we're starting to figure it out and learning a little bit more about um you know what people like and more importantly we've got a great product and you know when you've got a good product if you can figure out how on earth to speak to people it's going to succeed so absolutely now i definitely agree if i walked in somewhere and i saw a little you know 100 milligram like ready to rock and roll something to end to the beer i would absolutely be down to pick it up um but i'm also curious how did that first conversation so you get you have the product you know you went through figuring out how you want it to be delivered um via the beer how did getting that first uh like business to carry your products how did that conversation look like what was the first business that we got gosh it's been a while now um basically okay our first business i think they picked this up was a liquor store in charleston south carolina and that was solely because the guy that was the manager got you know he just you know you know there's just people that you know he didn't look at it be like oh cbd that's pot you know right that's you know why would you sell that you know terrible person right uh this guy you know he just saw it and understood it immediately and you know when and we get people like you know if we get guys that are you know anywhere between my age to like somewhere like in their mid-30s um they typically you know you got a better shot of them just getting it right away and once they get it once again that it's not a health product it's something that's meant to have kind of fun and they can see that it's it's really easy to explain it to them you know it's just a matter of their demographic you know who they've got coming in do they have you know old conservative folk coming to their liquor store do they have like hip youngsters that like you know right you know hemp shots in their beer right so yeah but you know that was that first kind of conversation you know as times have been going on um i've learned to make it simpler to explain you know we used to have three strengths we now just have one because trying to explain three strengths to you know not only to a business owner was there but trying to explain three you know when a customer is standing at a at a bar in a tap room and then you gotta be like what's the difference between the 30 and the 60 and that you know it's like you know you might as well like read a manual about it right so you guys only have the 100 milligram now yeah that's it yeah yeah so that you know and and you know that sold 95 percent i mean 95 of our online sales after um doing like an intro pack where people can kind of try them or then we're just the hundreds so we just decided you know this is what this is a win this is the winner people like it um might as well do it and you know what's even better is then we're able to pass the state you know that's two less uh skus that we have to manage and take care of so we were able to lower our prices uh which is pretty sweet oh man that is awesome so that was the first business that liquor store what was the first brewery that you guys uh slid your products into for insight brewing in minneapolis minnesota so just down the road here yeah yep um and it's done pretty well we've got another one in town here that called dual citizen brewing company that is selling this stuff like that this is what you know it's it's just a great partnership um insight's doing really well with it too but dual citizen especially you know they just got right that perfect demographic to uh you know really make this shine right which is pretty cool yeah that is freaking awesome so you have two main um revenue segments so you have your b2b and your b2c your business of business which you know the liquor stores are good their breweries and then your b2c you know all you the folks are out there jumping online ordering from you guys um for your b to b if i'm a brewery owner i'm watching this episode the daily sip right now uh what would you say to me and then how do i you know how do i reach out to you to get that carry to my brewery oh man i mean like what would i say to you as an owner yeah as a brewery owner like yeah i would say like hey you know this is this is a unique opportunity you know for a new age of drinking you know eventually i really think that you know the next three to four years the fda is going to get you know their act together and you know cbd beer is going to be able to be brewed you know right now this is a workaround and when that happens cbrd is not going to probably exist anymore if people are just going to make cbd beer i get it you know i understand that the writing's on the wall when that happens potentially well it would probably be more of a b2c play at that point you know absolutely yeah well and this still makes it you know instead of investing all this money and one being you know putting all your eggs in one basket this lets you experiment and see like oh wow everybody really likes my porter with cbd i'm trying maybe all right you're right yeah it can be a test kind of thing right um and then even more so you know with 100 milligrams oh boy if they want to put 100 milligrams of you know going through tap lines you know if they don't do it what does that look like i don't even know maybe it won't be a thing and even if it's legal i feel like there's so much manufacturing work around that no i don't think anyone has infrastructure in place to really do that if they do like five milligrams of cbd a pint or something like that i think it'd be fine but if it's like a hundred you know like what we're doing where it's like actually getting you like a lot of stuff it's gonna be uh it'll it'll require some challenges but you know if somebody really figures it out and can can it and whatever you know they're gonna be they're going to become millionaires just off of that you know it'll be like that g3 to the sweetwater yeah oh yeah yeah yeah and the emperor from uh yeah i'll take the the g13 over the emperor personally for sure yeah but no but when i talk to these you know basically i come to people and say hey look you know this is high margin it's doing well you can make decent money doing this it's unique people like it not everyone's gonna like it but when they do like it they come back and they buy it again it's at a price point that's right um and you know at the end of the day it's really not that big of an event you know it's not like they're buying a hundred thousand dollar kegging system or something you know right or it can't write or buying uh you know having to suddenly ship you know it's not like they're pivoting from tap room sales to distribution and then all of a sudden they're lowering their margins on their beer by a gazillion percent they're going this this amount um and so you know that's sort of the way to go and it's just a matter of if you think you have the customer base that has the interest in that kind of stuff and more likely than not i think people you know realize that the answer is yes they do have that customer base because it's not something that's age specific yes you might see one demographic have a little bit more interest but even the older clientele out there like this type of stuff like they were figuring that out before we were even born like this isn't something new absolutely man yeah so you know and it just and also just depends on the point of view of the owner you know obviously you know i i got really hopping on this in january so you know i had two months to like work my um you know work my butt off trying to get the word you know that basically to kind of get my act together and then code it and so now you know we just have all these people you know and it's getting a little bit better especially around here but you know from april to i don't know july or so you know it's just like all of a sudden you're if 70 of your revenue was your tap room you had all of a sudden open a seat you know had to you had to completely do a new business model and then you know this is an upsell so trying to you know trying to implement something that's made for a tap room when you don't have a tap room it's kind of a natural battle yeah that's a 100 true um but you brought up a good point with covid so how has covid you know affected your industry like what are some of the things that you guys have ran into um i mean the beat i mean the b to b just a big part i mean b to c has probably grown about like a typical like b to c company um a typical cbd company um can grow especially you know we're pretty limited budget so we can't pay a ton of money for advertising and stuff like that but we can pay enough to you know pick up a couple i mean most of us are offering organic growth and people tell each other about it um you know so that's only there's only so much speed that that can can go unless you're like uber or something like that right so um but um on the b2b side you know it's just it's just a slower you know and it's just everybody as a whole is has felt that pain of you know you know we feel it you know the malt distributors feel it the this person feel it and beer is crushing it but there's really crushing it for those that already have their distribution systems that's the key yeah if they were set up to already distribute even self-distribute you know cans and not relying fully off of you know uh like restaurant wholesale or growler fills in the tap rooms i definitely agree with that um have you guys ran into any supply issues or any bottlenecks there uh not so as you know we also do i do a lot of contract manufacturing for other cbd businesses so that's also a second side of like what we do and that's a pretty big portion of what we do actually um we've recently been having problems with the california wildfires where our terpenes you know what terpenes are like but but basically terpenes are are you they get extracted from the marijuana plant so like popular strains are like super lemon haze and blue dream you know there's a gajillion different kinds of um terpenes our chirpy manufact or chirping people are are stuck in the fires so all of a sudden they can't get anything out right and so now we've got all this entrant you know we've got some interest when people want to reorder their terpenes it's like well you know what do we do um we get all of our hemp from michigan so we're you know michigan's not in the california wildfires fortunately and so um in regards to cbrd supply it's good um you know we have our own issues in regards to getting the product you know every i mean everyone's got their own hiccups and ours is on the um you know what i was telling you earlier on the labeling and the getting the the um just having the capacity in the the hand the people on board that can keep up with the demand on just making the product look nice and getting it out on time but we've pretty much got that figured out so yeah well that especially you know and that that's the perk of growing you know slower once when you get hit with these you have time to pivot react um put a strategy in place rebuild but if you guys are getting you know 100 000 piece orders from multiple places and then you would run into a wall oh man that would just be a nightmare hundred thousand or yeah hundred if i get a hundred thousand piece order that'd be i don't know i'll be i'll be flying you to help me help me buy everybody everyone we know is gonna be we're gonna be it'll be it'll be a big cbrd bottling party in our in our manufacturing facility hey man they'll tease me with a good time we'll make the drive out there i don't know if you're gonna like yeah well a lot of fun there yeah um but you know we're up to the task uh we just hired one we just hired a full-time bottler we already have a manufacturing team for other stuff and then um so you know some of the other industries that joey's working in um and uh you know it's uh it's growing which is pretty cool but you know these you know brewery owners or liquor store and if they want to get in touch and chat with us they um you know all you have to do is email sales at cbrd.co um you can either talk with me we also have um preston james who is our um if you see him on instagram he's cb cbrd guy but he uh he's our our sa he's been our been a part of this since the beginning is our like main wholesale guy um and he's you know just super helpful and knows he's a marketing whiz and he can help people you know whatever kind of challenges or the way that you want to do this because there's 50 different ways you can market cbrd and attack right you know he's up to the task to really sitting down and you know making sure this is going to be a smash hit wherever you're at so and then you know i'm a part of that too um but he uh he really handles that while i'm doing all kinds of marketing and all kinds of crazy stuff wearing all the different hats we definitely know that whole song and dance and just trying to you know not allow anything to fall through the cracks because you're doing 15 different jobs at once until you could afford to actually hire you know folks to kind of uh build that safety net out um but so my next question i had for you josh uh maybe a little crayola style as my drill sergeant always told me um back in the day when i was in the military uh so breaking it down real easy so there might be some folks out there that are tuning in because uh number one thank you guys for watching go grab a beer i know you need a refill uh so folks out there that are watching they may not know the difference okay so what is cbd versus hem like what is going on here are you able to break that down a little bit yeah so basically hemp is a different you know it's different than marijuana right so when you you know hemp you can sort of call it like hemp and cbd similar um you know especially like after the extraction process you have cbd distill it right or you can buy hemp flour which is not um which hasn't been extracted right so you're buying hemp flour cbd flour you can use them really interchangeably um you know the difference between hemp and say marijuana is marijuana has a ton of thc you know it has most of the number one cannabinoids so you know cbd products have cannabinoids in it and in the marijuana plant the two biggest ones are thc and cbd and so then there's a bunch of other ones cbg is the new kind of like the buzz issue it's the new it's the new popular thing um it's the it's the new buzzword around that and uh something called delta eight thc and that is a whole nother ball that's like if oh gosh if you get in the cbd industry people are buzzing about c about delta athc but but basically essentially you know the cbd itself is has no no thc in it at all but it's one of the um you know one of the many beneficial parts of the hemp plant so when you're buying a cbd product you know there's uh variations how you can buy it this is a full spectrum cbd product so that means that the hemp plants got you know this is hemp derived and it's got that less than 0.3 thc right plus the full spectrum of other cannabinoids a little bit there but it's probably predominantly cbd you can also go somewhere and buy isolate cbd which is absolutely no thc at all but the problem with that is you don't feel it at all you know if you take it you're going to be like gosh this is like snake oil you know it's got similar kind of things and if you're doing like thera you know people use it for like therapy and you just kind of gotta like all right trust me buddy this is but it's not like taking like tylenol or you have that like you know instant like oh this is done right yeah um and you know full spectrum cbd has that similar effect you've got that relaxation um if we made this isolate with no cbd you would take it and not feel anything and say this sucks never buy it again so damn you drop like some alien technology like in the middle of that well when you were talking about some of the other buzzwords and uh cbd those were just brand new words to me i have no idea what that stuff is and they're kind of new to me too i mean i mean i know what they are um i'm not the you know because i focus so much on cbrd you know i'm just i'm sitting around thinking about beer all day all right think about beer people but you know other people in the industry you know they're trying to push wellness products and so they're sitting around thinking you know what's the new trend in wellness what's the new trend in wellness and you know we intend you know a big reason why we say you know cbrd is a good idea is so that we do not have to do that so that we can talk about things that we like talking about which is beer and brewing and cocktails right that's what i like talking about hell yeah which is why you're on the daily sip exactly yeah uh so one of my other questions that we got from some folks out there is how tough is it to start a business in the cbd industry um the startup costs aren't terrible compared to the average business um the cost to push to to grow your business is very hard um you know it's just so you know it's ultra competitive man it's crazy um you got to create niche things kind of like what i've created right you got to create something for a certain industry um you know i've got people that i talk with that you know we do manufacturing for and i help them with their marketing you know i say well you started a cbd business what do you want to start it for they're like back pain i say you're gonna fail all right so let's get a little more niche yeah let's get a little more niche than that right right and then we'll say all right well what do you like doing it's like surfing okay so let's create a product that helps surfers with their back pain and then when you make your marketing you know you can put up a poster that shows a picture of a guy riding a surfboard and shows your product and says like you know write it right right in the sun longer with blah blah blah blah blah right right and so um you know that's if you can figure out who your target customer is and who you want to market to that is you know that's the way you can make it kind of work and then instead of going and hitting up the cbd shop who gets called a hundred gajillion times a day i really like the word i don't know i just think it's a funny number to say gajillion but uh you know they get they literally get cost 200 times a day and we get them too and we don't even have a storefront right saying hey buddy do you want to buy my cbd balm right it's like well you know i'll put you in the list with the other 700 that you know then it's an seo business just to prove your legitimacy but when you're at like a uh um you know if you're but but then if you're going and hitting up bob's surf shop and saying hey bob here's your here's this bomb that'll help your surfers that come into your store and make them feel better then that guys can be like well you're the first person to ever come in here and talk about this damn i'll take i'll take ten right so these are big facts that you're dropping right now like and that it you know it kind of rung true through different you know cohorts and and you know different accelerator classes that we've done to grow our business is that niche down two levels and then they talk about it and it was just super cool like hearing you put it in a real world practical um experience you know because i'm sure you've had that conversation or similar conversations many times uh with different um clients that you may have had before oh yeah i just sit around and think about it you know and i'm sitting around thinking about it all day it's like how do you know you just got to make yourself stand out you know cbrd is the only game in town that's doing this i don't think that's going to last forever no i think we're going to get we're defining gonna yeah we're gonna get ripped off at some point um we'll see how they do that but uh you know if anything that'll be better because then more people you know you know one of the biggest issues we have is they're just like a hemp shot what's a hemp shot right so if we got 100 people you know if all of a sudden everybody knows what a hemp shot is and cbd is the leader in the industry it's a lot better when another sales guy is hitting you up and it's like oh hip shot and then you google you know and then you understand what it is so right absolutely yeah now it you you raise a definitely a few good points um one being you know when we a couple years ago whenever we uh you know brought our different legal team on board just trying to figure out you know how do we protect our brand because you know we're not necessarily creating things we're curating an experience with companies like yours being in our brew box a a company can come in that has a gajillion more times revenue than we do right you know and then what's going to prevent them from uh you know overnight replacing what we do as a company and they basically said dennis what your your intellectual property what you do as a company um that they can't replicate no matter how much money they have or the relationships that you build with folks like yourself josh like things like that so i i definitely agree and i i want to you know end this episode on a light fun note uh so with that said josh what was your first craft beer and you don't have to say how old you were probably like 15 or so gosh man i don't know i don't remember like like like something we're talking about i mean if we're talking about like you know still an independent craft brewery or what got you into craft beer what was the first beer you had you was like what what is this craft beer this is insane i mean i guess it was i mean if we're going craft kik is yingling still consider craft beer i think they change that definition every year as england grows i don't know i mean england was definitely you know yingling was a popular uh beer in college um the i mean since then oh gosh what was my first i used to get so i went to college in south at university of south carolina um i remember the first brewery i really got into was um well i mean i would get some like boston beer company stuff but like like local like you know like something that's not big a big dog right um company was westbrook uh you know they do the mexican cake that oh yeah do with it they do beer infusions too you know them and um evil twin do the mexican the something mexican cake i don't know i used to be able to get in dc which is pretty cool um but they i used to get their gozo it was like it came it got started right when i turned 21. and so i remember buying that and it was just like how on earth does somebody make a beer taste like this like where on earth is that this is crazy this is insane no that that sounds delicious and uh you're definitely making me more and more thirsty what is like what's your favorite craft beer it's probably right now you know it changes for people so i would say my the the beer that i've had and it's tough right like being in the position that that i am where a lot of these breweries and brewery owners have become you know family members of ours you know over the years it's tough to choose between them but you know everyone has a favorite kid right uh so i would say the beer that i'm really digging right now is the le noche triste from which is a stout from butler brew works okay in butler pennsylvania yeah travis is my boy they do a good job a lot of breweries around you know pittsburgh they do a phenomenal job but he's the one that consistently like sticks in the back of my mind um at one point we were popping open you know his brews on multiple episodes of the daily sip and my wife was like stop this we can't just be like a butler brew works uh video series i'm like okay you're right we'll stop i'll drink that when i turn the camera off like a big marketing company for him yeah hey fun he probably loves it so yeah no he's a phenomenal guy and we have so many like breweries around where we are that have just become like family members again to the point where like sometimes i allow

to wheat skies the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and if you're a long time then you know that I often talk about going to the moon products taking me to the moon going to the moon and back being over the moon moon moon moon moon moon moon moon well today guys we are actually going to be visiting the Moon Moon cosmic cappuccino that is 250 milligrams of THC we've got it right here the first time we are reviewing anything from this brand the Moon whoops again the Moon brand the cosmic cappuccino I'm not even really sure what this is to be honest I'm not even really sure what this thing is maybe it's some kind of cappuccino flavored wafer I I don't know I don't know it's gonna be a mystery for us all we're all gonna find out at the same time and I hope that like the product says it does take me to the moon and back it's Moon megadose chocolate bars is the name of the company and it's been cosmic cappuccino and on the back it says intergalactic milligram \u00e4j-- that's fun so uh if you've never tuned in to wait weeks before the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this product and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review all right guys I can grab some scissors real quick I'll be right back we'll open it up and give it a taste all right here we go trying to get it out all right here we go here is our wafer or what I assume is a wafer there is a strong weed odor to it let's give it a bite not a wafer just a long skinny chocolate bar with a cup of key no flavor on my cappuccino I mean cappuccino thank you Arrested Development it's good good quality chocolate liked it quite a bit perfect melting point it had a strong cannabis scent but well there is a cannabis taste to it it's really not that strong it's not that bad at all quite like it in fact well guys I'm gonna finish off this cosmic cappuccino looking forward to it and then I will come back to you guys in just two hours selecting a homegoing but for you guys will just be a couple seconds see you then peace [Music] welcome back guys it's been two hours since I had the moon mega dose chocolate bars with their intergalactic milligram \u00e4j-- and I gotta say unfortunately I am not at the moon I am more like at the you know sort of the International Space Station somewhere in the stratosphere definitely not on the moon certainly not on the moon and back it's not terrible I don't want to suggest it's terrible I'm at probably a for me maybe a 5 somewhere between a 4 and a 5 you know like that kind of level of high this was a $15.00 edible so you know you can't complain too much for that price that's a little worse than average but not substantially so I did like how it tasted tasted great there was just like cannabis taste but the rest of the chocolate was nice and smooth and creamy and had a great cappuccino flavor but I'm just not as high as I was hoping to be with the moon megadose chocolate bars here I was I was certainly hoping to be you know somewhere in outer space but yet I am still terrestrial what can you do alright guys thank you so much for watching wheats I appreciate you watching as always and we will check you out on the later view peace", "Ht3L3b52JRs": "hi friends welcome back to my channel and welcome if you're new here it is Monday so that means that it is meal prep day I can't wait to share these three recipes with you guys we do a breakfast a lunch and a dessert that is out of this world and wait until you see the smart points and on top of that it is clean eating you cannot go wrong at all with these three recipes so if you want to see what's on my prep for the week stay tuned [Music] [Applause] [Music] breakfast this week I'm going to be making individual baked oatmeal cups I'm really excited about this very clean healthy breakfast I'm going to pair this with eggs and fruit so let me show you what is in our oatmeal cups first you're going to need some rolled oats I'm going to be using my favorite ones from the thrive market these are the organic rolled oats highly recommend the thrive market you guys know I love it of course the link is down in the description box it'll get you 20 dollars worth of free product when you join the thrive market and you're gonna be seeing of course a lot of thrive products in this meal prep as well as most of my videos they really have affordable prices and they have literally anything and everything you would need for a healthy clean diet so definitely check them out again the link is in the description box we're also going to do some chia seeds milk or milk alternative of your choice I'm going to use a forager cashew milk baking powder unsweetened applesauce cinnamon and vanilla extract some salt honey in egg and then whatever toppings you want for your oatmeal cups I'm gonna do zero point toppings so it doesn't increase the points of my oatmeal cups themselves so I'm going to be doing some fresh blueberries and then some of these organic dried goji berries from dried I count these as zero because all that's in here is goji berries so there's no added sugar or anything like that so I don't count points for these because to me this is basically like a regular fruit so those are gonna be my toppings for my oatmeal cups so let's get started so in a fairly good-sized bowl we're gonna mix together one egg we're also going to add one cup of unsweetened applesauce so go ahead and we're also going to do about a teaspoon of our vanilla extracts we have one mashed banana I did not show you guys this when I showed you all the ingredients so I apologize you're also going to need one fairly ripe banana that you mash up and then last but not least I have a quarter of a cup of my raw honey so I'm gonna go ahead and add in that and then we are going to give this a mix until all of these wet ingredients are nice and combined before we add in our dry ingredients once your wet ingredients are combined we're gonna go ahead and add in two and a half cups of our rolled oats we're also going to add a pinch of salt I just use the pink Himalayan that's just really gonna help bring out the flavors we're gonna do one eighth of a cup of chia seeds a little bit of cinnamon or a lot of bit of cinnamon whatever your preference is the recipe calls for a tablespoon so we need quite a bit of cinnamon added to our dry ingredients and then one and a half teaspoons of baking powder so I have a half of a teaspoon here so I'm just gonna go ahead and add three of those and then we're gonna give this a quick mix together before we add in our almond milk all right last step is we're gonna put in our almond milk or whatever milk you're using and give that another stir and that was one in a quarter cup of milk so we're gonna make sure that it gets nice and combined and then we'll be ready to put these into our muffin cups and get these into the oven so I went ahead and pulled out my muffin pan this is a fun silicone one super cute I got this at Fred Meyer so I went ahead and just sprayed it with some of the avocado oil nonstick cooking spray you can also use a paper liner whatever your preference is and we are going to fill these with about a quarter of a cup of our oatmeal mixture we want to make sure we get 12 muffins so you can always go back and add a little bit more but it's a lot harder to take away so I'd go a little bit light on the amount to start and then again we can always go back in and add some more so go ahead and fill all 12 of your muffin liners with your oat mixture and then we'll be ready to add our toppings and get these into the oven [Music] I want to be daring baby dance the night away I let my hand outside one now that there fills with the Omo mixture we're gonna go and add topping so again I'm going to do some blueberries so I'm just gonna kind of plunk these in to the oatmeal mixture and then I'm also gonna go ahead and add a couple of goji berries I'm gonna kind of push those down in I want to make sure that my fruit stays in the oatmeal Cup as it goes through the cooking process so I'm doing about four blueberries in about four or five of the little goji berries and that's gonna be my topping so let's get the toppings on so we can get these into the oven hey I won don't you just get tired chasing Fame and feed pretty alright they're ready to go into the oven 350 degrees until their cooks through it's going to take about 30 minutes I'm so excited for these the oatmeal cups are out of the oven don't these look delicious next time I probably or for you guys if you're gonna use a dried fruit like these goji berries I put them on once you pull them out of the oven because you can see they got a little bit Brown because they were already dry so that's one difference that I would make still going to taste delicious not worried about it but for you guys that's probably a good tip so I'm gonna let these cool for a couple minutes we'll pop them out of the muffin tin here and I'll show you what I'm having for breakfast and give you the smart points so our oatmeal cups are cooled I just popped them out of the cupcake liner they came out like a champ so make sure you spray it your muffin tin if you're not going to use a paper liner my gosh these look so good look at these you guys they're nice and thick and just dense with oatmeal and then we topped them with those goji berries and blueberries these look amazing so each one of these oatmeal cups is for smart points and that's on the blue and green plan if you are on purple these are only two smart points because your oats are zero points so I'm planning having one of these oatmeal cups an egg whether I fry that or be hard boil that and then I'm just going to pair it with just a few extra of these organic blueberries and that's gonna be my breakfast that way my breakfast is only 4 smart points so can't beat it I am going to store these in a plastic container with a lockable lid so they stay nice and fresh and I'm just gonna put them in the fridge and each day I will take one to eat but how amazing of a breakfast and it's only 4 smart points [Applause] [Music] for my lunch this week I'm going to be making turkey meatballs with an apple and onion the original recipe calls for red onion but I don't have any so I'm just subbing minced onion and then I'm gonna roast some veggies so I'm gonna roast up some butternut squash and some organic beets and I'm gonna have those on the side with my meatballs and in my veggies or for my veggies I have avocados and then I'm going to be topping my veggies with the DAX green zest you guys know this is my all-time favorite seasoning for vegetables it's so good the veggies come out so flavorful I love Dax because not only are they all-natural so there's nothing artificial no fake anything so it's a nice clean spice there also natural MSG free and all of the ingredients you can literally pronounce in the seasoning so it's very very simple very minimal ingredients I love the Greens asked for veggies I actually have all of the DAX seasonings because honestly I love them all I do have 10% off and free shipping for Dax that code will be here on the screen give them a try they're a small business great to support them during this time and you won't be sorry because with their seasonings all being salt free they're great before weigh in or if you watch your salt and they're full of flavor like full of flavor so I'm gonna put some of this on my veggies and then I'm also gonna put a little bit of the Trader Joe's onion salt and then for the meatballs you're going to need a pound of ground turkey so I just have some 93 seven organic ground turkey you're going to need an egg salt and pepper again I'm using minced onion in place of red onion poultry seasoning garlic powder and you're gonna need a granny smith or green apple so let's get started on this week's lunches so the first thing we need to do is go ahead and chop our beets I'm just going to put them in a bowl here and we also need to dice up our apple and I'm gonna put that here in a bowl as well and then we can start assembling our meatballs you get the better let me show you what a cool tie looks like it's so much better [Music] ah [Music] Quizlet Arnold loves you know better [Music] baby so let's put together the meatballs with my beat hands it's hilarious so I have my 1 pound of 93 7 ground turkey to that I'm gonna add my chopped apple I ended up having more apple then my little Bowl would hold here so I have the remainder just on a paper towel so we'll go ahead and add that in and then we're also going to add one egg that's going to help bind our meatballs and then for onion it calls for a half of a cup of red but because these are minced I'm only gonna do about a quarter of a cup of minced onion and then we're gonna add some garlic powder and again you can season this to your liking the recipe calls for about a teaspoon of garlic powder and then we have some poultry seasoning as well and we want about a tablespoon of that that is what is going to give our meatballs that authentic meatball flavor so it's really important to add in that poultry seasoning and then we're gonna do just a pinch of pepper and again just kind of to your liking and a pinch of some pink Himalayan salt and then we're gonna use our little spoon here and combine this all together to create the meatball mixture and then we'll get ready to roll these out and get them on a sheet pan we are going to put these in the oven right alongside our vegetables and where they're both gonna get roasted at the 425 degrees so let's get this combined and get these meatballs or ready to go so we're ready to do the meatballs look at how good that looks so this recipe makes four servings so it really doesn't matter the number of meatballs whatever the number you get you want to divide that by four to make the four servings so I've lined my pan here with some parchment paper I'm going to use my cookie scoop to scoop out my meatballs it makes it really easy and that way I'll have to dig my hands in these scoops I find these on Amazon and I will make sure that I link them down below for you guys but I'm just gonna use those to form my meatball and again I'm not really concerned with the number of meatballs that I get because I will simply just take the number that I get and divide it by four for the four servings so let's get these scooped out onto our sheet pan here and then we'll go ahead and get those roasted veggies on a sheet pan season those up and we'll be ready to put everything into the oven I went ahead and put my beats and my butternut squash here on my sheet pan I decided that I'm going to add a bag of broccoli as well I have a ton of frozen veggies right now and I think I mentioned but our microwave isn't working we're in the process of getting that replace from our home warranty company and they're really quick to take your money but not really quick to replace your appliances so we still don't have a microwave so this is gonna be the best way I think for me to get in some greens is by just adding this bag of frozen broccoli directly to my sheet pan so these are my veggies so to that I'm going to add about a tablespoon of my avocado oil so I usually do one quick swipe across and then one quick swipe this way and I count about a tablespoon worth of avocado oil which I believe is four points so I will add an extra point to whatever my meatballs end up for the vegetables and then I'm going to season these with some of the DAX and hey the more the merrier when it comes to seasoning on these uh veggies so I'm gonna go ahead and add the DAX and last but not least just a very small amount of the Trader Joe's onion salt and that just kind of brings that onion vibe into our roasted veggies and then this is going to go in the same 425-degree oven as our meatballs so let's get everything into the oven so that we can have lunch ready to go all right our veggies are out of the oven steaming piping hot so I'm gonna go ahead and add these to the meal prep containers the meatballs are already in there as you can see here and I'll be back to show you the whole lunch and give you the points all right so here is lunch you guys I cannot wait for this lunch first I want to show you did not end up using all of the roasted veggies which is fine I love to have these as an easy warm up side dish I even like to add these on to salad with dinner or lunch they're really really versatile so I'm totally fine having extra but I'm going to count one smart point for the roasted veggies just because I did end up using the olive oil so I'm going to count one point for my veggies and then we have three meatballs per day so it ended up making 12 meatballs it is for smart points purse serving so all three of these big meatballs is only for smart points and then you add the one point for the roasted veggies you guys this is a five smart point lunch look how amazing this looks you even have room for a fruit if you wanted to add a fruit and you can also add something sweet to finish off your lunch and you have plenty of points to spare so this is a five smart point lunch so I decided with my lunch I'm gonna have some papaya and I just thought that I would show that to you guys I went ahead and just cut this all up babs it up and that's gonna be kind of my fruit or sweet treat with lunch [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I lose my breath whenever I see you you stole my heart what is it that you do life was great too you added colors money system we don't care about the others [Music] [Applause] [Music] you're my heart things I look at how yummy this looks oh my gosh I'm so excited literally you guys this is the best marinara it's that simple it takes five minutes to put it together I'll show you guys once it's done how I packaged it up I just freeze it and pull out a jar as needed so wait till you guys see this it is seriously the best marinara this is the skinny ish dish and of course this recipe will be on my website so I'm gonna go ahead and turn this on I think I'm going to do mine on high just because I'm starting this a little bit late for four hours and then I can come back and change it down to low if I feel like it's just cooking a little bit too fast for another four hours or so so let me get this closed up and we've got marinara going so I want to show you guys how I do my crock-pot marinara you can see we still have a couple hours left but I sort in mason jars so I have these really large ones these are like 32 ounce and I will put a few of those and then I generally do a couple small jars as well this is if I want to make pizza or maybe chicken parm or something that I don't need a lot of the marinara at once I will have some small jars and then I'll have quite a few of the big 32 ounce jars the rule of thumb is if you're gonna freeze it it's just shallow the jar a little bit so when it expands when it freezes it doesn't pop the lid off I've never had a problem I've never had the jar break I've never had the lid pop up nothing of the sort so that's how I store my marinara I literally just put them in jars put them in the freezer and when I need them I pull them out defrost them and you have zero point marinara whenever you want it [Music] [Applause] [Music] for a snack or sweet treat this week I'm filling all things spring so we're going to make a lemon poppy seed loaf we are making a glaze with frosting loaf and wait till you guys hear the smart points and we're using good whole clean ingredients full fat yogurt full fat milk I can't wait to share this recipe with you so let me show you what's in our lemon poppy seed loaf you're going to need some whole milk just some all-purpose flour this is the organic all-purpose from the thrive market again thrive is linked down below LeConte Oh monk fruit sweetener and they're powdered sugar and this is for the frosting or the glaze of the loaf you'll need some almond extract vanilla extract some poppy seeds baking powder baking soda some sort of oil I just have Auto Cod oil here it doesn't have any flavor so it doesn't affect the flavor of the loaf you'll also need some full fat or whatever you want to use not Greek yogurt a fresh lemon and last but not least some salt so let's make some poppy seed lemon bread so to start our loaf I have a fairly good-sized bowl here to that I'm going to add two cups of the organic all-purpose flour again you can use whatever flour you have on hand and then I have the zest of that large lemon I went ahead and just zested the whole thing I always figure the more lemon zest the better I don't worry about measuring it out because I really think it brings that brightness of lemon to your your bread so there's my lemon and then I have two tablespoons of poppy seeds so I'm going to add those and then I am going to do about a half of a teaspoon of my peak salt and we need to go ahead and add our leveling agent so we need three-quarters of a teaspoon of both so there's half of a teaspoon and then another quarter of the baking soda and we're gonna do the same with a baking powder and then we'll give it this all a good stir get those dry ingredients combined and then we'll be ready to add in our wet ingredients next we're gonna mix together some of our wet ingredients so we need one tablespoon of oil again whatever oil you are using this is just the chosen foods avocado oil and then we're going to add in one egg I don't think I showed you guys at the beginning I don't know what my deal is today but you're gonna need one room-temperature egg as well and then about a teaspoon of vanilla extract and then we're just going to whisk this together before we add in the yogurt and the rest of our wet ingredients next we're gonna go ahead and add in our lemon juice I have about two tablespoons of fresh-squeezed just what was left of that large lemon that I stood and then I'm also going to add the 1/2 of a cup of Greek yogurt mine is the whole milk full fat it does not adjust the points really to add the non-fat it may save you a small amount I honestly didn't figure that out into the recipe so you can certainly reput the ingredients into the recipe builder if you want to use nonfat Greek yogurt instead of regular Greek yogurt but like I said it for me I don't think it's going to change the points and I've been only having full fat dairy so whatever your preference is so go ahead and give that a mix together and then we're gonna start alternating between this mixture our flour mixture here and our milk so I have my dry ingredients here I have six tablespoons of whole milk and then I have the yogurt egg mixture that we put together over here so first I'm going to go ahead and add a little bit of the milk to my dry mix and we're just going to slowly incorporate all of these ingredients into our dry mix until we have batter and then we'll add this to our bread pan and get this into the oven [Music] I right so we're ready to get our bread ready and go into the oven so I'm gonna go ahead and spray my bread pan really really well with some nonstick spray this is just the chosen foods avocado oil and then I'm ready to go ahead and add my batter my oven is preheating to 350 degrees and we're going to cook our loaf until it is cooked completely through it's probably going to take between 40 and 45 minutes that's just going to depend on your oven so we'll get the batter in here and get it ready to go in so our bread is going in 350 degrees until it is cooked through 40 to 45 minutes so while our breads in the oven we're gonna make our glaze so I'm using the Lepanto powdered sugar this is 2 times sweeter than regular sugar so it's actually half of the amount of this versus regular sugar so the recipe calls for 4 tablespoons of powdered sugar so I went ahead and just did 2 tablespoons of this because it's 2 times sweeter so we want to use half the amount and then we're also going to add in just the tiniest bit of almond extracts and we're also going to send it out with some milk so I'm just gonna put in a little bit of milk to start and then we'll start stirring until we have that glazed consistency you don't want to add too much milk right off the bat or your glaze is going to be too thin this actually looks really good so we're just going to go ahead and set this aside until that loaf comes out of the oven and is nice and cooled all right our Lemon Poppyseed loaf is out of the oven we're gonna let this cool just a few minutes in the pan then I'll pop it out and allow it to cool completely once it is cooled we're gonna go ahead and add on this please and then I'll be back to show you our completed bread and we'll go over the smart points once we put on that place all right our loaf is fully cooled so what we're gonna do next is take this glaze that we made and we're just going to drizzle it right over the top oh my gosh you guys this is gonna be so good I cannot wait to try this I'm actually going to have this for a snack today because I love everything in anything lemon as you so I'm excited for this so I'm gonna get this glazed oh it's so pretty well cut this into 12 slices and I'll be back to show you our completed lemon move and give you the smart points all right so here it is so this is a slice so we want to haven't cut it into 12 equal slices so that is a good sized slice as you can see here so the loaf again it makes 12 slices so each one of these sections gets cut into three and it is only three smart points per slice on all plans you can have a frosted Lemon Poppyseed loaf basically cake for three smart points cannot wait of course this recipe will be on my website which is linked down in the description box [Applause] [Music] so here are my snacks for this week I actually have three snap options I don't eat all of these every day these are just my options for the week so I did haul these in my recent thrive order which you guys will see in Wednesday's what I eat in a day I found some really great new products that thrive these are the Mary's gone crackers these are the real thin no wheat crackers so these are very similar to a wheat thin without the wheat so I'm really excited about these you can actually have nine crackers for five smart points I'll probably only have half of that amount of crackers and I like to dip that and my good culture caught is cheese this is the really full fat double cream classic cottage cheese I believe this is for smart points for half of a cup so I'll usually do half a cup of that for four points and then two points worth of crackers and it's a six mark point yeah way to go Jen or you can do less and less whatever your preference is but I like having this it's a good source of carb and protein mixed together and then I have these two good yogurts I like these I really prefer the ciggies full fat but like I've mentioned they're really really hard for me to find in my area so these two goods are only two points and they have good ingredients and then I like to top it with my progra NOLA from Julian bakery this is the espresso cluster there's tons in tons of different flavors you guys if you're looking for a clean granola Julian bakery progra NOLA is as clean as it gets and the smart points are amazing you can have an entire half of a cup for two smart points which means you can have a quarter cut for one point of clean granola I literally put like a tablespoon on my yogurt so I don't even count it where you would have to count normal granola so I love this granola it's really good here are your stats on the granola so there's tons of fiber there's even protein so you get that little extra bit of protein boost and again ingredients are stellar absolutely stellar ingredients so I love this vanilla I do have 10% off I'll put that code here on the screen for you guys and there's a link down in the description box but this is only two points because I literally do not add more than a tablespoon and that is zero smart points I love the espresso cluster but they have tons of great flavors just check them out over on their website and lastly is belt bar you guys know I like to have these as an option as well because they keep me full and I get that little boost of protein so this one is one of my favorites this is the coconut almond it's a legit almond joy it's so good and here's your nutritional information this is only three smart points and you're getting 18 grams of protein for those three smart points you can't beat it also I love their nut based bars and this is the peanut butter you'll notice that the protein is much more as well as the fiber and the fat so I find that the nut bars even though there are four points instead of three keep me much more full and satisfied for longer and I think it's that extra boost of protein fat and fiber so I love the bill bars there are three to four points depending on the kind of bill bar that you purchase but I also have a code for 10% off and free shipping of built bar and if you're new to Belle bar and you've never ordered before or if you have a second email that you can use to order I have a leak for $10 off and I'm gonna put that down in the description box it is a special link for first time built bar or new email built bar customers so

coumadin is to number one inhibit inhale inhibit protein synthesis number to prevent conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin number three inactivate trombe in number four inhibit platelet aggregation so how does coumadin work so we have to think about each answer choice so coumadin is a long-acting anticoagulant that inhibits inhibits vitamin K dependent clotting factors side effects would be excessive dosage because hemorrhage rash fever protime used to control the surge therapeutic range is 1.5 to 2 times normal levels antidote would be vitamin K or the Python coumadin you should eat consistent amounts of green leafy vegetables containing vitamin K so the correct action the correct answer would be number one coumadin inhibit protein synthesis if you answer number to prevent conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin this is the action of heparin number three inactivate inactivate tromping this is another action of heparin and if you answer number four inhibit platelet aggregation this is the action of aspirin and person teen or diaper read them all a patient with Parkinson's disease receives levodopa the nurse knows that the levodopa works by number one blocking central cholinergic receptors number two restoring dopamine levels in extra pyramidal centers number three releasing dopamine and other catecholamines from neuronal storage sites number four activating dopaminergic receptors in the basal ganglia so the right answer for this one is why so how does levodopa work so we have to think about each answer choice and how it relates to Parkinson's disease so what would be the needed information Parkinson's disease this is caused by impairment of dopamine producing cells in the brain levodopa is converted to dopamine in the body to supply the extra pyramidal centers in the brain side effects which hemolytic anemia aggressive behavior dystonic movements depression hallucinations dizziness orthostatic hypotension so the correct answer would be number two restoring dopamine levels in extra pyramidal Center so this is how label dopa works don't take with vitamin b6 or fortified cereals because this will block effects if you answer number one blocking central cholinergic receptor this is the action of collagen teen use with levodopa the side effects for this one is urinary retention dry mouth constipation you have to take it two to three days before effects are seen if you answer number three releasing dopamine and other catecholamines from neuronal storage sites this is an action of cyber trail use with levodopa side effects are irritability insomnia dizziness and you have to take this one after meal if you answer number four activating the perm energy receptor in the basal ganglia this is the action of parlo del use with labelled OPA the side-effects for this one is dizziness headache or to stay hypotension abdominal cramps pleural effusion you should take this with what windmills next question the nurse cares for clients being treated for abuse of narcotics the nurse knows that which of the following data obtained during client history prashant the greatest risk for the client developing a disease process number one the use of multiple drugs number two intravenous administration of narcotics number three unsuccessful efforts to decrease drug use number four detail difficulties encountered as a result of drug use so question here is what is a risk factor for IV drug users so think about each answer okay symptoms of narcotic abuse include mark respiratory depression hyperpyrexia seizures ventricular dysrhythmias pinpoint pupils stupor leading to coma so the correct answer for this one would be number two intravenous administration of narcotics because IV drug use is associated with increased risk of developing HIV septicemia hepatitis and respiratory failure so we go back to the question what is a risk factor for IV drug user okay so intravenous administration of narcotic is the answer if you answer number one the use of multiple drugs this is associated with some increased risk of complications but not as severe as IBUs if you answer number three and successful efforts to decrease drug use this is not directly linked to the development of disease process and if you answer number four legal difficulties encountered as a result of a drug use this is not linked to this so the right answer here is number two intravenous administration of narcotics another question the nurse is performing discharge teaching on a patient with chronic renal failure the nurse knows that teaching has been successful if the patient selects which of the following menus number one to own Sturkey one-half cup noodles 1/2 cup carrots 1/2 cup blueberries and a town soda number two for owns bacon ham 1/2 cup potatoes grading one-half cup canned green beans one apple and eight ounce of milk number three six ounce of roast beef baked potato 1/2 cup brocoli one orange and 16 ounce of iced tea number four hot dog with bun 1/2 cup pork and beans 1 cup spinach salad one banana and 8 ounce lemonade so what is the appropriate menu for a patient with a chronic renal failure so you have a chronic renal failure patient what are you going to serve the patient so you have to record the appropriate diet for a chronic renal failure this is the slow a chronic renal failure is the slow progressive loss of renal function diet therapy includes what protein of high biological value increased carbohydrates may be some restrictions of sodium and potassium so number one 2 ounce turkey 1/2 cup noodles 1/2 cup carrots 1/2 cup blueberries and a ton soda this is the appropriate amount of what / HBV protein low potassium fruit fruit protein free drink number two there is ham and canned green bananas these are high in sodium and number three if you answer number three 6 on roast meat baked potato 1/2 cup broccoli one orange and 16 ounce of this is too high in protein in potassium and number four hot dog with bun 1/2 cup pork and beans 1 cup spinach salad 1 banana and a town's lemonade this is a lot lvv protein high sodium high potassium spinach and banana which is a no-no so the right answer is number 1 the nurse cares for client after you red tailed it ought to mean the nurse notes that the client has a left ureteral catheter in place the nurse should include which of the following in the clients plan of care number 1 clamp the catheter for short periods of time number 2 irrigate the catheter every two hours number 3 gently advance the catheter if no drainage is observed number 4 instruct the client that the urine from the catheter should be clear so what is the correct answer here first we have to analyze what is being asked so the being the one that's being asked here is what is a correct action for a client with ureteral catheter strategy determine calm of each answer so you read Carol Lee taught to me is surgical removal of calculus from the ureter so you do not irritate your Taryn catheter check incision check incisional drain check surgical dressing and you have to encourage oral fluids so number four is the correct answer instruct the client that urine from the catheter should be clear so immediately after surgery a small amount of blood tension is normal but then it becomes clear increases fluid to promote flow of urine if you answer number one on the catheter for a short period of style of time this is due to small size of catheter do not clamp okay if you answer number two irrigate the catheter every two hours do not irritate you have to measure intake and output number three if you answer number three gently advance the catheter if no drainage is observed you should not advance the catheter because this may cause trauma the nurse cares for 22 year old woman admitted with Crohn's disease original enteritis the nurse would expect the patient to be placed on which of the following diets number one high fat high protein high residue number two low fat low protein low residue number three low fat high protein low residue number four high fat low protein high residue so what diet is used for Crohn's disease so you have to think about Crohn's disease once this is original enter itis this is the inflammatory bowel disease involving segments of the terminal ileum and proximal colon the entire wall of the colon is affected restricts absorptions of nutrients sentient symptoms will be right lower quadrant abdominal pain diarrhea weight loss low-grade fever remissions and exacerbations seen the treatments of this one would be medication such as anti-diarrheal Zoar imodium anti-spasmodics anticholinergic so far so far so families or [ __ ] feeding with steroids and what would be the diet should be high calorie high protein TPN no cakwe chocolate sytrus juice cold or carbonated drinks nuts seeds popcorns and alcohol so the correct answer here would be what diet is used for Crohn's disease so number three low fat high protein low residue this is non-irritating high in calories and minerals if you answer number one high fat high protein high residue this may cause diarrhea for a patient with Crohn's disease in number two low fat low protein low Res dude this is nutritional deficiency diet number four if you answer this one this is a high-fat low protein high residue this is a high residue and it may cause what diarrhea so the right answer is number three low fat high protein low residue because it's not irritating high in calorie minerals", "3lIcRUKrsaU": "[Music] hey hey everybody hey guess what time

tylenol yesterday total yeah two two out two another two an hour ago an hour ago we were gonna eat something and it's a good thing i made bone broth because he said like oh i have to take these with

he stayed the same but you guys he injured his back he took tylenol um three times and he took that the maximum dosage each time i have to eat with it so and he had bone broth with it um so i'm glad that he did not go up at all yeah i lucked out he did he locked out so you guys were on a downward trend i probably was going down then the only time we want a downward trend is when we're losing weight you guys absolutely so anyway you guys um hope you guys have jumped on the jump start your weight loss challenge with harry and i um i'm going to start exercising next week i want to start exercising my arms for those of you who don't know i had coolsculpting done on um thursday and my arms are extremely stored this time this is my third treatment and i think um that it just did a better job would you say because it sucked it in further because there's less fat there now and i'm more so you know the first time she took two machines on each side it took two of those machines and the second time it took one right and then this one it just sucked your whole arm in yeah which is good which is good but my arms are still sore i actually did my hair today um because i could hold my arms up without like shaking right like i'm sitting here going oh so yeah it's heck getting old you guys i'm telling you so um i feel good because i'm able to lose the weight although my arms still feel um swollen they're not as swollen and they're not as hot today as they were yesterday you could see in the blouse when i put my plows on my blouse arm was tight and i was like whoa this isn't good so anyway you guys let me know how you guys did overall in december well actually for all of 19 of 20 of 2020. oh yeah let's do that how much weight did you guys lose in 2020 if you guys have been doing keto for an entire year and even if you haven't if you're brand new to it you're starting this year that's awesome what i want you to do is make sure you weigh yourself make sure you take a picture front view side left side right and the back view i know you're well you don't have to give dust you don't have to give it to anybody keep it for you know keep it bra and underwear or underwear swim trunks something like that so that you see your body because you will be amazed at the changes you will have on the ketogenic diet please no keto porn yes we don't want keto porn we don't don't need to see keto porn it's for your eyes only you guys will be so happy you did you will be amazed there are some keto folks that have lost feet of fat oh yeah feet of fat yeah well if you think about it if you add all up you can figure just about figure out what you lost and it'd be a lot i'm gonna give it two weeks and then i'm gonna do our measurements and the reason for that is harry's back he's bloated with the pills a little bit in my arms so i am going to take my first measurements let me look at my calendar year i will take my first measurements on january 15th so i will share my measurements from the last time i measured to today and then i'll go back and see what my first measurements were you know you even have you're very very oh you mean when i weigh 282 pounds no i don't have any of that i it's hard to find i know what you're saying yes i was a 22 24. i was a 22 24 i was a 2x going into a 3x top i'm down to a medium this is a medium and my pants my jeans i have on are 12. so yeah when i started keto and that you guys that's from when i had my lap band put in i had my lap band removed in november 2019 and i have lost a total of 56 pounds on the ketogenic diet so i've lost 106 pounds total 50 on that time difference oh yeah oh yeah how long was that months versus years yeah that band you lost how many pounds of the lap band 50 and 2005 to 20 19 yeah 19 because i went back and forth like with 20 pounds when i had my hip you know but it took that long so shoot it wasn't even what eight pounds a year or so right right and it was a struggle it was such a struggle had my removed done keto we have done fabulous harry got up to 260 he says he was in a 48 pants 2x shirt and he is in a large shirt and a size 34 pants so yeah we've come a long way um it was a struggle for the past couple months because we gained and lost the same couple pounds well i think everybody that we've done but i think the closest i've noticed i'm starting to notice the time of year means a lot it is it does i don't know if that's the weather or no i think it's the holidays well this year 2020 i think was the most stressful year for everybody on the planet oh god i really do and i think emotional eating stress eating all of the restrictions not having the foods available in some places being in total lockdown losing your job not having the money to buy the food you normally do all of those things factored in i think and so i feel anyone who was able to successfully hold their weight or lose weight in 2020 did an awesome job as far as i'm concerned and i'm thinking that 2021 is going to be hairy in my year we want our goal our first goal is 165. so we have 25 pounds to lose to get down there so we've gained five of that in water weight so we know we can get down to our um my all-time low was 174.6 and harry says 172.6 so i know in 2020 we're going to be able to at least hit our 165 goal now harry's doctor heart doctor wants him 10 pounds under that because of his heart his damaged heart for those of you who are new he had a quadruple bypass and uh 20 uh 2013. and then he had a silent is your backbone yeah i'm sorry we'll shorten it but anyway um you fall over he goes to see his cardiologist on the eighth he has blood work up tomorrow harry he's got blood working to do tomorrow and then uh we'll find out how his heart is doing uh since his uh silent heart attack that he had um was that in 2019 yep november he damaged his heart with a silent heart attack now we have to just keep track of it make sure he's on track and everything is is doing really well so he goes on the eighth but the doctor wants him down to 155 and i would all time all time goal is 145. i am five nine and harry is five seven and a half he says he's five eighty it's always that he's five eight but we've majored in he's five seven and a half and i'm probably just under five nine now because when i had my hip replacement done that leg was a quarter of an inch longer than my other he straightened me out straightened that out so i think i lost a little bit straightened your legs straightening it didn't straighten me out then straighten my brain out but uh so i'm probably like five eight and three quarters now and you know as you get older your um cartilage shrinks between your joints so i come down a little bit i'm sure i'm sure and you guys little sally girl what a rough week she's had phew with all the fireworks and stuff anyway you guys please tell us how did you do in 2020 tell us if you were keto the entire year and how much weight you lost total

love our button we love our cons of strings it's just there are so many people out there doing it and we specialize on the others so what we talked about today I've got my standard 510 battery here so I think that means that you know what we are about to do we are talking cartridges again today and today we are talking maybe the most popular cartridge branch certainly one of the most ubiquitous here in Southern California these guys have been everywhere for a couple of years now I I see the most frequently at dispensaries and certainly one of the most affordable cartridges I've seen I have seen this brand as cheap as twenty dollars for a half gram cartridge so very cheap probably why they're so popular today we are talking about carvanha and I wish I didn't have this sticker on it that says this product has not been tested as required by the medical and don't use cannabis regulations API let's see if I can get this off without ruining the rest of the package because I'd like to show it off to you guys should have probably done this beforehand but you know nobody's ever accused wheats of being bright before here we go here we go lift and separating just like a Wonder Bra there we go all the seekers are on so here is the curve on a cartridge in this weird little fake cork thing here in terms of packaging what do I think I think it's okay it's not as nice as some of the others but I I think it's novel I like the little you know the capsule or whatever I assume it's kind of a pain in the butt if you are actually a dispensary because these things are probably hard to store you know they're not flat you can't stack the kids stick them on the wall I just seen them often rubber banded together but in terms of originality a little plastic thing with cork it's probably cheap and it probably does the it certainly does the job so this here is the full gram it's a it's a gram cartridge sativa the jacker air might go to Presutti bus' uh and it cost me had my dispensary 60 bucks for the fulgrim so pretty cheap especially at my dispensary when full dream cartridges often run more in the 80 to like a hundred dollar range so this is the most affordable cartridge we have reviewed yet I will say I have had qurbana before but not in a very long time so I haven't excited to see how they're gonna hit after doing all these reviews all this fun stuff so let's go ahead and take out the cartridge take a look here oh this is nice inside the canister itself it comes with the testing information this is really neat actually you can see right there it's got all the testing information come on camera you want to focus being a webcam it may not but it lets us know what it is Jack Herer THC 70 2.05 cannaboids point one nine cannabinoids our CBD point one nine cannabinoids 0.35 it gives us a test date was tested way back in May and by the good people at SC labs may be the finest testing lab out there okay so that's really cool I don't know if they did not in there before if I had a head and register it love to see that always love to see that okay so we here's the cartridge our stuff its itself now ourself and we're starting off with a bad sign because it is quite sticky on the outside very sticky as if it has been leaking let's hope that's not the case here the threat feels ok but the the cap itself was quite leaky um or the this this thing is quite sticky so hopefully it's not leaking which is probably a problem with these cheaper cartridges so let's go ahead and screw it in here again just a standard 510 beep battery so first of all let's talk about this cartridge what you pay for in terms of cartridges this cartridge is very cheap compared to some of the others it's a plastic top and a plastic cartridge missed the metal and missed the glassiness all that good stuff so you're definitely getting what you pay for in terms of materials because this is very cheap compared to some the others again plastic all the way through cheap plastic there and plastic thicker plastic there but as long as it hits hard who cares what the materials like so let's go ahead give it a draw here Wow okay it hits hard it's hot too comes out hard and hot fills my lungs Wow um the taste is middling I've had some really good Jack Herer cartridges in the past this is not a really good tasting wine it's got a kind of piney like taste but it's not as it's not as fresh it's not as pure as some of the others but in terms of how it hits it's actually hitting pretty hard I'm taking a couple of nice draws and I'm definitely feeling the effects so in terms of strength let's do it pretty well just don't love the taste and and again I'm worried about that stickiness that I had when first opening it cuz the last thing I wanted to do is just short out this nice battery I have here which is a problem if it's leaking so in terms of materials bad in terms of packaging okay I don't like the packaging terms of taste mmm not for me terms of potency definitely not bad definitely on the on the good and even feeling it quite well quite a lot so um what we're gonna do guys is I'm gonna finish off this gram cartridge over the next couple of days here are probably over the next five or six days and then I will come back to you at the end of this once we've gotten through all this delicious oil here I will come back to you and give you my wrap-up thoughts hopefully won't tell you that this thing leaked through and wasted the 60 bucks in the cartridge and destroyed my pen hope not knock on what hopefully I'll come back and tell you that everything was a-ok and then really liking the product but for that guys you'll have to wait a couple more seconds for me it's gonna take a couple of days to get through this but I'll be sure to let you know how we're doing thank you so much for watching wheats guys and I will be back with you in just a bit peace hi guys welcome back two weeks it has been about six days I think since I last checked in with you when we did our Jack Herer full gram carvanha originals I've got it right here and as you can see there's actually still a little bit of oil left in the pen that's a pretty good indicator right six lasted six days on a gram cartridge and I still have some left yeah well it's becoming increasingly difficult to draw from a puppy nail work to get left in and it's a it's burning hotter now it's starting to to annoy my lungs I guess a little bit more cuz it's burning a lot hard hotter and I noticed that before on carbonic cartridges um in terms of cartridge design as I was just saying it seems to have some kind of flaws when it comes to the the fact that it's harder to draw when it gets close to the bottom and it does burn seems to burn a little hotter which I don't quite understand maybe just the less material in there the coil heats it at a more uneven rate I don't know also it leaked twice on the it leaked when I first opened it up and it leaked once more I actually had to clean my battery with us an alcohol to prevent it from shorting out cuz there was a decent amount of oil got a leak through um so yeah design flaws and then in terms of materials its junk I mean it's just cheap plastic and cheap plastic here I've seen so much nicer cartridges both in terms of materials and design so not not too Pleasant there in terms of taste did not like it uh never it wasn't foul tasting and it didn't have that sort of off taste that like the Panda liquid shatter cartridge had it just wasn't as good it wasn't as / peeny as say like the orchid jack herer it just and maybe more I took him in the closer I get to the bottom the worse that flavor sort of gets is a seemingly search starts to burn hotter or whatever it is whatever kind of reaction is happening in there that's making it taste more foul foul is the wrong word just less appealing than others um so in terms of value though that's where you're gonna find um you're sort of worthiness for carbonic because they are good value and this was sixty bucks in my dispensary but I think you can get a lot cheaper than that other places so don't don't really correlate that with overall prices I think Ramana is usually pretty affordable and that's probably why they're pretty popular is they're they're cheaper than some of the other brands and it has lasted a while it's lasted six days and there's still some oil in this cartridge as you can see even though it's increasingly difficult to extract so it is a good value for your money um but then in terms of how high you actually get I never felt like it was as potent as I wanted it to be I think I sort of leveled out you know three maybe peaked at fours after excessive excessive draws a afford but never never even in this sort of mid tier number levels so not the most potent cartridge not the best tasting cartridge not the best designed cartridge but a good value proposition if maybe you are tolerance isn't super high or if you're looking for something to pick up on the cheap crap on it might still do you okay for me it's not gonna be a recommendation I I've found too many of the cartridges that I really love to stick with something that I just kind of think's pretty good so it's gonna be a pass for me but I don't think it's a terrible product by any stretch and as I was saying if you are value conscious excuse me if you're value conscious or if you are simply looking for um really if you're not your tolerance isn't radically high this will do just fine but if your tolerance is high and muddy and you're not afraid to spend morbucks go with something else go with it work it go with the moxie stay away from this for the time being but I think we'll go back to carvanha in the future review some of their other strands because I know they're popular and I know people are going to want to see more from them so but that guys is gonna do it for this review and before I go I'm going to share with you another cherry on top one I'm really excited to share with you guys and that is a TV show one that is has been off the air for like hello for years three years now something like that it is one of my boy it's called hello ladies let me just get get that out hello ladies on HBO it's one season long it stars Stephen Merchant of Ricky Gervais Fame this might be the most popular or the most easy way to describe him he's like Ricky Gervais sis buddy the tall gangly Stephen Merchant so hello ladies is cringe comedy at its absolute cringy as it is about a British man in Los Angeles on the dating scene it is if you if you find cringed comedy hard to watch go ahead and skip it if you enjoy things like say the early seasons of the office you're gonna love this basically it's I think it's eight episodes long eight half-hour episode something like that it's basically an entire season of Scots taught sort Phyllis's wedding from the office if you know those classics it's every episode is is that it's a little unbearable at times but I mean that in the best way possible give it a shot especially if you got that HBO go subscription I think you're gonna enjoy hello ladies quite a bit and that guys is gonna do it for this review and this cherry on top thanks for sticking around we will see you guys on the next review peace", "kU_bTwnmFP4": "hey everyone joey here from respectmyregion.com back with another west coast we too review today i've got one of the most popular edible companies in all of california tko tko for those of you that don't know stands for total knockout so for me 10 milligrams is usually just enough to actually knock me out and put me to sleep so i hope these aren't actual total knockouts uh in the way that they don't actually knock me out but these ones that i've got today are uh actually a favorite of my girlfriends the churro crispies so i wanted to go ahead and get these and put them to the test she eats these all the time i occasionally take some bites i may eat a couple here and there but we're going to actually rate and review them today on the churro we've got this beautiful packaging it stands out on the shelf all their different uh items that they sell the brownies the cookies uh the actual fruity rice krispies they all have different packaging so it's visibly super attractive um this actually has 98.7 milligrams in the whole bag um 9.87 milligrams of serving so what's weird about things is that and sometimes with edibles what people don't know is in in the state that it's up to 100 milligrams is the legal limit but all of the items don't actually have to have 10 milligrams per edible or 5 milligrams or 2.5 like they can all vary they can only just go up to 10 or 100 in a bag depending on you know how they were created so for this one 9.87 milligrams per crispy 98.7 milligrams for the whole bag the last bag that she bought recently actually had more than 100 milligrams in it so you guys can see kind of some of the variation there uh i believe it had 102 milligrams of thc in the last bag we bought whereas this is almost two milligrams shy of that on the back nutrition fact-wise they do have this cool little thing here like most food products um calories 62 there's 14.2 grams in here serving size there's 10 servings per container total fat 8.7 grams sodium 33 milligrams carbohydrates 13 grams sugars 9.3 grams and then i always like to go over the ingredients in edibles i think this is super important in today's society a lot of people are allergic to things and you know dating back to when i was a bud tender i really don't remember very many consumers coming in to ask me you know what the ingredients were and knowing out there just how you know there are a ton of people with allergies and stuff super important to know what products are made of so if you're a bud tender learn always read the ingredients on everything on this ingredient wise we're looking at marshmallows which are corn syrup sugar modified food starch corn gelatin water dextrose natural and artificial flavor tetra sodium pyrophosphate and then we've got puffed rice cereal which is rice sugar corn syrup and salt coconut oil unsalted butter granulated sugar cinnamon and thc distillate so this is a distillate edible product manufactured by tko products tko products.com for their website they got the warning label and that's really about it perforated edge shout out to them i don't have to use my teeth look at that and on both sides that one works there we go they've got the metric tag for me to scan it and voila oh my gosh the smell is incredible you guys can see in the bag there a bunch of little rice krispies here let me hold it right side up for y'all a bunch of little rice krispies in there so good so sweet can smell the butter can smell the cinnamon that smells so good okay one bite talk about it two bites score out of ten you guys know what's [ __ ] good ready to go so you guys know those little individually wrapped rice krispie treats that you know we used to get in elementary school those were addictive for a period of time the crunch the sweetness the texture the rice krispies all those things these are better than that the reason why they're better than that is they've got the addition of the cinnamon the cinnamon really brings out the churro flavor that they're going for but it also adds this little bit of like texture not necessarily grittiness but a little bit of texture to the rice krispie treat i don't know if it's because these are slightly doughy or i guess they're not doughy they're marshmallowy but i really feel like this is arguably the best rice krispie treat i've ever eaten and i know that's a huge statement obviously i'm an adult now so i'm not sitting here eating rice krispies treats all the time but when i think about my memories as a kid i always go back to the quantity that i've eaten and the best one i've ever eaten and this with the cinnamon on it way better two bites review out of ten so on the second on the second bite i didn't you don't lose any flavor it still tastes just as good as the first time i'm over here thinking about what what could make this experience better and overall i think when i think of edible companies and i think of how big this packaging is all i can really think of is how to maximize the real estate on this and so when it comes to edibles although this is already in final form i just find that companies that make food when they put recipes on the back it just ends up being much more engaging the more you can keep me hooked into your brand the more likely i am to buy it when with that said a score out of 10 i think i can really give these a 9.5 out of 10 and i have two reasons reason number one is what i just said i'd like to see more of this space utilized the way traditional companies in the regular world with regular world foods are using this stuff fun games information recipes etc i already see cannabis companies doing this specifically cookies cookies companies not the actual cookies company from burner but other cookies companies i've seen them utilize that with recipes making it home etc so i think that's to me that's a 0.25 right there and the other issue i have is inconsistency on the testing i do find i do understand that it is hard to be consistent but when you think about literally two three days ago we bought a bag of these from a different store it has 102 milligrams on it and this one that is listed at 98.7 milligrams and i'm paying the same price i just find that issue to be a little bit concerning you go to most stores you get the same thing every single time i understand it's a food but that's where we can continue to improve so consistency consistency consistency still one of the best products the taste the flavors immaculate the presentation would absolutely recommend 10 out of 10 across the board for every little thing except for i need some more information or a little bit of a guide uh and then i also need this to become consistent on the potency so i appreciate you guys for all the love vaping here

channel My name is J\u00fa. If you are new here welcome! and those who are always coming back, welcome and thank you for your support. And God bless you. In today's video, I will make a African dish for my husband and my son. It's our diner Chicken in peanut butter and okra and fufu and I will also make plantain, because they love it and I love it too. so I will show you the recipe. and also I will show you my husband reaction. Eating this dish. I already made food with okra food with chicken and okra, meat with okra, fish with okra. but I have never made with peanut butter, for him. So this will be his first time. So let's see how he will react. so let's go to the recipe. For this recipe, we will need chicken, seasoned to taste. eggplant cut into cubes and okra. I cooked the okra, to make it less slimy. tomatoes, onions and peanut butter which we call muamba de ginguba. In here, I cooked the chicken with bay leaf. then I fried it. This  is oil and add a spoonful of wheat flour when you add wheat flour in the oil you fried the chicken but the stove does not get dirty and now I am making tomatoes sauce, this is the base I make a lot because I'm going to take some, so I cane use it for the okra. and here I am adding garlic powder. then I added water. there it, is I took some. and here I will mix hot water with peanut butter, \"the muamba de ginguba\" and I will add it to the tomatoes sauce that I made and let it cook for 5 minutes, and keep mixing it. so it doesn't burn in the pan so here I decided to add more tomatoes. okay guys. I cook without measuring. Just as you can see. no mg... I don't have this 100 mg, of this or that. 50 mg, no I don't I just cook then I added water and the chicken. the water that left from cooking the chicken, I didn't throw it away because there is the salt and the seasoning taste. so, I added it to this pan there it is, as you can see. then add the eggplant and water. then let it cook, mild fire here is plus minus 10 minutes. I checked  how it was then I left it again for more than 15  minutes, until it thicken. and here I made the okra sauce. with the tomatoes sauce that I made earlier and the okra is pre cooked. I added a maggi cube and I cooked all for 10 minutes and there is the results. enjoy your meal and? yeah.. can someone help me cut this. that's chicken. there are no strange ingredients in it I also used eggplant. I can not even see courgette(zucchini) we already ate it. but today I had... I saw you cut it. that was eggplant it wasn't  zucchini eggplant Daddy like the food, and Christiaan? It's delicious. the vegetable is really delicious. It's delicious? and the okra? also Am I already growing? from the little bit you ate? from the little bit you ate? Okay guys so you just saw how it was. How Hubby reacted. He liked the food. so yeah! Here ends today's video I hope you like it. share, like kisses, bye Until next time.", "nMsAeMXsZBo": "[Music] well I had a duty folks and welcome to wait to the marijuana animal review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at another new product we doing a lot of new brands in products recently which I love gotta love that diversity today we are looking at another syrup or what they call an elixir we are taking a look at the chronic elixir in this fancy bottle I quite like their packaging nice glass bottle I like their branding like the whole thing chronic elixir 375 milligrams of THC in this tiny little 20 milliliter bottle 30 milliliter bottle I think so tiny little bottle to it they claim 375 milligrams of THC I hope that to be the case if that is in fact the case this is gonna be a great deal I believe this only cost me $15 maybe perhaps it was 20 I actually cannot remember which is a shame for sure it was 15 or 20 dollars I'm sorry I cannot remember the price off the top of my head either way it's gonna be a good deal if it's $15 it's an outrageously great deal at the dispensary I picked it up so let's hope for that and let's go ahead and open it up and just give it give a taste now I'm not gonna mix this one with anything for the first time we'll see how it goes and then if we like it we'll come back and review some more and new it with some mixing try to find a better way to to ingest it so ok here we go and if you guys have never tuned in two weeks before the way that our reviews work here is I'm gonna drink this up drink this whole product over the next couple of minutes finish it off sometime in the next few minutes and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm actually feeling because that's what you guys really care about in the edible review not really how it tastes but how [ __ ] up it gets you so I'll come back to you guys in two hours but of course it'll be just a couple of seconds for you through the magic of editing so let's shake well as suggested almost forgot that part okay we are well shook little cap on the top comes off this is the watermelon flavor and it smells of watermelon or watermelon flavored things I have no idea what to expect I assume it's not going to be good but we'll do it anyways down the hatch oh wow yeah ooh that is strong that is very strong strong cannabis tastes strong watermelon syrupy taste strong everything I mean it's not that much different than like the cannabis syrup taste you know what this is gonna taste like guys it's not gonna taste great I mean obviously it's not gonna taste great but it's this is not let's give it another sip I've had worse I've had worse it's still not good alright guys almost done here I'm gonna finish this off you can see I just got a little bit left in the bottle I'm gonna finish it off and then I'll come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching weights see you soon peace [Music] hi guys welcome back two weeks it's been two hours since I last checked in with you that's the two-hour mark since I had the product elixir watermelon 375 milligrams and I gotta say it is definitely not a 375 milligrams product and I find syrups to usually be quite potent for their milligram age this is less potent than say like a the cannabis 200 milligram edibles substantially so those cannabis edibles can get me up to like a set this 200 milligrams came up to like a seven and a half eight maybe eight and a half sometimes and I would say I'm maybe at a four to five range right now with this may be lower so yeah it's it is not living up to to the other syrups and things that I have tried is not as good not nearly as good the price was right for it or the price was right if it were 375 milligrams or even if it were 200 actual milligrams the price would been good at $15 but for what I feel for the price does not feel it's not it's not quite up to snuff I'm afraid so this is not a first good experience with chronic elixir I will maybe try to review some other products in the future to see if maybe this one was just an inconsistent thing but right now not not the best first impression that is the chronic elixir 375 milligram watermelon getting a thumbs down for me thank you so much for watching wheat skies and we will check you out on the later review peace", "nggv7yjDVpU": "hi guys I wanted to talk today a little bit about avocados they're really healthy and they are a healthy fat and there's something that our brain needs it's that healthy fat however did you know that a serving of avocado is 1/5 of an avocado so if you're the only one eating them in the house you're eating 5 times the recommended amount or 5 times the fat five times the calories even if you share them with one other person like I do my son will eat avocado with me I'm still getting you know two and a half times the amount that I should get so see these spreads this is a really really good way to get the healthy fat that we need at a minimum of the calories okay I got these at Aldi and if you look at the date I got them on the date that they were used by okay so they were half off and they were probably about to be thrown out so there's no oil in these things guys Hass avocados lime juice jalapeno peppers sea salt Hass avocados lime juice 2% less of garlic sea salt and dehydrated parsley no oil so if you can get these things real cheap like I did I got these at Aldi but I'm sure other stores has products similar to this this is a good way for us to get our avocado without getting too much fat and too many calories see this one has 70 calories per tablespoon Oh two tablespoons eighty calories per two tablespoons and seventy calories per two tablespoons so there you are so I stocked up on these I put one of each flavor in the fridge and stuck some more in the freezer and that way I know that I'm you know I these I just pulled out of the freezer just to show you because they've still got the package on them the one that I have in the fridge is half gone so I'm not worried at all about that used by date there's nothing wrong with them like I said I got them cheap because they were about to expire so just a little heads up to look for products like this that don't have any oil and it's a good way for us to get our healthy fats and get some avocado on some toast or whatever without really breaking the bake on our calories and our fat overload okay so have a good day hope you appreciate my little tips and if you do please do like the video and subscribe comments actually helped keep me in the algorithm so that's not a bad thing either have a good day", "QTvyWgnWG_4": "on this episode Tuesday March 15 2016 I'm working on my squats today restocking my supplements and how to read a nutrition label enjoy whats up youtube it is Tuesday 540 in the morning on my way to the gym got like day today then we'll be testing his one rep max for squats I will just be doing squats like normal just because again I still want to get this move down so there's no point in me trying to do one rep max when I'm not even really confident in my form yet so that's the plan for today so that will be interesting for him I know cuz he's never tested on one rep max on any lift so I know he's really excited and you know I'm excited for him and hopefully it'll be a good good day for him so we'll see what happens today my topic of the day is how to read a nutrition label because a lot of times people that I'm helping out like that you know they'll text me they'll be at the grocery store and they'll be like is this is this something that's good should I eat this you know are the macros on this good you know they'll snap it to me snapchat it to me or or take a picture and send it to be and so one thing I find you know is that a lot of people don't necessarily know how to read and use a nutrition label and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to play something that I'm going to film later but i'll play it right and a little bit here but i'll demonstrate how you can take a look at a nutrition label read it know exactly what it is you're consuming and then work that into your macros and then you'll see what I look for in certain foods and what I look for in nutrition labels for me to help judge whether or not it's a it's a macro friendly food if it's something that I want to keep with me especially from on a cut and I'm strict on my calories you know is it worth it is it a good food for me to take or is it something that's just going to kind of mess me up and set me up for failure so I'll do that and so I'll play that just in a second or so so I hope you enjoy it feel free to comment on any you know suggestions or things that you have regarding nutrition labels again this is a community i love this channel to be really interactive because I'd like for it to add value to the fitness community you know and hopefully we can grow together and learn together so that's it enjoy the segment and i'll catch you eyes on the next clip alright guys as promised i am going to show you how to read a nutrition label and what I look for in a nutrition label and hopefully this will help guide you when you're in the grocery store you're trying to find out well what's a good snack what what should I look for how do I know if this is macro friendly but again a disclaimer is that the beauty about macros is that and if you're tracking is that you can essentially eat whatever it is there is no there's no food restrictions with macros just realize that you have a limit and so as long as you stay within that limit you're ok now there are foods that have good macros and you'll see what I mean in a minute where you can eat more of it and it doesn't take up as much macros and it leaves you a lot of room so keep you full keeps you satisfied is good for the psychology and then there are foods that you are probably used to eating that are considered junk foods which you could still eat if you can fit into your macros however you probably have to eat much less of it and so it takes up a lot more of your macros and you're not eating as much and so while it might taste really good you're probably not going to be satisfied you're going to be hungry and overall it's probably not going to be good for your psychology especially as you're trying to cut and so I'm going to give you a look at some some items and tell you what I look for it we'll take it from there alright guys first thing I have here is a box of crispix okay and here's what we're going to look for first thing I always look for is a I look at calories right so if you look at the calories see here that there's a hundred and ten calories that's per serving and so what you gotta do is realize how big is the serving size well the serving size is right here one cup of 29 grams so what you would want to do is get a scale measure that out so that it says 29 grams and there you have your survey so that's how much you know would be at 110 calories is one cup about 29 grams okay one thing that I always gravitate towards is because when I'm tracking macros the one thing that I'm always trying to keep lowes my fat and so that's the first thing I usually look at I look at how much fat is in this and here you see that there's zero grams and that's a really good thing if it's something under 10 or even under 8 for serving and it's a decent size serving that I like that and I I tend to gravitate towards those types of foods and so if i come down next thing I look at is the protein I want to see how much proteins in this so not too many protein not too many grams of protein here only two grams but that's okay and then finally I look at the card so carbs quite a bit of carbs 25 grams okay so it's a lot of carbs right and normally people might think well carbs are bad not necessarily especially if you're active if you're training pretty actively as I am so I'm training about five days a week then carbs aren't going to be too big of a deal and so you don't need to worry about it too much what I like to pay attention to is the fat okay because that's exactly what we're trying to burn so the less that we can put on the better it is for us okay now there's a bunch of different theories where people say hi fat low carb is better and other people say no low fat higher carbs are better so there's a bunch of different theories bunch of different reasonings for why people believe in what they believe for me what I found to work what I actually what I believe in is is low fat so that's my theory that's what I go off of and so if you hold that same kind of mentality than this is going to be for you this is this is good for me and I know that I could have this for breakfast and I like Chris pic so this for me is a good is a good a good arsenal in my food supply so I keep this now let me show you something else here I have pretzel crisps which are another snack that I enjoy especially when I'm cutting and i'll give you another reason why okay first thing I look at is my fat zero grams here that's that's already a good sign now let me look at the calories only hundred calories right and that's per serving and so what's the serving about 28 grams or approximately 11 crackers now that's a decent amount it's not a lot but again for 11 crackers that's only 100 calories no fat okay and so that's that's already got my attention now if I come down okay obviously the carbs are again going to be a little higher so 24 grams of carbs and protein is about two grams so it's almost like the cereal that we had but this for me is a snack and so if I get hungry and I want something salty instead of chips i can grab these pretzel crisps because it's a hundred calories per serving no fat again I told you that I'm not too worried about the carbs because I am tracking it and so I'm still staying within my carbs and so this is okay for me and usually why I'm okay with carbs is because even at the end of the day which you'll see cards are usually the thing that I'm most under and so I'm never really worried about my cars because if I'm staying low in fat chances are the foods that I'm eating are going to be typically lower in carbs than if I was eating something that was higher in fat that's usually how it goes not always but usually that's the trend and so again this is a good snack for me because low calories no fat decent amount of carbs and so it's good it's going to give me energy and instead of grabbing chips this is a great alternative all right let me give you a look at one more thing okay now here's something that's seen usually as an thought of as something very healthy something you should eat and it's peanut butter now I will say on a bulk this is probably a really good food source for you however on a cut you might want to steer steer clear from this and I'll show you why so peanut butter is great because the thought is well there's lots of protein in it and that's true but let's look at the label and see if it's actually going to be good for us as far as tracking goes alright so this is a peanut butter right here all right now let's look the serving size here is two tablespoons so it's not that much okay and so here we look at it's a hundred and fifty calories just for two tablespoons so that's already quite a bit and that's uh and then if you look here look at the fat there's 12 grams of fat already in that in just 2 tablespoons carbs are pretty low diagrams and again protein a lot of people say it's high in protein but it's only six grams of protein so it's not terribly high or it's not it's not extraordinarily high which is what i'm trying to say so you know a lot of people say it's a good protein source it's not really a good protein source it's decent and it's you know it's it's got some health benefits you know I guess because its peanuts but really if you're just going by nutrition facts this is something that I probably wouldn't eat on a cut because again just two tablespoons okay so even if we were just to do 1 tablespoon that would cut everything in half all right so instead of 150 calories we'd only be taken in what 75 which isn't too bad okay but we'd still be taking in about 6 grams of fat for one tablespoon that's six grams of fat one tablespoon so for me that's quite a bit and I don't want to be putting on too much fat for that little amount of food if I'm going to be eating fat and it needs to be in high quantity needs to be a food that I'm eating a lot of and while the fat is still staying relatively low and so that's why peanut butter probably good for a bulk but it's something I definitely avoid on a cut okay so there you have it that's pretty much what I look for in a nutrition label again if you guys have questions or comments or like to know a little bit more about the nutrition labels then feel free to comment below again it's not it's not like I'm the set law of all of this stuff but this is what I found to work with me this is what I found based on research that I I believe in as far as the theory and the science behind it to stay low in fat to have high protein and to really just keep carbs moderate because if you're training hard you'll need those carbs and usually when i'm on a cut or bulk it doesn't really matter my protein and fats stay relatively the same it's my carbs that i play with and so if I lower my calories it's most likely me lowering my carbs and so as I'm on this cut what's going to happen is as I'm getting deeper into the cut my carbs are going to start to lower and i'll be taking less and less in but for now my carb intake is still decent still pretty high as I just started this cut but again as it goes deeper you'll start to see those carbs drop down so anyways you guys enjoyed that topic again feel free to comment below if you have any other questions but yeah so I'll catch you guys on the next clip all right today was squat day i'm just going to show you a lot of my squats I did six sets of five while Ben was testing for one rep max and really I am just really trying to get this moved down and you know I had a lot of sets that I still felt I was leaning forward tried different things to correct to try and correct it tried winding my stance tried angling my feet a little bit different and I still had some good reps a lot of bad ones but again I'm really trying to just feel the move so that one looked okay oh I'm just going to show you is that you know through it all I was working with 155 by the way so not a lot of weight again and in fact my last set i backed it down even more just to 135 because I really felt like I was still moving forward it's getting better I think and I'm starting to actually feel it a little more I think the problem is and what I think I'm going to work on as a mental Q is that I need to I think my chest is too upright and so it is a low bar squat and as a low bar squat the way the bar sits in order for it to move over the center of your foot you kind of do need to angle your back down a little bit more and I'm not used to that because I'm so used to doing high bar squat and so with a low bar it's a little bit different i'm so used to keeping my chest high that you know I'm it's it's messing me up a little bit and so what I did on the last set I actually exaggerated or in my head what felt like exaggerated my my forward lean and has been was watching me he actually said it looked good and we'll see it here in a little bit this is this is it right here I believe ya this is 135 I don't know if this is it yeah let's look yeah so there wasn't too bad see I move for a little bit here I think this is a really good rut right here yeah that was a good rep to me and so still keeping the chest high upper back tight but just exaggerating the lean a little bit more so I'm gonna try that again next time I again I'm in no rush i'm not going to increase weight i'm going to keep working with 155 ish 135 until I can feel it properly and then I'll start to worry about adding way but right now just all about the cues and I'm excited to keep practicing and getting better alright let's talk about Ben he's testing his one rep max so we started at 225 and just kept going up you worked his way up and he actually worked his way up to three plates now his depth wasn't all the way there ok but I wasn't I wasn't a hundred percent worried about that because the whole idea is just to get him used to putting that much weight up he's never tested before and so the fact that he was still able to grind it up even though his form was not the greatest and you can see there this was just that that was the last wait right there so that was 325 and we stopped there and so it wasn't the best form wise but for him to still be able to grind it out that was a great PR for him and so we're excited now we're gonna work with that I told them when we start working with submaximal weights that's when he can really dial in his form and his his technical moves will get better but at least to be able to know that he can actually push that weight up it's good for him and now he can work with that so then while he was still taking breaks and stuff I went on to do leg curls three sets of ten and then finally just standing calf raises I did four sets at eight with just a plate on each side to 135 total and then after ben was done i just had him do one amrap set with two plates on each side because his calves are beasts and so anyways it was that was the workout even though it was only a few moves it did take an hour and a half and so it's great hope you guys enjoyed it I'll post the entire thing and see you all on the next court alright what's up guys lunch time I got my chicken seven ounces right here I ran out of rice so I have to use a hamburger bun so one hamburger bun so that's about a hundred and thirty calories I put it into my fitness pal which you'll see later on in the video but yeah so this is going to be my lunch just got to improvise my carbs and that'll be it alright guys this protein time it is about five o'clock gonna have this and I've been eating some troll EXO I put that in my fitness pal as I was working and so kind of just to have have it as a hold over until we eat dinner so and i have this hopefully gonna get some more quest bars because this is my last one too so I'm completely out need to reopen some protein snacks and then we'll have dinner alright guys we are here at TGI Fridays I'm gonna have some dinner some friends and then we're going to do some grocery shopping alright guys what's up end of the night did some grocery shopping went the sands went to walmart I've got some good stuff spent a lot of money on groceries but I also want a supplement store by me called nutrishop and I'll show you what I got there three up on some quest bars are s'mores mint chocolate chip got some more creatine because I was running out and what I'm going to switch to for my pre-workout for this cut c4 ripped which is what i use before so i'm going to switch to that starting tomorrow since I ran out of my Pap test bulk and since I am going to be cutting now something a little more thermogenic so that's what I'm going to be using and so LMK give you my fitness pal update see here we go so today like every morning after my workout i have my post workout protein shake for lunch i had seven ounces of grilled chicken with a hamburger bun because i had no more rice which i bought some more by the way today during work I had trollee eggs about 30 pieces also had a protein bar the pure protein chocolate deluxe and then for dinner at fridays i had the mahi-mahi there and i also had some broccoli which i didn't put on here and some jasmine rice broccoli it's about 30 calories but not to worry about it since it is not that much on there no fat hardly any carbs that's not a big deal but i also did have oreo madness for dessert which is cool because i was able to fit it in the oriole madness isn't that bad compared to some of the other desserts and i shared a few bites with marissa and so i didn't have a quite a full serving but pretty close to it and that's pretty much it so tonight i was going to have some trollee eggs but it's pretty late and i want to get as much rest as i can because tomorrow we're going to test OHP so i'm just going to have scoop of casein to finish out my protein and that should be it but i'll give you a look at my nutrients today protein I hit it went over by about 5 grams so not not bad they're carbs I'm wonder by 50 grams and fat i'm wondering by 13 grams so overall still within my macros i wish i could have got a little more cards in i may have something before I go to bed but if not thats that's alright but i'm going to try to get some sleep because we got a big day tomorrow and going to be testing my HP early in the morning so that should be interesting excited to do that but that's it for today again thank you for watching please like share and subscribe and i will see you guys on the next video peace", "Cg8sHiwFfSU": "hey guys welcome back this is Tarun again back with another Fitness video for you folks so today I want to talk about this toaster on you know testosterone you know the mail you know the Porton male hormone and how you guys can increase your testosterone levels naturally you know I'm not going to be talk again guys I'm not going to be talking about synthetics I'm not going to be talking about steroids you know because you know steroids are synthetic hormones which which synthetic testosterone hormones so if this video will be all about you increasing your testosterone levels naturally because just imagine guys testosterone is the mother or rather father of our muscle building properties if you have more testosterone more testosterone means more muscles so what can you actually do to increase testosterone in your body now guys you know I'm sure you know there are tons and tons of videos online available you know talking about different things how you can do things you know to increase your testosterone levels naturally but you know when I did my research I found out that you know most of these articles are more misleading than they actually help us you know so in this video I will be kind of simplifying things for you especially for Indian males you know because you know we don't have access to you know foreign food so we don't have access to you know American order or European food items you know which will increase our testosterone through food so here in this video I'll be talking this is more of an Indian perspective how you can increase your testosterone naturally the distortion remains the same for males across the globe about you know in terms of what you can do to increase your testosterone level so let's start so number one what can you do so first of all guys you know if your goal is to increase your testosterone or if your goal is to pack on more muscle first thing you really need to understand and and respect which is the fact that you know you have to eat and what you have to eat I'm not going to be talking about protein no protein is a given obviously the routine is a building block of muscles you have to have X amount of protein obviously there is going to be carbs as well card is something that you need for a sustained supply but for your increase testosterone levels what you really need to focus on is eating more fat you heard me right guys you know you have to eat more fine when I say more fat I really don't mean that you know you go out you know to KFC or you go to McDonald's and start eating junk and you know load your body with sodium salt no you have to eat good amount of fat you know good kinds of air one of those fats you know so I'll tell you some of the things that you can include in your diet which can actually help you for example almonds you know bodom you know I mean you know I'm sure you must have seen a lot of people like a lot of old school guys you know your mother or your father you know where I could be go around pick okay so they know the super Thums overnight so that you could have it in the morning that's also a good practice you could have per them peanuts you know another one you know peanut butter you can also have another thing you know avocados you know dry fruits so you've got to pound on all these things you know because these are the these are the kind of facts that will actually help you back on or probably increase your testosterone levels you know because you really don't have to minimize your fat because what will happen is if you were to eliminate fat from your diet especially when you're training not only your Liberty will go down and libido is one of the key component that you will see like just imagine guys if you're training hard if you're working out heavy in the gym you're lifting heavy but if your sex drive is low that's quite a sign for you to tell you that you know what your testosterone levels are not working or they're not going in the right direction which means you really have to add fats in your diet guys you can't just be eating protein all day long you can't be just having carbs before you work out you've got to have back and good kind of fat and I told you kind of ads that you can actually look at having number two you know the other thing that I've realized that you can actually I mean this is the this this point is more from a supplementation perspective that you know probably one of a natural test boosters you can add a show than you know you can add you know another supplement that I really recommend you folks you know that you can actually look at adding is called as ma you know zinc magnesium and Daniel there's another east and for something else you know I call it GMA I think in a google everywhere you can just do that you know and Zed am a something known to increase your testosterone and this is something that you can take it before going off to sleep in about a tab or two this will have some properties here but if you don't want to invest in sedima because they will cost you somewhere between 1,500 to 2,000 rupees you can also invest you know in something called a 10x10 takes is an Indian a natural test booster it's again Ayurvedic you know made by Himalayas you know it has again a potency of I think about 100 mg you know you can take one tablet before going off to sleep or two and you know when I say test boosters the test boosters does not mean that you know it's only when you have a low testosterone diet that you have to take even if you're in your 20s you can still get some benefit of testosterone you know these natural textboxes which can help you pack on more muscle because just imagine more tests will make you which means you can lift heavy and when you can lift heavy obviously you know the heavy lift will actually help you back on more muscle that's the idea guy so you really don't have to worry that oh I'm in my twenties I'm going to can I take test boosters this you can i mean it is natural it's Ayurvedic it's herbal so obviously there is no side effect to it and you know probably you're just taking one or two before going off to sleep and always remember guys test boosters have to be taken before going off to sleep after your meal because that's the time when they actually work because when you sleep that's the time when you're releasing your growth hormones that's the time when you're actually increasing your testosterone levels so as a thumb rule whatever you do as a test booster any test book says that you take natural and whatever you got to take it before going off to sleep so always remember that number three from a training perspective now you really am sure you know when you are looking at increasing your testosterone level always ensure that you add one multi-joint exercises in every workout of yours now I've talked about multi-joint exercises in my previous video so what exactly are those exercises a multi-joint exercises which includes all all joints put together for example a bench press is a classic example of multi joint you know a deadlift you know probably a squat you know or probably a squat so this include one of these exercises in your workout guys because what we'll do is especially and if you're if you really want to increase your testosterone levels you don't guys start focusing on your legs you know and this is something that I I hate to acknowledge that you know I had and you know because I had injury with my legs and you know my legs were lagging and in that time period that when my legs weren't as developed as my torso my testosterone levels were also fairly low so what you would realize is that you know because I've seen Indian males especially most of the guys that I work with teenagers you know everybody almost everybody they pretty much focus on their upper body and the legs are always a lagging part mine was a lagging part and it still is at at some level for a simple head because I'm healing from an injury and once I recover from it and I'll start working on my legs too but if you are not injured if your legs are absolutely fine guys start training them because you know if you train your legs more often when I say training legs I mean at least twice a week you got to do squats you got to do leg extension you got to do leg press you know these are the exercises which will increase your testosterone levels naturally guys you know please do not include oh not do not ignore your legs because more legs you can just pick up any biggest body builder pick up a pick up any biggest fitness model you see that these guys have great legs you know right from Steve cooks of the word to sergi constance with lazar angelov all these guys you know the reason why they are muscular the reason you know the way they look they are because the fact that you know they focus also more on their lower body part which is their legs and legs are one of the reasons which will increase your testosterone levels naturally so remember guy that's some training perspective also you know if you were an another perspective that you can bring in your training when it comes to increasing your testosterone level is the fact that you know you can minimize your rest periods you know when you're working out you know usually I've seen people resting for about 2 minutes or 1/2 minutes no you know you should not focus more on volume you should focus more on getting the quality workout 45 minutes 1 hour boom your workout is over move out of the gym you know do not waste too much time guys please do not you know the idea for you is to get quick workouts you know shorts word quick workout and the last point my personal favorite which will help you increase your testosterone levels naturally is guys sleep sleeping you know I can talk more about it you know it's it's more it works like a tripod guys you know one on the one stand supports your diet the other stand supports your training in the third stand supports rest and recovery sleep so if any of these stands you know it's it's unstable you know you're not going to get your results you have to compromise on your results so whatever you do if your stress levels are high whatever it is you know you've got to ensure that you sleep sleep enough you know at least six to eight hours remember guys the more you sleep you know the chances of you developing and are increasing your testosterone levels are also very has something I'm going to share with you you can probably imbibe it if in your daily a routine just see if it's feasible or not and in the afternoon after your food whatever you take try to sleep for at least ten to fifteen minutes like more of a power nap what will it do is man it's hot seed Ellie's getting hot so try to get those a fifteen minutes because those fifteen minutes will really rejuvenate you and help you with your testosterone levels guys so these are some of the points that I wanted to clarify and also if you see why am i sweating a lot of people have been asking me the third why do so a lot is because you don't know I have also no lights you know camera lights facing me and I also talked a lot you know I know a nurse when I when I talk I kind of I'm very expressive I usually don't have a script you know I pretty much express my thoughts and you know my my experience with you folks so and also you gotta understand I've done a video on sweating I also have many sweat glands that's the reason I sweat guys if you're wondering why am I doing this by myself I do I sweat so much here's your answer to that so I hope guys this is this video is helpful for you to understand you know how you can increase your testosterone levels naturally and you want a few who have any questions around this feel free to reach out to me either on my youtube facebook or on my Instagram and I'll be very happy to help you with your testosterone goals until we meet again peace", "7zfxWszCc8w": "the point I'm trying to make is we care about the oceans our hearts are breaking for what's happening in the oceans we got to do something about it this and and and we're always talking about what are the action items when we make a documentary you know what are we asking people to do what are the changes they can make in their daily life well I'm going to tell you one I watched that film four silver knives I went into the kitchen I took everything out of the kitchen that was not a plant it's amazing but setting aside the health benefits how often do you get that kind of incredible win-win where you can really transform the planet and it's possible you got to check the facts for yourselves you're not gonna believe it hearing it from me but I want to challenge everybody here if you're an environmentalist I say my challenges you can't be an environmentalist you can't be an ocean steward without truly walking the walk and you can't walk the walk in the world of the future the world ahead of us the world of our children not eating a plant-based diet that's my challenge you can check the facts for yourselves and anyway without using any gas or oil or fuel ever again from this day forward we would still exceed our maximum carbon equivalent greenhouse gas emissions now the 565 gigatons by the year 2030 without the electricity sector even or energy sector even factoring in the equation all simply by eating raising an eating livestock if you reduce the amount of methane emissions the level in the atmosphere go down goes down fairly quickly and within decades as opposed to co2 if you reduce the emissions to the atmosphere you don't really see a signal in the atmosphere for 100 years or so the single largest contributor to every known environmental ill known to humankind deforestation land-use water scarcity the destabilization of communities world hunger the list doesn't stop the leading cause of environmental destruction is animal agriculture in 1812 there are 1 billion people on the planet in 1912 there are 1.5 billion then just 100 years later our population exploded to 7 billion humans this number is rightly given a great deal of attention but an even more important figure when determining world population is the world 70 billion farm animals humans raise the human population drink's 5.2 billion gallons of water every day needs 21 billion pounds of food but just the world's 1.5 billion cows alone drink 45 billion gallons of water every day and eat a hundred and thirty-five billion pounds of food this isn't so much a human population issue it's a human eating animals population issue we're growing enough food right now in the world to feed between 12 and 15 billion people we only have 7 billion people we have roughly a billion people starving every single day worldwide 50% of the grain and legumes that were growing were feeding to animals so they're eating huge amounts of green and legumes in the United States it's more like closer to 70 80 depending on which grain it is 90 about 90 percent of the soybean 82 percent of the world's starving children live in countries where food is fed to animals in the livestock systems that are then killed and eaten by more well-off individuals in developed countries such as the US UK and in Europe raising cattle produces more greenhouse gases than all cars trucks trains boats planes combined 13% compared to 18% for livestock this is because cows produce a substantial amount of methane from their digestive process methane gas from livestock is twenty five to a hundred times more destructive than carbon dioxide from vehicles hydraulic fracturing for natural gas uses an incredible amount of water a staggering a hundred billion gallons of water is used every year in the United States but when I compare this with animal agriculture raising livestock just in the u.s. consumes 34 trillion gallons of water and it turns out the methane emissions from both industries are nearly equal the average Californian uses about 1500 gallons person per day about half of that is related to the consumption of meat and dairy products so meat and dairy products are incredibly water intensive in part because the animals are using very water intensive grains that's what they they eat and so all of the water embedded in in the grain and that the animal leaves essentially is is considered part of the virtual water footprint of that product I found out that one quarter pound hamburger requires over 660 gallons of water to produce here I've been taking these short showers trying to save water and to find out just eating one hamburger is the equivalent of showering two entire months so much attention is given to lowering our home water use yet domestic water use is only 5% of what is consumed in the US vs. 55% for animal agriculture that's because it takes upwards of 2,500 gallons of water to produce one pound of beef when I added up all the government's recommendations I was saving 47 gallons a day but still that's not even close to the 660 gallons of water for just one burger I started doing more investigating on the impacts of livestock and found out this situation was actually worse than I had thought in 2009 two advisors from the World Bank released an analysis on human induced greenhouse gases finding that animal agriculture was responsible not for eighteen percent as UN stated but was actually 51 percent of all greenhouse gases 51 percent yet all we hear about is burning fossil fuels this devastating figure is due to clear cutting rainforests for grazing respiration and all the ways to animals produce this makes animal agriculture the number one contributor to human caused climate change a hundred and sixteen thousand pounds of farm animal excrement is produced every second in the United States alone livestock operations on land has caused more than father created more than 500 nitrogen flooded dead zones around the world in our oceans comprise more than 95 thousand square miles of areas completely devoid of life so any meaningful discussion about the state of our oceans has to always begin by frank discussions about land animal agriculture methane production from cows and other livestock flatulence is a major contributor but mostly it is due to deforestation in the waste they produce which is a hundred and thirty times more waste than the entire human population virtually all without the benefit of any waste treatment the UN reported that three-quarters of the world's fisheries are overexploited fully exploited or significantly depleted due to overfishing the oceans are under siege like never before and marine environments are in trouble and if we don't wake up and do something about it we're gonna see fishless oceans by the Year 2048 that's the prediction from scientists the way fishing is done today to feed the demand for 90 million tons of fish is primarily through massive fish nets for every single pound of fish caught there's up to five pounds of untargeted species trapped such as dolphins whales sea turtles and sharks known as Mike Hill an acre of rainforest is cleared every second and the leading cause is to graze animals and grow their feet crops that is essentially an entire football field cleared every single second and it is estimated that every day close to a hundred plant animal and insect species are lost due to rainforest destruction it is estimated that palm oil is responsible for 26 million acres being cleared though compared to livestock in their feed crops they were responsible for a hundred and thirty six million acres of rainforest lost today no matter how many of these operations I was doing for women for breast cancer I wasn't doing one single thing for the next unsuspecting victim so dr. Esselstyn started investigating the global statistics on breast cancer one of the facts he discovered was that the incidence of breast cancer in Kenya was far lower than it was in the United States in fact in 1978 the chances of a woman getting breast cancer in Kenya were 82 times lower than in the u.s. dr. Esselstyn was even more surprised by the numbers he discovered for some other types of cancer in the entire nation of Japan in 1958 how many autopsy proven deaths were there from cancer the prostate 18:18 in the entire nation that to me was about the most mind-boggling public health figure that I I think I'd ever encountered in the same year the US population was only about twice the size of Japan's yet the number of prostate cancer deaths exceeded 14,000 dr. Esselstyn also discovered that in the early 1970s the risk for heart disease in rural China was 12 times lower than it was in the US and in the highlands of Papa New Guinea heart disease was rarely encountered the link he noted between all the areas he studied was simple virtually the Western diet was non-existent they had no animal products they had no dairy no meat the results were consistent nutrients from animal foods promoted cancer growth while nutrients from plant foods decreased cancer growth yet Campbell hadn't identified a specific biological mechanism that caused the effects he observed and I finally occurred to me that there is no such thing as the mechanism what we were looking at was a symphony of mechanisms we think that nutrition is attributed to individual nutrients and that's the way gets marketed and that's the way the companies tell us so forth well in fact nutrition all that working together to create a symphony the hundreds of thousands of different kinds of chemicals and food all kind of working out nicely I mean the complexity is total heart disease as far as I'm concerned is an absolutely toothless paper tiger that need never ever exist and if it does exist it need never ever progress it turns out there's a successful movement of sustainable animal alternative food producers based right here in California funded by big names like Bill Gates and biz stone when you imagine all those egg-laying hens eating all that soy and all that corn you have an energy conversion ratio at about 38 to one whereas alternatively you can find plants and you can grow those plants and you can convert those plants in the food and the energy conversion ratio for the plants that we're using to replace the eggs is about two to one compared to 38 to one for eggs so our explicit goal is to have the maximum amount of impact by creating this new model that makes the global egg industry entirely obsolete we're making the Omega products improving that we can make better tasting food that's great for you and it takes one twentieth of the land and resources that dairy do if I could tell you that you could have the fiber structure of meat the satiating bite of meat the protein and all the nutritional benefits of meat without actually having animal protein itself and by doing that you could address climate change you could address the human health epidemics that we're seeing you could address in welfare and you could rest natural resource conservation would you make the change to feed a person on an all plant-based vegan diet for a year requires just one sixth of an acre of land to feed that same person on a vegetarian diet that includes eggs and dairy requires three times as much land to feed an average US citizens high consumption diet of meat dairy and eggs requires 18 times as much land this is because you can produce 37 thousand pounds of vegetables on one and a half acres but only 375 pounds of meat on that same plot of land I also learned the comparison doesn't end with land use a vegan diet produces half as much co2 as an American omnivore uses 111th the amount of fossil fuels one-thirteenth the amount of water and an eighteenth of the amount of land after adding this all up I realized I had the choice every single day to save over 1,100 gallons of water 45 pounds of grain 30 square feet of forested land the equivalent 20 pounds of co2 and one animal's life every single day you realize 75% of Americans consider themselves to be environmentalist you don't think we couldn't solve this problem in a heartbeat I'll tell you what all we would need is for the environmentalists to live what they profess and we'd be on a new course in the world when you take the animal out well you also take the greenhouse gas issue well and you take the food safety issues out and you take some of the other externalities related to food scarcity but one thing that's amazing is I think you put our values back in you put values like compassion and integrity and kindness values that are natural to human beings you put that in you build that back into the story of our food renewable energy infrastructure such as building solar and wind generators all over our country to reduce climate change I mean that's that's a pretty good idea but it's projected to take at least 20 years and at least minimally 18 trillion dollars to develop that we don't really have 20 years and we really don't have 18 trillion dollars to develop these so so another solution to climate change we could we could stop eating animals and it could be done today it doesn't have to take 20 years and it certainly doesn't have to take 18 trillion dollars because it cost nothing", "V5GW2CArT10": "Stanny from conscious calisthenics here so yeah I wanted to just ask janessa a bit about her journey with one meal a day which she started around three months ago if remember correct yes around early May she started it and yeah first I wanted to ask you like what made you want to go towards one meal a day many reasons mostly because I was intrigued by the benefits of it like and fat loss and increase in muscle mass and just overall like mental clarity and energy and improvements on digestion and I'm willing to try anything when it comes to improving my health and so I thought that I would just try it out and see how it worked for me yeah did you find it was quite hard to get started on this journey or not no I found it to be pretty easy but I think that was because one I was with somebody that obviously was saying really into it already and it came very easy and so being around somebody that's already in that flow made it really easy for myself - yeah I'd do it for myself and also experimented with intermittent fasting and so making the switch from that - Oh mad cuz also a lot easier because I think when you're eating multiple meals and then you go - Oh mad like I think it's a lot harder for the body to adjust in general yeah when you're in like three meals a day and snacks in between so when you say you was doing like intermittent fasting in the past what type of enemy and fasting was you're doing sustaining different types mostly the sixteen eight but where you fall you're up to sixteen hours and then eating within a eight window period but honestly like I wasn't very consistent with doing it every single day like some days I would do it and some days I wouldn't and sometimes I would you know eat certain things that weren't truly in a fasted state like I would have like coffee with like sugar and stuff I would like fast the rest of the day and so I wasn't really yea consistent with like doing intermittent fasting every single day correctly yeah and he was doing some things that are breaking out and fastest though about realizing it which a lot of people make that mistake with enemy and fasting so yeah how is your experience been we're doing it for the last three months roughly I really enjoy it I like the simplicity of it and the free time that it gives me because I'm not focused so much on one getting food or thinking about like all my meals and what I'm going to do to prepare for it and I noticed that improvements in digestion were definitely a lot better from the beginning of my journey until now yeah I think the biggest benefit that I have enjoyed with one meal a day is the freedom that I have around just eating in general like I have a lot more time to do the things that I'm passionate about and not worry about my meals and like what I'm gonna eat throughout the day and also I was very surprised by the amount of energy that I have in the day with fasting for an extended amount of time and I really enjoy not only the energy throughout the day but also like during training like I noticed I can just work out really really hard and I think that's because obviously I don't have food digesting in my system and so I really like that aspect and you find that your kava Foster from training sessions I really hard as well definitely and that's yeah that's also a really good benefit like I tend to not really get too sore or tired after a really intense workout and more so often I have even more energy like after the training session yes pretty surprised oh there's some some pretty significant amazing benefits as well and what some of the mistakes that you've done on one meal day if any for that matter of fact definitely overeating to the point of discomfort especially in the beginning because I had a little bit of a fear of like under eating and so I was just like really pushing myself to eat as much as possible yeah and I think as well because I Z in yeah yeah it's a I mentioned a bit about that multiflora going to what I'm gonna mention yes I think with also one meal a day I was just giving myself permission to eat whatever I wanted because I thought that it wouldn't really affect me that badly so I was eating a lot of like more high fat high salt processed foods and it was definitely affecting me in a negative way yeah to get away of it because I can but her digestion wasn't as optimal as mine it's still pretty good digestion but still not as good as mine and yeah you also found certain foods were just over stimulating if I remember correctly so you were just over eat more and more and more they said just made you feel bad and also I think being around me with the in loads and loads of calories and be able to do it and not affect me in a negative way I think that was also a contributing factor for her eating more would you agree or not yes so yeah a lot of people when they watch me they're like wow you can eat so many calories and they try to do and they can't do it and then they think they can't stand by me of doji's that reason but just eat the amount of calories that you need just to the point of satiation yeah you know it's a negative X like she has so from your own experience we have one meal a day for three moments of what would be your tips to people that are new on this journey or are finding it hard to succeed on the one meal a day diet I think listening to your body is like the most important thing and just taking notice as to when your body is like going really deep into a stress response because it's fasting it's like you are putting stress on your body and if it's like if you're not feeling good then I would say stop immediately and go back to either intermittent fasting or whatever feels best for you until your body gets kind of adjusted to eating one meal a day but what would you say if it's detoxification symptoms would you be able to tell the difference between the two and whether you need to push for it and do things additional to help your body detoxify itself or not I think yeah making sure that you are taking the right supplements and eating the right kind of diet to help help your body with any detox symptoms that you may be experiencing yeah I'm making sure you're well hydrated as well to remove toxins and just doing other things to kind of detox the body like exercising and sleeping enough and maybe doing other things to help your body detox yeah going to the sauna you know coffee enemas or saltwater flushes is so many different methods out there that can help rejoice those detoxification symptoms and yeah Genesis just asked me how do you actually know the difference between it's detox centers or not and something that I'm an expert on is detoxification because I've done loads this for years and I coached people on this and sometimes you're not going to know when but what I say is if you're not feeling so good ask yourself did I sleep enough did it go to bed too late am i hydrated enough did I enough calories the day before when he in my one meal a day and trying new some things to detoxification a lot of times detoxification symptoms can be fatigue headaches acne diarrhea even constipation can be various other different ones and what I'd say is with detoxification symptoms they shouldn't last for like weeks on end they may last up to a week or four days and days and days if they still don't go away after that sort of time period then you could say maybe one more day is not working for you or it may just be running to some nutritional deficiencies or other things so it's not necessary one meal a day to blame and what would you say for your own personal experience about people and hunger a lot of people said have hunger issues I noticed that most the time when I am feeling hungry most the time it's I'm either dehydrated or bulled yes the board I'm just looking for something to consume and once I was properly hydrated and just feeling my day with things to pretty much just keep me busy or active yeah then you enjoyed yeah that I enjoyed that really food was not on my mind at all and there really was no hunger yeah and it's a lot of people just want to seek pleasure from their food and get that instant gratification from it and they got this satisfaction with inside of themselves so yeah I highly recommend doing this thing she's definitely just mentioned yes and I come from a past of like food addiction and so I definitely think that omote helps me to kind of not think about food all be like okay I'm committing to this lifestyle and that pretty much helps me yeah not yeah yes you say that it definitely helps with overcoming food addictions would you say the unlike food binging yeah which so many people have issues with them a lot of people think Vinny meant fasting that it will not be a good thing to do when you've got issues like that going on what about in relation to weight loss how do weight loss journey been so far so I noticed that in the beginning there was significant weight loss but I didn't really notice it specifically until I measured myself because when I was weighing myself I didn't really see that much of a drastic change but then when I measured myself I saw that I had actually lost weight like especially around my midsection and you measured yourself at the start didn't you like relatively early on and yeah when you then checked it a later date you noticed some significant improvement especially around your belly area wasn't it yes and yeah what has happened since that point forward for the rest of the free month journey we won we were de and the weight loss so I noticed that the weight loss kind of stopped in a way and then I was thinking that I wasn't really making any progress is kind of just staying the same but then when I measured myself there actually was change but then also with like the weight when I weighed myself I noticed that it was relatively staying the same but I also think that because I'm doing calisthenics and weight training that there's an increase in muscle mass so in general I think that it's much beneficial for you to measure yourself rather than weigh yourself because muscle weighs more than fat and so you can see that your weight is kind of staying the same but obviously like there are changes you just can't really tell if you're away yourself yeah and this is what I recommended to her to do is actually do the measurements because a lot of people people can be cutting their excess body fat and the check scales and they don't notice any changes or it may even go up a bit or just slightly down but yes she said she's doing calisthenics exercises which I found a lot of people that need to lose body fat and gain muscle at the same time that a lot of time the weight cannot change much because as you mentioned be gaining muscle mass at the same time as reducing body fat percentage which I did that with calisthenics and one meal a day combined so some people can freak out check the scows and be long not losing anyway and I've had a lot of people sell it to me and it's just like yeah take those measurements and also take some photographic evidence as well so you can compare yourself we've new photos from the present moment with those are ones and you can then see if you've had any difference with the weight loss benefits or one meal a day and also if I remember correctly you're also stalled with your weight loss benefits as well and then you started taking a specific supplement which started aiding in your weight loss even further didn't you yeah which team is three indoor carbonyl which is naturally found in cruciferous vegetables and do you know what it does exactly or should I explain it to them what actually happened when you started taking it definitely shrinkage midsection and I'm not quite sure if it was like that loss or just like reducing water retention but I know that dim helps with regulating estrogen in the body and that's about all I know yes so it gets rid of excess estrogen metabolites that are not beneficial for you at all it doesn't at City lower beneficial estrogen that's habits within the body because a lot of people have generations within the body that come from plastic sources which a lot of people drinking bottled water have microwave meals and getting generations in all types of forms on a regular basis in the body so people become more each and dominant when you're more Eastern dominant testosterone levels go down and then what happens muscle mass goes down what our attention goes up and your fat mass goes up as well so this is saying are highly recommended to her and how much is you taking in how often just in case anyone wonders I'm taking it once a day one capsule and yeah because these kids have it we'll be able to maximize the absorption and I will put links down below this and also I will put a link down below for her video where she talks about that experience in more details and depth and for anyone wondering out there what type of diet he in combination with one meal a day what yeah diet have you been in Whole Foods plant-based diet yeah which is also known as a vegan diet for anyone that doesn't know what a Whole Foods plant-based vegan diet is but it's where you eat mostly plant foods in their whole form not process you have some process things here and there yeah and would you say everyone needs to be in that way to be in one meal a day and how comes the you do in combination with one meal a day well I just resonate more with the vegan lifestyle I don't want to consume any animal products due to the ethical side and moral side but also I just find that overall I enjoy eating plant-based because it improves my energy and just makes me feel the most alive in the most vibrant yeah and does it help optimize your digestion and digest it improves digestion helps my sleep pops with muscle recovery there's just so many benefits and I just really enjoy eating yeah and what would you say for people that are finding they got digestive issues of one meal a day say like they got constipation and just their digestion slowing down it's saying you experienced a lot yeah I did experience it at first but I found with consistently doing it that it actually improved and so I think it's just your body adjusting to this new way of eating and that with time it'll improve yeah and what you doing anything new on your like diet journey and with the enemy and fasting like one meal a day that could have helped improve your digestion as well yes including fermented foods and a good probiotic completed into your diet yeah and you've been taking a lot more supplements as Wertheim member correctly yes that as well to just improve my or overall bacteria because if you do not have good bacteria you if anyone that is interested in the pro bite that she's just mentioned I put links down below for UK US and worldwide supplies I use it myself as well and it's the one I use of my clients it's just a really good high quality probiotic and yeah for many foods even like amazing to use in addition as you just mentioned because they just have an abundance of different bacteria as oh well and these there anything else you'd like to add before we end this video that you haven't already shared with people I would say if you're interested in doing one meal a day but you're kind of afraid or hesitant to trying it I would say just do as much research as you possibly can so that you're confident that Oh Matt is right for you yeah my last thing I'd add II find people to froggen on it and learn from them what they're doing and what I do is I put a link down below for a channel she also offers coaching if you're interested you can find a contact details for a YouTube channel she really knows what she's doing from my own personal experience and the information I've taught her and from the resources that she's learned online to make one meal a day work the best for her so

number 28 and he actually sent me a PDF of a team a list of foods that you can eat and certain protocols what you should do when you have team al and I wanted to share this for people and also share a link so if you need even watch the entire video you can at least look at the link and look at the PDF yourself so this is from the University College London hospitals and it says dietary information for adolescents and adults with trimethylaminuria calling restricted diet now within this PDF not only do they talk about diet they also talk about other things like they they explain what trimethylamine trimethylamine manuia is what causes team now primary team al clinical met a management and here it talks about like different things you can try to do like it tells you you know first off limit choline and lecithin restricted diet now lecithin I have never really heard too much before so I had to look it up and let me see if I'm in the right one lecithin right here it says that lecithin is a fad that is essential in the cells of the body it can be found in many foods including soy beans and egg yolks lecithin is taken as a medicine is also used in manufacturing of medicines lecithin is used for creating memory just is true used for treating memory disorders such as dementia Alzheimer's disease it's also used for gallbladder disease liver disease certain types of depression high cholesterol anxiety and a skin disease called eczema some people apply it lecithin to the skin as a moisturizer I also went to medical news today to try to figure out what types of foods typically are in lecithin to have high amount Celestin and at the bottom says food sources it is advisable to choose lecithin from food sources before considering supplement forms lecithin is found in many whole foods including or meat red meats seafood eggs cooked green vegetables such as brussel sprouts and broccoli legumes such as soy beans kidney beans and black beans so that's interesting but let's continue to reading so they also talk about the different types of antibiotics and the names of the antibiotics you should probably get and also talks about you should actually use probiotics after a short course of antibiotics then it talks about like using charcoal and chlorophyll to absorb it let's read just some some of this stuff these can be useful in the management of team mail by binding some of the free choline and teammate in the gut and allowing it to be excreted rather than absorbed in the body research has shown that taking these supplements will reduce free urinary TMA suggesting that they can help with symptom control and here are some links to where they go to body minton alone I also talked about riboflavin and it tells you to take about between 90 to 200 milligrams a day but let's go to the diet let's go to the diet you can read all this yourself within the link hopefully I provide it if I don't provide a link tell me so I can't but here's this this diet there's like a green Lesar green lysander list and then the red the switches do not as it's advised to not it's consumed or consumed in very little amounts but let's go through the green list so with fruit it says all fruits except those listed on the amber list will go to the amber list very soon vegetable is the same but then it goes into Milton and milk products and talks about you can eat creamer or consume creamer sorry and Kashi's cream cheese cheddar cheese wow that's good oats rice or coconut milk Wow you could drink you can drink milk I never drink oat milk before well fats and oils margarine butter and vegetable oil spreads without added lecithin and choline oil olive sunflower canola corn and what breads and stuff you can eat anything well almost anything white bread plain potato crisps I guess those are just potato chips spaghetti noodles brown rice actually have something opened up for brown rice which one here okay this is the one so I'm actually in some type of self nutrition database where it collects the amounts of nutrition value for food and this is some nutrition value for rice brown long grain cooked and shows that one cup of brown rice contains about seventeen point nine milligrams of choline also I have something for sweet potatoes because sweet potatoes and regular potatoes are actually within this green list meaning you can you can consume it I have received like my sweet potatoes so with sweet potatoes let's actually go to one meat let's go to one large sweet potato it shows that it will contain around twenty three point six milligrams of choline if you ate one cooked sweet potato so that's really good now I don't know what frozen chips are and it has some cereals like Cheerios and Wheaties which is very interesting another thing that was really interesting in this green list meaning the stuff that you can eat is you can eat technically eat meat pork sausage and turkey sausage I also have something opened up for turkey and pork but this is called pork and beef sausage fresh and cooked and one technically one link of a pork and beef sausage has seven point six milligrams of choline but that's like let's see what 100 grams is fifty eight fifty eight point eight milligrams of choline how much is a gram two ounce ounce tranche ounces let me see bounces what is that loading loading Louie so hundred grams is so if you ate 3.5 ounces 3.5 ounces of pork and beef sausage you would have consumed about 50 point eight milligrams choline and it turns a turkey sausage one pound 16 ounces Jesus Christ you gotta have 268 milligrams but let's see what's a hundred grams it'll be is pretty much the same like fifty nine point 59 milligrams so that's interesting obviously egg whites you've never heard of egg whites very low in choline and here's another stuff it also talks about like the different types of juices and stuff but for me I noticed that when I take you need to eat or consume anything sweet that makes my odor worse so I don't I avoid these types of sugary stuffs but let's go to Amber list because I found this stuff interesting the fruit that's on the in British store the caution list is bananas avocados and melons which is very interesting I actually opened up let's go back to this let me see if I can find a list where I had avocados avocados so with one avocado what is telling me is that you get around like twenty-eight point five milligrams of choline but that's on the caution list but maybe there's more lecithin in avocados so that's why it's on the caution list and even in bananas as well another thing that was very interesting was like kale cooked and spinach cooked because I also recorded um spinach when I looked into spinach raw there's only like 5.4 based on a cup of spinach you will consume five point four grams of choline milligrams of choline but I also looked into spinach cooked and when you look into that is about thirty five point five milligrams of choline and that's very interesting but at the same time I think it's because when you have a cup a spinach is 180 a cup of cooked spinach it's about 180 grams or like a cup of just raw spinach is thirty grams but I don't know even when you hold on here okay this is kale cooked so one cup cooked that's chopped it has 130 grams which is oops 4.5 ounces let me see cook it shows that only has 0.5 milligrams and I think that was the interesting part like it has very even when it's cooked has very little choline however it says this is on a caution board kale cooked so maybe that when it's gets cooked maybe I don't know yeah I don't know I don't know I don't know like I'm not sure with that but there but what we we continue to go downward there's milk products whole milk bread cereals old brand meats bacon tofu peanut butter popcorn Wow popcorn chocolates that sucks because I really like dark chocolate but let's go all the way to the red list and read this there is milk and milk products and pretty much soy skim milk and goat milk I don't really think that's too much available in my market yeah that's on the red list and all the types of food all the types of meats and especially soybeans for some reason soy just really bad is on the list and you know what's so funny a lot of a lot of people go vegan or vegetarian and within that they consume there's a lot of products that are for vegans or vegetarians and contain soy so you think it's good for you but when you sumit you get worse reactions so that's very interesting stay away from soy or anything that has soy beans in it and chocolate ice cream ice cream that's on the right list but of course it would be milkshakes oh man I haven't had a milkshake in a long-ass time butter than that toward the end they show you the page value of soaps are recommended vote soaps to buy and I think you're supposed to buy yeah soaps that have low pH in them I actually took a look at one of them which I already have up and it's it's this one of which is called evene ultra rich soap free however when I went to Amazon to look at this I think this is must be some type of French soap el thermal veins or comm ultra rich cleaning bar just for a three half ounce bar it costs $12 it's $12 for one bar soap so yeah now there's obviously other bars obviously other brands that you can choose from but I just chose the first one and I just like damn that's a little bit too expensive just for one bar so but anyways I'm gonna drop the link so you can take a look at it as well also I'm probably going to make a separate video about the different soaps that are recommended because I'll be interesting as well other than that I'm gonna do right here you guys have a good day", "n-KHBYTkPG0": "today we're here to talk about peanut butter except two of these aren't peanut butter and it says so on the label just not the way you think stick around [Music] [Applause] [Music] I know I know you probably think this is a video about organic or natural or whether you should stir the peanut butter or not the endless debate about that it's actually not about any of those things it's about how all of these things and I chose some random brands here are in the peanut butter aisle and they certainly look like peanut butter but a couple of them have this little word after peanut butter that says spread what on earth is that the Food and Drug Administration are the FDA keeps a set of standards called the standard of identity and the standard of identity dictates what something's allowed to have in it if you're going to call it something so for example if you want to call something sugar if the rules dictate what's allowed to be in it if you're gonna call something maple syrup or chocolate or any of hundreds of other items the rules tell manufacturers what is allowed to be in it to be called that thing now before you go and say that oh it's too much government meddling we don't need that I employ you to think about this there was a time when ingredients were scarce er and manufacturers who made things like bread would put sawdust in them and other things you wouldn't want in there and same goes for all the other foods you eat you really want them to only contain certain things so you might expect that in your peanut butter you'd want certainly mostly peanuts depending on what kind you want might have some salt in there so let's has some salt certain kinds of peanut butter have sugar so let's add some more sugar if you don't like stirring your peanut butter then we're also gonna have to add some saturated fats in there that are SOL at room temperature so let's do that so these are all things that you might be allowed to put in peanut butter but then there's clearly some things you don't want in there and really there ought to be a rule don't you think YUM so that brings us back to the federal regulations from the Food and Drug Administration so here we are in title 21 food and drugs chapter 1 food and drug administration Department of Health and Human Services subchapter B food for human consumption sorry dogs horses all sorts of other animals this is not for you and then we enter the different parts table of contents and headings everything from food labeling nutritional guidelines infant formula uncontainable contaminants and food for human consumption so lots of cool stuff in here if you're a geek like me eggs fish milk and cream bakery products frozen desserts etc etc and if you look we come down to tree nut and peanut products 164 now let's go over soo-min here or click as you might say here we are 164 tree nut and peanut products this is split into mixed nut products shell nuts and rigid and semi rigid containers and here we go peanut butter let's take a look so peanut butter is the food prepared by grinding one of the shelled and roasted peanut ingredients etc etc okay has to be safe has to be stabilized okay so those things that you add seasoning and stabilizing ingredients do not exceed in aggregate ten percent of the weight of the finished food so that means we need 90 percent of this product to actually be a peanut butter you can add ground peanuts caught cut or or chopped so of course that's if you want your chunky or creamy so that's that's all the same there's a fat content limit so cannot exceed fifty five percent when determined yada yada okay you can have blanched or unbleached peanuts and then here we go again chemical preservatives colors etc there's an important thing to note here the oils you're allowed to use to stabilize it sorry I'm writing in a weird position here you are allowed to add hydrogenated vegetable oils and partially hydrogenated vegetable oils those are the oils you're allowed to add so 90 percent have to be solid peanuts cannot be more than 55 percent of this additional fat content and you can add hydrogenated vegetable oils if you're making a product that people don't want to have to stir so here we are back at our collection of six peanut products four of which are peanut butters these two on the right you'll notice actually say peanut butter spread and peanut butter spread and now you know what the difference is these four meet the standards we just read and these two don't let's see if we can figure out why let's see oh says right there not sure if you can see it 60% peanuts and we read that it has to have 90% peanuts to actually qualify as peanut butter so the other 40% of its is not peanuts are filled up by all of these other ingredients here so we know that this has about 30% too much other stuff to actually be a peanut butter now let's take a look at this other one now this one is a peanut butter spread because it says so right there and it actually says it has 90% peanuts so if it has 90% peanuts why is it not a peanut butter well let's dive in peanuts sugar it's allowed to have a palm oil now here's a little trick palm oil seems like something you should be able to add and it's less than 10% obviously but remember the only oil you're allowed to add and have it still be peanut butter is a hydrogenated oil or partially hydrogenated vegetable oil palm oil is not in that category and because it has palm oil this is a spread and not actually a peanut butter not about does it for today's Jesse makes I'm not here to tell you what you should buy or what's healthy or not that's a whole other conversation but as a product designer I come across certain pieces of information that I think are pretty interesting and they're out there in the world they're not proprietary but no one's taken the time to explain them so in this case I just want you to understand that every word on food packaging means something and it's probably there for a reason so if something says chocolatey it's probably not chocolate if it says it's creme it's probably not cream and in this case if it says peanut butter spread that ate peanut butter please

waistline what are the two food sources that cause around 60% of health issues and single-handedly prevents you from creating your dream body in all probability you may not have guessed correctly its sugar and processed food even if you guessed correctly still you will find this video to be a real eye-opener and it will induce some powerful changes in your dietary habits do you know that sugar falls in the category of recreational and addictive substances like drugs and alcohol you may not believe the statement now but by the end of this video we promise that you will agree with it wholeheartedly as we equated sugar with addictive substances let us understand very briefly what makes these recreational substances so addictive and hazardous it's quite strange that the actual sources of any of these recreational substances were not that addictive or hazardous the problem originated only when we started to refine them let's demonstrate this with few examples fermented alcohol like wine is not as bad as refine or distilled stuff like whiskey gin or vodka another example is the very dangerous and very addictive cocaine which is also a product of refinement the refinement of coca leaves these leaves had been chewed by farmers for hundreds of years for a boost in energy without having any major health issues similarly sugar is produced by the refinement of sugar cane or beetroot juice and mixing it with refined corn starch if consumed in their natural state in moderation neither sugar canes nor Mays is either addictive or harmful can you notice a common trait in all these examples the result of refinement of the source is a higher concentration of a particular ingredient that will have an effect on your brain's reward system which makes you happy after consumption in whisky it is ethanol in cocaine it is cocoa leaves and in sugar it is the sugar cane juice the extent of refinement dictates the intensity of the effect a massive 100 kilograms of coca leaves will get you about 100 grams of cocaine it implies that the resulting material is 100 times stronger than what we started with average Indian population consumes around 85 grams of sugar every day which requires one kilogram of sugarcane stalk so the result of the refinement process is a material that's around 10 times sweeter than what you started with in order to naturally consume this much sugar you would have to chew through about one kilogram of sugarcane stalk that will come along with the goodness of fiber on the other hand table sugar is highly refined and processed as a result it is completely devoid of vitamin mineral or fiber sweet activates your reward center more than lots of other tastes we are eeveelution airy programmed to seek sweet food because sweet foods in nature are very rarely poisonous sugar and cocaine have the similar effect on the brain in terms of the release of happiness inducing chemicals like dopamine with its happiness triggering attributes combined with the irresistible sweet taste no wonder researchers have proven that sugar is eight times more addictive than cocaine as is the case with any substance abuse people addicted to sugar also exhibit the traits of increasing tolerance and withdrawal when you become tolerant to something the pleasure center of the brain produces less amount of dopamine for the similar intake of the recreational substance or activity with reduced dopamine feeling of happiness becomes less intense so more dopamine is necessary to get the same effect and you are forced to increase the quantity of the substance to get the same amount of pleasure this is tolerance which is progressive and is a common feature of every addictive substances or activities what about withdrawal people who tried to quit sugar experienced symptoms like lightheadedness headaches anxiety mood swings muscle aches and general fatigue okay so we have agreed that sugar is addictive we have also agreed that it is devoid of any nutritional value but why did we make such a tall claim that sugar is the cause of more than 60% of health related issues why are we not blaming fat at least for the obesity isn't it correct that fat supplies 9 calories per gram whereas sugar being a carbohydrate supplies just 4 calories per gram so why are we holding sugar responsible the answer lies in a hormone called insulin our body starts creating insulin the moment it identifies the presence of more than 5 gram of sugar in our blood in Ceylon is like a chef that transfers the sugar from the blood and feeds it to the cell think of insulin like a key that opens the entry to the cell so that the sugar from the blood gets absorbed inside when we eat carbohydrate our blood sugar Rises quickly Peaks quickly and falls off just as fast protein also leads to spike of sugar in blood but as you can see it's not that high The effect of fat on blood sugar is almost nil coming back to carbohydrate you can see that glucose fructose and galactose are the simplest forms any carbohydrate they are basically three different kind of simple sugar known as monosaccharide every other carbohydrate is a combination of two or more monosaccharides these monosaccharides are like three different bricks which construct everything that falls under the category of carbohydrate for example more than 10 bricks are required to produce brown rice which can be equated with a palatial house between two to 10 bricks of sugar are required to produce an apartment like pulses and wheat whereas sugar or sucrose is just like a tiny room that requires only two bricks one brick of glucose and one brick of fructose a small room takes less time to be demolished than a huge palatial building that's why sugar when consumed will be converted into glucose almost instantly when the body detects high amount of sugar in the blood it would release insulin in order to facilitate the transfer of the sugar from the blood to the cell now you can see the reason behind sugar which is a carbohydrate in essence triggers such a spike in insulin there are three storage areas for sugar in the body the first two storage areas are body cells and muscle like any storage area sugar will be stored at these two places only when they become empty for somebody who is not unwell muscle and body cells become empty of sugar as a of a strenuous activity or endurance training or strength training the third storage area is liver where a small percentage of sugar is stored as a backup reserved liver supplies sugar to muscle and body cells when they become empty and there is no supply of food we would use the knowledge we have acquired about carbohydrate metabolism and sugar storage to understand the most powerful concept in nutrition and body transformation so let's assume we have not performed any strenuous activity or resistance training during the day however we decided to eat a meal which was high in sugar or simple carbs such sugary stuff would trigger instant insulin spike in the body after this we were still hungry and ate chicken with brown rice and some salad though our healthy meal 100% of the carbohydrate 50% of the protein and 10% of the fat will be converted into sugar the body would check if the three storage areas of sugar which are cells muscle and liver need any sugar replenishment as we were lazy during the day the sugar storage was full to the brink this is known as excess sugar now we are in a state of spiked insulin and excess sugar here comes the most astonishing fact about sugar metabolism excess sugar will be converted into fat in the presence of insulin once again let me repeat excess sugar will be converted into fat in presence of insulin this is probably the most important nutritional concept that you will ever learn now where do you think all this fat gets stored easy it gets stored in the belly region if the consumption of sugar is still not controlled body will keep on producing more insulin and the cells will develop a resistance to them this is called insulin resistance it's exactly the way you lose the interest to talk when somebody does not stop talking as a result of insulin resistance now the key which used to open the door to the cell earlier is not functioning and hence the sugar from the blood starts getting stored in the belly region as fat so the belly keeps on increasing in size at the expense of cells which get deprived of energy the lack of energy is perceived by the brain as hunger and therefore you land up heating more and the cycle continues that's why guys sugar is so bad for anybody who wants to live healthy or lose fat we have seen how sugar gets converted to fat in presence of insulin though majority of the fat gets stored in belly some fat is stored in liver as well if not controlled accumulation of fat may leads to non-alcoholic fatty liver 10% of alcohol gets metabolized in our brain therefore we experience the feeling of getting drunk and know when to stop drinking on the contrary 100% of the sugar has to be metabolized by our poor liver and the worst thing brain does not realize when to stop eating the metabolic stress created on the liver while trying to metabolize either sugar or alcohol produces loads of toxins these toxins are responsible for inflicting damage to liver and kidney though sugar can cause similar if not more damage than alcohol to the liver it's the alcohol that takes the blame for liver issues because alcohol makes you feel drunk unlike sugar also there is societal barrier that prevents frequent daily consumption of alcohol while sugar can be consumed anytime anywhere so there is a greater chance for sugar to cause more damage than alcohol there is an Australian documentary that sugar film where the filmmaker Damon goes on an experimental high sugar diet for 30 days despite consuming the same amount of calories but increasing his sugar intake he gained eight point five kilograms in 30 days and by the 18th day he already had developed fatty liver disease listen to Robert Lustig who is the biggest factor to bring the ill effect of sugar to light he demonstrated with hundreds of studies how sugar was responsible for triggering chronic metabolic diseases now you wouldn't think twice about not giving your kid a Budweiser but you don't think twice about giving your kid a can of coke but they're the same sugar is poison it is a chronic dose dependent Pepito liver toxin he supported his statements with 16 years of studies research papers and clinical trials now what about processed food what makes processed food as bad as sugar well the answer lies in the word process a processed food is any food that has been altered through grinding freezing or sophisticated cooking methods or complex industrial process the primary objective of the processing is to improve the taste value of the finished food obviously if a food manufacturer wants to succeed and get people to buy their product it has to taste good our appetite gravitates towards foods that are sweet salty and fatty therefore processed food had been engineered to be loaded with sugar and fat during the late 90s however ever since the low-fat craze our food supply has become loaded with added sugar food companies very smartly take the fat out of the product so that it can be marketed as low-fat and then put sugar in where the fat was so the product still tastes good in fact the companies found out that you can make almost anything tastes better by putting some sugar in it the Bliss point is a term the food industry uses to describe the point at which a product is most likeable for the majority of consumers so the Bliss point is going to be the point at which the maximum amount of sugar has been added before the product becomes too sweet this includes anything from bread to Pete's a source to salad dressing sugar is cheap makes the users addictive to the taste and that's why it's usage is increasing in every processed food with increasing awareness about health the food companies use all the marketing gimmicks to mislead health-conscious population so that they don't pay any attention to sugar terms like extra protein zero added sugar low fat and added vitamins are all coined to make the health conscious people fall prey to buying the product which are fattening and addictive in some cases synthetic vitamins and minerals are added to the foods to compensate for what was lost during processing synthetic nutrients can never be a replacement for the nutrients found in whole foods if you look at the ingredients label for a processed packaged food chances are that you won't have a clue what some of the ingredients are that's because many of the ingredients in there aren't actual food they are artificial chemicals that are added for various purposes this is an example of a processed food a high protein bar which is actually marketed as a low carb friendly health food I don't know what this is but it most certainly isn't food let's not forget that real foods contain much more than just the standard vitamins and minerals that we're all familiar with real foods like plants and animals contain thousands of other trace nutrients that science is just beginning to grasp maybe one day we will invent a chemical blend that can replace all these nutrients but until that happens the only way to get them in your diet is to eat whole unprocessed foods during the processing even the good complex carbohydrate is converted into simple sugar and protein becomes unusable for our body all this sugar coming from simple carbohydrate which originally came from a complex source apart from added sugar leads to huge insulin spike and high amount of fat ensures that such spike is maintained for a very long time it implies that after eating processed food your body goes into fat storage mode and remains in that state for a longer time that's why there is a higher probability for a person habituated of eating processed food to store fat even after eating something healthy like chicken and brown rice even the protein loses its true purpose of building the tissue and muscle and just ends up supplying empty calories also the process of refinement removes or reduces fiber from the food fiber is a buffer that reduces the insulin spike in fact many time the fiber is intentionally removed from processed food in order to increase its consumption and habit-forming traits now there are people who are aware about the ill effect of sugar and they refrain from having Coke and desserts but they still overdose on sugar without even realizing it everybody is aware about sugar and high fructose corn syrup therefore food companies slide sugar in processed food under the disguise of 54 different names just to make you feel better but they are all sugar in essence so we suggest you to read the label carefully before buying any item from the supermarket and discard it if it has a camouflaged name of sugar do not forget that every McDonald KFC or Pizza Hut products are either loaded with sugar directly or gets metabolized into sugar within no time post consumption because of excessive refinement remember how an apartment can be demolished easily as compared to a palatial building listen to Michael Moss who is a Pulitzer prize-winning investigative reporter mas is explosive empowering narrative is grounded in meticulous I openin research the food industry is extremely secretive competitive and proprietary it took years and hundreds of interviews before Michael Moss could finish his book this was like a detective story for me getting inside the companies with thousands of pages of inside documents and getting their scientists and executives to reveal to me the secrets of how they go at this what did he find that the food processing industry rests on three pillars salt sugar and fat well these are the Holy Trinity of processed foods and again when they hit the perfect amounts they call it the Bliss point for sugar the mouthfeel for fat the flavor burst for salt they know that their products will be irresistible now let us drift into a controversial subject of home-cooked food can home-cooked food be unhealthy the purist may hate us for the answer but the truth is that even home-cooked food can be unhealthy let me prove this as we know now any method that alters the food to improve its taste is called processing now it's not just complex industrial process even unhealthy cooking methods can convert bunch of healthy food sources to unhealthy food which can be as bad as processed food overcooking frying and mixing food from different sources while cooking other major reasons for our Indian food to lose its nutritional value for example while preparing fish fry or chicken butter masala at home utilizing unhealthy cooking methods protein from meat sources capable of being used by the body to repair or build muscle gets either reduced or even eliminated such food though prepared with quality protein source just ends up supplying lots of empty calories excessive cooking like commercial processing makes it very easy for the body to metabolize such food such easy and rapid metabolization results into high insulin spike isn't this similar to the effect of consuming processed food any protein is made up of 21 amino acids and many of them cannot sustain excessive cooking and heat like protein unhealthy cooking methods even converts complex carbohydrate into an easily digestible state similar to simple sugar carbon dioxide is released in our body when it's trying to metabolize excessive sugar carbon dioxide is responsible for making us feel bloated and gaseous this might explain the reason to be bloated after eating poori but not roti made up of similar amount of wheat dough whole wheat is a complex carbohydrate but the process of frying converts it into a form which is quite similar to simple sugar we may not add extra sugar or chemicals while cooking at home but that's not a sufficient criteria for a food to be characterized as healthy and nutritious while cooking at home we may be guilty of pulverizing whole grains over cooking the meat and cooking the vegetables until it becomes soggy all this taste improvement mechanism unfortunately makes our food easily digestible caloric dense and extremely low in nutrition do not assume that processing only implies addition of chemicals and just because you are not adding any chemical to home-cooked food they are superior to processed or restaurant food it will not be too difficult for us to look around and notice our family members who hardly eat so-called processed or junk food but still struggling with obesity and addictive eating syndrome doesn't this indicate that simply cooking at home is not a guarantee for the food to be healthy we can safely conclude at least technically that home-cooked food can be as bad as processed food if wrong cooking methods eliminates its nutrition increases the calorie per bite and causes insulin spike post consumption so the bottom line is that the hyper rewarding and insulin triggering nature of food can be induced both in a manufacturing plant or at home and that's why some people can literally become addicted to this stuff and completely lose control over their consumption the intense dopamine release that occurs in the brain when they eat these foods can easily defeat their defense mechanism and make them eat much more than they need although food addiction is something that most people don't know about we are convinced that it is a huge problem in society today so we have learnt until now that food is processed to enhance the taste and in the process nutrition goes out of the consideration so does it mean that a healthy food needs to be tasteless of course not if the food does not taste good it can never be a part of our long-term dietary choice you just need to be mindful to avoid processed and sugary food our recipes that make your dream body are carefully designed to retain the nutritional value of the ingredients without compromising with taste we recommend you to watch our recipe videos to prepare delicious food which can even enhance your performance and improve health a small bit of clarification is required about fruits here whole fruits also contain fructose but do not treat fruits at par with table sugar unlike table sugar fruits are neither processed nor refined unless you consume them in the form of juice whole fruits are loaded with fiber which reduces the rate of intestinal absorption meaning your liver can easily handle the steady stream of sugar from a piece of fruit the fiber will also fill you up so for apples might be actually a lot of food to take in in one sitting but you can get four whole apples worth of sugar delivered to your liver in a few seconds from one glass of apple juice which will lead to huge insulin spike refinement of fruit required to produce fruit juice Rob's off vitamins minerals and fiber from the fruit and what we consume now is very similar to sugar and therefore we advise you to strictly avoid fruit juices even if they claim to have zero added sugar however like any other food source fruits are the source of calories as well and therefore be mindful of not exceeding your set caloric intake by over indulging it's very common to see people gaining weight over mangoes and dates to have an idea we have given the calorie content of some common fruits you also need to learn to eat the fruits in a right way to maximize its benefit fruits should be consumed on an empty stomach it is best to have fruits two hours prior or two hours later after having anything eating fruit in this way will help the body to process the nutrients fiber and sugar properly this prevents fermentation of fruits in our digestive system most importantly you will avoid sugar getting converted to fat in presence of insulin spike through fructose from fruit eating fruit this way prevents any digestive discomfort fruit as a snack in between major meal is the best way of consuming them also against the conventional wisdom it's best to avoid fruits as a breakfast your body has been fasting and the sugar in the fruit will spike your insulin and you will become hungry very soon let me give you another piece of good news insulin spike is not always bad in fact we need a spike of insulin after resistance or weight training post weight training protein is the go-to nutrient to repair and rebuild the loss of proteins from our muscle cells protein also provides the building blocks required to build new muscle tissue we know that insulin is a chef that transfers sugar in the cell of a person having normal metabolism now insulin also acts as a carrier to transfer protein into the cell without insulin absorption of protein is reduced drastically therefore the best time to spike your insulin is after wake training while consuming protein insulin is consumed helping in protein absorption into the cells rather than converting sugar into fat so now the question is what kind of carbs should you use to spike your insulin after a workout well you know how there are good carbs and bad carbs as it turns out this is actually the only time when good cups and bad carbs switch roles meanings typical good Cubs like roti oatmeal brown rice etc contain fiber and other nutrients that slow down its digestion and insulin spike this is exactly what makes them good any other time of the day but by now you know the post-workout meal is all about insulin spike to help in protein absorption therefore foods like honey white potatoes white rice or a cereal like cornflakes are all good choices for a carb source after a workout post-workout you should consume around 25% to 30% of total daily carbohydrate intake or roughly 25 to 30 grams of carbohydrate total daily allocated carbohydrate implies carbohydrate from all sources including good or bad carb you should not think that your workout has you have the license to eat more than you're allocated budget of carbohydrate protein nor fat my favorite carbohydrate source post-workout consists of four dates along with a handful of raisin apart from spiking my insulin without majorly contributing towards my daily caloric intake it takes care of my sweet tooth as well here is the insulin index of few common food source insulin index indicates the extent of the spike that you get from the food you can select any of the food item from the list there's a post-workout carbohydrate source if it score more than 75% also it's important to avoid fat while spiking the insulin because fat slows down the insulin and digestion therefore having a desert-like rasgulla or cake or even ice cream is strictly not recommended even as a post-workout meal they are processed high in fat and most importantly very high in calorie - post-workout nutrition is very important we will surely do another exhaustive video very soon about pre and post-workout meal don't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel and join our Facebook page so that you never miss any of our videos as we have been talking about dopamine and reward circuit a lot let me tell you that getting a dopamine high and activation of reward circuit in brain is not bad if the source is healthy and soul-stirring in fact in our modern society when depression is on a high it's really important for us to identify and pursue at least few healthy activities that are capable of activating our reward circuit physical activities like resistance training or endurance activities are the most effective source of activating the reward circuit in our brain pursuing a passion bonding session with best buddies and commitment to a social cause are examples of healthy activities that promotes dopamine release in abundance to figure out healthy activities that provides you eternal happiness and if you have already identified them pursue them regularly so that they become a part of your habitual routine if an honest self introspection has revealed that currently not even a single activity is capable of releasing happiness chemicals in your brain then it is surely a cause for concern and you must address it at the earliest one last topic of this video is a comparison between sugar and few other supposedly healthy substitute of sugar let's go back to science to see if they are really healthy our comparison is going to be between sugar honey Indian jaggery and artificial sweetener like equal and Splenda Indian jaggery is popularly known as Gore Indian jaggery is an unrefined sugar made by boiling concentrated sugarcane extract until it hardens we will compare all the four sweet stuff on four parameters the parameters are calorie density nutrition profile impact on insulin spike and addiction inducing traits let's start with the first parameter of calorie density which is the amount of calories per gram that a product has for visual ease our paracin criteria shall be 1tsp of every product which is roughly around five grams one teaspoon of sugar gives 19 calories honey gives 18 calories jaggery provides 19 calories and artificial sweetener gives zero calorie which is not a big surprise let's check the nutrition profile now needless to say sugar has zero vitamin mineral and fiber constitutionally honey is a bit different from sugar sugars are generally half glucose and half fructose honey is a larger proportion of fructose honey comes from a more natural unadulterated source it does contain nutrients and antioxidants but I won't go into the details of what they are because when consumed at two to three teaspoons a day these nutrients are present in just trace amounts so nutritionally if you seek to reap the benefits of honey you'd need to consume about a glass every day in which case you can kiss weight loss goodbye given its composition it has many allied benefits - from curing coughs to healing wounds nutrition profile is an area where jaggery is definitely superior at 100 grams it gives 61% of the recommended daily allowances or RDA of iron 30% RDA of magnesium 30% RDA of potassium and 20% RDA of manganese however considering that you should not exceed 15 grams of daily consumption of sugar from all the sources put together you can't afford to count on jaggery for getting these nutrients instead eat spinach please but at 5 grams to 15 grams jaggery is definitely better than having the same amount of sugar artificial sweetener has off-course no nutrition profile when it comes to insulin spiking traits sugar and jaggery are exactly the same glycemic index is the scale that measures insulin spike sugar and jaggery both have the glycemic index of 68 honey is slightly better at GI of 55 artificial sweetener are worse than sugar when it comes to insulin spike research has established that majority of the artificial sweeteners available in market raises the insulin drastically in fact artificial sweetener are almost 10 times sweeter than table sugar moving on to the last parameter of habit inducing trait well since all the four stuff are sweet causes more or less similar insulin spike they possess almost the similar capability of releasing happiness triggering chemicals in the brain and therefore all the four products can cause addiction interestingly stevia is the only artificial sweetener which is different from all other product in this category as it comes from plant it's insulin spiking trait is insignificant and therefore it can help you in your battle against sugar addiction but again we do not recommend the usage of more than two stevia on a daily basis so what's the verdict work on reducing your sweet and processed food craving that's the only reliable long-term method to getting fit and staying so disease doesn't happen with one meal but it happens with a thousand but that's what we have because now sugar is with every meal getting rid of sugar addiction may seem difficult or even impossible for the initial three weeks but once the positive transformation like higher energy reducing waist line etc becomes dominant your craving for wrong food will start diminishing positive transformation is more addictive than sweet after all thanks for watching guys please do subscribe to our YouTube channel and join our Facebook group for more videos

the one with the cavalier lis throwing around these scissors and I've got scissors in my hand not because I'm reviewing scissors I'm sure that there probably is a market out there for somebody who wants to review scissors no I've got scissors because I'm here to open a tough package one that I knew I'm gonna have trouble with but one that I am excited for because it is my one of my favorite kinds of edibles and that is the chocolate bar ooh the Sun is making that very difficult to see bad son bad bad son la familia it's the product of Los Angeles the mint flavor I read all the Spanish in English oh it looks like there's like four years of Spanish paid off so this is the la familia de la I almost said that terribly mint to flavor 200 milligrams of THC really that is quite obnoxious how that shows up they're very thin curtains I have um very simple packaging on this it's just like a little aluminum wrapper on this green kind of iridescent packaging you can feel not much to it again just like a sticker on an aluminum packaging it does have nutrition facts and ingredients on the back which is great but no lab test results so this is came from a black market or gray market dispensary in California because we all we all know all legal edibles are now 100 milligram edibles topped and they have to be ten servings or more this is an old-school 200 don't give a [ __ ] how many servings so let's go ahead and cut open the top here take a look at this chocolate bar give it a taste and if you've never tuned in before and if you have tuna before you must really [ __ ] hate here this by now but if you haven't the way of the reviews work here on weeds is I'm gonna eat a little bit of this here in front of you not necessarily the whole thing because I don't want to bore you to death but rest assured I'll eat this whole thing and then after I finish it I will come back to you guys in another two hours write us about when you'd be peaking to let you know how the product is actually hitting because that's what you're really in it for that's what you really care about is you know is it really gonna make you is it really gonna work not so much how it tastes okay Wow a very basic looking chocolate bar here totally basic it doesn't even have like an imprint with their logo on it or anything it is just what 12 squares of or twelve rectangles of chocolate I'm not gonna break it off into single rectangles let's just give it bite on three it smells like no I don't really detect a cannabis odor to it definitely a mint odor I'm a fan of mint chocolate I know there are a lot of mint chocolate haters out there I don't understand that but teach their own okay that's pretty good chocolate I'm decent quality chocolate for sure the mint flavor is not overwhelming I've definitely had some mint chocolates that are way more minty flavor more of a hint of mint here which is nice really no cannabis tasting I can't really detect much of any no hmm well what I hope that means is the chocolate is excessively masking the flavor of the cannabis and not that there's not 200 milligrams of THC in there mmm I never got to mention I picked this up on at the dispensary that I mentioned for $17 I believe which is two dollars more than they charge for a two hundred and thirty sixty milligram delta-9 which are excellent so high expectations for the la familia mint 200 milligrams here well guys I'm gonna eat another nine squares of this and then I will be back to you as I said in two hours let you know how it's hitting thanks for watching weights guys see in just a bit peace [Music] it's two hours later hi guys welcome back uh it has been 2 hours since I had the la familia and that still does not show up very well on this camera and I apologize for that there's a little bit of a better angle and the familiar the family that la familia is together families together is my review the end no my more elaborate view is it's pretty good it's not the most potent chocolate bar I've ever had chocolate bars are usually I believe the strongest and best vector for THC this one doesn't feel like a - like a kiva equivalent to me certainly not not even close really but it's still pretty good I'm at about a 6 right now some somewhere in that range so it's not you know terrible I've had 200 milligram edibles that are way worse and it didn't it tasted pretty good there's really no cannabis taste so you know on the whole I it's not the best you know there are certainly better chocolate bars out there I still would even probably recommend one of the new Kiva 100 milligrams over this la familia 200 milligram but if it's although your dispensary has and you like the chocolate bars this one's got a good taste it'll still do the job it's just probably not honest about that 200 milligrams would be my guess so if you have no other options and you like chocolate grab it otherwise go with one of the better brands pick up a kiva pick up a default say even probably a chill that one doesn't taste as good but I think it's more potent so stick with the bit the bit better brands if you can otherwise la familia is not a bad alternative and that is gonna do it for this review and before I go I'm gonna give you a very quick cherry on top guys just a soup quick little cherry on top something just so delightful and hairy I'll get you out of here real quick and that is cursing swearing profanity I mean I've been profanity since before my teenage years [ __ ] I [ __ ] love cursing it's the [ __ ] [ __ ] damn [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] it's great um if you if you don't curse a lot you should curse more if you don't curse at all what the [ __ ] is wrong with you cursing is the best the science is on my side you know they say that people who curse are more intelligent they're more honest they're more empathetic I've read that they actually have bigger dongs and that they're also better lovers to that I most of those are things that I've read so uh curse say [ __ ] a lot you'll like it la familia it's not that shitty thank you for sticking around to the end of this cherry on top thank you for sticking tuned to the end of this review appreciated Alice always guys it's been a [ __ ] blast see on the next week's peace", "pxpG7vEgeyM": "[Music] hello moon man and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful beautiful handsome intelligent and artistic we'll say artistic folks make sense of that crazy mixed up well let's just start over hello moon man and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today's review we are taking a look at a an edible god damn [ __ ] i still suck at doing these hello moon men and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy wild weird place you call your dispensary today we are taking a look at a review from a company that we have uh reviewed at least one thing from before maybe two uh i do know that it is a company that i have had a lot of success with and one that i am very excited to give another shake here on wheats and that is moon intergalactic milligramage this is their cannabis infused sativa bites the cherry blasters um like all of moons edibles they are very affordable i picked these up for a scant 12 which is quite the deal for an edible up especially for the 400 milligrams you get here in southern california one is what you see there we see our uh lab tested results 100 milligrams 10 cherry blasters whatever they're going to end up being at 10 milligrams each um and then we've got our nutrition information here on the back our mission control advisory uh which suggests that we wait at least 45 minutes uh houston uh says if we don't wait at least 45 minutes we got ourselves a problem um and then they also have some helpful directions on how to open this bag because they know they're dummies like me who will f it up um so let's go ahead and give this moon intergalactic milligram edge a shot um and just like they said uh i may need to read those um cut cut bag above zipper well no [ __ ] i wasn't gonna able to open it because i don't have scissors i'm for those i'm gonna have to go really far away excuse me for one second i'm back so good to see you guys again so let's get into these cherry blasters and find out exactly what they're gonna be my guess is gonna be some kind of chocolate covered cherry candy oh bite-sized confections coated in milk chocolate that sounds kind of like maybe candy covered in chocolate now they say cut below that zipper line i'm going to say [ __ ] that i'm going to cut below the zipper line i meant to say above a bit originally so that you could reseal it but i'm going to cut straight beneath it because one live a little two [ __ ] the man and three i don't plan on sealing this up because i'm gonna eat all 10 of our cherry blasters here probably over about the next hour or so and then after i have my 10th cherry blaster about two hours after that i'll come back to you guys and let you know like all of our wheats reviews whether these cherry blasters are worth your very affordable 12 so let's go ahead and give one a try after cherry blaster that is interesting it's like pretty much like a cherry flavored gummy candy but like a harder gummy candy um with chocolate covering it it's like a muddy buddy the gummy bear is covered with chocolate pretty much there is a slight weed taste to it nothing too bad let's get a cross sectional going here and there is the inside of your cherry blaster wow very cherry blastery if i had to guess if somebody put a gun in my head before i said this and said tell me what a cherry blaster is going to taste like and i could uh accurately describe things that are indescribable like taste i would i would describe these exactly perfectly cherry blasters okay they're not my favorite edible in terms of taste from moon uh moon has like the spaceman mint bar the toffee fudge something with another sort of space pun in there i like those ones quite a bit these aren't bad it's just i'm not a muddy buddies guy so um these are you know not terrible uh and i'm certainly not complaining for twelve dollars the weird taste is is is i wouldn't say negligible but not a major concern uh so really no complaints just not my favorite of the moon products in terms of taste but let me talk with my mouthful it's not about how it tastes it's about how it makes you feel and for that guys just stick around here for just a couple more minutes i'll come right back to you i'm gonna finish these next six off or so over the next hour and then two hours after that as i said i will come right back here

say that i'm definitely in geostationary orbit um no i'm probably on the moon these are great moon man uh moon is really one of my favorite uh edible um companies uh out there in terms of uh punch to dollar ratio uh moon is one of the most affordable hard-hitting edibles that i know of they never fail uh this one is real real real good i i again just can't believe um how hard it hit uh i almost fell asleep before i came back to do this review i was like oh [ __ ] oh my god i was getting ready to go to sleep and i was like i forgot because uh i was so high so that is about as good of an endorsement of a product as i can give moon cherry blasters so good and speaking of cherries i saved one for a little cherry on top so not only was it great it was great with nine cherry on top a little something extra something not necessarily weed related that you may or may not want to check out with or without weed that is just supplementary just a little bonus for you guys i'd like to uh

until then stay stay high but also stay healthy and i'll see you guys right back here for a later review good night", "tdMUPP3GIyM": "hello welcome to healthy living my name is caitlin cornell in the health education coordinator for the purchase district health department fabrice a month we are reminded about celebrating those that we love in our lives we typically show our affection by giving gifts of chocolate candy or flowers well febri is also american heart month and should remind us all to love our heart and our brain and take care of our health for a longer and healthier life heart disease and diabetes tend to go hand in hand because both have some some familiar and similar risk factors such as being overweight high cholesterol levels low physical activity and family history in fact those with diabetes are at higher risk for heart attack or stroke high blood cholesterol signals a higher risk of heart attack and stroke and today that's what we're going to talk about we hope that you will gain some information and some under understanding of what those labs are when you go to the doctor today I'm joined with Julie muscarella and Deanna here who also work at the health department with me thank you for coming today Deanna could you explain generally what what is cholesterol well cholesterol is a fat-like substance that's found in our body our body also makes cholesterol but we can also add to that cholesterol level by the foods we eat and the more cholesterol we have in our body the more it can clog and block the vessels that are in our body serving our important organs such as our heart and our brain and other areas of our body so we it's something to pay attention to it's a level that we want to know what our number is and find ways that we can get that number down so because the higher our cholesterol level is the higher our risk for heart attack and stroke and typically people with diabetes tend to struggle with high cholesterol levels in addition so that's why they are so much more at risk for heart attack and stroke sure what what would be the total cholesterol that a person should remember because there are a lot of numbers when we're talking about these yes and when someone goes to the doctor the doctor may order a lipoprotein level or lipid profile and that's basically just checking with their cholesterol levels are it consists of their total cholesterol but also two components of their cholesterol which is called their LDL or their bad cholesterol or the HDL which is there good cholesterol now those at risk such as those with diabetes those who have had heart attack or stroke before or a very high risk of having a heart attack or stroke may see their health care provider order this every year but typically those that lower risk may have this level done every two years it just depends on their health care provider but when we talk about our total cholesterol level in our blood we're talking about a level we should see less than 200 milligrams per deciliter and when we look at those two components of our cholesterol the lousy cholesterol or the LDL that is the bad cholesterol and the reason we call it the bad cholesterol is it wants to go right into the side of your vessels it's what clogs and stops up our vessels and puts us at Rick risk for that heart attack or that stroke whenever blood flow is blocked through a vessel going to our brain or our heart that is what causes that heart attack or that strobe so the lousy or the LDL cholesterol we want to see that less than a hundred but people that have had heart attacks before people they're a very high risk for heart attack and stroke they may be on cholesterol medication treatment right now their doctors may want to see that level at 70 or lower so what's important is the lousy cholesterol needs to be low we want it as long as possible now the good side of it is our good cholesterol so I think you know we our body needs cholesterol to function so that's why we have that good component of cholesterol and that's why our body makes it good cholesterol or the H dl we want that to be as high as we can get it for men we want to see that more than 44 women we want to see 50 or higher it seems that the older women get and whenever especially we go through menopause we lose some of that heart protection so the higher this happy or HDL cholesterol level is the more protective it is on our heart and that really goes for men and women both the higher the number the better at protecting against a heart attack or stroke mmhmm yeah I'm also too besides our total cholesterol our LDL the lousy cholesterol or our HDL or good cholesterol they can also check for triglycerides and triglycerides is another type of fat in the blood we typically see triglycerides want to get higher the more weight we gain and also the older we get so that level we need to keep it below 150 and I think Julie is going to be sharing some things later on that will help keep that and lower that triglyceride level as well as our other try gristle our cholesterol levels and as well too sure so really it's important to know that there's not one set number that it can vary individually as to where your risk levels are so it's very important for everyone to talk to their doctor about what should their number be and and you know why and it's right alright so so Julie what let's start off with some diet tips what what would you you know when you when you when we talk about the the numbers it's really hard to bring it home and really you know have us understand what it means to us so and nutritionally how should we look at it so the good news is that to help all those levels that Deanna was talking about that everybody can it help those numbers by having routine exercise and also losing weight if needed and if you smoke get help to stop those are true for everybody and for everybody who has problems with that so before I get into specifics of lowering this or lowering that I just want to make sure that I make that clear and I'm sure Dean true true exactly so I said enough Mellie you know because it's it's that's prevention that's right so in the other the other good news is that there are things that you can do that to eat that can actually help lower the LDL which is that lousy cholesterol and so that involves fiber and there's two types of fiber there's a soluble fiber and there's an insoluble fiber and insoluble fiber is something that is not digested by our body something like a whole grain or something similar to this and this is very very important for our body it helps them food move through the body it helps form the stool it's very important with any type of fiber if you increase your out fiber make sure that you drink plenty of water and work at it gradually yeah the the type of fiber that actually lowers the LDL cholesterol is something called soluble fiber so rather than talk to you about what not to eat the first thing that I want to talk to you about is the good things that you can include in your diet that actually partner with your body to bring down that LDL cholesterol and that's exciting and some of these things also help your triglycerides yeah absolutely i'm going to be yes that you know that you know once you've told alright these are your numbers there's just so much that you can do so some of the things that have soluble fiber that i encourage all my clients to eat routinely and regularly and to have them in their in their pantries are oats and that is oat bran regular oats even instant oats beans that includes kidney beans and peas like I've got chickpeas here that I'm showing you barley is important vegetables such as broccoli brussel sprouts eggplant lima beans and also whole fruit rather than fruit juice also you want to eat more so megha 3 fats this helps lower cholesterol that includes things like flaxseed you can get it either ground or flaxseed oil and the thing about flaxseed is that you don't want to have it whole because it is not digestible just go straight through you but so the seed itself isn't what you would want to be you just don't want to sprinkle seeds on everything those type of flexi because they're not digestible but you'll want to make sure their ground or the oil type also walnuts are very high in these omega-3s some peanut butter even has it added canola oil your green leafy vegetables and then you have fatty fish from saltwater like everybody's heard of salmon also sardines mackerel herring and albacore tuna there's also fatty fish that had these omega-3s and that includes rainbow trout catfish tilapia and bass so all of those are good things that you can include in your diet good for you Foods good yeah and even with the the omega-3s the fats that I did mention remember that they do have calories so you want to be very careful that you don't over indulge in those because you know they will add to your calorie portion that day you don't want to gain weight sure yeah so the other thing that you can do to lower cholesterol is to limit your you're trans fats and your saturated fats what really contributes to this LDL level argues that the saturated fats that we eat and that comes in particular from from fatty meats the fat portion of the meats and also your your highly processed meats like your bacon and sausage and salami also your high fat dairy products such as whole milk your aged cheese's your creams and also lard and there's also some oils that are high in saturated fat that's coconut oil palm oil and palm kernel and of course you know you want to be very careful to to look at labels and make sure that you know what you're eating sure the trans fat neither actually been outlawed in New York City trans fat has actually been outlawed in New York City in other words if a restaurant is using trans fat than they go against the city ordinance because it is so unhealthy that they've decided to not let restaurant tours use it at all it's actually a commercial product for the most part things it's a manufactured fat it's usually found in things like your solid shortening anything that's processed with partially hydrogenated fat like our baked goods but typically in restaurants they use it as fat stir fry and things like that and but on the package label it has to be listed and you want to steer away from foods that are high in this actually have any trans fat and again it could be in baked goods like crackers cookies cakes pies anything like that sure and so very very important but remember the main culprit for a look to for increasing that is that saturated fat that you want to omit sure the other thing that you want to do is you want to limit your cholesterol your foods that contain at the actual cholesterol itself and this cholesterol is found in organ meats like your liver your sweetbreads your heart excuse me your kidneys things like that and also it's found in butter and whole milk and your hard cheeses your your high fat cheeses as well as egg yolks sure a typical egg yolk has around 200 and really you need to keep under 200 at least under 300 a day of mgs of cholesterol related things and I think what you said with with the whole milks you know our cholesterol starts building in childhood so the whole milk you know is is important to cut for children too I mean it's just not when you get to adult you need to be worrying about it you know you need to be worrying about your you know the foods with high fats for all ages children under the age of two can have home milk and they need it for proper nerve development mm-hmm but but after that then you know they need to what else besides the LDL yeah so okay so what about lowering triglycerides right so triglycerides are a very very interesting part of the body because it actually makes the blood more sticky it's very very important that we understand the importance of getting that number under 150 and how we do that is by eating frequent meals you also want to bake steam broiled or grilled foods rather than fry it and again you're going to want to limit your portion sizes of foods that have your saturated fats you if you drink alcohol you want to decrease or cut them out because even small amounts of alcohol raise those triglyceride levels triglycerides you it has to do a lot with sugar as well so you don't want to have sugar intake including cakes pies you want to limit your whole fruits to two per day and when we have people in our classes that are trying to get their triglycerides down I even suggest no fruit juices at all and no sweetened beverages because it's very very sensitive to run to sugar and to excess calories in our diet that's when the triglyceride reads and again eat more of those omega-3 fats that I that I mentioned that can help lower than triglyceride levels so and lower the intake of your cholesterol your saturated fats and your trans fats so again the triglyceride level can come down the one thing that I haven't mentioned yet and diet related but the medications that you take to bring down your blood fats they need to be taken exactly as your doctor has directed very very important so mm-hmm because some medications should be with foods I mean you know at different times of the day and you know and the other thing that I haven't mentioned is how to increase your HDL level that happy cholesterol that Deanna was talking about and that HDL cholesterol can be improved by routine physical activity and that is the best way to to bring it up also when you lower your weight to the proper amount if necessary then that helps that HDL so that makes it happy and and also the stop smoking if you if you smoke get help to stop mm-hmm so those are the way that you improve that HDL so when we go to the doctor we get the labs done and they said these are your numbers we all would prefer to have less medication no one ever wants to go on medication you know and these are just great ways of being able to prevent yourself from you know having to go on medications what kind of exercise and we talked about exercise but it really has to be a specific type of exercise rather than you know just this casual walk and counting that is although any type of you know movement is really physical activity however if you're going to you know lose weight or if you're going to you know achieve certain goals there has to be a certain kind of exercise what what would you you know recommend for someone who wants to lose weight what kind of physical activity should they be thinking I being more active is certainly key if you want to help achieve those goals such as you know lowering not only lowering your blood cholesterol but low in your blood blood pressure lowering your blood sugar and maintaining a healthy weight it's something everybody to do whether you're at risk for heart disease or stroke or not and I like to think of exercise as a medication it is something just as if you had to take your medication every day to help lower your blood cholesterol your sugar your blood pressure you need to take that medication of being active and having physical activity every day and we want to build up to 30 minutes every day on most days of the week and what kind of activities we're talking about is regular aerobic activities these are activities that actually get your heart beating a little faster get you breathing a little heavier but we build up to that we don't want someone to start out just doing 30 minutes if they have never been active before because then that's going to cause them to be sore it's going to cause them to be very fatigued from that and then they're not going to want to do that just start slow and you're right any activity is good as far as taking more steps in your day and being more active and moving more but having a regular schedule time and doing some of these aerobic activities such as walking at a moderate pace you could jog you could ride a bike swimming and even some of our outdoor working outdoors and doing our chores outside it can be regular such as you're raking our leaves sweeping those are all things that can really give us some aerobic activity vacuuming and doing some housework but it's very important that we have and have that every day and start out even if it's five minutes a day that is better than zero minutes sure so right you want to start out five minutes and work your way up each week adding just a little more the more you do it the easier to get that's right you build your stamina to that's know you're going to have more energy you're going to feel better and I'll tell people you know at first don't watch as far as your weight numbers so much because you're going to see your blood pressure your blood sugar your blood cholesterol levels and just in general how you feel you're going to see that happen first before you see the number on that scale go down so hang in there you will get so used to it that your body will actually miss it when you don't get to do your regular daily exercise but I encourage people think of that exercise as your medication that you've got to take every day sustain your life because it really is important for everybody right yeah and i think you know we hear people say well i really can't do this because my knees hurt or you know but like you said just a little bit and you know work up and i think people would be surprised just how they can start changing you know their ability all right you know what they can and their tolerance of what they can do that's true and you mentioned something very important there are people that have some aches and pains some pre-existing health problems especially if they've been overweight sometime they may have some bones and joints and problems like that they need to check with their health care provider on the activities that might be right for them there's a lot of great activities they can do sitting and there's some activities they can do in the water that would be a lot easier so I tell people talk with your healthcare provider for that reason and let them know because you do want to be safe when you're doing it and if they already have have had some history of some health problems and then there's some exercises that may not be right for them but everybody can exercise sure absolutely body no matter if you have to do it from a chair if you can't stand up for long periods there is an exercise for you so just talk with your healthcare provider and find out where you can get started and believe they'll feel so much better and they will actually get more about mobility and probably have less aches and pains when they do start moving more right yeah yeah that that just helps the flu it around the joints and it also helps your balance you know the more you're exercising and that's right moving about it will prevent further injury will print and prevent lower your risk for Falls sure yeah well you know because I I know when when you think of exercise you think well going to the club but there's a lot more exercise than just you know going to the club so you know I think everyone needs to be encouraged to to step out as far as we've talked about you know if you're smoking and you know how can you quit smoking water what are some ways that our community provides resources for that well yes we have a lot of resources provided for those that who use even tobacco it's not just smoking it's any tobacco use that affects our body what happens is what makes up that that's in the tobacco use of cigarette a lot of the chemicals can affect our body in this way it causes our blood vessels to get smaller and if our blood vessels are already having smaller blood flow because we have that extra plaque collecting on the inside and then they're even smaller themselves that further increases the risk for their heart attack or stroke cutting that blood supply off to a very vital part of our body so finding some help to stop smoking or stop our tobacco use is so important and I know a lot of times we have people that come to our classes for diabetes learning sessions we will tell them make that your first goal if you are willing and you are ready then let's talk to your healthcare provider about your options what you can do through your healthcare provider their medications that can help because it is a very strong addiction and the body will have some withdrawal symptoms so they may need some medication to help with that too slowly wean them off of that or those nicotine packet has patches the Lawson just gum whatever works best for them and they say that it takes up to 15 times for someone to actually quit 15 tries so don't give up if you've tried to before you you can do it when it's right for you and if you've got the right resources so not only talking to our doctor about what how he can help us we can contact our local health department because we offer smoking cessation classes and they're offered in most of our counties that we have if not all of them so they can call their health health department find out the class schedule that's upcoming and any resources that we could have to get in their hands right then if there's not a class coming up soon and the most important thing that they can do that's available 24 hours a day is call our 1-800 quit now smoke smoke free hotline that is manned by trained professionals and counselors that know exactly what ways they can support you and you contact them and they will contact you as much as you want them to but they have resources right at their hand to help you when you are having those cravings when you are having those troubles and trying to get through and when you need a little bit of extra help it is so important that our state has that one 800 quit now to help people stop with their tobacco use and so that is a wonderful resource and I encourage it and pass it along all the time for people to give that a try right and check those resources out yeah and I know now between now and July if they call that line if you are eligible that you're able to get nicotine replacement from them for a couple months so it definitely is a good time to to call if if people are thinking they want to quit that's right alright so as we you know come to a close here of all the different things that we've talked about what Julie what would you say would be when you think of all the things you know that we've talked about the soluble fibers and the omega-3s and all that what would be one or two of the foods that you would recommend that everyone should should really have in their grocery cart 20 well I do have examples thank you i do have examples here that that i use all the time and just easy ways that you can another thing that a question that we get asked all the time in our classes is you know what's the best type of margarine and just know that the heart of the margarine like a stick margarine it's going to have more saturated fat but a liquid margarine is going to be more more unsaturated and the body is going to recognize it more also people say what's the best kind of oil well regardless of what all you use don't use very much and so that you know in some type of vegetable oil it can be safflower oil sunflower oil canola oil but use some type of vegetable and so be very very careful with the amount of wool and so the other thing is about there's different types of unsaturated fats that are good for you and one of them is something called a monounsaturated fat and that's actually in peanut butter and I've got an example of natural peanut butter sure here and very went in all my classes we talked and I make many converts to this natural peanut butter it has all at the top so you do have to mix it in with the butter below the peanut butter right but the ingredients are actually peanuts and salt and that's I think what we need to you know remember when we're looking at foods with you know you really need to keep it more and more natural the better for you closer to the farm better for the body closer to the farm bed of the body commercial peanut butter actually has a lot of shortening added a lot of sugar at it it's actually more like a peanut spread and it has a high it's actually Heinkel a saturated fat so go toward the more natural peanut butter and again I've got a broad an example yeah that's that's great well thank you thank you for coming and talking about this important information and I just hopefully you have learned the importance of having your cholesterol levels and those labs done at the doctor's office and hopefully understand a little bit more now when when your doctor tells you you know what your levels are we want to make that choice of having a healthier living and make februari your month for having a healthier life thank you for watching our show we'll see you next time you", "T1tj62nRWf4": "waters up everybody and welcome back to another product review for today so check it out okay guys for this product review video I'm going to be trying some edibles and I know this is crazy because we don't really review edibles much on this channel now really quick before we get into this let me kind of explain why I don't really do a whole lot of edibles and it's not because I don't like edibles I love edibles okay the reason that you guys don't see a whole lot of edibles on this channel is mainly for the fact that here in the state of Oregon edibles is limited to 50 milligrams for recreational so anybody 21 and up you are limited here in the state of Oregon to only 50 milligrams now you can buy multiple you can buy multiple but that can get rather expensive okay that can get rather expensive especially when some of these edibles are like 15 20 25 bucks okay so 50 milligrams that's weak sauce I agree with you I know what anybody's gonna say in the comments section on this video they're gonna be like 50 milligrams that's [ __ ] that's weak sauce blah blah blah blah blah blah don't take it out on me please that is just what the state limits us and I can't really help that okay medical gets a hundred milligrams so if you're a medical marijuana patient you got your medical card you can get access to a hundred milligrams but that's still not much better okay because a few years ago before 2015 you could get like thousand milligram if not more you know like I had a 16 a hundred milligram edible lollipop once and it was phenomenal okay so before that before the legalization happened we used to be able to get all different kinds of stuff and they were very well priced so without further ado let's get into this edible review alright so for this review I have here this awesome rice krispie treats all right they are bite-size as you guys can see I rice krispie treats now I'm multiple because they're 50 milligrams each I have three here they were about six dollars for wreck or a recreational a little bit cheaper for medical of course so I bought three of them that's about a hundred and fifty milligrams total I still know that that's not a whole lot okay I know there's tons of us out there that'd be like like $500,000 but but I mean like he's not bad right not bad I could have just got one and been like hey guys here's my 50 milligrams it's gonna be great all right no but I got all three so I can at least feel something another reason why you don't see me do a lot of edible refuses because 50 milligrams 100 milligrams for me stuff like that it's not I'm not gonna feel it okay I have a high extremely high tolerance okay so I need those like four or five six hundred milligram edibles in order to really really feel it that's um I believe there was a person who wants to comment in my last edible video I did a long time ago and they said something like oh he got so high he forgot to come back and tell us how it was which is not true because the truth is is I kind of felt it a tiny bit a little bit so you know what I mean like for somebody who has a low tolerance for somebody who doesn't smoke a lot or doesn't take a lot of edibles stuff like that 50 milligrams is gonna is going to be right where you need okay 50 milligrams is gonna do the job if you're like a beginner or if you're somebody who has extremely low tolerance 50 milligrams is all you need but for us like me who dab all day long and smoke and all that kind of [ __ ] I have a high tolerance I have to at least get three of these even to feel like the slightest bit of a buzz okay so here we go we're gonna go ahead and get into these now these are the can of Krispies cannabis treats bite size 50 milligrams they take it says it takes about 60 minutes for activation that kind of ranges depending on the person depending on your body size stuff like that that could range that could be 30 minutes all the way up to an hour and a half of edibles to kick in anywhere in between there right I love that these are bite-size because I'm not one of those people that like to eat a whole [ __ ] [ __ ] ton of sweets just to get especially a small little milligram as 50 milligrams okay so I like that their bike size I really do if they would have not been bite size if it would have been like a big-ass chunk for only 50 milligrams I would have complained I would already instantly be downing this this review but the fact that their bite size is even better oh you can chase the canvas not much it's not like a strong taste but you can faintly taste it you can faintly taste it mmm all right let's get the rest these [Music] [Music] oh all right so I've eaten all three all right it's gonna take a little bit to kind of feel them if if I feel it because again it's only 150 milligrams which I should feel something right like you should feel something even if you do have a high tolerance should feel a little bit of something you know what I mean yeah that's just my opinion in my thoughts these were good they tasted great they're Bitesize I love it the fact that they're only six dollars to me they could be a little less than that that's the only kind of complaint that I have here with this product is the fact that six dollars for bite size little edible fifty milligrams it's alright it's alright it's a little push in it but it's alright it's still affordable okay Joe only because I remember back in the day you used to be able to get fifty milligrams for five dollars or less okay you know you know 100 milligrams ten bucks or less you know and so on so forth you know but not bad a taste great tastes like a good rice krispies it's got a little bit of an aftertaste to it you could definitely kind of taste the lead on the aftertaste like right now I can still kind of taste it a little bit like I could tell that it wasn't all just rice krispies hi if I was somebody who never had cannabis before I'd be like did you use something different in this recipe kind of tastes a little odd you know little little tinge maybe yeah you know that would be my reaction to because like I said the aftertaste you can taste a little bit however it's not a super strong pungent weed taste it's not one of those edibles that you'll eat and go oh you know what I mean it faintly tasted it's very mild okay overall it's a good edible it's definitely something I'll give a thumbs up for I will if it affects me if if I can feel a good high off of it if I can feel any kind of a high off of it really I will come back and do kind of like a follow-up for this if not then just know that I pretty much just did this review for the taste and you know the overall just checking it out you know what I mean it's not so much of the high alright because I like I said like I explained early in the video I need a little bit more than that for me personally and again this is just for me personally okay others it might not need that much and then other people might need a lot more so it depends on you depends on your tolerance and it depends on you know where you're at with your cannabis usage all right so much love guys I hope this video is somewhat entertaining and informational if you guys like this channel if you guys like this video if you like me hey remember

feeling a little Spacey feeling it very mildly it's kind of a little relaxing it's a little creeping up if you will but I thought hey hey what's up the stakes a little bit all right shall we shall we up the milligrams now really quick let me just apologize for this being kind of an extra long video I'm sorry about that I will try my best to fast-forward through the parts of me eating so we'll kind of shorten the length now but anyway I got three more here now these are the cocoa ones okay so they have the regular ones these are the cocoa ones Cocoa Krispies and I got another three so it's another 150 for a grand total of 300 milligrams which some people might be like I am that's nothing that's that's weak sauce ba ba ba ba ba which yeah you know it is but whatever what we're gonna do it hmm so alright first one up here we go now again the same company this is the same company these are just the cocoa ones 50 milligrams each bite-sized edibles all right and you got to make sure that you get like all of them I'm sure all the little chunks and pieces don't let anything little pieces go [Music] you [Music] all right so there it is 300 milligrams I'm gonna come back in another hour hour and a half or so and I'll let you guys know how the effects are which should be a lot greater shouldn't be like super high it's not gonna be like uh like a Drunken level of high you know where I must like oh I'm so uh you know it's not gonna be like that however it should be you know I should be able to feel it pretty good should get a good you know nice feel from it so we will be back with you guys here at about an hour yeah about an hour hour and a half and we will see how this works all right so it's been about another hour and a half and feeling all right feeling all right a little a little more Spacey a lot more relaxed to feel nice and relaxed I could definitely fall asleep right now I could tell you that right now edibles are great for that in my opinion if you ever need something to help you fall asleep just load up on some edibles don't don't take too much okay don't take too much know your limits okay know what works best for you but I do love edibles I do love hi milligram edibles I should say and they're all all right there all right it sucks see if it takes so many just to get you know the milligrams that I took or more like that's crazy that you have to eat so much like if you're somebody who's just taking edibles you're not even smoking you're not even dabbing you're not even doing any of that other stuff and you're just taking edibles like this you're probably gonna be diabetic after the first like eight to 12 months okay I'm just saying just saying with how many you have to buy to get the correct milligrams that you need that's crazy okay anyway I hope you guys found this video entertaining much love please smash that like button show that support and hey if you'd like to see more content just like this thing consider subscribing

out here [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh dang braid them [ __ ] go hey are we salad clouds around", "UJ8xcuQnB4A": "plus new episode I'm good at showing you on my training sessions now because I'm full experiment I trained twice a day now besides when I train legs weakness bigger that's enough other than that I'm going to start now let's take one back and I just received these reps and I'm gonna make a giveaway on my Instagram so whenever I post this video online the giveaways have already started I'll have it long enough so we can take part so in communities and also a pair of lifting straps also from wild sport yep take part in yeah so let's start back alright so first of all this like I do it before every workout over your face yeah I like hold it I'm in the top attraction you try to poke you in the forehead not to your chin and so then I see the little bit forward tension all the way down but like this case is pulled down with it support over that's activate that's the back but without using the bicep so I try to pre-exhaust the back without using the bicep because in every other back exercise basically need it if this pre-exhaustion you will fail because your back fails are not your bicep so otherwise your bicep cooks be able before your back and then to train your back as efficiently if it's a failure which is what we want to do first you can also do it as well as the drop set that's not which train to trace them pulled up and push down and try to keep the rope far away from you the closer it is you the war it's like a lap pull down all right now we're at the lat pulldown it's a basic exercise and it's actually pretty easy put on to see many people not doing it correctly but that's a secret but in an impossible way so what you want to do is like wanna grab further than your so I like to grab my great pushing elbows to the front then [Music] and always just the chest out push it out very proud all the way from scratch yes them [Music] [Music] [Music] bend over goes now I try it when I do a back routine I try to incorporate all of the grips so neutral grip has been fun laughter this pronated grip that's what we just had we have a pronated grip again but now we're focusing more on the upper back before we focus on the blacks now it's more the upper mid-back and the thickness of the back so next thing we're going to do is the neutral grip [Music] with a supinated grip like this and we have like covered all of the angles and that's what we want to do hit a body part is one hit from all the angles and again overall development and a nice proportion disease so yeah start out now they're pretty like this somebody have you said but that's not what it's about I'm sure what I do in them on what time to do all right so I'm gonna do regular dental stuff so I did the bent over rows before normally we have here and tape through that anymore and between switch didn't see but they do some leg braces sometimes and I do then to stretch my spine because everything everything happening over the roller back rather than like impress your spine so it's really good to do at work in between you can stretch this line so to do that and it also stretches your rest which is also good so just hanging if you can't do leg raises just hanging on apart simply that stretching your lats and stretching your spine it's very good by itself and should actually do it every day before that come I'll try to do now without the rest let's see how many I can do because I don't want I only want you so much I really need straps so I tried it well but when I'm in weight they're right where my the weeks back I think I can now as we did not do the neutral grip by now we're going to do gross and I'm going to walk like to my belly button to really focus on the lower part of the lights if I use momentum is this contention if you don't feel your lats correctly like perfectly then try to lower the weight and focus on the contraction focus on the bypass of connection and try to hold the top contraction and until you get this my muscle connection as long as you don't have it to it control if you have it then you can't use momentum to push out like all you've done yeah so far so good [Music] Oh momentum that we [Music] all right now should be getting what I eat and post-workout right away this is unsmooth apple juice some raisins and quick oats so I got very fast caps medium fast carts like applesauce and so light hits the carbs the quick oats I put it in like an hour before so it's a really soft down so that's my post-workout carbs as I train twice a day I really got a brief few very fast and also I drink a shake which is a protein isolate creatine salt is actually in there and because every hydrates you you lose a lot of sodium during the workout so I have to now rehydrate put in some soap I also put in some salt in my intro without to my intro workout is usually a lot of contradiction just slowly nuts look best exist of course but with a very red with very very little insulin output so it's just for inside kind of all races and that's what I do so enjoy your me", "8y-wz_22LN8": "hey guys it's Daniel from meatless pounds calm today we're talking about peanut butter and portion control I really like peanut butter on my toast on my crackers and on my graham crackers but peanut butter is crazy high in calories if we look at the nutrition label two tablespoons of peanut butter has a 190 calories now I'm going for a 45 calories serving of fat so what I'm gonna need is about a half a tablespoon so if a tablespoon is 32 grams a quarter of that or a half tablespoon would be 8 grams easy math so to get 8 grams out of here and I eat this stuff eight grams at a time it's a lot of digging I just use my scale and I used the the negative weighing technique that I've shown you before so I turned on zero out the scale and then using my knife I remove about 8 grams this takes two hands as the charge about empty that's six and there's eight grams so you grab some peanut butter on my toast and I just smear it and use it and that's how I do portion control with peanut butter with peanut butter crackers because I'm gonna make three of them I actually do three grams each per cracker four cracker sandwich so I get actually nine grams of peanut butter but who's counting so weighed your peanut butter one serving for fat is eight grams when serving for protein is 16 grams yeah it's much cleaner much easier and because we weighed every bit that came out of the jar you've read a lick the knife oh hey before you go click over here to see some of these videos that are produced or click up there to go to my website see ya", "rYy5PxzFNXs": "[Music] you show we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review I got a bottle opener and why do I have a bottle opener because new first here on wheats we are taking a look at our first cannabis soda that's right guys our very first cannabis soda this is the orange wreck by cush town they claim it's lab tested and a hundred and fifty milligrams I got this for a very good deal buy one get one free for ten dollars so five dollars each which doesn't leave me with a lot of confidence got it from a delivery guy I think it was cheaper because there was no tax so I assume he's delivering illegally Shh so uh sorry Long Beach I what I didn't realize I wasn't paying taxes that gets me off the hook I don't know who cares today we're talking cush town orange red orange soda orange wreck hundred and fifty milligrams of THC they claim to be lab tested although they don't show any lab testing results here and it was bottled by cush town sodas in Santa Clarita California it's got nutrition facts there on the side this bad boys got a hundred and thirty calories in this twelve ounce bottle I have no idea how to expect this is going to taste I hope it's gonna taste okay but I drinks can go either way drinks can sometimes be really really rough especially high potency drinks can sometimes be very disgusting like zas an incredible incredible product loves ASP but tasted disgusting and being carbonated could make it even worse because you can't really just sort of pinch your nose and drain it down if it's carbonated well let's uh stop building up the anticipation and just give it the taste test bottle opened give it this old smell smells like orange soda with a slight cannabis odor so here we go the orange soda orange wreck by cush town tbh that's not bad at all Wow very little cannabis taste to taste speak of the orange soda is pretty good not the orange iasts orange kind of a more neutral kind of orange II taste not the fruitiest of taste but really quite good and the least the most inoffensive cannabis taste I think I've had in a beverage so let's hope it's actually a hundred and fifty milligrams let's hope it was they're not lying about their lab tested results yeah I like that quite a bit hmm well in terms of taste I think we have my new favorite edible beverage edible beverage that doesn't seem right cannabis beverage but it's not about the taste the taste is only a small part of what you actually care about what you really care about guys is doesn't work is it gonna get you high and for that you need to wait just a couple of seconds me however I'm gonna wait two hours and I'm gonna come back to you and finish up this review and let you know if this products actually working because that's what you really care about so guys I will see you in two hours for you just a couple of seconds thanks for watching waits see you in a bit [Music] [Music] you guys get the idea it's [ __ ] unfortunately it's not the worst edible I've ever had a there is some effect to it I would say it's sort of like smoking up you know kind of like an hour after smoke and maybe a couple of bowls that like lingering kind of high it actually was a little bit more so earlier but I found the high faded really quickly it's sort of peaked at like 45 minutes and then went down not that it peaked anywhere anything worth a hundred and fifty milligrams not even close as a matter of fact I feel like it wouldn't be more harsh with them for their fabrication of their lab tested lie right there I mean like how audacious do you have to be to lie about your I mean they don't back it up in any way shape or form they just remind me of Voodoo sours which also claimed to be award-winning but didn't tell you what award they had one it's really audacious and its really sucks because it's really it's certainly not one hundred and fifty milligrams it might be in the realm of like 30 to 40 somewhere in there I really enjoyed the taste that was a very positive part of the review but that was also a red flag for me that along with the price getting to for $10 I want and the almost Pleasant tasted to it were both big glaring sirens this is fraudulent and it turned out to be don't waste your money on cush town guys I'm gonna review one more of their products I think will review their lemonade in the future just to double-check maybe I got a bad batch you don't want to you know totally rip them if this was just an anomaly I mean they shouldn't be selling products that you know even can infrequently not make you high but my guess is that these guys are a bunch of liars and a bunch of con artists because this is not a hundred and fifty milligram product and I don't care if it's not if it doesn't cost a hundred and fifty milligrams worth of you know if it's not equivalent amount you still don't lie about what's in there it's really really really deceitful and really awful so the cush town orange soda orange wreck is a complete pass for me I mean I got it for about five bucks and it kind of got me a little little high for a little bit so it's not a complete waste but don't don't support shitty business practices like lying about how potent you are Pass pass on them pass on them as I said I will be reviewing them once more so we will see if there's any reason for any kind of indication but I seriously doubt it so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "IwG015dJRj8": "hey what's going on everybody this is sanitary 103 again so in this video I'm at the grocery store and I'm going to be going over some things that I typically get when I go and also go over some tips on certain items that you need to avoid so right here you're looking at some pretty made chicken salads these are not too bad or like 399 a pop and if you buy more than 3 I believe you get a dollar off at your local Safeway store so inquire about that the things you want to avoid are like the cheese and the extra dressings also over here when I typically get once in a while or some chicken cacciatore it's already pre-made 3 minutes in the microwave and it's like 300 calories total yeah like over 30 grams of protein and hardly any carbs so that's pretty good if you're on the go and you don't have time to cook and moving right along over here you got some rotisserie chicken these are ready to go ready to eat they're very warm very tasty you could split it up into two meals I do that once in a while it's very good and a lot of flavor and they also have some other like turkey and other stuff the next thing that we're going to be going over as I'm moving my shopping cart or the lunch meats now sandwiches are a pretty good option to have trying to eat clean I typically get like turkey or ham I stick with the organic or low you don't have to but with the organic you get less nitrates less fillers a little bit more expensive obviously if you're on a budget it's not the end of the world if you don't go with organic but I try to go as clean as possible but every once in a while I'll deviate and get some salami this is a light salami salami is a little bit higher in fat so you got to be cognizant of that but it's okay to mix things up once in a while it is high in protein and low in carb and here are your other cuts of meat your roast beef your hands cetera et cetera now here are some items that you probably should avoid these right here are glazed donut holes they are tasty but if you're trying to lean out and be healthy Stan they're not very good obviously four pieces 210 calories a lot of fat a lot of carbs a lot of sugar not that much protein so at all cost try to avoid these here's a random tickle-me-elmo don't know I have that the next section right here is the bread aisle you want to stick with 100% wheat bread avoid the white bread at all costs so that's Safeway they have the guys behind right there yeah my wish there's a the Alvarado bread is the organic bread I have used in the past 50 calories per slice although I have upgraded to Julian bakery calm which you can only get us from stores but this bread is not too bad if you can't get to Julian bakery the next section we have here is the seafood aisle now I typically have fish about once a week fish is a very good source of protein low and car behind the sand is very loaded with omega-3s which are the healthy fats that you want if you want a little bit less fat for a fish with all the protein and all the benefits stick with the tilapia which you see right there the good old alcohol aisle in moderation it's been known to be good for your heart but make sure you don't abuse it for obvious reasons next we have the meat aisle there are some pretty marinated meals that you can get that I have eaten before and are pretty good they're very easy and very tasty but the one thing you got to worry about is some of these have a lot of sodium so make sure you read the nutritional information for instance this is a garlic or chicken 130 calories per four ounces but look at the sodium so 780 milligrams of sodium that's just way too much especially if you have blood pressure issues so you got to make sure to look at the nutritional information right here surprisingly this steak right here you know 4 ounces under 50 calories but look at the sodium in this it's only 70 milligrams only 3% based on a 2,000 calorie diet so you definitely need to read the information and not just grab something to say oh it's protein I'm gonna throw it in now you got to make sure you know what you're doing right here you got the steaks now sirloin is a very good cut of meat so right here is a sirloin a steak boneless almost six bucks pretty self-explanatory you get it more in bulk if you trying to save some more money if you get a little bit more of a discount if you buy it in bulk and that's about it for this section right next to the meat section is the chicken everyone knows about chicken especially if you're trying to build some muscle and stay lean so you got some breast tenders there's all sorts of kind you get the ones that are already cut up you can get the organic non-organic you buy it in bulk get the filets or you can just cut them up yourself like these right here this is organics a little bit more expensive for obvious reasons so chicken is a good source of protein next we have the frozen food aisle now one of the reasons why I go to the frozen food aisle is to get my frozen berries now I put frozen berries in my protein shake it's very good it makes the protein shake like a fruit smoothie I love the berry family I love the strawberries I love the blueberries what you see right there I love the raspberries and there are a very good source of antioxidants one cup seventy calories low in fat they have some carbohydrates but they also have a lot of fiber and also another reason why I go to the frozen food aisle is to get my frozen vegetables as you get the stir fry mix there's an asian-style vegetable one right here there's also another vegetable medley with asparagus right here this one's really good asparagus carrots cauliflower got some other things and the third reason why I go to the frozen food aisle is the fish sometimes I get the fish and right here this is stuff that you probably know avoid now this is fish so you might be saying oh it's you know it's good it's good pretty healthy but it's breaded so going to be careful look at that two fillets 260 calories and all that sodium a lot of fat so be careful and in contrast if you compare the Gordon's with all that bread and all that fillers compared to the Pacific cod which is less altered no breading this is much cleaner it's only like 1.5 grams of fat 30 grams of protein look at this less sodium less cholesterol no carbs same thing goes for the other frozen fish that I typically get which is a tilapia fillets same concept you don't get the breading look at that three ounces 97 calories hardly any carbs or fat here's another thing that I get from time to time if I'm pressed for time this is a Greek brand chicken skewers they're already pre-made you just put it on the oven and they're ready 130 calories for one skewer a little bit higher in sodium but it's a good option once in a while next we have the beverage aisle and what you're looking at right here is soda if you're trying to lean out you're on a diet or in general just be healthy you want to stay away from soda as too many artificial sweeteners aspartame and regular soda has too much sugar which you want to stick with as a healthy alternative is water now this is bottled water I do want to do a video on tap water versus bottled water so I might do that in the future but bottled water is definitely better than soda is it better than tap water like I said that's for another discussion and moving right along it's going to move the car hope you guys are having a good time with me shopping with sanitary kind of cheesy but uh so here are the junk food aisle man this the aisle is pretty nuts right all these potato chips all the stuff that tastes good but it's bad for your belly so I'm going to grab one of these chips right here and look at this information is it the Cheetos good old Cheetos let's see so twenty-one pieces hundred fifty calories ten grams fat no cholesterol there's some carbs that wasn't too too bad if you stay within the serving size but like most people who eat the serving size right most people eat like two or three or four times the serving size at the end of the aisle is a beef jerky beef jerky is a little bit higher in sodium but in moderation it's completely fine they don't have the organic beef jerky at this Safeway but it's not to about 80 calories per serving only three carbs so that's a good option to munch on every once in a while and the good times keep rollin right guys now we got the candy aisle god this is like temptation City right too much sugar let's just put it that way too much sugar bad for your teeth did I say too much sugar already I think idea let's get a Hershey bar right here and upside down look at the attritional information on this block five blocks things 190 starts a little bit blurry 12 grams of fat 23 carbs 19 grams of sugar so you want to avoid that so stay away from the candy people and next we have the fruit juice aisle now similar to soda you need to be very careful with the fruit juice aisle now granted fruit juice does contain less caffeine than soda but a lot of fruit juices can be actually worse and have more calories and more sugar or take for instance writer 100 percent juice it says don't be fooled by that gotta read the nutritional information so let me zoom in so right here 8 ounces at 160 calories but that total carbs is 40 and 39 grams of sugar that's for 8 ounces that's actually more than your typical Coke or Pepsi so stay away from that and next we have the nuts aisle now seeds and nuts are very good healthy snacks to have they're better than candy bars and potato chips so peanuts are high in fat but they are loaded with the healthy fats and low in saturated fat 180 calories low and carb got some fiber and a good amount of protein so a handful of nuts from time to time to keep your appetite at bay is not too bad next we have the serial section I typically stay away from most serials because they are loaded with sugar and preservatives I tend to get plain oatmeal and add some like fresh fruit and set for a good healthy breakfast but some people do like cereal you probably want to avoid most of them especially if it's a frosted or something like this one this one overall is not like too too bad I think cinnamon toast is worst but probably isn't something that you should be eating on the daily and right to the right of the cereal or the chewy bars the breakfast bars as they call it and good old pop-tarts I love pop charts they're pretty damn tasty right but if you look one pastry 200 calories going to pay the price for it next we have peanut butter I usually get organic all-natural peanut butter I usually have at least one tablespoon with my protein shake or sometimes if I have a sweet tooth I'll have some peanut butter just plain it's very good as satisfies my sweet tooth high in calorie but good healthy fats next we have the protein bars now you need to be careful with protein bars just because protein Marnie might be saying oh yeah let me get this it's going to be good amount of protein on a builds muscle but protein bars are kind of like candy bars with a lot of protein they're filled with a lot of sugar and let me turn this one around and I'll give you an example one bar turned 50 calories 9 grams of fat and there's about 24 carbs it's not too too bad but if you're trying to just get in your protein for the day and using bars to get them in it's not a good idea because you getting too many calories and in contrast if you want to get some protein in without all those extra calories get some egg whites look at this three tablespoons 25 calories zero zero zero across-the-board and a lot of good protein and you also want some complex carbs to fill you through your workouts and to also give you energy throughout the day so this is a Uncle Ben's 1/4 of a cup 170 calories they're slower digesting very clean calories and here is what I call heaven heaven for health freaks right this right here is at most grocery stores the outer aisle this is the fresh produce this is the fresh fruit so where you get your salad your fresh corn on the cob this is the non processed area look at all these luscious greens right here this is awful fiber a lot of your carbs should come from all these greens got some complex carbs for energy which potatoes your celery your lettuce your carrots the list goes on and on there's kale organic broccoli right there we're getting ik celery green veggies as far as I'm concerned are free calories so fill up on those this is a small little organic section as well you got some various fruit you got some grapes organic blackberries raspberries again got some good old strawberries I love berries as always so you definitely want to spend the majority of your time on the outer aisles at the most grocery stores next we have the seasonings aisle now the seasonings aisle is very critical if you want to stay on your diet because plain chicken just tastes nasty right but if you douse certain proteins with too much salt it's not very good for you so a good alternative right here salt free mrs. - this is a garlic herb and if you look across the board at the nutritional information it's pretty much a zero across the board that's about it I'm at the checkout stand and when you go there don't be tempted by the candy they want your money but you're gonna resist and say you know thanks again for watching another video make sure to try to stay with wholesome foods foods that were meant to be eaten on this planet comments and questions always welcome thanks once again see you guys next time", "N368pIoEs3Q": "hi everyone welcome back we are going to be going through chapter 2 today using dietary recommendations food guides and food labels to plan menus so the cool thing is there's a little bit of overlap here with the first chapter and when we start thinking about group projects it's still in a couple of weeks away but it is nice to have something to refer back to I highly recommend reviewing the slides at the end of this PowerPoint because they will be really helpful with the group project so some learning objectives we're going to be talking about my play the US Dietary Guidelines and then we're gonna be going through reading through a food label so we'll go through that at the end and we'll do some practice all right this is my plate some of you may have seen this before if not you're seeing it for the first time this is a really great basic place to start I start all of my students out with this and all of my clients if they're children I tend to go with this one especially for children and parents there's another MyPlate guideline that's from Harvard that I really like it's called my healthy eating plate if anybody's interested I can email that out it's a little bit more advanced than this one but this is a really great place to start and everything that we talk about in this presentation is going to come back to this image so if you want take a picture or take a screenshot or look it up online and just have it in front of you it's a really great way of thinking about eating healthy so this is a really good example of eating healthy eating a variety and eating a balanced meal which we talked about a little bit of those concepts in Chapter one so if you look on the left there's fruits and vegetables one thing that I always tell my patients is when you look down at the plate you want to see that the plate is colorful that's gonna be your fruits and vegetables grains you want a portion of grains and a portion of protein so in chapter 3 we get into grains and I believe chapter 4 is fat and I believe chapter 5 is protein so chapter 1 and chapter 2 do a really great overview of the different food groups that you're going to be seeing and the different macronutrients you're going to be seeing and then chapters three four and five get into the specifics and then in the corner you have dairy for some of us it might look like dairy and then for other others of us if you're not a big fan of milk for example you can replace that with water but we do include the dairy category into this image because its source of calcium which is really great for our bones alright so my plate is a really simplified version of the dietary guidelines of Dietary Guidelines go more in-depth and break this down nutrient density is a term you might see it's the measure of the nutrients provided per calorie and examples of nutrient-dense food include lean meats fruits and vegetables foods that contain fiber vitamins or minerals and a good protein content so I in this slide I go over the Dirty Dozen in the clean 15 I think this is a really great example for any of us to use when we're going to the grocery stores so we talked in the last class about what does it mean for a food to be organic sometimes organic foods can be rather expensive so I include this list and the Dirty Dozen our foods that if you can buy organic it would be recommended only because these foods and this list comes out new every year there's a new list these foods are typically the highest in most pesticides used to grow them so if you can get organic in these that's great if not sometimes buying in season can help oh I wouldn't say avoid these if you cannot buy organic then I would just recommend washing them really really well but the less pesticides we can exposed to the better for our overall health and then another list is the clean fifteen so to save money on these foods they typically tend to be produced with the least amount of pesticides so these are safer to buy non-organic so like let's say you had a and maybe you could afford a few organic items you would try to buy the items on the left and the Dirty Dozen organic and then the items on the right you can have a peace of mind knowing that these were produced the least amount of pesticides on the clean 15 list and so you can buy those non-organic and know that it that they're not covered with a lot of pesticides so it's just a nice little diagram I like both of those and I use them when I go grocery shopping okay so my my plate and the dietary guidelines are based off of a 2,000 calorie recommendation if you have already done your My Fitness Pal account which hopefully you have because that was assignment number one which is due tonight at 4:00 um so if you fill out your My Fitness Pal account you may or may not even be close to this 2,000 calorie range so 2,000 calories is a really like even number and it breaks everything down really nicely as you can see this list here is broken down really nicely based on this 2,000 calorie diet you would have to adjust if your calorie intake is lower or higher um but this is just in general what the dietary guidelines are based off of so they recommend six ounces of grains so in chapter 2 we go we we talk about grade is more but those can also be considered your carbohydrates and then um rice pasta bread so those would all fall on the grains category and then vegetables and fruits so two and a half cups of vegetables two cups of fruit is recommended and this is per what you're seeing here this is this is per per meal so what you're seeing here is per meal it's not for the entire day so just so you have that in mind and then three cups of milk or equivalent and that that and then milk here it's talking about dairy so cheese or if you use like cottage cheese yogurt so it when it says equivalent that's what it means five and a half PSA's of lean meats or beans for any of you who are vegetarian 6 teaspoons of oil 200 and 258 empty calories so this is tricky right so this would be any calories that don't contribute to your overall health is what it means by empty so that would include alcohol or candy or soda so empty calories means calories that are not going to provide any nutrition I don't tend to follow this I mean you can if you were meticulous and you use MyFitnessPal indefinitely for the rest of your life then you would be able to really track the number of empty calories I think that the USDA guidelines wanted to include this so you know that you don't have to restrict you just have to limit or moderate how much of those kinds of foods that you're eating so so it's food for thought it's something to think about and also I did make a mistake this is for the entire day the only change that I would make is the vegetables and fruit you can do a little bit more vegetables and fruit throughout the day so I apologize this is an example for the 2000 calories broken up for the entire day but I you can do more than two and a half cups and more than two cups of fruit a day if you wanted to because these contain a lot of essential nutrients vitamins and minerals and fiber so that was the only only thing I need to make a correction on sorry about that all right so why should you eat lots of fruits and vegetables because they're associated with a reduced risk of heart disease including heart attack and stroke they provide a large amount of variety of vitamins and minerals and fiber and they're low in calories I always like to tell people to eat the rainbow that's why I included this cute little picture so this slide goes over seven ways to eat more fruits and vegetables which are great it's a different way of thinking about how to incorporate fruits and vegetables into your diet for example putting them on a skewer and grilling them adding them to pizza casseroles omelette salads making smoothies creating a dip like hummus you can dip your veggies in there like sliced bell peppers cucumbers etc you can pack different cleaned and cut vegetables and fruit into little Ziploc bags so it's like a grab-and-go snack you can go to the farmers market get fresh fruits and vegetables it's kind of fun going to the farmers market too because you get to see some different produce sometimes that you don't normally get to see in the grocery store and it's kind of to support local farmers and then you're just making sure that when you do buy fruits and vegetables you keep them visible so that way they don't fall to the very back of your refrigerator then they run and then you're like oh man I forgot about those but anyways these are really simple and basic ways of eating more fruits and vegetables I highly recommend checking out the different YouTube videos of different cooks and chefs who are utilizing vegetables and fruits in different ways they can give this can give you inspiration and help you think about other ways of incorporating fruits and vegetables that are not listed here so whenever we talk about whole grain whenever you see that word it's referring to the entire grain which are these three parts the bran which is the outer layer the endosperm which is in the inside and the germ which contains the majority of the fruit of the vitamins and minerals so it's really great to be able to eat whole grains but because you're getting the nutrients that come from all of this so in the next slide we break this down more so in the the bran is typically contains the fiber and then the endosperm right here gives you some nutrients and the germ contains the most nutrients is also where your protein vitamins and minerals are coming from so it's really important to be eating a whole grain because if you just have so for example this chart shows the differences in whole grain and refined grains if you just have the refined grain then you're only getting the endosperm and you're missing out on the nutrients that come from the bran and the germ so there's two terms that are called enrichment and fortification these are really important for you to know for the test so enrichment means vitamins and minerals are added to replace those that were lost in processing so an example of this is bread so a lot of times bread goes through a process where it's stripped it typically becomes a refined grain its stripped of a lot of nutrients and so what happens is the vitamins and minerals that were lost now get replaced so an example of an enriched bread typically will add iron and several buy B vitamins fortification is different so enrichment is when you were when we were processing the flour the flour already contained vitamins and minerals that were essential to our health and we're lost in the processing part and so we're going back in and adding those nutrients that were lost fortification on the other hand is adding nutrients to a food that were not originally present sometimes nutrients are added to increase the amount that's already present so an example of this would be adding vitamin A to breakfast cereal so breakfast cereal on its own didn't have vitamin A but after it's fortified the manufacturers add vitamin A so that way your breakfast cereal has more nutrients essentially excuse me okay so here are really great examples of whole brains I really like this table I got this from the Whole Grains Council org and it's really fun in my opinion because when I think of whole grain I typically default to just brown rice whole grain pasta and whole grain bread but here you see examples of whole grains that maybe you've used maybe you haven't maybe you've tried cooking with maybe you haven't but it's really fun so then you can incorporate these different types of whole grain into your diet and make new dishes using them I know some popular ones are oats in quinoa like I'd said brown rice but some other ones that may may you may have heard of but maybe aren't using or maybe haven't tried yet barley buckwheat I know a lot of people forget about corn I mean it's probably because it's added to so it goes through a lot of processing typically but it is still a whole-grain which is really great okay I've had farro that's pretty good too but some of these I've never tried so maybe that's something that you'll look into trying so as I had said whole grains have more nutrients so hope whole wheat flour has more fiber vitamin E vitamin b6 magnesium zinc potassium when compared to white flour so remember that word enrichment refined grains are enriched so when grains go through a lot of processing and they lose nutrients by federal law those nutrients have to be put back in and typically those nutrients that were lost were these B vitamins thiamine riboflavin niacin fully and iron this is iron stands on its own it's it's own mineral it's not a B vitamin but these four are B vitamins alright so remember I talked about dairy so again the reason why dairy is included in my plate is because it has calcium we go over later that there's calcium and other food groups they're just those food groups just don't have as high of a concentration as most dairy products here this little side note is talking about it's talking about dairy products I don't have as much calcium so cream cheese cream and butter it's mostly fat not some not some and so much nutrients there but they are still pretty tasty okay so next one cup of milk or calcium fortified soy milk is equal to one cup of yogurt or one ounce Parmesan cheese have a cup ricotta cheese and one cup cottage cheese so it's really about how you want to consume your calcium I really like yogurt I really like Parmesan cheese and ricotta cheese I'm not really a big fan of cottage cheese that's a texture thing for me but for any of us who are these are options or if you're vegetarian or vegan you can go with soy milk which if you buy the soy milk that's calcium fortified then typically has the same amount of calcium here's some plant sources that have calcium as you can see here we're looking at 18% 31 percent 25 percent 18 percent of your daily value that means what's recommended for your calcium intake and you look at the plant sources they have it but in lower amounts so you would have to eat more to get the same benefits as as these here so for example one cup of yogurt 18 percent of your daily value if you really like collard greens you can eat two cups of collard greens and you'd be at 16 percent daily value for your calcium so that's an option here that would be harder right you'd have to eat four cups of broccoli I mean it's doable in a day but first not for anyone who you can be vegetarian and eat and have dairy products if you're vegan then you don't so for anyone who's wanting to go vegetarian you can still eat these um eat these food products here so it's really up to you how you want to consume your calcium but it is great to know for anyone who's who is vegan or maybe it's thinking about going vegan these are options for calcium intake as well which i think is really cool collard greens broccoli kale at a mamey bok choy or Chinese cabbage figs and almonds okay so wrapping up the dairy group the why we recommend dairy in our diet is because it provides calcium which is really great for our bones and teeth vitamin D that's it's typically these dairy products are fortified meaning they didn't contain vitamin D vitamin D was added later after its processed this is good for our bones potassium which is good for helping blood pressure and protein which helps build / maintain the body we're going to talk about protein later okay so one thing I just make a note of here eat a variety of nutrient-dense foods there's and be patient I guess with nutrition because it is a new science and with more more research that comes out each year you'll see some recommendations change over the years be open to that in the chapter one at the end of the slideshow there is a slide that has recommendations for where you can look for further nutrition information if you're ever interested and going beyond this course or going beyond the book just email me and let me know and I can send you more resources for you to check out if you're really interested in nutrition and want to keep up on the research and everything that's going on it is a really great skill to build and knowledge to know especially as you're entering into the culinary field this is definitely gonna be it is already part of trends but it will continue to be part of trends especially as people try all these different things out Adkins diet Paleo diet gluten-free diet I mean there's so many out there it's just really great knowledge to have in your back pocket so one thing I always think talk to people about when it comes to their diet is to really be able to look at what you're eating for multiple perspectives you know what you're putting in front of you you can use your creativity when you're cooking you should know yourself personally like for me for example I really like to switch things up some some weeks I eat more vegetarian some weeks I incorporate vegan options some weeks I go all out and I have bacon I mean it really depends on you just as long as you're getting a variety you're getting nutrient-dense foods in there and you're moderating how much you intake and you're not having too much of one thing you may think about food from an entrepreneurial aspect you may think about it from the perspective of a mother or a father or brothers sister partner so there's lots of different ways of looking at food and looking at your diet don't feel like limited okay so again this is just overview we go more in depth on some of these topics in chapters three four and five but just so you have an overall picture foods that typically fall into the protein group include me which might come in the form of beef lamb pork poultry aka chicken and duck or turkey seafood and then non meat items eggs legumes such as beans peas and lentils nuts and seeds and soy products keeping in mind one ounce of meat poultry or protein what this means is how much protein is contained in one ounce of meat poultry or fish the equivalent would be half a cup of cooked dry beans one egg 2 tablespoons of peanut butter one ounce of nuts or seeds 1/4 cup of tofu half a cup of Sawyer bean burger patty I like to include this the book includes it which i think is great it's really forward-thinking there's so many people were trying to become vegetarian and vegan these are their options for protein intake and the nutrients that you'll find within protein obviously on the macronutrient side protein but typically B vitamins and iron for anybody whose thing about going vegetarian or vegan you may in future if you cannot get enough B vitamins or iron you might have to supplement so we can always talk about that later all right so so I just wanted to go over this little no vegetarians should count beans and peas as part of the protein group but meat eaters should count beans and peas as part of the carbohydrate vegetable group so this is really if you're thinking about how much calories you're intake in taking or how many grams of protein you need and how you divide up your macronutrients carbohydrates protein and fat and remember in the first chapter I talked about the different percentages you can use to break up the nutrients your overall say you're at a 2,000 calorie diet you can adjust those percentages remember carbohydrate was like 50 to 60 fat was 10 to 20 and then protein was like 15 to 20 percent so if you're breaking your calories up using those percentages and say you're eating me you can break up the beans and peas into your carbohydrate and vegetable group if that's easier for you okay proteins high in saturated fat so the reason why I have this exclamation point has your caution is just to say like let's slow down and not eat so much of proteins that are high in saturated fat because saturated fat raises the level of unhealthy cholesterol which is called LDL in the blood and that's an increased risk factor for heart disease so proteins that tend to be high in saturated fat include beef pork and lamb depending on the cut ground beef but 75 to 85 percent lean means that this is typically higher in saturated fat so if you can go from for 90 or 95 percent that's even better to lower your intake of saturated fat sausages hot dogs and bacon and really high in saturated fat some lunch and some lunch meats like Bologna or salami and Doug can be high in saturated fat so you want to regulate how much you're in taking to reduce saturated and trans fat you want to look at you want to look at what you're in taking so in the last slide we were talking about animal fats that tend to be higher in saturated fats mmm and then what's the plant plant foods that you would have to look out for that tend to be high in saturated or trans fat include coconut oil products that have coconut oil palm oil or palm kernel oil so but typically plant foods tend to have healthy fats we go over that more in Chapter four so don't feel overwhelmed by this slide we're gonna go over this way more in depth in Chapter four this is just for the purposes of going over the dietary guidelines so if we do intake saturated fats the recommendation is less than ten percent of our total calories should come from saturated fat and zero percent we try to aim for no intake of trans fat because the body can't break that down oh I was just saying that diet and exercise matter so I once had a 40 year old male patient who had had a stroke which is really young so if you ever see a note like this overweight or obesity is and external signs and labs and blood work on internal sign it's really important to be going to our yearly checkups to see where we're at as far as our BMI range we haven't gone over that yet but essentially BMI range accounts for your weight and height ratio so if we fall into the overweight or obese category this is a risk factor for developing heart disease and then our blood work if our cholesterol is high then that's also a risk factor for developing heart disease so the book goes over that and I wanted to go over that too so this picture is an example of a lot of foods that are high in saturated fats I know chocolate we can't you can buy like dark chocolate and you can buy buy chocolate that's lower in fat so this is kind of an exception saying with coconut if you eat the into the coconut whole that has more nutrients then after it's been processed into something like coconut oil so that's why it made it into the image there and then depending on the cheese as you know you can get an milk you can get cheese's and milk in lower amounts of fat but this is just a picture of general to give you an idea what we mean by it's not a trait of fat so here your book lists out foods that are high in saturated and trans fat so foods that are high in saturated fat we've gone over but again things like butters Jesus that are made from whole milk ice cream beef lamb pork and especially poultry with the skin on fried foods and then some grains based desserts foods that are high in trans fat you really want to try to avoid if possible fried foods prepare Bacon's here they're referring to things like donuts those are typically deep-fried frozen pizzas processed foods right biscuit those are two biscuits can tend to be made from shortening so in unless you're making these things from home and you're controlling the type of products that are being used the ingredients that are being used in your recipe that's different what the book is talking about is when you're buying from the grocery store ready-to-eat things or things that are quick to make in the oven or microwave so microwave popcorn ready-made frosting and then some stick margins and shortening here I have a slide on butter which I think I just like to I'm not like I'm not opposed to butter I would just say that we definitely do have to think about how much we're taking in a day 1 tablespoon has 102 calories and then butter is predominantly made up of unhealthy fat if you see here in this chart there's 7 grams of saturated fat account from for the total grams 12 so the majority of the fat that's found in butter is unhealthy poly unsaturated fat and monounsaturated fat are considered healthy forms a fat and here you can see it's only 3.4 grams so depending on where you're at there are healthier alternatives but if you're like I love my butter kind of person then you would try to lower other foods in your diet that halves that are high in saturated fat and anything from this list you can lower the intake of these food items so that you can have a little bit more butter so you can have butter and we're just talking about ratios we're just talking about moderation here I'm not saying you have to get rid of it but I if you were interested in other healthier alternatives I have them here first we're gonna go through margarine because that typically is what people think is the next healthier option but a lot of times these margins are they also have either saturated fat or poly or excuse me or trans fat so anytime you see this word partially hydrogenated oils this is coming up your test so please pay attention the partially hydrogenated oils are an example of trans fat and so these margins right here they do have parch partially hydrogenated oils in them which is trans fat and why we want to be careful or limit how much we're eating of these margarine is because they have trans fat and trans fat I had briefly mentioned isn't broken down in the body very well so that that's why margarine is not always the best alternative to butter these would be healthier alternatives these are vegan butters the cool thing about these is they're typically met made with a vegetable oil blend here this particular brand that we're looking at I believe it's for melt I could be wrong I believe it's from melt I don't think it's for its balance I use Earth Balance at home it's spreadable I use it when I'm cooking um I haven't tried using it for baking yet if anybody does let me know how that went but here you can see this is all plant-based ingredients so for any vegans out there these are options but for anyone who's wanting to go vegetarian or maybe lower their saturated fat intake this is an option you can go back and forth maybe one morning you use butter the next morning you use vegan butter it's completely up to you definitely don't know until you try it because they're they're really good actually I really like Earth Balance melt what's pretty good I just tried a new brand I think it's called mikonos and I think it's available at sprouts I don't shop there often but I have friends that do and I tried that vegan butter it was really good really close to the taste of butter so lots of different options to choose from okay so my plate does include a section for oils but that's not technically a food group the reason why is because they are aware that we use oils in our cooking so and that oils tend to show up in some of our processed foods like mayonnaise or salad dressings so they try to account for them did I let's see I've been reviewing things all day so I think oh one thing I forgot to say is if you wanted to look at the smoke point for different oils you can go to this website and it's kind of interesting so smoke point is the he the point to which an oil is heated up and then begins to break down so that is an option for you to check out and look at I forgot to point that out so you can use oils to cook at home you can use a combination of oil and a little bit of butter vegan spread it's up to you yeah it's up to you I think we talked about that more in the fats chapter though I'm sorry if it seems like I'm going through it quickly or if it seems like a generic example but this this chapter is really to give you a foundation and give you some definitions that will help you for the four chapters three four and five so if there's anything I go through too quickly or something that you need more explanation on please just email me and let me know and I will be sure to explain further so some things that I had already talked touched on empty calories our calories from saturated or solid fats and/or added sugars that add fewer no nutrients to the diet so here's a list and an example of who's that contain empty calories and a picture I really do like the pictures in the book they're really simple and to the point right so but mostly you're seeing on this on this slide are processed foods cakes cookies pastries sodas energy drinks cheese and pizza ice cream sausages hot dogs bacon and ribs so these are examples of empty calories because they don't provide if they provide any nutrition it's very minimal but typically there's no nutrient value so when we're talking about nutrition we're talking about foods that contain vitamins minerals fiber and really are contributing to the overall maintenance of the body what the body really needs these are just kind of like if you will pun intended the sugar on top right the little extra but it really doesn't it mostly just contributes to calorie intake and not so much nutrient intake in this slide I just incorporate where the majority of our salt and/or sodium comes from so a lot of times when I'm talking to patients this is really difficult for them because there they tell me I don't use a lot of salt when I cook but the majority of Americans are eating out the majority of Americans are eating processed food we're eating frozen meals we're taking we're buying takeout or delivery reading out at restaurants and so when what happens is we're eating a lot of processed foods and one that we eat processed foods those foods tend to be higher install examples include pizza processed chicken such as chicken nugget sausage Franks bacon cold cuts many frozen can and can't foods cheese the exception to the canned food would be canned fruits or canned vegetables sometimes if we buy canned vegetables and we don't buy low-sodium those can be high in salt so always go for a low sodium or no sodium canned vegetables because we could we can always add a little bit of salt when we're cooking at home but it's better for us to add it so we're in control of how much salt is being added to our food so in this what I'm gonna be starting to do is incorporating nutrition labels because that will come up on the test you'll need to know how to read nutrition labels you'll also need to know how to read the ingredient list so too much sodium contributes to high blood pressure and a lot of times these I included hot sauces because they tend to be really high in salt so next time you're gonna use a hot sauce be sure to look at the sodium fat or sorry Nutrition Facts and then look for sodium so one thing that I try to point out on the on this nutrition label which I'll break down again but like if you're starting to consider what you're eating a good place to start is the nutrition facts and the ingredient list so the nutrition facts are gonna tell you how many calories per serving we're gonna go over that are in the product and then the macronutrients are always in the nutrition facts so macronutrients are carbohydrates protein and fat so those are always there other things you'll want to look out for in future is from of your carbohydrates how much sugar is is contributing to that overall total carbohydrate sodium and then when you're looking at ingredients cereal C enriched cornmeal so enriched right that means the product corn itself was a whole grain but it was processed to make cornmeal and in that processing it lost its original nutrients so the manufacturers enriched it meaning they added nutrients back into the product and here you'll see they added ferrous sulfate isn't another word for iron and then niacin thiamine riboflavin and folic acid those are those B vitamins I was telling you about so this is a classic example of an enriched food product and those typical B vitamins and iron that are added back in one thing I also try to remind you of our well here you can see I don't always look at this but I think it is important to look at like these different dyes these different colors you can see the cheddar cheese so see this one gram of protein it probably came from that cheddar cheese we choose milk cheese cultures and then there's way so here's some buttermilk so that can contribute to the fat if you look at the the overall what's inside these Cheetos you'll see that the majority the Cheetos are fat which most people wouldn't think and carbohydrates and probably people think carbohydrates but fat I'm sure a lot of people didn't think there was like hardly any fat in these in these chips because most of the time people don't think to categorize chips they're just chips they're just a quote-unquote snack but we really want to limit how much we're eating so this says serving size is only one ounce so if any of you have taken pay any pastry classes and you know you use your scale to weigh out ingredients maybe next time try weighing out one ounce of these Cheetos and see how many Cheetos here it says maybe about 21 pieces but another thing to be think about it's like is that half of the bag is that the entire bag like what we're gonna talk about that in another nutrient label here it normally specifies if how many servings are in the entire bag here it didn't so we'll go over that more about these urges these are things to start thinking about like I said on the test you will be asked to read a nutrient label and tell me what's going on there'll be open-ended questions so our Americans healthy no sadly that's why I included this picture for me as a dietician the struggle is real only about 20% and I think that's honestly a really high percentage I'm not even sure if it's 20% about 20% of Americans meet the requirement for physical activity we go over that in the next slide about 75% three-quarters the majority of Americans have a diet that is low in vegetables fruits dairy and oils so darian oils we can debate on but like this the diet low in fruits and vegetables not good that we need to be better we got it we got to increase that because fruits and vegetables is really what's giving us the most nutrition so the dietary guidelines recommend that dalts exercise for at least 150 minutes per week if you break that down that's about 30 minutes five days a week you could also switch it up to 60 minutes three times a week which you'll still have you yeah that'll have that'll be good too actually let me go ahead and calculate that to make sure I'm telling you the right thing so if you do 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity and our exercise that's 180 minutes 60 minutes three times a week so so you want to try to shoot for that if you're not there yet that's totally fine the book just wants to give you a recommendation so whenever you do physical activity whatever you engage in physical activity you want to incorporate some cardio what does cardio look like running tennis soccer things that were you know you're getting your heart rate up and then you also want to incorporate muscle strengthening exercise resistance band or lifting weights they says resistance band but resistance training can also be using your own body weight so push-ups is an example of muscle strengthening squats or lunges with even without any weight in your hands your body weight alone is another way of muscle strengthening is an is another muscle strengthening exercise so if you are wondering where to start let me know I can shoot you over some YouTube videos for some at-home exercises and then as far as running you can start running outside if you know like right now I know we're quarantined so we shouldn't be going to the gym gyms probably are closed I just run around my area at home so you can do thirty minutes of that and then or sorry 15 minutes of that you can break it up fifteen minutes of that and then 15 minutes of muscle strengthening things that I or that I mentioned push-ups lunges and squats you can do without any weight just your body weight and you want to get your heart rate up and a really good indicator of that is if you can I like this recommendation I got from a dietician if you can do the exercise and talk at the same time you're not working out vigorously enough so you want to be able to struck hope to have a conversation with someone else which means your heart rate is up so it's a good indicator of if you're engaging and engaging in moderate to vigorous physical activity okay so we're coming to towards the end of the slideshow whoo okay so these this is a summary I'm gonna let you read this on your own this is a summary of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans this came out in 2015 and 2020 next year for them it they they will come out the USDA will come out with a new set of dietary guidelines for 2020 and one to 2026 so the next five years so definitely be on the lookout for that that'll be really great you can actually visit this website included right here you can look up Dietary Guidelines and then you can you'll see this as one of the first hits it's pretty cool right now the USDA is asking for our input it says Americans we want to hear you so this is great because they're actually gonna ask us our input on the next Dietary Guidelines so it's pretty cool if you want to check that out and be part of that I think it's really cool these are just different great guidelines for you to review on your own it's this great summary for everything I just talked about I know I talk a lot sorry guys there's a lot to cover in this in this chapter and in most of the chapters our class was set up for three hours so that's how much content I have for almost every chapter it's an hour two hour and a half so I do my best to be thorough but I also do my best to like get through it so I don't want to go too fast but I also don't want to bore you guys so I'm doing my best so we're gonna talk a little bit more about nutrition labels because we really want you to practice to be familiar this is a great skill to have after this class and you have test questions that are based off this so what you're looking at here is an ingredient list so this ingredient list is listed from the ingredient that has the most weight so the if you will the main ingredient - the least ingredient and that is measured by weight that's the explanation here the radiant's are listed in descending order by tweet from the most abundant to the least abundant so in this product for example the wheat flour the is the the most abundant ingredient in this product and again you'll see it's enriched and what is enriched mean you should be able to answer that so pay attention to that like make sure you could be able to answer what enriched means this comes up again and again on the test so make sure you know and just for clarification enriched any enriched product is not a whole grain if we go all the way back to the slide where I compared the two grains I talked about that so just so you remember if you see the word enriched that's a hint that that product is not a whole grain that's gonna be helpful on the test alright so let's practice okay so we're gonna break this down for you these are examples of questions you may see on the test so if someone eats too of this product how many calories is that so here this this is what I was saying that the that the Cheetos nutrition label left out so maybe it was the entire serving was on the back but typically most Nutrition Facts say the serving size and then they tell you how many servings per container so for example this entire container has 12 blueberry muffins in it that's like the it's the product I chose for this example so if you were to eat the entire product the entire package which contains 12 blueberry muffins if you 8th or 12 blueberry muffins in one sitting then you would multiply these calories times 12 because 150 calories is what's found in one muffin so if you ate the entire package then that would be a thousand eight hundred eighteen hundred calories in that entire package so it's really important to pay attention to the serving size the serving size tells you that for one muffin all of these nutrients are found in the one muffin if like I said you ate all 12 in one sitting you would multiply all of these numbers by 12 so sorry I hope that's not too confusing I continue to give other examples and go over it again and again so let's practice one serving size is one muffin one muffin equals 150 calories so if somebody ate two muffins from this container you multiply 150 times two so the answer to this question if someone were to eat two muffins they would have consumed 300 calories okay how many calories come from fat so in this nutrient label this number is included not all nutrient labels include that so the way that you get that number is you think about Helmut see here's the total fat 5 grams per 1 serving so how many calories come from fat so there's a total of 150 calories how many calories of fat are in one gram of fat so if you refer back to chapter one I said that for one gram of fat there are nine calories so you're gonna take this total fat five grams times nine because there are nine calories for one gram of fat 9 times 5 is 45 and that's gonna give you how many calories are a fat are in this one muffin so some nutrient labels include this and others don't make sure you practice this because this is a question from the test okay next what are the macronutrients listed if you remember earlier in this presentation I said that the three macronutrients are included in every nutrition label those macronutrients are carbohydrates protein and fat so when you are asked what are the macronutrients listed that is the answer carbohydrates protein and fat and what are micronutrients we've barely kind of touched on this in Chapter one micronutrients are vitamins and minerals which are found at the bottom oh look at that guys look at the bottom in case you forget some nutrient labels include this now all nutrient labels will look calories per gram 9 calories per gram for carbohydrate four calories per gram for protein 4 so this information is in chapter one but the nutrient fact that I included actually had that not all nutrient facts how that's not that's pretty cool all right so here is an example of some of the current label the majority should have already trans out transitioned over to the new label for your test I will be using the old label the new label they made the calorie font more bald and bigger they tried to make this more clear they put the servings on the number of servings in the package on top and then the serving size they made bold so you could see what a serving size looks like they added that how much added sugar is in the product they added or they switched up the nutrients that required previously was vitamin A C calcium and iron now it's vitamin D calcium iron and potassium yeah those are the major changes okay so these next slides are just definitions these are things that you might come across so an exam an example of low calorie low fat or high in here are the examples these are sometimes food words or definitions that are or phrases I should say that are found on packaging they're tried they're try to get appeal to us they try to get our attention so these this is an example of a nutrient claim that's regulated by the FDA this is different than a health claim a health claim is is an example is diets low in sodium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure so sometimes these health claims are put on packages that are high in fiber or low in salt again trying to appeal to the consumer menu labeling so most of us are familiar with the change not all menus have done this at all restaurants but they're supposed to I think it's really interesting now all restaurants should include the number of calories fat sodium all they're supposed to include all the nutrition info on their menu boards I don't know if you saw that change but I saw it happen at the movie theaters and Starbucks I saw that change where they're now trying to include some of this nutrient content at the front when you're ordering from the menu it's supposed to be there on their menu okay so these were the these were the dietary guidelines that I was saying come back to when you start working on your group project these questions will help you think about the menus that you're being given and how to make those menus healthier so this is more food for thought be sure to review them this is a great resource this is a great resource for you to even think about not only the menu for your group project but more so or I mean even so for you personally on a one-on-one individual basis some of these things you can't answer yet as we go through chapters 3 4 & 5 you'll be able to better answer the majority of these questions and if you have any questions you're not sure what a question means just email me last thing I wanted to do for chapter 2 is give you a preview of what's to come in chapter 3 but also practice more so typically when you're looking at a label the nutrition facts are on top and the ingredients are on the bottom and remember the ingredient list is by weight so the most abundant ingredient all the way to the least and these are exam these questions are examples of what you'll find on the test so these questions are open-ended so be sure to be able to define and describe or answer these questions because these questions won't be multiple choice so the test is majority multiple choice but there are seven to ten open-ended questions and they have to do with the nutrition label and the ingredient list so when you read through the ingredient list look for hidden sugars so a really great indicator is like you might see sugar right you might see that in Chapter three we're gonna go over this more but anything that ends in OSE that's an example of a hidden sugar dextrose cellulose so those two are examples of hidden sugars I can let's see we can go through this more but I think those are the only two so you want to go through that if you start from the top you know that here you're seeing the vitamins again if in the test if you put sugar dextrose and cellulose that's fine you can include that even though it doesn't seem hidden if you're not if most of us who don't take the time to read the ingredient list if we didn't then we wouldn't even know that sugar was added so you can put those three baking sodas your leavening agent sodium calcium xantham gum sap binder citric acid it's like vitamin C natural and artificial flavors contains milk derivatives beta-carotene color that comes from it typically comes from carrots okay so if you had answered on the test sugar dextrose and cellulose you would get it correct is enriched flour considered a whole-grain flour considered whole-grain flour why or why not you know the answer enriched flour is not whole-grain so make sure that you remember that okay and we haven't got to this yet but what is where is gluten typically found gluten is typically found in wheat products so if this product is in enriched bleached flour and you continue reading wheat flour then you know that this product is not gluten free this is also really important I picked these three questions and I picked I picked those three questions in particular and I picked these three questions in particular because these are these are questions that will appear on your test so make sure you review this slide you know you can fast forward rewind this recording so that way you can go back and review those you can look at the slides that I gave you you can print those out if you want and make sure to review this one because those two slides those three questions are very particular because they will appear on your test I hope that you enjoyed this recording thank you so much for listening please let me know if you have any questions there's anything that might be helpful as we move forward please let me know I'm always here to help I'm always willing to listen and anything that can help you guys I definitely want to do I hope you have a great rest of your day til next time", "FOuqi4WeZys": "digestive certain digestive diseases and and how you ought to approach that you know whether I can actually tell you what to do or at least give you recommendations on what you should actually focus on or do next if you have any questions whilst we go you can leave them in the comments and I'll try and get to them if you're watching this from a Facebook group stream yard which is a software I'm using that doesn't let you comment unless you click their link in the description you'll see the description in this video it's like you must click here super annoying but if you're on my Facebook page and you wanna leave a comment and please do let me know where you're from and also you know what your question is and how I can open I'll try and go through those at the end I don't have that much time now I was took me ages just to set up I'm in there I'm in a new room but yeah let's see how we get so I'm just gonna make sure that it is streaming everywhere first and then I'll get to the first questions which which is actually a thyroid I think it's a thyroid question from what I saw I'm gonna attempt to bring it up here now hope everyone's doing well in in quarantine oh one thing I thought I should talk about it's like I see so many people talking about Sweden and how they they're dealing with the corona virus and all that and it's like but then talking to anyone in Sweden they just have these strong opinions well look at Sweden's doing I'm like one person has asked me I live in Stockholm my partner's a coronavirus nurse her mom works in nursing homes and no one's asked me anything about it so funny to see people strong opinions when they they don't really understand um anyway I'm not gonna get into that I just thought it was really funny I was thinking about that when I said I hope you're all doing well in in lockdown or coming out of it and I hope you're having a good Sunday so yeah looks like the streams going well so let's start the first question is I'm gonna try and pull this up on the screen everyone like I said I can't do it for you guys well it's taking away my whole face anyway it says I have Hashim odors currently in remission two years ago I was on the autoimmune protocol AIP well protocol autoimmune Paleo protocol now I'm on a balanced diet including gluten free grains and some seeds everything was okay but for now I've had joint and muscle pain for several months here's my question is it necessary to switch to the AIP protocol for reducing inflammation with such such diseases as arthritis fibromyalgia I wonder what nutrition should look like in your opinion I'll be grateful for your response so the thing yeah with nutrition it's hard right because the conduct the answer depends on who's asking and anyone who tries to tell you very confidently they know the answer probably doesn't it's like if they don't know more about you this is called the dunning-kruger effect insights the more the more you know the more you know you don't know and the less you know the more you think you know so people who don't know much about a topic you know let's say you know a chef potentially a chef who talks about nutrition a lot oh used to they don't know a lot about a topic they'll make absolute statements where they're very confident and that's very reassuring and appealing to people because Allah Arwa he's making these statements like this is yes and this is no very black-and-white statements and then you'll have scientists and and this is happening with coronavirus for example where where people who are very knowledgeable on the topic are not giving very absolute answers at all because they can't and this is the dunning-kruger effect because the more they know the more they realize they don't know so the more I know about nutrition reading that question and then why I dig into say gut health or autoimmune issues the more I realize there's so much more I need to learn there is someone else who has a very superficial understanding might say well I figured it out it's the Paley it's the Paleo diet for example do that the end and so they make a very absolute statements very convincing and compelling but the reality is that they don't you know they think they know more than they actually do and that's very dangerous so to circle back to the question which which let me bring it up again so what's happening here is like you have to look at why if you understand why the diet helps you then you can start making informed long-term decisions about what you should do okay people just like the problem with diet say AIP for example or Kido or whatever you want to do is that they tell you what to do they don't teach you okay they're telling you what to do you follow this list of rules don't don't need these food groups many of these foods yes you can eat these and so on but then you're not actually been taught why because when you understand why and then you become empowered and you can make informed decisions about about what to do next and chances are the diet you're following isn't a sustainable thing it's more of a you know it's pretty drastic but it's because you want immediate change I get it you're in pain or things haven't worked no one's listening to you and you're willing to try anything at this stage and that's fine in the short-term go for it which it sounds like you did with AIP and now you're in a more balanced diet as you say because air P is not balanced but now you need to understand what worked about hey why did AI P help me when you understand that we can start to talk about well what what should you do actually look like how could we help you pivot and tweak and change things so that the the elements that are working for you we understand why and we just apply them to your actual lifestyle and diet okay so you've gone you've gone off AIP and they've had join a muscle pain for several months is it necessary to switch back to reduce inflammation no it's not necessary to do AIP you know arp cops a lot of flack in the science community because it's it's pretty restrictive and it was it's a spin-off of a paleo diet which which is a load of you know I get the principles but it's kind of a load of horseshit like the whole the premise of it it's it's dumb but it's healthy it's definitely healthier than a lot of people do but it's you know if you understand the way you realize you don't have to be paleo you can kind of just tweak and change your own diet you can you can still go out on weekends and have fun things with your friends you don't have to lie that you're not having paleo that you're not following paleo on certain days you know that's what people were doing you can eat like anyway I'm going a tangent to answer the question the okay why look at okay why did AI P help me with my autoimmune issues or my inflammation issues well let's look about let's look at food compounds in the gut for example and things that you might be intolerant to or things that trigger a food sensitivity so I be first looking at the AIP is essentially an elimination diet right so what components of that helped you that's the first thing you need to figure out was it no dairy and and that can help a lot of people either the dairy protein right be a casein alpha beta casein beta casein or alpha a1 protein or a - yeah it's a 1 or a 2 and the thing is a lot of people are reacting to a a 1 and they don't react very poorly to a 2 which is like sheeps and goats milk so that's if you're reacting to the actual protein in in dairy food then you've got the carbohydrate compound so the FODMAPs you probably heard of and these are important prebiotic fibers but they might be irritating you and I don't know a lot about your symptoms for example I'd be exploring if those were an issue as well for you because when you start to pick out what worked and what didn't then you can actually make a more sustainable eating pan you know it doesn't have to be AIP and not a AIP why don't we just take the part so they appear that work for you and then put them into your normal lifestyle your normal diet then you will actually find something that sustainable long term and you know resolve your issue so the other thing is you asked about is it necessary for for diseases like arthritis well depends are we talking about rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis I find we've autoimmune issues like rheumatoid arthritis Hashimoto's hyperthyroidism celiac disease obviously everyone agrees gluten is damaging there but I also find there gluten that's the protein that's not it's not like it's not a FODMAPs no carbohydrates of protein that one in particular a lot of people respond well when they reduce now is it just the gluten is it because there's wheat from Tanza fodmap as well that you're cutting out is it just that the foods that's that are that gluten is in are typically not very healthy for you in cutting those out has you know second-order consequences and effects that are beneficial I don't know but yeah if it's if it's rheumatoid arthritis then then I can see AIP helping because it cuts that gluten and it cuts up potential dairy protein issues as well reducing inflammation like so it's a very it's a difficult thing to measure we're talking about low-grade inflammation right so not like I have a bruise but more like well I feel like my cells are inflamed and it causes me pain and the fibromyalgia which we don't really know but to answer the question is it necessary to switch to the ARP protocol to do that no you want to find out why does it why did it work take those bits and use that and and have someone help you they don't do it on your own obviously it's really difficult right have someone who knows what they're doing help you to tweak and and develop your own eating pattern that takes those good parts that work for you but also fit in the parts that are going to make it sustainable for you so that you know you're you and your family can eat the same meals for example so that you can go out and enjoy eating at restaurants with making informed decisions so you don't have to be all or nothing so yeah that's my long-winded answer to that one but it's just like you know it's so hard for me to answer those questions definitively I'll prioritize you guys who are live on the Facebook page asking me questions so Heather said recommendations for IBS please well assuming you've ruled out it like some things more sinister then you can go a low fodmap diet cap directed hypnotherapy also it seems to be very useful both even better that's what we do in with my clients so if you're interested let me know but I mean that's that's what I would be going down the road of looking at hey do anxiety there's anxiety trigger symptoms one good question to ask yourself is like my symptoms the same when I go on holiday vacation or are they better or are they worse and based off that answer we can start to put the pieces of the puzzle together unless someone knows the more stubbornly they know it that's hilarious oh yeah so true yeah it's looked down in Kruger the more you know the more you know about something the more you know oh how to know that much it's like a lot to learn here I need to like learn more and then you got someone who like doesn't really understand things and it's just like yes this is it here you'll live happily ever after the end I've done it you know I've saved humanity he'll lose belly fat quickly that's well you can't you can lose it not quickly I have fibromyalgia have a fragment iris and tritium mean all neurology I don't know what that is it sounds like something in the brain if if if that's even in the English word can these be helped fibro yes IBS yes I'm not sure about the other ones hyper prolactin if I think about hmm fibromyalgia we definitely work with and can help actually have a video on that the other day if you like this video if you scroll down Donner on my page I did like a little video about fibromyalgia it's like it's five minutes in IBS see I just spoke about that one right with Heather okay I used to have a rectifier with Graves mm-hmm and then radio I didn't stop the fire producing vaccine so now you're on a live rock scene so now your goes to hyperthyroid can I do anything through diet to regulate my thyroid and lose weight please I also have fibromyalgia IBS and endometriosis well so you know you're not alone it's not uncommon for someone to have had Graves then it becomes underactive and then to also have these all these other issues going on Oh you know I'm not and I'm genuinely not trying to like pitch my service or something but it's like you know when it gets that complicated you know the a generic meal plan is not going to cut it for you anymore it doesn't cut it for anyone anyway but like it's definitely like you know you needed some individualized help because a lot of those things are overlapping right and it's snowballs it snowballs the wrong way our health but we can it also snowballs back the right way so if we fix one thing it's gonna help with fibromyalgia symptoms and then you're gonna feel better there and you're you know you know if you've got anxiety or depression or something like that that will improve and then you'll be able to go outside and be more active and that will help with your IBS as well and then the endometriosis will with specific nutrition things we would do for that as well but like everything's gonna help it's like it's just going to snowball and get better and better but you know there's no like there's no meal plan that you know you can follow a meal plans don't work anyway yeah they're great they're great starting point you know that's kind of the start line and then we need to build on it straight away so if I can give you something actionable oh yeah and I generally think an elimination diet will help you at least figure some things out because there's probably some foods you're eating that your your body is not agreeing with right now so I would I do always recommend like for a lot of people they start we start with gluten-free why is it the gluten not necessarily but when you go gluten-free you have to cut out a lot of wheat for up turns as well and so that can help for IBS for example I probably I cut out those see I don't know which is the main issue for you so what to focus on first but I go gluten-free like properly for two weeks if IBS is a big thing I'd cut out onion and garlic as well and see if that helps from there we'd have to make a decision if that helps you or not and so I would start that and just to let you guys know if you are interested in getting one-to-one help for your issue whether it whether it is specific like medical nutrition related or if it's hey you've just got a weight loss goal then coming interested in our I can message you later with some more details about how it would work and okay Rachel odd man cool how long do you recommend people to follow the low fodmap diet for also when reintroducing foods what would you recommend someone to do if they triggered all the food groups well I think a lot of people probably resonate with this one coming yes if that like if that is you you tried you've tried a low fodmap diet and you've reintroduce you tried to reach allenge foods and you're just like we're reacting to everything so the first question how long do you recommend people to follow the diet for not long so remember it's two it's two or three phases but let's say it's two phases right elimination every challenge you don't want to eliminate formats forever they're good for you they're important before you got out there are a lot of them are prebiotic fibers so you're the bacteria in your stomach need to feed on these to flourish and to be in balance and if they're if your gut bacteria are out of balance with all dysbiosis then we we believe it leads to a lot of health issues down the track second-order consequences not necessarily immediate things but later on and that's something you definitely want to avoid and that's the problem with restrictive diets and elimination diets right so you only want to eliminate for as long as necessary before you can reach allenge basically so you know I have some meal plans and stuff and like an online program that's like an introductory kind of thing and I in that I say two weeks and some people takes a little bit longer because it depends on how well they stick to it etc right but if you if you can like get to a point it's all about your symptoms right the point is you want to be able to see if it helps relieve symptoms if it does you just want to be not necessarily asymptomatic but basically where your symptoms are so low or they're not affecting your day-to-day life that if you were to reach allenge your food you would be able to tell straight away and be like oh it was that that thing I ate that cause that because I've been fine otherwise that's where you want to get to okay some people can do that in a week so you know it kind of ranges but shouldn't take that long Rachel if it's been taking you weeks and weeks and months and months then it's not right it's either not helping you or you're not doing it correctly and then when reintroducing foods if you if you you react to everything then there's so many variables right so first I need to think about well I have you doing are you doing properly where you were you completely symptom free or pretty much before you started recharging were you doing the right quantities of foods yeah there's this too many variables these things is anxiety is the mindset and stuff is that a major trigger for you as well and you tell you factoring that in those things what else is going on I wish I could it's like these questions are it should be simple right I can follow that Olo format I can just follow that meal plan and then I'll just follow this reach out on your schedule and you know I'll live happily ever after there's so much individual variation with gut health issues because well what caused your IBS is it IBS what caused the problem is gonna affect on what you react to it's like you know it's it's hard for me to say without knowing you personally but hopefully giving you some things to think about and if you want help send me a message so this one's on YouTube please show how to repopulate the gutter free of histamine intolerance I don't think I understand a question because maybe you want to repopulate if you've been having an antibiotic for a long long period of time but a histamine intolerance well then you would well you would be eliminating the histamine foods or forming foods in your diet and then trying to recharge those very strategically to see what you tolerate and what you don't and it would it tends to differ food by food so now when I talk about histamines I'm talking about food chemical intolerance right that's not for demamp intolerance it's different food chemicals is like hey do you eat things and then you get you get sinus issues or headaches or skin issues like rashes or itchy skin this is when we're talking about potentially food chemical intolerance which is is different you you can you got to sort of figure that out and some people have both I don't find it yeah it's I guess it's it's pretty common to be intolerant to FODMAPs and certain food chemical as well yeah that's something we as well of course so Rachel's extended her question a little bit I think someone trees to all the format' groups when reintroducing what you're a yeah I've IBD the prasada colitis well high permeability weight allergy specific disease being gluten free for a long time suspected celiac disease yeah I mean I guess if you're if you're strictly gluten free then at least you take in the box there so I have four only four clients at the moment with an IBD in one other with with a microscopic colitis essentially so it's like you have flare-ups often you know do you have to that with medication sometimes is that in remission these are the kind of things I'm thinking of first Rachel and then you know so like the the best way to approach this kind of stuff is like you've got to have for you to put the pieces of the puzzle together and like find patterns and figure out what causes what you've got to approach it very methodically and that's what we do so definitely an element of tracking what you're having in your symptoms and then try to see the patterns and match them up that's and then you can you know try to rule things out and it's just a process of elimination that's what we're doing with with people very successfully and it's really hard to do by yourself like you know yeah you have to be accountable to yourself that's gonna foul I mean none of us can be accountable to ourselves you've got to be very disciplined if you're you know if you're not around other people who have a similar issue and talk about the same things and you don't have that support accessible to you it's really difficult I get it and now like you can't for a lot of us right we haven't been able to go out and see our dietician or see our physio or go to the gym or any of that stuff so it's all been interrupted online doing online it still is the way the future it's not going away now I wish I bought some zoom shares but essentially what we do have clients it's all virtual always has been always will be it's faster it's more convenient what if you're gonna get health you're gonna tail it or individualize help with your health you can get it online especially nutrition it's faster it's more convenient like you're probably setting there now in your pajamas if we had a client consult you could literally stay in bed and do your consult you have to drive anywhere you don't have to find babysitter you don't have waiting rooms you don't have a 40-minute time cap on your consultation like it has to be convenient convenient will be far superior and in your instance I think well you know it's again one of those cases where it's like you need some individual help have you worked with someone before that's the kind of route I'd be going with Linda I'm 49 hysterectomy oh by the way guys if you finding this useful please please give it a like and a share I don't even know if you can do them Instagram but give it a like and share people an Instagram by the way so I'm I'm doing all the comments on Facebook live first and they're probably not going to get to yours and they all disappear on Instagram if I can find them later I'll try and reply to you or message me your question just DM me and then I can do voice replies and try to take off a lot of people Melinda 49 hysterectomy 9 years ago mm-hmm I've tried Weight Watchers paleo Atkins strictly none worked I exercise 5 nights a week with an elliptical 30 minutes neither strength or abstract of 30 minutes I now do a mix of low carb and paleo about 50 pounds to lose what am I doing wrong well this is a good question cuz Malindi you are not alone I know there's gonna be like hundreds of people you see that question and I'll be like oh I'm really happy she she asked that and was brave enough to ask that so so thanks for sharing that with us what are you doing wrong I have to see you're like how many calories do you eat on average per day start with that can you answer me very quickly if you cannot we'd want to look at that near the hysterectomy like when we talk about perm in a pause and then after menopause as well it's like there's hormone changes that happen and they influence where your body stores fat but they also influence your your appetite hormones as well and and then of course you know a 49 years old your your basal metabolic rate you know the calories you burn just to exist just like sitting watching this video right now it's lower than it's a lot lower than what it was when you were 39 for example and so there's lots of there's so many ways to go about it but you know it's no surprise to me that Weight Watchers paleo Atkins strict didn't work the you can't you they're too restrictive if you if you can't go out and enjoy food then it's eventually you're gonna stop doing it because humans are really good at continually doing things we enjoy and we're really bad at continually doing things we do not enjoy in fact we a war waste stop right so nutrition you can't think of it like a hundred cent I'm all in them all out it's it's got to be more like eighty ninety percent because following a nutrition plan and trying to do it a hundred percent it's not it's not perfect it's it's prison I can't remember who who said that but following a nutrition plan 100% is not perfect it's prison okay you need to be able to to follow an impact mostly and then kind of enjoy yourself as well but without sabotaging results that's that's what you have to learn and it doesn't have to be complicated it's complicated when you're trying to do it all on your on your owner by yourself and and what you find is if you're not careful yo yo yo and you know I we speak I speak of clients who who have been yo-yoing for for ten twenty thirty years plus and at some point you need to get a plan that's specific to you and someone who can really hold your hand virtually of course you know it's coronavirus don't hold hands hold your hand virtually and guide you through the process okay the generic stuff just just isn't going to cut it and you've got to learn some things right like I said at the beginning Weight Watchers paleo Atkins they're telling you what to do they're not teaching you so little nuance but it's really important it's when you learn what to do yourself and why it works you're empowered to make decisions when life throws you some curveballs okay you know to also us what about your relationship with food this is a big one with clients with our clients we have not only like me and the dietitian coaches we have a mindset coach as well who talks about like mindset motivation goal-setting you're in with food how can we start to change those habits because people can do really well six days of the week but if their identifies stresses or emotional leaders then all that work is undone whether it's a weight-loss goal whether it's a you know trying to fall plan elimination diet plan and so that's that's an element I need to dig into as well Melinda so obviously if you don't wanna do it here but send me a message what so I'm gonna turn my banner off and [Music] Rachel wasn't symptom sorry guys I'm slowly getting to yeah I definitely wasn't symptom free when I started reintroducing I doings iy which does trigger my IBD I bet you do because IBD is like it's yeah it's it's severe right I mean I know like some people have bad IBS but the IBD clients is like I can't imagine so so have you worked on the anxiety side of things because that's gonna contribute big-time to your to your your symptoms or triggers and you definitely want some time free so then as well like I get it you were like trying to do it that's kind of helping all right I'll reach allenge something and you know I want to make some progress and then you at the end you just say well this is just a  show I don't know show and I didn't even mean that pun there you go but this is just like this is terrible right like I don't know what what what helped or if it if it if I reacted or if not so um have you worked with anyone I would I would look at you know and doesn't I think I would genuinely don't even care if it's if it's me it's not about me it's about you I want you to like try to find someone in your area or something who can help guide you through the process that's that's the next step in my opinion I'm messaging Rachel Melinda okay go we can continue about 1,500 do I straight up too high I could do a screen share and show you guys but I was mucking around this morning anyway when Danielle was here looking at calorie cap so go do if you want to work out what's what calories you need to have per Dave some things go too I recommend tdee calculator dotnet stands for total daily energy expenditure tbe calculated you can enter in your you know your details there but it factors in body fat percentage which I really like it's based on the Mifflin st. your equation which we learn in Dietetics we used to do it by the book I mean like I'm not that all but apparently I learn we were backwards but so you'll see like when your body as your body fat percentage goes up as well your metabolic rate goes down well doesn't go down but it's not as high as it could be if you're if you had more muscle mass and and 1500 is is too is too much per day especially if you think it's bad and it's probably a little bit more and that's a whole new once thing as well we all under report I think dietitians under report the least in studies but it's still like fifteen percent so yeah you know it's it sucks like that's why losing weight so hard especially as we're getting older because it like it's it's possible to do if you'd know if you know if you told what to do and you understand what you're doing in someone's helping you and keep you accountable and making sure you you make progress but it's like it takes a long time that's why it's hard because you got to do it then for a long long time the human body was just very good at you know if you think about like cuz okay for example I did the rower the other day rowing machine at the gym and thirty calories it was only two minutes like a bit less than two minutes it felt like twenty minutes and I was like after I just the amazing human body it was so efficient I there was so much power that I generated there and it only costs 30 calories so you can see how advantageous that was way back when a cavemen days say 10,000 years ago tumour that we could eat so little but produce so much power and effort to to do things to survive and to flourish how we have so advantageous and now of course it's the opposite right now it's we have so much food and we don't have to do stuff so we have so many so now we're eating three meals a day even that's gonna just eating three meals three solid healthy meals a day will get you to 1,500 calories you can figure out forget about and snacks and so that's why it's just so difficult for people to lose weight because for a lot of them you know I'm talking about women especially we work a lot of women who are like 40 or 50 plus actually and and you know I just need to give them a little bit of a virtual slap in the face a little reality check hey this is kind of this is kind of where you're at this is where you need to be and and I'm gonna help you do that and this is how we're going to do it sustainably so that you're able to stick with it to get to your goal because you want to get to your goal in six weeks and I'm here to tell you it's going to take you six months plus and if you think there's any other way to do that you're kidding yourself and you're gonna end up back where you started and you're just going to end up being the same weight in a year's time but yeah a years older a year old so you know half half of my job with with like clients who want to lose weight as well which is we know most of us 99% of us it's like trying to teach people to be patient like people just like we humans are just impatient you know take us you it take us decades to gain way and then we just want to lose it in like five weeks it doesn't help that we have you know magazines and stuff saying lose lose 20 pounds lose lose 15 kilos in three weeks with this plan that Hugh Jackman did it's like it's just not the reality does it also have questions otherwise so I've got to hit up the ones that were pre submitted again Instagram if you guys ask me questions I won't see em until after but like just DM me your question and I can try to reply to you there I discover a stress that I've been working at for several months yeah Melinda so you know I genuinely believe that you've been trying very hard with your goal you've tried so many things so obviously for a long time it's probably fair to say there's probably one or two moments in the week or maybe it's one one moment every couple of weeks that is enough to undo your your progress and it's and it could be that it's a moment of like yes stress eating or however we want to call it and you know why do we why do we turn to food why in quarantine people putting on weight like why do we and it's not like that's a bad thing or anything but like why why do we go to food when we're bored you know it's a and I know I have the answer but it's a whole nother topic its dopamine if you want to like try try start searching about that so Melinda the point the my point being like you know I try to identify hey what is their patterns what triggers me to stress eat let's look at that first oh it's work or it's you know for some clients it's like a particular day or every Tuesday at work like I get IBS symptoms or I feel stressed out and it's we find out what it is when you identify that you can take steps to fix it but until you've identified it well you're going to keep spinning your wheels you're going to get no way so so there's that as well windows there's quite a few things I genuinely believe like you just set a point where you're gonna keep spinning your wheels if you're if you're following the generic plans and stuff you don't have to restrict yourself to get your ego I can't eat like we can teach you how you can get to your goal and still eat foods you love and not sabotage results and you don't have to exercise like mad all the time as well that's you know the saying you can't outrun a a poor diet or a bad diet it's very true it's very true exercise is important for health okay and it can get you results quicker and the older you are the more important it is but if you've you know it's I'd say it's about 10% of your results 90% is your nutrition and you have it's around nutrition in your mindset around it as well that's what you've got to focus on I have my you know I don't have the answer in like a piece of paper like ego I wish I had how good would that be fortunately it doesn't quite work like that okay so I'm gonna grab another question and again you guys if you found it useful or you want some individualized help with a specific medical issue particularly if it's autoimmune or digestive that's what we do so so send me a message and we can see if we can help ah Linda I was about to do your question that you pre submitted for so good I'm glad you got you know if you have any follow-up questions ask me now for sure I'm glad I got you live what is your this one what is your advice that diet for an underactive thyroid if you go to I have so much information on that under active thyroid as well and like I biessing and gut health you guys if you go to my website hang on I'm gonna bring it up here because it's kind of a pain to put it spell it diet verse disease dog vs diet versus a dog I have I have like 170 articles or something but like really in-depth really science based on like what to do for specific medical issues that's the whole point of the website so under active thyroid it's slightly different if it's Hashimoto's or not like an autoimmune issue but you know it's you're probably best getting there to read it rather than me trying to explain it here um oh this is a good one about food sensitivity testing I'm gonna bring it up here hang on a sec you guys I have to post it as my own question what do you know about food sensitivity testing so food allergy testing right of course that's that's accurate because allergy creates an immune response you can measure in the blood food intolerance testing is not useful in my opinion has anyone down the food intolerance test and did they find it useful or not like let me know in the comments yes or no if you found it useful because what I find from people will speak with and and just seeing in clinical practices like you'll do a test and it'll come back and they'll be like hey you can't eat 9300 foods out of 10,000 you're intolerant good day bye and you hear it's like oh so well now what here's a problem so a a lot of that what we find is like somewhat a client will have a food and tolerance test and be like yeah I can't eat pistachios and I'll be like all right is that true and they're black I don't know but I haven't been eating them because the Torsen I'm like alright eat some pistachios Nate some pistachios I'm like what happened but like nothing right okay so so why were you avoiding pistachios since I will because of the thing said I was like oh well okay can you see the problem here so it's like a it's it's inaccurate the science is just not there yet if I if we could just wave a magic wand and fix your intolerance we were right if we could just do a finger prick or a blood test and get your results and be like here this is this is it like this is what you're intolerant to and this is what you tolerate then you know that's how it is then I guess we would but it's wrong it doesn't work like that there's so many gaps in the science so the tests are typically incorrect foods the food sensitive like food intolerance tests and they also don't tell you what to do after right they're just like they just say yeah someone else is put here not really useful said said chicken was sensitive food for me and I bet you probably chicken all the time it's fine so they don't don't tell you what to do after it's just like hey here's a problem and we don't have a solution tchau you know I don't know about you but that's not a very useful surface for me I kind of want answers so that's why I would work work with an elimination diet I'm assuming this is for digestive issues I don't have that context why do some other diets seem to work and recklessly for some people but not others but I need the context right what diets for whom this there's too many variables there some people might be doing it properly and some not some it might just really work for there they're crazy ridiculous lifestyle or eating habits you know okay let's try and think of an example like a carnivore diet right you guys heard of carnivore diets it's exactly what it sounds like you just eat meat and animal products and of course 99.9 percent of people like it's disgusting and no one wants to do that and they can't stick of it but there is the exception to the rule there's always an exception outliers and we don't want to focus on outliers you know is everyone gonna be LeBron James at basketball no he's the outlier so it's like let's look at the majority of people can the majority of people enjoy a carnivore diet no but perhaps you're looking at the outlier when you say it works miraculously for some and you need to focus on on the the vast majority of us regular people um Rachel yeah you do yep you do that's why I think you're probably at a point where it's not necessary because if for you to eat gluten right it's gonna like wreak havoc I'm guessing so I think as I said before he probably the the diet protocol I would have for you anyway would be not including gluten I can't like just thinking about the food from a nutrition point of view foods containing gluten are gonna add much value to you to you from a nutritious point of view however food is more than nutrition right it's it's the social component of food that's very important everything we do as humans is around food and meal time that's when gluten-containing foods whole like top of the pile right think about like croissants and and doughnuts and things like that that I'd have so it's kind of like a pros and cons thing but for you I think you've been living so long gluten free I wouldn't be changing that anyway if that makes sense Heather I keep seeing the importance of taking a probiotic what is the best kind is it have to be refrigerated does it have to be a tablet form are they just effective you can see you've been doing some research Heather is very informed question yes probiotic quality matters yes it typically would have to be refrigerated because like a live gun test like a lot of probiotics you eat them and then they don't even make it past stomach acid right the probiotic has to get to your colon your large intestine so the bottom of the digestive tract I guess stomach and then it has to go through this you know seven meters or whatever is a small intestine and then to the the gut the colon the large intestine and a lot of them don't make it there what's the best kind will Heather depends on what's your goal feel like we've spoken before I can't remember I apologize what your condition is but again I have [Music] if you go to google and type diet verse disease probiotic IBS you will find a very fair article on the top the best probiotics based on actual evidence of things that have been tested so doesn't make it to the large intestine is it actually useful there which strains for what you know cuz then if someone's got constipation or someone has diarrhea or someone has microscopic colitis or someone has dived to I like it depends on those things as well so yeah the more you know the more you realize you don't know for the more I dig get into these things and write these about these topics and stuff and I'm like wow if someone says hey here's the probiotic just take this this is for everyone it's it's amazing then they're more yep I can't sugarcoat that I hope that helped Heather what else the question was how to deal with Helicobacter pylori or h pylori again diet versus ease h pylori is a good chance i've written about the topic you want to know about and that's you know i can't even remember but if you go there it's all there any nutritional advice for interstitial cystitis no I think that's a bladder thing you've had to guess but I don't know if no you'd have to ask the doctor or something I can't help with that one ooh what kind of oil do you use for cooking is that a good question what kind of oil do you guys use I would like to know let me know and on Instagram if you just joined and you got questions like they all disappear and stuff so I'm just gonna answer them later or like no actually just message me in your question in in the DMS because then I can voice require I can reply they're all at once and it's much faster because I do want to answer you guys as well but on Facebook I can bring the questions up on the screen so it's like a more interesting experience with people and the questions don't disappear what kind of oil do you use for cooking it looks like I asked myself I promised someone else asked me I could just be like ooh yeah this is a good question I intelligent I so we just bought over the other day and we bought extra virgin olive oil we always bought like you can buy like canola oil or wraps oil whether you call it that's the cheapest right it's um look long-term it's probably not that great for you how much canola oil do you eat that's the real question so you know the dose makes the poison I'm not particularly fast and you know some oils are expensive so you gotta pick and choose your battles there we bought extra virgin olive oil I thought you know what I think I'll buy better quality one that's it has high high resistance to oxidative stress so essentially they done tests on that and it it it does very well high temperatures for a long period of time before it oxidizes and goes rancid when we talk about fat and oil it oxidative stress causes it to go rancid is the word and it spoils and then it's particularly producing compounds that are really bad for you so you want to oil that maintains its stability its stable at high temperatures a long period of time and doesn't transfer flavor typically depends what you're cooking right so long story short extra-virgin olive oil you can also use it just as a dressing or something so I really like that I also use coconut oil or when we have it I do sometimes if I'm making some sort of Asian dish or cuisine then I will use coconut oil virgin coconut oil it has a real high in saturated fats that it's really stable at high temperatures and for long periods of time so but of course it makes stuff taste like coconuts or thereabout so you know sometimes from making it you know like Mexican like taco night or whatever I'm not gonna use coconut oil so I think there you know that's kind of my answer hopefully that helps oh hey Monica coconut oil olive oil yeah yeah it depends right and totally depends am I like you know never gonna use I use canola oil like I don't eat that stuff you know like no okay I'll eat some if you use canola oil but like if you're if you deep frying you know samosas everyday in canola oil the canola oil is the least you're worried you know how come you're having some deep fried samosas every day that's that's where we need to start right it's kind of like the question is important but it's also it needs context like how much do you actually you know you're focusing on the wrong thing here the health people are like oh I need to eat you know just you know organic or this type of oil or you know and it's like they're eating the you know what's that mean Organic peanut butter cups versus regular it's like hang on you you're eating peanut butter cups it doesn't matter if it's organic or not you're focusing on the 1% of of Health when you're eating peanut butter cups if you've got a health goal that like that's probably not in line with it we should probably be looking at that aspect you're focusing on the wrong thing I see it old sign and then this one anyway start to wrap up you guys does anyone else have a have a question of someone who puts on forever Oh avocados oil is a good one as well expensive there right so it's like yeah you're gonna meet people where they're at and I've got one more question here pre-submitted one I did promise everyone I would get to those this one so big is gonna cover my face oh no not this one Oh someone did TDE okay I'll get to that in a sec I take 23 tablets a day I can immediately say like in probably something in the US right it's it's I'm amazed at the the drug culture there it's crazy every time I go there and like ads on TV for for pharmaceutical drugs like that's insane anyway chronic pain okay lots of lots of comorbidities I'm so fed up the pills that don't work here the pills a band-aid right you know you've got a cut on your leg and you put a band-aid stop the bleeding and it helps initially but does it solve the problem you know maybe you got to disinfect that cut maybe you need stitches is really deep like the pills kind of just the the surface I've low mood depression anxiety I'm desperate for a way out yep I I hey I know exactly where you were coming from because I speak these people of everyday people who are in the same situation and need that help I tried all the diets on the planet still gained weight I need help so all I can say for you Lisa is is you need to work with someone who is really going to help you through the process because it's a big it's a it's a big mountain it's it's not big it's it's a long process it's it needs to be more long-term and because long-term I know that's going to be really hard for you to do on your own near impossible hence why you've you've tried everything and you're still stuck right it's difficult because it's long-term so you need to be in an environment or set up an approach that supports you long term and that's going to be a you can't do it alone there's just no way it's too it's too grandiose of a project definitely achievable many people have done it you need to see those people you need to see that if possible you need to surround yourself with people who will show you that it's possible and other people who can help you get there and pick you up when you fall and help you get back on track if you fall off track and that's the reality of the situation I wish there was an easier way to door or a faster way that's that's the reality so you've I guess she's bringing you doctor so like yeah you need one-to-one help and we do we do this with clients exactly this so like it's perfect because you can get the help even if you're stuck at home so a lot of people don't go out that much or for whatever reason it's difficult you know send me a message this is why I had the service I have it's particularly useful for a certain sub for everyone I think but especially a certain subset of people and Lisa you're one of those you know as you said you'd the depression anxiety like that's that's such a big piece of the puzzle people are trying to reach their health goals and they have they have this anxiety depression that they're just sweeping under the rug or you know by the diet culture being told just to well don't worry about that you know just follow this carnival diet will solve your problems well you know it's like a if you invert a pyramid right like the big piece at the top it's like mindset mental health let's fix that first then let's look at your nutrition and we can do you know we can count it in the same time but it's not one or the other the approach you need to take has to factor that in as well Lisa so I hope you message me do okay last one and I'm hopping off I plug my data into this the site you suggested mm-hmm it's just 118 grams of protein for me that's high I I get I say 30% of your calories so whatever 30% of 1600 and eight years and then divide it by four and that will be your grams of protein is that right yes so I would do that predominately vegetarian you're never going to get to that so I have a client who who is predominantly vegetarian and Riskin changes for anyone who who's interested to learn more about personalized approach the service that we we have comment interested okay so you're vegetarian like I have a client who just you know we can get a 20% of 20% of your calories from protein is very achievable as a vegetarian and vegans and is in line with we is in line with good health and whatever your goal is so I'd be aiming for that so we even go 20% of 1680 and divided by 4 yeah I think that's gonna work but 118 super high I'm not sure what exercise level you put in body fat percentage but that would have influenced it as well I find trying to meet that need means protein powder 100% it does 20% of calories you can get to with that protein powder because I we have clients do it all the time but if you only get to 30% which is it's more ideal if you train if you do muscle training like weight training or resistance training which you know you probably do and hopefully you do the comment box they new you do want to stop I'm a protein powder that you tolerate if you find one you like you know um I hate to waste my calories on a slurry well rather get a strict like I bought one today it's whey protein isolate so that's that's dairy but and get an isolate soy protein isolate P protein isolate it's strictly protein you're essentially going to get 25 grams for 150 calories yeah it's a hundred fifty calories you could eat but you can't eat that many things have 150 and you're certainly not going to get 25 grams of protein for it so in my in my perspective is worth the trade-off big-time like that's a that's a win-win deal you know 25 grams of protein 450 calories you can't get it anywhere else but it costs it depends on your goal right I don't know your goal yes I do you right at the very bottom do I need to just suck it up if I lose those stubborn ten pounds you don't have no you could you know there's yeah you don't have to use a protein powder I use a protein powder in place of 150 Cal's from food think you will get to your goal slightly quicker or you'll build more muscle mass and you'll be able to sustain that easier when you're at your goal yeah hopefully that helped you lots of weightlifting Thanks yeah you go to UM you got a hit your yeah I will be gone for 30% you're leaving money on the table now so you let you go to the gym and the gyms like oh that was a sweet workout here's $50 in the other slate I'll take 30 keep 20 it's like you're just leaving money on the table there you're leaving gains potential benefits on the table because you don't enjoy a protein drink in saying that you're leaving it on the table in that it's just going to take you longer to collect that money later you can still get it that's like what if you want to as fast as possible you sound like you're frustrated with the 10 pounds I'd be looking to that but there's the argument well we're look I'd rather 850 calories as well from food but it ain't going to be 25 grams of protein and zero fat and zero carbs good and that helps Monica been 2 weeks in the plant I feel much better no bloating at all it's another whirl for me that makes my day good awesome so Monica is a client so I'm glad one clients come on still have constipation with that doesn't hurt at all my question is where's is this healthy food going I mean do you mean like in your digestive tract so you know with a lot of people we work with it's like they've got several goals right and we're working here for a long time and we can pretty much resolve them all or at least make sure the client knows what to do and feels empowered and has learnt what they need to do and gets it so they can do it on their own there's the whole point you don't to be paying someone to help you for the rest of your life which you will be if you keep yo-yoing right so fix the bloating what I find with digestive health clients is like when asked how your symptoms I split them up I say symptoms like gas and bloating and stuff and then constipation and or diarrhea or whatever it is that's a tool the bowel habit itself the bowel movement we talk about it separately because we can typically we can fix one and the other one's a different approach so the bloating is stuff is to me food intolerance related constipation you guys is like oh it's Hana the Beast I want to say it's easier than diarrhea to resolve but of course as outliers like I said but constipation Monica it's like we go through a protocol so if Taylor and me we will go through a protocol of like we need to try this and then this on top of the diet you're already doing in recharging foods and making sure you're eating a varied diet we're gonna have to introduce a couple things yeah Zenoss the question I hope so any we're gonna wrap up if you want one-to-one help maybe you've been stuck ten years plus and you've not resolved your issues and they're not getting better or they're getting worse whether it's digestive issue or autoimmune or something else oh maybe you just got a weight goal and you've got fatty liver or something and it scared you or you had a health scare and you want to learn you want to learn about a topic and some skills that is the most important thing in your life which is the thing that the food food that goes into our mouth you know three five times a day right it's something you want to learn about and know and understand where your body responds with certain foods so if you want some individualize hope that comment interested okay and I will check the comments for next couple days and because if you comment I can send you a message in explain how it works and we can talk about well if it'll be a fit or not essentially if we can help you or not so yeah thank you for for watching I hope you found this useful please give us give us a share if you liked it or even just a thumbs up if you don't share it that's fine as well I appreciate that helps just bump it up a little bit if you want to speak with us on a call and actually go over well what are your issues can we map out a plan for you and then we can decide if you want to work with us or not you can also go to diet versus East calm sigh free - session and book something in there and lastly its diverse disease dot org where I have all my articles and things like that if you want to look up a specific topic probably have a really detailed guide there for you to have look at good right I'll speak to you guys later", "6c7-QIOYS6U": "but there could be so many reasons my skin reacts just from everything from touching your face like this without washing your hands to using the wrong product to your diet not enough sleep so do not take everything and don't stress out I'm not the trained GP I'm just a girl sat here so yeah so we're gonna start off with just right here and this is actually the sister to the bladder and digestive system if you get a lot of breakouts along this area it can tend to be from a lack of water so keep yourself hydrated and not enough Whole Foods so at the middle of the forehead in between the eyebrows this is linked with the liver so if there's a lot of congestion in that area that can be from too much alcohol intake rich foods and it could possibly be allergic reaction when I'm doing this it goes what do we call it we call lactose intolerant which can be from like dairy products I do believe if you ever feel like your ears are quite hot all the time that can generally be related to the kidneys so generally if you're stressed all the time you may feel them getting very hot and very sensitive so generally that can relate to too much alcohol and too much caffeine so definitely cut down on them and drink plenty of water I know it's hard because it's so damn boring I'll just read it out for my that's what I'm secretly know it but you know this is gonna go all my rule because I'm so clever like that the cheeks often give an accurate glimpse into any distress smokers or people suffering from allergies generally experience fine lines broken capillaries or congestion in this area which relates to the lungs the eyes are generally the true window into the body's health so dark circles can be genetic it is a very common thing not enough sleep dark circles can get worse from poor dehydration an important limitation generally the eye area is linked with the kidneys that's so professional you know this awful when you can be whatever you like fingers so we're gonna be talking about the nose so reading nose can definitely indicate to high blood shut normally when you say a little bit of roll out the Barrow if you want me to be honest a bit of a lash you ever drift and okay alright okay they tend to have red noses it could just be generally you just suffer from rosacea which is ready just don't take my comments so personally there but I'm just saying it's definitely one to cut out caffeine and alcohol congestion around the upper lip can be caused by lipsticks lip liners lit whatever this word is called", "INGue0fpEaA": "[Music] hey guys what's going on it's a girl I'm back cuz Queen and I'm here with another review a product review and today I'm doing one of my favorite things in the world I'm gonna review one of my favorite things in the world chocolate mmm chocolate and today's review is on Hayes and Maine and this is actually a milk chocolate and when I saw that it was one to one CBD and THC I was all over this of course as you can see it says 250 milligrams and then it has I think it says 34 percent cacao for milk chocolate that's pretty good and like I said one to one CBD THC and the 250 is 125 milligrams of CBD and 125 milligrams of THC so per piece per piece I'm going to get 12.5 CBD 12.5 THC which is you know 25 basically milligrams but the reason why I wanted to try this is because normally and I've said this before at this stage of my journey since I'm starting off I'm still a newbie I'm starting off pretty small as far as the amount of THC I try to consume I generally try to stay between 5 and 10 this is 12 but I'm hoping that because it's a 1 in 1 that the CBD will offset the high filling of the THC because this is more THC than I normally consume in in edible I'll just say that so and I should have haven't had we chocolate before so this is a new one for me like a chocolate bar cuz this is Arizona by the way my house is pretty cool but uh it was like a hundred and I don't know five today alright so that is what a serving size looks like and again I'm gonna tell you when it comes to edibles listen this chocolate board you're gonna want to eat the whole thing okay okay and what edibles one of the best ways to consume them I'm gonna get this out of my hands because they blow milk with edibles they tell you to hold it in your mouth and let it know I don't want to say just all but like what chocolate of course let it dissolve but like when you're doing oils and things like that hold it in your mouth awhile and kind of let it get into your system I'm really trying to you know it's good okay so I wouldn't to me is not there to try to compare it to something like the Hershey bar or something like that because I'm pretty sure it has a higher the cow example but I think it's very good I mean I think it's very good chocolate there is just a a back note like a under note of the cannabis but it's it's I mean it's it's almost not there it's very mild and maybe because I know that it has cannabis in it I'm picking up on that but I think if you just gave it to somebody and they were just eating it they wouldn't they wouldn't pick up on that but it's actually really very good and that's again I tell you guys that's the thing about edibles when they're very good like that you're you're more apt to pick up another piece because it's like you're not really even thinking about it you know is this unconscious thing to continue to you know don't want to consume something delicious something good and before you know it you're like you know 10 sheets to the wind and you're trying to remember why and so with this chocolate is very good yeah that's it's very good so I might if I feel any any differently or if someone notices me filling in you know a little bit like who I'll do a reaction video after this just to kind of let you know how about ten twelve point Bob didn't mean [Music] it's something that I would I mean I said this a lot edibles are not cheap that candy bar probably cost about 12 bucks for a candy bar yeah it's like normally you can go get a candy bar for a dollar you know 50 cents or whatever but we have to realize that this is also medicine and so you need to compare it to that and not compare it to something like a chocolate bar because at the end of the day when you're comparing it to actual medicine you know that it's a completely different story right so we have to be careful how we you know frame it but as medicine goes yeah that that went down pretty good so alright guys that's Hazen main milk chocolate and I like it I do alright guys I will talk to you later alright bye hey guys hey listen I just got through in a fish sandwich just everything's good but yeah they had me needing a snack yeah it was good very good chocolate and that was great for a while and I tell you again the edible is that I'm not I'm not going to talk too much right now you just have to be careful and I only have one square I don't understand how these people be putting back you know so much damn weed Oh anyway yeah [Music] you [Music]", "e81yot9lFX4": "what's up everybody my name is Sarah Vee and welcome back to the haze today we're gonna be doing another edible review we are reviewing the moon megadose moon bars this flavor is the cosmic cappuccino and I can absolutely say let me just start out with this I love these chocolates this is a California based brand I believe they do also fruit snax little bites other different types of products but I think they only do edibles I looked up and these guys are made with cannabis extract and you can definitely tell because these are strong the flavor is absolutely on point you don't taste any type of cannabis no oil not at all like it's kind of insane how much you don't taste it on these I would eat these even if there was no cannabis in it obviously like these are so far away I love them the packaging is also really cute I love a little moon right here it's really awesome I love the whole space theme of their company if you look in the front it also shows how many milligrams of THC is in every piece which is really nice my only complaint which is not really a complaint it's just like an inconvenience factor is that it comes with the top that you can't pull off like you have to get scissors to cut it it's impossible to get off any other way I mean maybe if you had a knife but I don't want to cut myself every little piece is 10 milligrams and I'm saying if you don't take edibles a lot I would just start out with that and you'll will feel it it is so nice in the back it says that it takes 45 minutes for it to hit and you definitely can plan on that because it does take 45 minutes for day it doesn't hit me and he's sooner it doesn't hit me any later like I honestly timed it out and it was really really accurate and I think that's really nice in the back you tell you the nutrition if that's important to you it's chocolate so I love that these guys are also extremely affordable I found them between $14 to $17 before tax there are not many edibles out there that you can say are delicious strong and affordable and the moon bars are all three and it's absolutely fantastic if you see these guys at your local dispensary I would say grab them I don't know if they're nationwide but I've seen them in Northern California and Southern California yeah I would say ground Diaz I absolutely recommend them so again guys these are the Moon Omega dose bars and I absolutely love them thank you guys so much for watching my video I hope you have a great day please leave a comment please hit that like button please hit that subscribe button I would also love to hear your guys's opinion on our Instagram so if you can follow us at the haze channel that would be great my name again is Sarah P and I see you guys next time", "uwlphjFS8Hw": "[Music] the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking our second look at cushy edibles and we'll see if they come under our new two strikes and you're out role here at wheats we don't have time for that [ __ ] third strike so that's right guys we are taking our second look at cushy edibles and we are looking at another one of their three hundred and twenty milligrams the first time we reviewed their 320 milligram watermelon rings this time it is the gummy bears there are 32 gummy bears in there in total with 10 milligrams each so if you watch my first video you will know that I was skeptical about their claims of having 320 milligrams in this package and I seem to be vindicated at the end when I wasn't as high as I expected to be I was a little high sure but not not three hundred and twenty milligrams worth so this time we're gonna come in even more skeptical and if they indeed fact if they in fact are are exaggerating their potency claims will will put the fire to them so uh one strike against them that we talked about last time was their price I think these were priced at like 15 bucks which is insanely good value for a 320 milligram gummy but I don't think they're 320 milligrams so like after my last review I decided to do a little bit uh to do my due diligence I guess and because they do claim to be lab tested there they do have the audacity to claim that I decided to search them out so I found their website and lo and behold they have a tab for lab results and I clicked that excitedly and thinking I was gonna have to forgive them but then it looks like it's actually oh they only have two lab results posted both for products tested on November 9th 2017 and neither one of those products are in edible flower that they also sell so they have gotten something lab tested but not these edibles which is really really deceptive of them so that one's for your deceptive practices but if these gummies get me outrageously high you know we'll forgive and forget so let's let's see here let's go ahead and open up this package also I found these gummies to be last time oh and these seem to be the same case there's definitely cannabis odor in there these are covered in this weird sugar that is it's like where the cannabis oil is infused it's not like any gummy I've ever had before or edible gummy it's when the infusion is in the sugar it's weirder it's not as bitter as like a net appear or infused creation but it's it's certainly not as bitter it's not as bad tasting but there's something off-putting about it anyways let's go ahead and give them a taste these are about the exact same again not disgusting and there are certainly worse edibles out there but whatever that coating is is just it's not pleasant and there's a lot of it so it's just a little disconcerting and it's very oily as you may or may not be able to see so that's something to look out for if you're really sensitive those kind of things and that guys is gonna do it for this first half of this review here I'm gonna finish off all these gummies unfortunately and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to let you know how I'm actually feeling do you see if this product is worth its weight or not thanks so much for watching weeds guys I'll see you soon [Music] Oh guys I am back it has been two hours since I had 29 of the 32 cushy edibles gummy bears I could not stomach the last three I am sorry if you consider this review incomplete my apologies I got 90% of the way there literally it's just that the closer you got to the bottom the more drenched they were in that sugar oil combination and they just got disgusting I mean just disgusting again it wasn't a bitter taste it was just an oily waxy nasty gross gross gross gross gross and that's the least of its problems the most important part of its problems is it's not potent there's there's there's no way there's 320 milligrams in here as a matter of fact I mean I feel less high than I had with the watermelon rings granted I've eaten a little bit less but I feel a whole number point less high than I did before I feel like maybe a 3 right now somewhere in there this is just a bad product Cushie edibles shame on you for lying about your milligram egde shame on you for your stupid story that you have online about what a cool brand you are looking out for the customer and yadda-yadda you got a bunch of horseshit well you know what I'm sorry I said all that I would love to talk to you guys if any one of you wants to come on wheats and talk about your products and and and tell me why I'm wrong and maybe show me the show me the batch that got lab tested so I can see for myself that you actually do what you say and I would love to talk to you guys and I promise I'll be I'll be fair and and equitable with you so I'd love to have you on email me wheats reviews at gmail.com or wheats at wheats reviews calm hit me up on Twitter Facebook whatever I'd love to talk to you guys again give you a chance to to you know

well whatever that means thank you so much for watching weeds and I'll see you guys soon peace", "CIct7-z1SCM": "yo just waking up after the IDIS of eating a delicious fried turkey that I cooked I'm showing you how I did it in this video I will give you the instructions on how to do it it's four minutes per pound four minutes per pound some people's gonna say three minutes I'm gonna say 3.5 but you have to take into the account the temperature dropping when you add the turkey to the oil okay I have a Butterball turkey fryer if you're using the same device that I'm using to fry your turkey indoors you it takes 40 to 45 minutes for the turkey fryer to actually heat up to 375 degrees where you gonna fry your turkey at so what you want to do is you want to go ahead and start your fryer while you're prepping your turkey to get fry or if you're a person who properly planned and have your turkey already marinate just be aware it takes 40 to 45 minutes for this butterball fryer I have the Excel to heat up to 375 degrees okay hopefully you can get the gist of everything that I'm doing in this video and I hope you enjoy please like subscribe share I will try to do more videos like this for holiday fiddles is that what a hot turkey is a fiddle anyway I hope y'all enjoy thanks for watching and we're gonna start the video all right so that's when the camera round stop this so here's what we're using to put in our fried turkey first we got hello once I see that that rock that daddy put on our mama finger yeah see look at look at this okay yeah hello there hold on there let me get the closes it like hmm Oh mmm okay anyway so we also bought this poetry herb blend that you can get for Thanksgiving anywhere so you put all that stuff you chop them up real fine as my lady doing right there no real fire do you mix it all up it's go get a little sulfur as the day goes on yeah and she looked about it but it's it out so it'll be a little bit softer and this is gonna go under the breast of the turkey actually all that under the skin of the turkey of me I'll show you that and there's our end or a turkey fryer right there you'll say a big old butterball dealio but uh yeah that's gonna be it and you stick it under the skin between the skin and the breast of the turkey before you put it in there you can let it sit let it marinate a little bit and stick it as far as you go where else to be sleepy that's it okay do we what do we put on the outside of Turkey so this is what we're gonna use to season the outside of it chef Paul yeah and then to inject it we're gonna use so to inject it we're gonna use these right here where do we get this from yeah you go order funny website you can also order the simple stuff away today so I got that one we got the that one over there we got quite a few over going on around here but let's me stick it here baby and no we're not we're gonna use Creole butter we're not gonna use jalapeno butter so you're gonna inject it with the Creole butter this is what it comes with your injector Cajun shake my kids must've did that but uh yeah inject it first you uh put the butter stuff on and then also with these right here you can just stuff a lot of butter and stuff just stuff this under this the between the breasts and the skin and the drink for today you get you some some cheap rum like coconut rum or something so for lion punch and then you use whatever canned fruits is left over so just so happen to have some pineapple left over but you can see it's hanging right there and you mix it all up and it's absolutely delicious you want to know what kind of granite disease we so proud of our granite this is called sea foam this is sea foam right look at that oh yeah ain't that pretty ain't that pretty right there thanks they're pretty let me see if we can get even closer oh that's it boom but uh but yeah that's what we're doing right now I'm gonna also feel when we're doing it fry the turkey or getting a turkey ready to be work and dipped in the fryer and y'all enjoy peace so it's time to go ahead and get the turkey ready it's still a little wet cuz I'll make sure to wash it out actually I might go back clean it in cuz uh look a little so it might be a little bit dirty so before I even do whatever we're gonna do I'm wash it out again actually I'm gonna do that now okay watch the eyes a little bit better but it's just got some water in the cavity okay anyway so when it's time to go ahead and get the turkey off set up to put your stuff in you want to put it on me here but you got to break this membrane so you can use a butter knife I usually put a knife in this slide ease onto the side no this is how I do it you know I used to use my fingers but it'd be all gooey but I realized I could just use something else to get her good and ready to break that membrane it's not hard to break if you use a butter knife or something you use whatever you tell so that you want I just prefer use the butter knife because it's not really cutting the meat you know I'm even using the back to go down and you want to keep down as far as you can all right you don't have to really worry about the membrane in the middle but as far as you can and then once you do that that's when you gotta start using your hand get down in there little bit more so use our hands I've already properly washed my hands on that that is tight boom pop that little bit brain right there and see I mean you can basically bring it on the round so I mean if if I can get my humungous hands up in there you know that's about as far so I will just try to pinch the skin a little bit see if I can get it to overlook cuz I can't get my fat fingers down a knife in there you know oh yeah I watch no finger technique right there y'all like that finger technique right there huh yeah all right get over here open this up a little beat all right I'm gonna try to get back up in a little bit deeper in the edge but a knife never lady got super laughing you're so her fingers right wrap oh wait dance bottle I don't they all right so what you do now is you go ahead and get your stuff that you made butter onion powder garlic powder you take the leaves off of this chop it up real fine and then I you guys just get a spoon get a spoon go do this with two hands - y'all got hold on yeah hold on real quick Oh scoop some of the butter under the cavity right here and then all you got to do then it's just we use it all the way to the back as far as it can go as far as it can go and then just massage it in here right there all the way back as far as it can go and you will repeat this step until you get all of your stuff under there all right so that's what I'm gonna do love me come back in just a minute all right so once you put the butter in you just massage it trying to put as far as you can go down that way that way and then once you do that you just go ahead and get your injector stuff get rids injected and that'll be the next step make sure before you fry too there's a plastic thing in here to hold these feet together you want to make sure to take that off take that off take the the neck bone is here the interests will be over here somewhere all right all right so I'll go ahead get rid of tin J all right so what you want to do return check your stuff right here usually comes with the syringe bang soak it on up spit it out real quick do it right suck it on up and then you want to do it at an angle bang pushing to the swells up a little bit you got plenty of injectors so I'm gonna just skip around now you don't want to go to beat because if you go to beat you don't go back to the cavity in which case it's just gonna spilled out into the playing now please keep in mind I am an amateur at amateur I am an amateur what's the word I'm looking for baby okay cuz I'm saying it I am whatever she just said so if I am not injecting the turkey to your liking so be it it is my turkey me and my family will enjoy this turkey now you see ice was up like that now technically you probably want to start from the top from the bottom and work your way around so that way when you do start to inject it you don't push the other floors out so it's all a learning process either way as long as you get it into the breast and we're going to do the wings a little bit better to do it the day before so I could marinate yeah you want this to marinate so there's no sticking in the wing right here all right you know you know you're getting it when a starts to swell up if you start to see a lot fluid come out that means that your that is too is too much and this was actually why I'm taking a lie boom we inflated that titty huh baby okay look at that titty and look at that titty you could get any sweets like desserts okay yeah all right so we gonna just inject this what the rest of this injector I didn't think it was gonna take then let me check is a squeeze that's it no man this thing is taking a lot of a Creole butter baby all right let's get around front oh we see this a little bit on the slide straight down actually I was I'm a dual peanut because I need to set it in there to see how many and then I take it out and just sees me I think already hit that uh in all the spots that you think is going to be good and delectable and that's it so just hit the record button or the pause button okay so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna do a test run because this is a new turkey fryer that I have here and I don't it says max but sometimes you might not want to spit it to the max stop it you might not want to fill it to the max you might want to just fill it you know a certain way so what I'm going to do now before i season the outside of the turkey and put the turkey into here I will put it into there and I'm gonna form our peanut oil into there and so this is fully covered and completely submerged then I'm gonna pull it out let it drain a little bit and then I'm gonna go ahead and season it with my poetry magics all right so y'all hang on I will show y'all but my house is dirty hey there you go okay so this is the Butterball turkey fryer I think this is the exhale right it's the exhale this is a 19 pound turkey 19 20 pound turkey fit in the cradle actually easier than I thought what I'd like to do sometimes is I will leave this here so it is just start cooking the inside of it without it actually going through some people might want to kind of hold now everything you're doing is touching like even my phone is gonna have to be sanitized so you won't get Salmonella or whatever but you will just pick it up with your little hook thing right here you know and you will drop it all right okay all right so i'ma go here for actually let me show y'all where the macaron is there so the Mex line is right there of course when you add mass to water and expands to a liquid and expand so we're gonna just drop that in here now also what I'm doing is when I take this out it have a coat in the peanut oil which I'm gonna fry it in any way and that way I could put my season on the top of it all right so y'all just hang on all right so I got my big big old thing of peanut oil here this is what we use to fry the turkey and so this is what I'm gonna pour it in there all right all right all right so I pour some oil in here and as you can see it only came to right there so i'ma just pour a little oil to where it covers it then I know for sure when I put it in that it will not come out and burn everybody and everything and burn my house down you know we got pretty good house insurance I don't know if they would bring this up like this right there right and then what I like to do because now in the candy we got all that oil in there to turn it to the side a little bit that's some of that oil drain out because if you gotta take a count when you do put it in there you gotta take into account that oil so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna transfer this over back to the pan and drive dump that I'm gonna hear the wonderful sounds of mama being mama for whatever reason my twins want to clean the toilet and not to turn is it if she said if she gonna make him go to bed instead of clean it up you don't I'm sitting over goodnight boffo I'm cleaning toilet bowl cleaner bathroom anyway so yeah we using this it has ingredients spices hey you know what it was absolutely good I'm sure some paprika and powdered stuff but now that we got the oil from when I tested my turkey fryer and uh hey Lorraine damn to everybody oops we're mama is regulating leave her alone so you just go to bed every now every now and then daddy gotta gotta speak up I forgot don't worry about it I forgot so yeah is this season it on however you like it whatever season is you're gonna use and then like I said before you put it in there make sure you let me see if this plan remove the plastic thing there's a usually a plastic thing in here hmm hmm usually it's a plastic thing I don't think I'm saying that good delicious fat for seasoning you know I'm gonna let y'all look at this because if I get a look gross here I don't see the plastic thing obviously the plastic thing isn't it a little plastic thing they usually hold the feet yeah usually holds this part together you know what that projects be a different brand of Turkey I'm a soul in there so yeah yeah but look it looks like they kind of tucked it under the fat or the skin of the turkey this time which is actually friendly to the environment that's a turkey but oh no anyway so I'm by the season this whole thing up and I'm gonna start by getting a fryer Troy all right John so to operate the dilly-o is pretty easy you plug it in once you plug it in this is going to blink right here so you can just press this plus or minus to set your temperature and then purge this again you don't get a flashing H see that you'll get a flashing H that just means that it's heating up I usually put my eyes right here by my window for a vent or whatever close to the edge here here all right so right now it's warming up got the turkey all seasoned up got a bald spot like Daddy you know saying so I'm actually uh tripping because I should have this turkey in the in the cradle so when it's ty I don't have to deal with a hot-ass cream so we're just gonna take this out real quick I got my eyes filled up just at the little bit above the mess fire it's supposed to say match right there so hopefully I won't set that no fire you see the oil starting to do it stay I'm close this up they're gonna do a stay and we gonna transfer that turkey oh reader all right huh okay all right so it's ready the green lights on the H stop now it takes 45 minutes for this thing to heat up to 45 degrees I didn't know that so uh we bout to go ahead with Randy just stand up and come over here now huh my foot just a tad bit too much grease up in that time so now you want to make sure that your turkey is not that wet and it's not frozen and we don't drive it real slow Hey and we fried turkey said so the H started blinking because the corner temperature drivers cuz that drop in there real slow you see all this famous stuff it's not a lie this is an indoor one so just hit the time you hit this button you're gonna hit hoedown plus we're gonna do it for 82 we gonna do about 85 minutes hit the timer dear boom it's said we fry the turkey get up in here real quick one more time oh never mind that steam is happening over this highway we pry the turkey nothing exploded let with bone how it's still in good shape I guess we could take off our house insurance now because that's all the reason why we had it on and we're good to go uh let y'all know a little bit how the turkey comes out shout out to my sexy yes I am looking at her boobies with my kids right here huh Danny got no feels really good say hi hello YouTube don't film the house of 30 okay alright do it stop alright so 19 pounds at four minutes was eighty minutes I left it in there for 85 to 87 minutes and this is what you're looking like I just took out there are nice boys about it dump it to the side a little bit to get the grease that still cooking in the cavity there so whoa there's your fried turkey you know I'll show y'all what I cut it alright so we cut in there you know we're not no professional turkey cutters so we just doing what we do that they look good and juicy look at all that hinges how that gives you something that time right there that's what I'm talking about that's what I'm talking about see that see that shininess all right so that's how you fried turkey yeah all right so we just went ahead and uh cut on through this half of this bread real quick I'll tell you it's delicious man still on shiny and good cuz you saw nice and cooked I put the herbs leftover culture herbs in there I mean man come on come on how easy that peeled off see they're gonna see the juices on that thing like subscribe and share", "NfjqnNjklnI": "MUSIC ONLY.", "-ZQMQ3b8zsc": "welcome to the lifestyle medicine clinic this is dr. David ruzek are you ready for health this session is on reading labels and shopping smarter if this is the first session that you found of ours on YouTube you might want to go to our website a lifestyle medicine clinic and take a look first at fill up with fiber and be like the Blue Zones before you do this session however this session is well might be helpful just as a standalone we'd like to start with our featured recipe this is Burgers and Fries modified from Jeff Novak's fast-food basics you can get the recipes on the sidebar on the left on the website uses all plant-based whole food ingredients we start out with some kidney beans these can be canned if you're looking to do them quickly ideally you want kidney beans that have low or no sodium if you can't find those and you're gonna use canned beans at least rinse them very well or if you have more time you can start your kidney beans from scratch get the dry bulk beans soak them cook them and you'd be ready to go then you add in some rice again if you're looking for the quick 10-minute recipe you can have some rice like the boil and bag brown rice or success' instant rice or whatever bram that's ready and it's precooked or you can get the bags of dry rice ideally you want the brown rice which is a whole grain rather than the white rice but if you if you have white rice you can use that you can put that in a rice cooker or a crock pot or do it on the stove by the directions and just a quick healthy hint if you make extra rice do the whole package and make extra rice you can freeze it away in small Ziploc freezer bags or storage containers and put it in rice and then you are put it in the freezer and then you will have rice ready when you need it the recipe also adds some tomato product it can be the diced tomatoes it could be tomato sauce or quite a variety of things that you can do and then the Quaker Oats or whatever brand you have of oats to help absorb the water and hold the burger together and then you want some salt free seasoning 'he's like mrs. dash or whatever other variety you have you want to mash those beans up either with a potato masher or you can do that with a fork and then mix them all together with the other ingredients in a bowl you can then shape them into nice patties the size you would for hamburgers if you have the time you can stick those in the fridge for about 20 minutes or so and they'll firm up as the the oatmeal absorbs more of the water and they kind of gel together nicely if you don't you can go ahead and use them right away if you need to get moving on with preparing the food then you can do them however you like and do them in a skillet you can bake them in the oven you can do them on a grill and then to go along with those are the healthy potato wedges you can have sweet potatoes or white potatoes cut those up into wedges like this put those in the oven under the broiler use some healthy no salt seasonings whatever you like on there can be something that's hot or something that's milder and flavor and then eat that burger with some other fresh veggies on a whole-grain bun and you've got a great healthy meal Bon Appetit so normally at this point we ask how you are doing and I would encourage you to take a moment if you've been following along and doing the lessons in order how are you doing I hope you're doing well I hope you're making some applications of the things that we've been teaching increasing the fiber in your diet limiting those animal products and processed foods and that you're achieving the success that you're hoping for well today we want to focus a little bit more on shopping and label reading obviously you have been shopping already and maybe reading some labels but not maybe the way we're going to encourage you to do that remember we're encouraging you to eat more plants fruits vegetables legumes whole grains and save those animal products and processed foods for special occasions minimizing those not having those every day but maybe at the most one or two days a week but most of the time eating the best foods the best foods are those without labels there are those bulk foods and the foods you find in that produce section remember the recommendations are 5 to 9 or even more servings of fruits and vegetables a day at least one helping of green leafy vegetables a day and that includes really cauliflower and broccoli as well as kale so those kind of things in cabbage are all all count in that for your green leafy vegetables so let's turn our attention to label reading you can find label really guidelines on the sidebar they're also in the packet of recipes that occur on the sidebar on the left as well and here's what we're going to do we're going to take these steps first we're gonna look at fast total fat as well as the bad fats the sodium content or salt content the ingredients overall then sugar and fiber so the first step if we want to look at this label here as they as we follow them down the total fat should be 20% or less of total calories and no unhealthy fats which are the saturated fats are trans fats or cholesterol the sodium density should be roughly equal to your calories you want to read the ingredients and eliminate any ingredients that obviously aren't healthy for you and the sugars you want to keep the sugars total less than 5% of the calories unless they're naturally occurring sugars in the fiber we want to see whole grains and ideally the carbohydrate to fiber ratio less than or equal to 5 we'll walk through all of those together so first starting out with the total fat you want at 20% or less than the total calories unfortunately that's right there on the top and here you can see this ratio 3 divided by 68 and times 100 percent and that's 4 point 4 percent obviously well below 20 percent this is this recipes good concerning fat content and you look down there's no saturated fat there's no cholesterol there's no trans fats you look at the calorie to sodium ratio and this one's pretty good it's about 1 to 1 you know it's not exact but the sodium is not 3 times the calories as you'll see in some of the labels we look to so this is pretty this is pretty good and you want to look at the ingredients can you easily pronounce them or there any of those unhealthy fats in particular from animal fats palm oils or coconut oils is there sugar in the three such as dextrose fructose maltose sucrose honey and molasses are the grains whole grain and they'll say so especially if it's wheat like this one it'll say whole wheat flour then you notice there's sugar in the top three there's also molasses later on down below and then honey and then there's also salt added so are they're camouflaged ingredients like whey encasing which are also animal products that you want to minimize and then in this label here you can see the preservatives the ammonium sulfate things like that that are added that ideally you don't want those if you can avoid them we look at sugar you want that total sugar percentage of calories to be less than 5% of the total calories this one you'll need to do a little math it's not done for you on the label since this one in particular doesn't have any we're okay but you'll see subsequent labels that we look at and then you want to look at this carbohydrate to fibre ratio you want that less than 5% if possible or less than five if possible and here you see it's four point three three so that's pretty good that means there's plenty of fiber and water in this item and it's probably pretty good to eat so let's look at some actual labels so here's some Kroger black beans and what's the first step look at the calories in the fact so 110 calories and 10 from fat so that's only nine percent that's pretty good we can we can move on to the next thing the unhealthy fats and you see there's no saturated fat no trans fats and no cholesterol so we're doing pretty good with the beans next step about the sodium so the calories are 110 but look the sodium levels 370 more than three times and you look at the ingredients and indeed their salt added so that's less than optimal but if that's all you have you use those you rinse them as best you can but you try to find beans that are lower sodium if possible next step we look at those ingredients overall so we've got prepared black beans water and the salt if they left the salt out it would be perfect next step sugars so here we look at the sugars and again there's zero so we don't need to do any calculations at this point next step we look at the carbohydrate to fibre ratio and if you look at that 19 divided by seven it's two point seven so beans definitely fit within that ratio that we want and they're these beans are good except for the sodium is there a better option well yes there is here's the simple truth organic beans that you can get from Kroger and if you look here that sodium to calorie ratio is about one to one look at the labels they still added sea salt which you don't need sea salt Himalayan salt pink salt it's all sodium you don't need it the others are more of a gimmick but here's the best no salt added no salt at all in the ingredients and the sodium is less than 10 percent of the calories this is what you're looking for ideal if you can find it let's look at another label one of the American favorites macaroni and cheese so step one look at the calories from fat versus the overall calories now this because he the macaroni and cheese in the box isn't finished you can look at it that way or you can look at it as prepared so we'll look at the finished product and if you look at 400 calories and 170 from fat and you do that calculation Wow forty two point five percent we're way over that twenty percent and then you look at the unhealthy fats and what do you see saturated fat from the dairy products cholesterol from the dairy products not great next step sodium Wow again 570 quite a bit of sodium in that it's not 2 to 1 from the completed product of 400 calories but it's still up there pretty good and that's a whopping sodium load as it is a whopping calorie load for the amount of food you're eating the next step look at the ingredients and they have enriched macaroni product which means process they've taken the fiber out and it's not a whole grain plus they've added lots of other things it got way milk fat a milk protein chemical names all kinds of stuff in there that you really would prefer not to have next step look at the sugars so this has 7 grams of sugar and you're looking at 400 calories so this one we do need to calculate out so 4 calories are in every gram of sugar so 7 times 4 is 28 and if you divide 28 by 400 you get that 7 percent so the sugars are higher than that 5 percent so we to again take note of that and realize that this isn't in our optimal range next step look at that carbohydrate to fiber ratio you don't really even need to do much math on that it's 48 everything is so processed there's no fiber in it or minimal fiber it just doesn't fit for us it's not the optimal food even though we love it but let's look at some whole-grain pasta by itself without all the cheese and stuff on it so step one we look at the fat calorie ratio and that's 9 percent so it's good we look at the other fats there's no unhealthy fats in this so we're doing pretty well next step look at the sodium it's very low so we're in great shape there then we look at what's listed whole grain durum wheat flour and semolina wheat so some of the flour in this is not whole-grain and to be listed as whole-grain look on the front of the package it says made with 51% whole wheat flour so it needs to be at least 51 to be advertised as whole-grain but that means that 49 percent can be processed so it's not ideal in that case but it's certainly better than most next step look at the sugars so remember the two grams we multiply that by for calories that's eight calories eight divided by 200 gives us four percent so the sugar level is good and then we look at the fiber and carbohydrate ratio and it's 6.8 it's pretty high it's out of our range so you want to keep this into that quarter plate when you're doing a seventy-five percent of your plate with foods high in fiber and water because this really is kind of low in fiber because of that 49 percent of the whole grain if you can find a whole-grain pasta that's even higher than that great grab it but this one doesn't but it's certainly better than the processed whole grain so the idea is pick the best that you can avoid the bad stuff do what you can to improve the health of the food you're eating so let's take a look at some breads here's nature's own this is a common bread we see this in Kroger I think Walmart carries it many other historians always carry it as well step 1 we look at the calories from fat you can see right there that the ratio is 10% so that's pretty good good start on this bread it doesn't have any of the unhealthy fats so we're doing well next step is the sodium and it's a little high one and a half on the ratio could be worse but then when you look at the ingredients and look at that it does have stone ground whole wheat flour but there's brown sugar in it right up there near the top and we prefer not to have any sugar added next then you look at the sugars and you actually calculate those out three times four is 12 to get your calories on the sugars you divide that by a hundred and you get 12% so that's above what we would like but that's those that brown sugar that was added to this bread step 5 we look at that carbohydrate to fibre ratio it's 5 so it's right at that borderline so generally this isn't bad it's more better than most it's a bit high in sodium it's high in added sugars but it certainly could be much worse if you look at some of the labels on white breads which we all take time but you'll see this one's passable if you're looking for a bread but if you're looking for a better bread or the best some something like Ezekiel bread there's a new line out as well they're in the freezer because they don't have any preservatives it's a little bit more expensive what we do is keep it in the freezer and take a slice out at us at a time as we need it and you'll find that this is a heavier bread you won't want as many slices of it likely so first step we look at the calories from fat and we've got 6.2 percent so we're well below that 20% next we look at the unhealthy fats there are none there we move on to the sodium no sodium nothing added so this certainly fits so far what we're looking for and then we look at the label and everything there is pretty healthy there's no added sugars the the first ingredients are that whole wheat hundred percent whole wheat so everything is good in there plus they've added some other things like lentils and soybeans this is pretty good from the ingredient perspective no preservatives and you look at that carbohydrate to fibre ratio and again it's five because it's drier so it fits in that quarter plate so you don't want to eat too much of it but certainly a slice of that along with the rest of your food is probably pretty decent compared to other breads how about crackers is there a cracker that you can eat well my favorite is Wausau and you can get these in most grocery stores and they're great with hummus guacamole but skip the cheese let's look at this label closer so we start out with that fat and we see that it's only 8% unlike many of the other crackers that will be high in fat we look at the unhealthy fats there's none there we look at the sodium it's a little higher than we'd like and they do add salt to these which I wish they hadn't but they did and but it's not too bad you look at all those other ingredients and they start out whole grain rye flour wheat bran pretty good none of the preservatives in there looks good and then when we look at the sugars none added and that fiber is 2.8 so it's high in fiber this one fits the categories pretty well how about one more let's throw some frozen broccoli in there just for comparison to see how this would look if we ran it through the same numbers step one the calories from fat are zero there's no unhealthy fats step two look at the sodium it's it's equal a one-to-one ratio there's no sodium added so that's intrinsic sodium in it step three ingredients only broccoli step four the sugar is now this might be surprising because two times four is eight calories and eight divided by 20 that gives you 40 percent sugar but this is the intrinsic sugar it's not added so that's just fine because the only ingredient is broccoli and the last step is looking at that fiber ratio it's two it's great eat your broccoli so let's take a couple minutes to just look through some of the things that we can buy to fill our refrigerators and our pantries with some healthy items Kroger is a very popular grocery store within our geographic area where I live and you can get very inexpensively things like potatoes and onions and garlic you can get sweet potatoes plenty of great options there don't forget to try those sweet potatoes if you're not used to them give them a try they're really great in soups you can cut them up like flies like we talked about earlier lots of great things you can do use these instead of baked white potatoes you might find that you really really like them one of the other things about Kroger that's helpful is they have their simple truth organic line of food you don't need to have organic products in some cases they're likely better healthier for you but don't get hung up on the extra price on organic just get the plant-based Whole Foods Organic is kind of a fine-tuning issue if you can afford it that's great but some of these are pretty inexpensive so we already talked about the black beans you want to get the ones that are no salt if you can but you can also get the bulk beans which are even less expensive and if you fix those up and then you can freeze those like we did with the rice and have those ready to go in your freezer then you've got no-salt-added beans ready to go the no sodium seasonings are also prepared there and noticed that a lot of grocery stores like Kroger have right next to the mrs. - their own brand which usually is a little less expensive and very similar in nature so you can try some of those out as well you can get some blends but you don't want the ones with salt notice on the right the garlic salt you want the garlic powder instead of the garlic salt so be sure you pay attention to the labels of that cinnamon great for things like your sweet potatoes and your oatmeal and then be cautious with hummus to some of the hummus like Sabra which is a very common brand out there has lots of extra oil so read the labels do the calculations and look for the hummus with the lowest fat in our geographic area we've got one here called Oasis and there's no added fats there's no added oils it's just the natural fat that's part of the ingredients so that's my choice when I go after a hummus and of course if you want some crackers to dip in it the Wausau crackers which we looked at are a great choice then there's the foods that I call transition foods they're processed and they're made to use as substitutes for animal products but they tend to add salt sugar and fat to make them healthy so read the labels just because it says that it's vegan or veggie and animal free read those labels because there might be a fair bit of salt sugar and fat in particular the fat often times used is that palm oil or coconut oil which are high in the unhealthy saturated fats so if you need these kind of transition that's ok tofu on the Left is is fairly healthy and we have several tofu recipes in our book that you can look at and the bread like the nature zone that we talked about or if you can find Ezekiel bread and some of the newer brands that are similar to Ezekiel that'll be right there next to them in that freezer section again read the labels be sure you've got something that's healthy how about some energy bars or things like that you got to be careful lots of them say healthy you know health bars no animal products and things like that but read the ingredients read the labels ideally what you want are the bars that only have ingredients that are a better plant-based no added salt sugar or fat so this one is pretty good just remember it's going to be higher in fat because of the nuts it's going to have that higher or that higher carbohydrate fiber ratio because it's going to be dry kind also has some of those as well and look at the ingredients they should be all natural ingredients with all that out any added sugars in our area we also have some other stores that a lot of areas around the country will have some but you may not have one in your area but we have a bulk food store sometimes there's food co-ops look for those in particular you can get some good deals on some bulk foods oftentimes I also probably have some unhealthy options big lots and a lot sometimes have some great opportunities they've got if you want some cold cereal the Kashi go lean which we've talked about earlier on in our first session is not being my favorite food but certainly better than the Froot Loops and things like that and then you've got your whole grain pastas and some granolas and mrs. mrs. - and then Bob's Red Mill cereals and beans great options that you can get we also have another health food store and you can look for these in various areas we call ours is the pharmacy with an F in Athens by our post office and again they have some bulk foods some other things that you can get sometimes they're a little pricey but if you're looking for some specific items that you can't find elsewhere some pretty good options they have lentils and things like that there and my favorite is you can grind your own peanut butter right there so no salt and it is the best it doesn't separate we get it we get it eaten before it separates out some other things you might want to try are the nutritional yeast as a condiment it's also high in vitamin b12 and that TVP textured vegetable protein which you can use as a meat substitute in your chilies and spaghetti sauce your your family won't even know it's not ground ground meat or ground turkey all these is also a popular chain around and if you shop there carefully you can find lots of other good options that are affordable again they've got the spices they've got the dried fruits they've got some canned goods that are well look for the the no salt added and the no sugar added as much as possible read those labels and we do have a pretty good produce selection as well so it browse through there and pretty much any grocery store if you look you'll find some things that are healthy again and all the they have another brand of hummus read the labels find out what the fat content is and they also have the almond milk and on the almond milk you want to get the unsweetened again if you need it sweetened for a while as a transition fine but you want to get away from that added sugar and get just the regular almond milk or soy milk without that and watch because some of them have vanilla added which if you like it that's great I prefer it without the vanilla so it's time to write some smart goals specific measurable attainable realistic and time oriented so for this session and you can find a gold a gold sheet on the Left sidebar if you're tuning in if you go to our website you'll be able to find that and I'm gonna ask you to then choose some goals maybe like this fill 75% of my shopping cart with produce and unprocessed bulk foods things without labels read labels and 75% of the items that I buy or if you don't have time because that's time consuming initially but at least maybe at home when you have a chance start reading the labels on everything you use and then you'll find the items over time that you want and you won't have to read the label every time once you identify the items that are good but you want to start increasingly to read the labels until you identify those products that are healthy and then maybe 90% of the things you buy will have fat calories at 20% or less than total calories maybe that's a good goal or one that says 90 percent of your items will have sodium levels equal to or less than the total calories so think through the things we've talked about the rules write some goals be sure you share those with your buddy ask your buddy to keep you accountable and see how you do are you ready for health I hope so", "B118r7kcTko": "it's like an episode of cribs except we're looking at my pantry pantry pantry here's what's going on okay we're obviously in the quarantine isolation phase and everything that I have in my pantry some of the things that you could live off of so I'm doing this video because people have been asking what are you stocked up on them what do you have so let's just take a look and I'll just go through everything that's in my pantry and talk about what I stocked up on and what you might want to consider stocking up on and the reasoning behind certain things my pantry people always ask I want to see what's in Thomas's fridge what's in Thomas's pantry so let's take a little look-see okay first hit that little red subscribe button and also hit that Bell icon that way you never ever miss the daily videos alright let's rock and roll let's see what's in crypts work okay so there's no real rhyme or reason to a lot of the way that I have things set up here but let's see first and foremost I've got lots lots of chomp sticks alright so these are the little chomping ones so these are smaller ones that my kiddo likes to have tons of macadamia nuts effective to open bags stock up on these guys okay if you're going to be stuck in quarantine if you're gonna be stuck in isolation of all the nuts that are out there macadamia nuts and pecans macadamia nuts because they have the higher basically better omega-3 omega-6 ratio but also high in palmitoleic acid so a really unique fat that has some pretty cool protein properties within the body in terms of different receptor proteins pecans are a second favorite for me at least right now because they're the highest antioxidant rich nuts so if you're looking for just more bang for the buck in terms of immunity then you want to go with the pecans if you watched my Costco pain free haul 1389 that's kind of a cool nut blend I think for the sake of this pantry haul I might actually go ahead and tie this they make the cut they make the Thomas de Lauer approved list that's how that ended up in there not something I would normally really have in there but didn't want it to go to waste got some LeConte or granola that they just sent me Oh guys these are quick get these on thrive market these are really cool these are sprouted organic mix the seeds let me show you this real quick alright so when you're looking at any kind of seed or nut sprouted is always better it's simple all it means is that they took the nut or seed and they soaked it for usually 24 36 sometimes 48 hours and basically what it does is it breaks down what's called phytic acid so it makes it so you can actually get the nutrients out of the nut so you can get the zinc now check this out sprout the pumpkin seeds sprouts sunflower seeds spread watermelon seeds when you're talking about a major just mineral boom here right look at this okay if you look at just one serving of this look at all the minerals in there it doesn't seem like much but 135 9 milligrams of magnesium he's huge you're not gonna find that nice thing is because it's sprouted you're actually gonna utilize that so I love that stuff I got the epic barn you got to talk about those let's see what else is in some of the other drawers here they said no real rhyme or reason let's go take a look at this drawer let's go here first all right this is my protein drawer now in this case kind of interesting stuff okay so I've got wild pink salmon normally I'd have wild sockeye index I still have some of that left so the cool thing about the wild sockeye is it's actually going to have a better and make a three profile but the reason that I like the sockeye is because it's high in a really cool antioxidant the reason that salmon is pink to begin with is because of the astaxanthin but acid xanthine it's kind of a unique antioxidant okay you think about it like this salmon swim upstream right so they're really creating a lot of oxidative stress within their body because they're working out a lot that creates stress so they have a natural built-in antioxidant within them that literally is assless anthem so the pink stuff the stuff that makes salmon pink is actually what protects the fats and makes them usable within the body so in this case I like sockeye visits a deeper red meaning it's higher in acid xanthine usually like Alaskan sockeye because they're the ones that are really swimming upstream a lot so that high red pigment is actually making the fats more usable in the body so I totally stock up on that stuff check out what else I've gotten that little kind of weird protein fish drawer okay I've got sardines which I'm always talking about okay in this case they're in olive oil usually I like them in water but I had to take what I could get now on the contrary I have wild white anchovies which are going to be equally high in omega-3s to be completely honest smaller fish so even more sustainable but this one I was able to score I was able to get a little case in water with sea salt okay I could live off with one or two of these and have a pretty good amount of protein to be completely honest and a good amount of omega-3 then here I have a wild pink salmon I had to settle for the bag in this case because I didn't want to get it in oil so this is a little bit different because this is a little Alaskan salmon but it's not the same as the sockeye so it's a little bit different fat content a little bit different mineral profile a little bit different antioxidant but as you can see I get a nice little variety so I can switch it up now let me show you something that I'm really proud of okay my smoked oysters these guys are my go-to when you are fighting illness or when you are concerned with illness you should load up on placers if you like them if you don't like them don't choke them down but they are one of the if not the most rich zinc they are they are one of the if not the most rich in zinc foods that's out there when you are sick what's going on is you have the activation of what's called a zip a transporter it's a specific kind of protein that transports zinc into immune cells and into sort of the inflammatory cytokine storm what that means is the zinc is actually going to modulate inflammation in some ways so really really important when you're sick now sometimes the last thing you want to think about when you're sick is eating oysters I understand you can always take a Zeke tab but bioavailable is always better so that's why I stocked up the best that I could now when it comes to oysters you usually can't get them in water so these are all in olive oil okay hand packed and olive oil naturally smoked in olive oil and smoked with red chillies okay then I have one other thing in this drawer kalamata olives you don't have to get kalamata olives but I just love these because they're good source of vitamin d2 which could at least get converted in d3 if I had the right mechanisms within the body if I was actually had the right nutrients in point is just a good healthy snack it's kind of in a random drawer and then lastly I have this canned chicken in this drawer also wild planet so this canned chicken is the only to see if I have another one I can show you really quick hang on if I flash forward to my canned drawer oh here we go check this out look at the ingredients in that organic chicken breast I cannot believe that exists literally and look at no sodium no salt added or sorry 25 milligrams but no salt added that is so cool so it's from wild planet who also makes like the canned sardines and stuff FYI you can get this stuff on the rive market so it's super super cool I will say almost all the things I'm talking about here you can get on thrive market they might be different brands but you can get these things on thrive market I highly highly highly recommend that you check them out right now in the grocery stores you might feel a little bit more difficult it might be harder to get some things I highly highly recommend that you check them out and get your groceries through there and you can use my link down below to get yourself a little bit better access but also we've gone ahead and we've created a specific list of pantry essentials that I've created so Thomas tell our pantry essentials for the given situations so you can stock up your home with the right kind of caloric lean and stuff to make sure you check that out but let's continue to check out my pantry I just want you to be able to get that special discount vo check out thrive market right now because it really is worth it okay so now that we've finished up basically the protein fish drawer let's go ahead and let's take a look actually this is more of the snack drawer this is more of just kind of the fun stuff so it's been just a little bit of time here okay I always talk about dark chocolate dark chocolate is one of the highest antioxidant content foods that's out there in fact literally it might be the highest okay very very good stuff you just want to get unsweetened regular chocolate okay see 100% cacao unsweetened baking chocolates it's bitter okay but you can melt it down you can add some stevia okay then coconut butter highly recommend that you guys check this stuff out I don't care what brand you get but look at this profile here okay we've got 105 calories per tablespoon 11 grams of fat 4 grams of carbs 3 of which are fiber for what it's worth that is a tremendous fatty acid profile but it's also a very good fat to fibre profile which I like to see I like to see you good amount of fat good amount of fiber why again immune health okay we're looking at gut health we're looking at short chain fatty-acids of butyric acid which can feed epithelial cells helps support that gut wall that we need to be taken care of right now when we're looking at developing the right immunoglobulin a the right kind of things that are gonna help defend us from any kind of illness Plus that stuff tastes absolutely insanely good okay then we tried this just Maranatha dark that was a mistake sorry um it was horrible bitter nasty maranatha omen then why isn't that there that honestly shouldn't be there any point is is if you're going to go with peanut butter at least go with the one that isn't hydrogenated I guess we're all human too this is like a vice it's not supposed to be here for obvious reasons because it's way too dangerous anyhow that's why it's in a treat door and then fat snacks cookies but you guys know I talk about all the time they're kind of my little treat then you guys are looking at this sand what yes cereal what's going on here no this stuff's cool I don't know if you've seen ads for them before it's called magic spoon so this is like a keto cereal so it's a whey protein isolate coconut oil tapioca flour ally Louis monk fruit and stevia chicory root fiber natural flavors and salt yeah so it's literally like a keto healthy cereal so that way if kiddo wants a little snack we can do something a lot better than just giving them regular cereal but also I've been known to dive into that stuff now and then at least when I'm being a little bit more relaxed on my diet so that's something that's kind of in there no matter what it's not something we particularly stocked up on but the next thing I'm going to show you is something that people ask about all the time yes this shouldn't have been the one that we got because this one has a couple grams of added sugar but you know how when I talk about breaking a fast sometimes I say to spike your insulin really fast well usually what I'll have when I break my fast it's usually an unsweetened rice cake and maybe a couple rice cakes and a protein shake in this case we have the chocolate ones but sometimes you like a little treat so that's kind of a cool thing there so we break your fast have something high glycemic like a rice cake corn tortilla something like that anyhow story for a different day and then lastly we have some gluten-free beef jerky this one's got a couple grams of sugar and it's not exactly Kido think Amber's eating some of this ones that's not necessarily Kido but still at least the clean jerky like I said there's no real rhyme or reason to a lot of the stuff I have in my pantry I just want you to be able to see what I stock up on generally and what I had a lot of right now during this time and what I'm leaning on because I'm not really going to the store because I'm getting my meat really like through either put your box or thrive and then I'm getting most of my groceries from thrive and I'm not really going to the store much like we really shouldn't be right now so anyhow let me continue to show you a little bit more but just remember well the stuff that I'm showing you you can get via the link down below at thrive market you know it's to buy a big bundle of it you can just check stuff out at the right okay this drawer is kind of random this is like the can / condiment drawer but I think you'll get a kick out of this okay cilantro lime ranch dressing I wanted to show you one particular thing on this high oleic sunflower oil people have questions about high oleic all the time what does that really mean you know sirens they're coming for me okay high oleic means that a essentially concentrated more of the oleic acid out of a given oil so you'll find high oleic soybean high oleic sunflower high oleic safflower oil it really doesn't mean much basically what they've done is they've made it a more stable monounsaturated fat to make it shelf stable it's a heck of a lot better than making it hydrogenated normally you'd see like a trans fat in that so testaments did a good job cilantro lime ranch just something we might use as a salad rice and usually we look for olive oil but it's not always found even when you see olive oil dressings are usually canola soy and then a little bit of olive oil okay let's see what else we got in here always stock up on pumpkin okay if you're ever going to be in a situation where you have to live off shelf stable food this is probably one of the most nutrient-dense things that you can get plus the digestive enzymes in pumpkin are really really really good so if you get a little bit constipated when you're stuck at home not a bad thing there this stuff's cool this is evaporated coconut milk so for baking where you normally would use like regular milk or evaporated milk you can use this stuff let's see what else we got in the cans section you wanted to get a bigger jug of this but organics sauerkraut again gut health everything we have to do to focus on the immune system right now is going to be gut health-related take care of the gut take care of your immune system 70 to 80 percent of your immune system is in your gut probiotic rich sauerkraut you just need a tablespoon or two of that and you're in good shape try to stock up on marinara but I figured this would last for a couple weeks with between the couple that I've gotten this Victoria one I really like because look at this ingredients tomatoes onions avocado oil salt garlic basil and spices only six grams of carbs mainly coming from of course the tomatoes that's some really good clean stuff then I stock up a ton on coconut milk I've got some coconut cream yeah coconut cream which is basically just high fat coconut milk so I can use that for baking I can use that for cooking I can use it for making curries I can use it to put in my hot chocolate that I make with unsweetened cocoa all kinds of stuff secret listen up yeah I'm sure we got more pumpkin okay and it's not pumpkin pie seasoning for mix it's actually pumpkin okay so again we're getting a good enzymatic effects they're really good for the digestion you know what do you know more can't chicken so this is the canned chicken that we had a stock of before we went out and got more sorted okay let's see what else we got what's in this next report okay so this is more just regular pantry staples okay we've got poppy seeds and burgers using for baking it stocked up on a little bit more mayo this is pesto Mayo primal kitchen again the stuff you can get on thrive - I've gotten this in fact I literally got this on thrive avocado oil organic eggs organic a oaks super-clean Mayo I'm all about stocking up on the high calorie stuff if you're going into a situation right you want to make sure you're stocked up on the right stuff okay then I've got beef tallow again calories calories calories common theme here I'm getting calorically dense foods and nutrient dense foods you don't see a whole lot of empty calories here you see dense calories that aren't getting fuel help ketone production help keep me sated if I went into a mode where I couldn't go to the store for a long time but I could still keep you know at least nutrient-rich chilies this shouldn't be in this one this is more primal kitchen this is vodka sauce for non-dairy though so instead of having cream it uses like cashews I'm not the biggest man of Kashi news but in this case it's kind of okay it's minimal always talking about kettle and fire bone broth usually I have like a whole dedicated drawer to this stuff I generally break my fast with a couple ounces of bone broth just because it's good for the gut mucosal layer when you do fast if you're practicing intermittent fasting it breaks down the gut mucosal layer a little bit so you just need to try to take care of it by getting some of the gelatin that's in bone broth fun fact you really only need like two ounces you don't need much drive has a version a little bit less expensive if you're a thrive member so again you can use that link down below but same kind of thing fact it's probably white label Kevin fire also has a keto soup usually have a couple of those then I have some Trader Joe's low-sodium chicken broth we got a bunch of that actually we stocked up on that because you never have enough broth and then it wouldn't be a Thomas de Lauer video if I didn't have some apple cider vinegar right so I got that by like I like the geography that and then let's see what else we got all right of course we got some olive oil got my Cholula got some balsamic got some regular peanut sauce nothing really crazy here some curry all right here's the baking section that's good to talk about tapioca flour you can tell we do a lot of keto baking amber is like the queen of pita baking coconut flour we got some xanthan gum Oh looks like Tommy's out of the back I can hear him hold on a teen night hemp seeds this is kind of an extra one I do like to use hemp protein and have season ever possible amber makes a really good called an oatmeal no oatmeal so it's like oatmeal made with hemp and stuff like that so hemp is a complete protein but exceptionally high in methionine which can help some different conversion processes in the body help you get a little bit healthier okay let's see what we got here okay flax meal so what we do is we'll take flax meal take a little bit of almond flour take a little bit of psyllium you mix that with some water and you have bread you have a flatbread it's literally all you need to do to make a flatbread it is really cool you can ask me nutritional use to it in your misshape now something very important to tell you about nutritional yeast which is something that I think it should be on everybody's pantry staple lists we share this with you I'm gonna flip the camera around okay one of the most b12 rich foods that you're gonna find okay nutritional use is super underrated okay the vegan community uses a lot of it therefore the keto community the carnivore community all the other communities tend to kind of poopoo it a little bit because they're like oh it's the vegan food no this stuff is so rich in vitamin b12 and newsflash you need b12 to help build antibodies if you don't have vitamin B you don't produce antibodies it is so so so important for you so make sure you're getting nutritional yeast plus it does have a slight minute sense right it does have a slight excited toxin effect so it does kind of light your brain up so it actually makes food that cannon would be bland taste a little bit better without having to add MSG so it's a fun fact I do recommend having that okay then we've got my baking cocoa lots among fruit pistachio flour was kind of a neat thing okay if you know my recipe for muumuus what I do before bed is I have baking cocoa and then I mix it with almond milk and then mix it with a little bit of coconut cream and a little bit of stevia or monk fruit and or and there we go you've got hot chocolate it's pretty darn epic okay let's see what's in this bottom door here alright ginger juice I usually have a case of this too but with everything that's been going on it's been a little bit crazy with shipping haven't been able to get things so get the ginger juice and then I've got paleo birch spend your pancakes now these paleo one's kind of funny here they're technically a couple carbs in so they're not as keto friendly but then you've got their birch benders keto version well ingredients wise I actually prefer the paleo ones now technically this one's more keto friendly but I'd rather have a little bit less pancakes and have the paleo when the keto one okay look at the ingredients on the paleo one cassava starch just very good coconut flour very good almond flour eggs leavening basically just baking soda salt monk fruit and spice whereas this one has almond flour eggs tiger nut flour coconut flour cassava starch buttermilk lemon or sorry butter no leavening the reason is is I'm not the biggest fan of Tiger nut flour because I seem to have a sensitivity to it and a lot of people that I know do as well it doesn't mean that you can't have it I just like the profile the Paleo one better anyhow these are just a pancake mix so super healthy pancake mix and again you can get those at sprouts Whole Foods whatever I think actually they literally hung that thrive market too so you can still use that link if you wanted to get them online keto by the way dogs are not out of water okay maybe out perfect keto these are some keto Institute coffee that I'll use now and then it's kind of like a just a keto coffee this is LeConte Oh liquid monk fruit so I like this because there's no erythritol I'm sorry we're just water monk fruit extract and natural flavors and then they have a lemon one and I'll use that when you have to be careful with natural flavors a lot of times so with natural flavors they can add what are called incidental additives 150 different non-regulated compounds that go into natural flavors unless you trust the brand look out for natural flavors I trust the canto I use them a lot I know their natural flavors are did an ethically sourced so I'm not worried about it but just word to the wise and yes we have way too many of those we stocked up on that because we know the inventory issues could come into play there hey look who's here okay we're gonna start to speed it up a little bit here just to save some time but just so you see everything the pantry okay you got some waters yeah butternut squash pretzels which are a little bit deceiving I'll show you something okay cassava squash non-gmo corn starch non-gmo expeller pressed canola oil cauliflower salt vegetable Brent blend so pretty darn clean in the way of a cracker and you know if you're gonna give the kiddo a little cracker I would recommend something cream like this and at least its color Kreskin oil so it's not terrible stuff you summit handlers whoops Amber's electrolyte supreme this is magnesium I think you know we're all magnesium people here so this is a magnesium based electrolyte paleo bars actually you might have seen me get these on my Costco haul 1249 for a box of 20 I mean that's like less than a dollar a pop that's really really good okay so this is really super cool the only thing that was a bummer in there was the honey which is high in fructose but again if you're not doing keto it's not too bad just so you know this is appropriately filmed at the right time look at my stash of vitamin C all different brands yeah I just got my hands on what I could get my hands on in fact in fact my own company pure thrive literally got back ordered like 30,000 units so I had to start stocking up from other brands literally so I started getting as much vitamin C as I could people were hoarding toilet paper I was boarding vitamin C that's why did those videos talking about mega dosing vitamin C everything here is filmed at the right time I'm talking in real life okay this is March 2020 anyhow let me show you what else is in here oh then I've got more more fish more canned fish we've got more albacore this one's in extra virgin olive oil okay so that's why it's not down where I can just grab it okay I always try to get tuna sardines whatever in water just because I don't want the extra calories I just want the protein generally in this next style okay this is potassium chloride why the hikma\u00edah potassium chloride because I like to use potassium chloride every now and then just to get a few extra minerals in me you could get this stuff literally on Amazon for like eight bucks like a jug it's gonna last you it should last you five years if it doesn't last you five years you're probably using too much get that other way really quick okay then I picked this stuff on the Costco haul when I was trying to identify the best proteins that were there I'm not a big whey protein person but in this case I did use often the nutrition simply because that is going to look at the ingredients here you want whey protein isolate okay you don't necessarily want natural flavors but stevia leaves no sucralose and a little xanthan gum you want whey protein isolate because you do not want whey protein concentrate pay very close attention to that okay then I have Sunwarrior which is usually my go-to for breaking up fast so I'll use this because look at this blend here pea protein hemp protein goji berry a really cool fatty acid profile really cool carb profile it's just really really clean so I recommend breaking your fast with pea protein okay then I have my collagen that I'm always talking about perfect keto collagen that's not just different flavors stocked up on that I can live off this stuff if I really need it to and we're wrapping it up here pretty soon you know that I'm not key to all the time so I cycle in another pedo so what do I have if I'm not keto well lentil pasta bonzai chickpea pasta I'm very limited when I'm not moving keto okay when I'm not doing keto I'm very very clean very clean low glycemic carbohydrates so Trader Joe's red lentil pasta and I also have natural heaven which is that hearts of palm pasta stock check this out really good nutrient profile there okay so here's the thing I want to know I keep list out all these brands ok people would think that I'm a total sellout so if you are interested in knowing what brands I'm talking about all you have to do is comment ok and I can try to reply to you with any links or anything like that the only one I will link to is the dive market because a they're a sponsor of this channel they've helped me out a lot they're supporting this video but also because a lot of the stuff that I'm listed here you can get on the right market then lastly I have chlorella tabs which I stocked the heck up on I got a ton of it because the chlorella is going to be a great heavy-metal detox er so if I'm going to have a bunch of canned fish and things like that where I know I might be getting in some mercury I might be getting in some toxins I do want to take in chlorella I do want a conspiracy that chlorella is one of the only compounds algae that's been shown in multiple studies to chelate minerals that are stress and chelate iron and chelate heavy metals that means it can get them out of your body so anyhow well that's about that let me show you one more thing you usually have these guys in the pantry apple cider vinegar drinks easy deities are pretty awesome too that is about that nothing too crazy everything I usually talk about I'm stocked up for quite a while maybe next time I'll do a fridge tour if you want to see me do a fridge tour comment it down below you guys are super awesome thank you so much for taking the time to watch this and see my pantry excursion and my this episode of TT cribs I mean pantry anyhow you guys are awesome thank you so much don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you in the next video you", "aeQUytoIuqo": "drink green live green live international live life well today you know I've just had a lot of information that I wanted to share and decide you know let's put it out there where people can have access to the information and so thanks everybody for getting on whether you're on Facebook or on the webinar with us thank you very much for joining us and a lot of you may wonder why we tied in the two topics hydration and gut health they kind of seem so distant and apart from each other why would we tie those two together well hopefully by the end of this short webinar we'll be done in by uh by twelve o'clock we'll be hold to our thirty minutes and hopefully by the end you'll understand the tie between hydration and gut health and the importance of both of them for our overall health and why those are probably the two biggest keys in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and and our health so I am going to share with all of you my screen alright hopefully that works my grandkids pry could have done that in ten seconds but it'd take me a little longer alright we're gonna talk about hydration and gut health today and we're gonna jump right in why is hydration so important well we're mostly water seventy-five percent of the brain is one or 90 percent of our blood lungs are 90 percent water here's the interesting fact two percent drop in body water can cause a small shrinkage of the brain I don't think any of us want to deal with shrinkage okay that is not something that we like so that can impair I don't know if anybody's ever seen somebody who is running a marathon and I'll send their body just fails they can't stand up they can't walk they look like they're drunk and that typically comes from the dehydration and from the and lack of the possibly electrolytes and other things so the motor skills don't work and and to a lesser degree that happens every day if we're dehydrated we may not be able to concentrate a lot of times we get that afternoon fatigue we think well it's a blood sugar drop you know what it may be partly due to a hydration issue as we go throughout the day and so staying hydrated consistent hydration is really important all day long so other interesting thing is it's estimated at about 75% of the people have chronic dehydration well huh here's an interesting thing anti-acid says sometimes they drink a glass of water just to surprise my liver you know a lot of us don't drink enough water and our body needs water to function at its optimum so why not just hydrate with plain water or drink an electrolyte drink let's look at what we get when we drink an electrolyte drink okay here's a typical one I've got my little kid they go out and they go run and they're there at the the park and they and so we need our electrolytes back right that's why we're gonna drink this is Powerade or one of the other products because we know that those electrolytes are so important we'll talk about sugar later but the electrolytes are so important do you know that you would need to drink five bottles of that just to get the equivalent of potassium that you would get in one banana so what do you think it's healthier drinking five times what how many calories is that in sugar versus eating of banana so our healthy choices is what we're gonna talk a little bit about today first of all you don't just lose electrolytes when you sweat okay so we think of electrolyte sodium potassium so if you drink a sports drink what do they put they put a little sodium a little potassium back in there if you notice a label copy you know how much potassium is 1% of the daily requirement so you would have to drink a lot of sports drink to get enough potassium to help replace what you're losing as you exercise so that may not be the best choice but we also lose other things like trace and the trace middles go out of our body when we get dehydrated and we can we need to replace those and so if we're just drinking sports beverages we may not get those other trace minerals that are so important so let's just take a minute and look at some of those trace minerals okay we have a lot of minerals and what's important is that they come in balance a lot of people say well I'll drink you know I drink a lot of soda pop and that'll take care of because it's got some minerals in it if you look at this wheel this shows that hydration is all about balance and if you drink for example most soda pop you'll read on the label contains phosphoric acid okay phosphoric acid is a high level of phosphorus in phosphorus if we eat a lot of meat a lot of other types of foods have very high levels of phosphorus but if you look at this wheel you can see I'll explain it quickly that these arrows as they point out they show that an excess of phosphorus will deplete the other minerals that are where the arrows are pointing in other words if you look to the left phosphorus will deplete zinc it will deplete iron it will deplete calcium it will deplete Capri Oh deplete magnesium and manganese so getting an excess of phosphorus is not necessarily healthy and so that's why it's so important to have our minerals in balance and that's what we get will eat fruits and vegetables when we eat healthy foods that come from from the ground ok so let's talk about a few lesser-known benefits of hydration first of all water is needed to transport nutrients around our cells ok it we need water to make muscle energy it's essential to stay hydrated to build muscle so if we're working out hydration is not just about not passing out or not having muscle cramps it's actually about helping ourselves to build muscle and do our optimum sports performance so you know drinking that Gatorade may help because of the hydration but there are better sources of hydration for our bodies the thing is a lot of all I don't want to retain fluid if I drink a lot of water I'm gonna retain fluid so therefore you know I want to look better but really the body when you get dehydrated it perceives dehydration as a threats or survival and so it starts to hang on to that water water is sword in extracellular spaces and so one of these happens well you can think of temporary diuretic you'll see ballpoint number three you can take a diuretic which will help reduce that and you know some bodybuilders will do diuretics those kinds of things because they want the muscle definition however long-term we want to if we stay hydrated the body perceives as conditioning and it will help eliminate the height the fluid retention so staying hydrated actually helps reduce fluid retention okay also hydration is important for weight release for reaching our optimum weight you'll find there are a lot of diet plans a lot of programs things like keto diet urnament fasting that sometimes we don't get enough liquid into our bodies and really that's what cleans up and detox is ourselves so water also suppresses the appetite okay it's interesting if you drink cold water versus warm water tap water you actually burn calories as your body heats up that water as you drink it so put your ice cubes in your water drink it and the calorie counts it looks like you can live about five pounds a year just by drinking cold water versus hot water or warm temperature water you know a lot of times we feel like we're hungry but we're really thirsty and so replacing our thoughts of hey I'm hungry I need a snack with hey I'm thirsty I'm gonna go get something healthy to drink there's definitely a great way to to help reduce calories in to and to lose weight okay also it's interesting that do I'll just read this one do studies have shown that a decrease in water intake causes fat deposits to increase while an increase in Dante can actually reduce fat deposits okay and that has to do with the kidneys and the liver function and since the livers primary functions is to metabolize stored fat that if it's working to perform functions of the kidneys then your body your livers not functioning properly you have less store less of your stored fat that's burned and so your weight loss may be lessen okay so it not only is important for hydration to you know just to stay healthy but it can help with weight loss athletic performance and several other things so when should you get hydrated you don't just drink your water in the morning or drink it at night you need to stay hydrated throughout the day the best thing you can do is carry something with you to stay hydrated drink it when you feel like you want to smack drink something and you really need to hydrate whether you're thirsty or not okay so stay hydrated the best way to do that to carry something with you to stay hydrated okay if you drink a lot of caffeine coffee drinkers if you drink a lot of coffee or soda drinkers you need to actually increase your hydration and again as I mentioned cold hydrations better and having a good source of hydration is really important now let's look at what our source of hydration is if you look at if we look at that soda as a possible source or obesity risk increases by 60% so it's soda really a great choice you know once so today increases your risk of diabetes by 22% so for me so does not the best choice and where are we headed with diabetes in the US I mean look at that we're not hitting the right direction with cases of diabetes and a lot of that's attributed to the increase in the amount of sugar that we're putting in our diet and primarily that comes from the things that we drink so is a sports beverage the answer for us well if you look at this typical sports beverage a 32 ounce bottle contains 11 teaspoons of sugar okay that's a lot of sugar now if we're saying okay but I'm drinking it further asking for those electrolytes and I'm going to put I need those electrolytes because I don't want to get cramps you'd need to drink 25 bottles of that to get the required the single daily requirement for potassium so for me the trade-off is not that good because you'd be drinking 25 times 11 that's a lot of sugar you'd be needing to drink in order just to get your daily potassium levels well how about fruit juices and you know fruit juices are good fruit juices contain fiber they contain a lot of other things but oftentimes when we concentrate a fruit juice we also concentrate the sugar so let's look at these these say no added sugar but you know what there are 11 teaspoons of sugar in a 15 ounce bottle my grandkids are drinking this I don't know that's pretty healthy and I started to look at what's in it and because they're concentrated fruit juice you just have to be careful and not overdo it okay can somebody drink some of that absolutely is it pretty healthy absolutely but making that our main source of hydration is not what we want to do so I've come up with a little acronym about talking about hydration and it's about the things we need to think about now I'm going to talk about some specific products that I've developed for a live international but if you're I just want you to follow the concept of this ahead because whatever your choices are these are the keys to healthy hydration and to to basically stay healthy okay so as we think about hydration just think of ahead first of all alkaline a lot of things we drink are way too acidic they the just most of the things that when we exercise we create acid so trying to balance alkalinity in our body and pH is important healthy hydration electrolytes which we just talked about antioxidants and then detoxing water helps detox our body so green tea o is a product I designed with those items in mind with the alkaline pH balance make sure it tasted good you know designed a lot of products that taste terrible these are some of the things that are and are not in - oh and I just want to go through why each one of these parts of the ahead word are so important so II the electrolytes fulvic mineral complex and I mentioned that the sports treats typically put a little potassium a little sodium back in their drinks we use a special plant mineral base in this because it needs to have the complex remember that mineral wheel it needs to have the complex trace minerals and not just a little sodium and potassium you know that's like fertilizing your garden with just one mineral you need to have that complex that's why you put manure on it because it has a complex of plant nutrients and so the fulvic mineral complex our plant deposits and these are some of the things that they do you know we need minerals for DNA synthesis we can't get foods out of the air they have to come our body don't manufacture minerals they've got to come from the foods we eat and we need to have them on a regular basis and consistently the problem is even if we're eating right a lot of the minerals are not in our soils anymore and not in our crops you know years ago we died you know people our grandparents or even us we'd have a garden and we'd eat those and we'd have organic fertilizer and we'd use and we would get a lot of those trace minerals that would come back through those natural fertilizers what we find out now is that a lot of the farming is very sterile and a lot of the trace minerals are out of the soil so even for eating good even if we're eating the three to five portions of fruits and vegetables you know we may not be getting the the trace minerals that we need and trace minerals are important ok another part of healthy hydration then why I put the green to those and the look skinny's together is because a chlorophyll is very important chlorophyll and these are a couple of studies about white chlorophyll ants work and so chlorophyll is the lifeblood of the plants that's why the product is green chlorophyll does have some very special benefits and this is a highly concentrated version of the chlorophyll okay the next one was antioxidants and for me antioxidants are really important because they are the protectors of our body they help reduce cellular damage if we're exercising whether you know just living and breathing and breathing in toxic things that we may be breathing or coming into contact with chemicals antioxidants help reduce some of the cellular damage one of the antioxidants that we use as cause I chose this because it has some other very unique principles it's called resveratrol and it actually activates a gene called a certain one gene which helps break down stored fat it's also been associated with increased lifespan in in animal studies and so resveratrol interesting the unique antioxidant why because it not only you know vitamin C is a great antioxidant vitamin C has some vitamin E has some great properties but resveratrol has not only function as an antioxidant but it also helps in these various other ways helps with cognition glucose control heart health bone health energy metabolism and it also helps you reduce calorie now the reason I put it in the green too low is because one we need antioxidants remember I mentioned that but too it has these other benefits that we can have on a daily basis we can't just eat food one time during the week and say oh I'm covered with all my nutritional needs no and the same thing is with our antioxidants our hydration those things that our electrolytes we need those on a daily basis to stay in maximum health and another thing that for me that's important is that one of my pet peeves okay is that people will make a claim about a particular nutrient and they'll say oh this this has let's say for example I'm going to use it a aspirin okay our product has aspirin that we know aspirin reduces headaches and then they put one milligram and well we know that aspirin at one milligram does not work but they still make the claim and this happens time and time again with natural supplements they'll put a supplement in there an ingredient but not put anything in there in a sufficient quantity to make it work and still make the claim like it's going to work so let me just tell you about resveratrol it's the active ingredient wine it's what they claim the has all of the benefits of drinking wine it's because of the resveratrol okay so green tea oh we want to put enough in there so that it's going to work it has in every stick of green - oh and again we're just back to the antioxidant and some of those other properties it has more resveratrol than an entire bottle of red wine okay another source of resveratrol if you want to get it from natural sources 600 blueberry pies and obviously ours does come from a natural source but it's isolated and concentrated more resveratrol and 600 blueberry pies I think you get a little bit sugar food 600 blueberry pies 13 pounds of pistachios or 200 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and I bring those up because those are all good they are listed as good sources of resveratrol now I didn't pick something that doesn't have her as Vera control in it so hydration get ahead alkaline healthy hydration electrolytes antioxidants and detox and you know what water is one of our great detox errs it helps rid the body of waste products so staying hydrated is critical as we detox detox our body and those protectors the antioxidants can also help us in our detoxing okay all right so you're probably wondering well why do we tie gut health with hydration well guess what the first key to gut health and that is funny because that's a scientific term the gut is hydration is the number one key to gut health why because dehydration affects the mucosal lining you get all sorts of problems and sticking in the in the gut and not being able to absorb the nutrients that you need okay so when I just talk just for a minute I know we're running low on time but we're gonna get through this your microbiome you're gonna hear more and more about the mic crow biome because that's the kind of you know a few years ago as antioxidants in a few years and it's been doing tropics and you're gonna hear a lot more about the microbial because you know what they're finding out that your microbiome which includes all of the stuff all of your microbes inside and outside your body we're mainly talking about what's inside you're testin trite now but they affect your brain your kidneys your heart they've linked certain types of bacteria with increased obesity now that's kind of interesting right it's the bacteria in your gut that's cause you need to be fat not the fact that you're sitting on the couch eating doughnuts so we can blame it on our lonely little microbes that are good but they're even doing studies with athletic performance and finding if they can alter the microbes in the gut and which these microbes reduce inflammation boost energy strength and bones elevate hydration and they also create a higher antioxidant defense so having the right microbes in your gut is critical to overall health and scientists what they call your gut is your enteric nervous system we all know about our central nervous system while they're calling this the enteric nurdles nervous system two thin layers of more than a hundred million nerve cells that line our gastrointestinal tract and they not only control digestion but also break down a food they control blood flow nutrient absorption so having a healthy enteric nervous system is critical and it's also interesting that they've found that it seems to be communicating directly with the brain so your gut there's a gut brain connection and high levels of stress processed foods and not enough sleep also wreak havoc on the ombr\u00e9 on the gut and on the brain just on your body so first key is healthy hydration second key is prebiotics prebiotics are things that create a friendly environment okay so here are some examples in Ulan garlic onions lentils chickpeas another one is Jerusalem our well how many of us eat a lot of those every single day probably not most of us so you need to look for your supplements with prebiotics that's one thing that I included in the green to own in the live skinny are the prebiotics because to me that's again something that we need to have that's healthy every single day so look for prebiotics they're basically fibers that your body feeds on that your good bacteria feeds on and then creates that good enteric nervous system so that's critical so let's look at green tea oh how the prebiotic fiber works basically you drink the green - oh it goes into the small intestine and there it actually helps increase fecal volume and helps maintain gastrointestinal health one other side effect is it also as shown that it helps balance blood sugar levels and so if you're taking that drink in along with a meal it helps stop that that blood sugar rush and helps balance your blood sugar levels so prebiotics are extremely important and that's another reason why I put them in with along with the green - and probiotics now probiotics are a little bit different those are our friendly happy bacteria and I put probiotics into another product called III now probiotics you can get multiple sources of probiotics one of the probiotics do they help block out the bad guys help increase the good guys the good bacteria so it's important how the prebiotics create a friendly environment then put your probiotics in there to to feed those good bacteria okay or to be the good bacteria sorry so Elroy Durai is a probiotic that I really like because it's been shown to reduce colic and infants shown to help reduce the incidence of illness in people and so that to me is is very important okay and the last thing that the the fourth part that's very important is really to keep a healthy intestinal system is reduced stress it adequate sleep eat healthy foods okay and supplements support a healthy intentional system so you know heavy foods that may be lacking in nutrients are not our friends okay so eating a lot of refined foods a lot of processed foods is really not where we want to go with with our foods okay and there's also some interesting studies recently on other nutrients that can help support and healthy intestinal system for example l-glutamine which is an amino acid okay and we get in our foods but supplementing with additional amino acid of l-glutamine can actually help with the growth and repair of your intestinal lining helps protect the digestive system and and act as a repellent to irritants so l-glutamine if you see a product without glutamine check it out probably healthy for a year if you want to maximize your intestinal system health and then another one is quercetin and quercetin you can see the the studies here important for people who suffer from poor digestion you know gas diarrhea bloating those kinds of things it helps improve the gut barrier function some of you may have heard of leaky gut or problems with that gut barrier normally nutrients pass through between our gut and our bloodstream with leaky gut other things may begin to pass through there and so it's important that we maintain that that barrier and maintain to help us maintain a healthy gut okay summary and I think we're just about made it in the three minutes healthy hydration is the key to all aspects of health okay a healthy gets responsible for for more than digestion 70 percent of our immune defenses are built in our gut that's important so we're getting sick all the time you know it may not need to take antibiotics we may need to work on our on building our defenses and building our guts staying hydrated and keep getting a healthy gut and I designed a special kit that supports healthy hydration to help you get for those people who may be looking at this for the first time it's called our immune support bundle I just want to let you know that that available it does contain the things that I've talked about today if you have a regimen that you're following

webinar wish you all the best and have enjoy the rest of your Saturday have a great day thank you very much bye-bye", "9TSbpDNLUb0": "hello everyone welcome to wheats where we're going to be reviewing the Korova 5dos medical cannabis mint dip cookie the kirova brand I think is a very popular brand of marijuana edibles this one is a five dose which means it has 250 milligrams of THC and 3 milligrams of cannabinoids the submit' dip flavor as I said earlier Korova makes all kinds of different edibles sizes from I believe 150 milligrams all the way up to a thousand well let's open up and take a look at this product if I can get it open this seems like you know a shot against kirova when their packaging isn't easy to open and then we're gonna have our first moment of technical difficulties why go grab a pair of scissors okay so our cookie here is filled with these little mint these little chocolate mint chips they look and taste a lot like Andes mints I don't know if you've ever had Andes mints if you've ever made me been to a hotel and had turndown service you probably have delicious little mints go really well in the [ __ ] cookies he'll know I'm a fan of the Korova I assume that's how you say it with three-eyed cow excuse me for talking with my mouth full so grub up again um promises to be the five dos edible I think they break down their dos as if we do division here it's 250 milligrams and this is five does that means 50 each now as we know anybody who's had edibles from different companies 250 milligrams means many different things to many different animals so a half an hour from now I'm going to come back to you guys and let how this 250 milligrams is feeling well about half an hour in on feeling not much just yet but asked for edibles we all know that can easily take an hour before the effects really start to hit and it couldn't even take two hours for the effects to peak so I'll check back in in about an hour or excuse me about another half hour and let you guys know how we're feeling alright guys I'm back it has been an hour since I last consumed the Korova 5 dose 250 milligram chocolate mint dip edible just letting you know how I'm feeling um so an hour in should be feeling something and I'm feeling a little bit wouldn't say that I'm in outer space just yet but I'm feeling a little bit more relaxed feeling a little bit more interested in things than I normally would be nothing quite in the body all the high so FAR's of the mind in terms of like pain reducing abilities feeling a little bit more or a little less anxious and a little more relaxed but it even this sort of aches and pains haven't really gone away just yet but we as we all know it should peak around the two-hour mark so I will check back with you guys and then alright talk to you soon well hi everybody it is officially at the two-hour mark after consuming the crew of a 250 milligrams something something something or other mint dipper ooh flippity-flop it tastes good number one number three you can find it in a store for ten to fifteen dollars in the Greater Southern California area for sure number four how does it feel to hours later it feels pretty good for the value for 10 to 15 bucks and for a legitimately decent tasting cookie it's not a bad value it's it's uh it's not the most potent 250 milligram edible I've ever had but and certainly not the least owned 250 milligrams atta boy I've ever had either so with that I bid you adieu and I will catch you next time on wheats thanks for watching just a word of warning guys always follow the directions on

staple of any school lunch but nut allergies have made them a thing of the past so what to pack in your hungry scholars knapsack adrian gobrill is live with some allergy free alternatives to pb j adrian yeah that's right roger peanuts may have been black listed in many schools across the gta but there's now lots of alternatives on the market and we put some of these alternatives to the taste test today after we found out the alarming number of kids suffering from peanut allergies peanut butter allergies in canada have increased threefold since 1998 so that's a very short period of time the problematic peanut long gone are the days of the pb and j sandwich at school the harsh truth the tasty spread on your kids sandwich can be deadly for some just even breathing in a peanut particle can be enough to send a child into anaphylactic shock thankfully nut free butter spreads are now on the market even if your child isn't allergic it's food for thought for proactive parents what used to be a niche market is now available everywhere for people because we're all trying to find that food that keeps us healthy there are several different nut butter alternatives on the market now available but the question is do they taste any good there's only one way to find out ask the experts we picked up four different types of peanut-free butter and spread the sometimes oily crunchy stuff onto some whole wheat bread first up the original crunch sun butter a little crunchy does it taste like real peanut butter next on the menu the organic sunflower seed butter it just it tastes like peanut butter what would you think if mom packed that in your lunch for you would you i wouldn't eat it the gluten-free wow butter also got a failing grade from our pint-sized culinary pros it tastes like peanut butter does it taste good not that much would you eat this if it was packed in your lunch no and finally we threw the kids a curveball treating them to some raw organic pumpkin seed butter disgusting it looks disgusting i don't think she likes it very much negative on the pumpkin seed original crunch sun butter took home top prize in our very unscientific survey but no matter which one gets the thumbs up from your little ones there's some things you can do to make sure your kid doesn't lose his or her lunch these products are great but they do look a lot like peanut butter so it does make it harder for teachers and lunchroom staff to police if you peel this off you can take one of those stickers and stick it on the lunch so the administration can know that it's not a peanut product now peanut protocol and bands on nut ingredients are basically done on a school-by-school basis by most boards in the gta including the tdsb for parents who want to learn more about nut

love movies the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review I've got with me bakery fresh goodness that's right guys we're taking a look at odd on clearance from rouse for a dollar forty nine double chocolate love [Music] that's right guys we are taking a look at straight from the Ralph's bakery about 24 hours old and I guess so actually about 48 hours old because it's already 24 hours old because that's why it was that the clearance section we're taking a look at the double chocolate loaf cake but that's not true at all we just got the duckling double chocolate loaf cake here because we are doing another gummy review it has been a while since we reviewed some gummies so I figured it's time to dip our toe back in gummy land and take a look at cushy edibles watermelon rings contains 320 milligrams I picked this up in my dispensary for 15 bucks so 8 L of a good deal which should be red flags sirens blaring what do we have here shitty packaging just stickers on a ziploc bag an exaggerated a lot of milligram \u00e4j-- Oh gummies obviously gummies are already outside of a few examples look at flourish look at occasionally cushy punch or tiki killers uh we've got exaggerated mode grammage and a cheap price so that all tells us that this might not be as good as advertised we're gonna give them the benefit of the doubt and hope they're amazing but who knows when you see too good to be true pricing shitty packaging and gummies it's usually a recipe for failure but as I said we will give them the benefit of doubt and cross our fingers and hope that they are going to work so why do I have this double chocolate loaf cake well just to maximize my chances of getting high I like to take a little bit of fat before hand there's something to help process the THC in case it hasn't been properly managed so people bite of the double chocolate loaf I have a feeling it's gonna be the best tasting thing in this reveal this is dollar 49 at Ralph's on clearance it's still really good that's my dog nard hurting it real name's noop that corner okay I can upload a for now let's open up the packaging whoo these are stinky and ugly they're very green these watermelon rings look at how ugly that is it is just green all over if they're trying to win the contest for most edible looking most like looks like it has wheat in it they're doing a pretty damn good job but again it's not a contest about how it looks it's about how it makes you feel but before you have feel anything you got to try to taste it and I have a feeling I'm not gonna like the taste of these so here we go that's kind of weird it's like then what it doesn't that's kind of a neutral weedy taste but it's not terrible it's not as bad as at a pure infuse creations with their awful bitter gross after tasting this isn't that bad but the weedy tasting part is like the sugar on top it's quite odd each one of these claims to be a 20 dose 20 milligram edible really doubt that very curious again they're not great tasting but they're far from the worst tasting gummies have ever had I'm really intrigued by what is on top or whatever process they're using to get the cannabis infused it's really strange really strange you've never had an edible quite like this so guys well now I'm more curious than I was before when it comes to cushy edibles watermelon rings handcrafted in Los Angeles we're just gonna have to do the wait-and-see approach because I'm not sure so guys I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know for sure exactly how it's going I'm gonna finish off this whole bag there's 320 milligrams we'll see and I will let you know exactly how we're doing thanks so much for watching weeds and I'll see you in just a bit peace has been 2 hours since I had the cushy edibles of watermelon rings and ooh I don't it's definitely not 320 milligrams and we kind of knew that ahead of time and that's a huge strike against them exaggerating their potency but they're not totally devoid of potency I'm certainly a little high I'm kind of in the five ish range and I just don't know about the taste it wasn't disgusting but there was something very off-putting about having the sugar coating be the thing that has like the is cannabis infused it was it was very odd tasting wasn't disgusting but it was disconcerting in some way so I don't know I don't know how to articulate it exactly what does say lab tested on it again which is you know of course they're gonna say that oh it is infused coconut oil I'm seeing that now it must be the sugar that's infused I didn't I totally it's it's it's I'm confused by this one cuz she edibles because of this it does have some potency and it's affordable I got it for a pretty good price I just don't think it's as potent as they're saying and it's not gonna get you out rage ously hi I do have another cushy edibles to review and I am certainly going to review it so I would say hold off for now don't pick up any cushy edibles we'll see what the second one does if that review is favorable or you know negative whatever the case may be that's gonna be our final determination but for now if you see him at your dispensary and they are super cheap and you like gummy candy maybe give it a shot but I think I would tell people to hold off for now and the C for the second review if they're gonna you know prove to be good or bad hopefully we'll get a new termination in one way or the other alright guys and that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds thank you so much for watching I'm sorry I was a little bit wofully here I just I don't want to tell you to rush out and pick these up because again I don't think they're as I don't think there's 320 milligrams in there but they're not without their merits either and they just have a very odd taste sorry thank you so much for watching and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "ofLsr8ZKfHY": "Welcome all I'm Jyoti khatri, health and\nholistic wellness expert . Today's video is all about what food or herbs we can\nhave that helps in liver regeneration. I will share seven both some natural\nsubstances that are scientifically proven to be useful for stimulating the\nregeneration of liver mass and function. Liver is our only internal organ in\nhumans that is capable of natural regeneration of lost tissues. The best\nthing is all these foods are easily available in the market and most of them\nmay be lying on your kitchen shelf. Watch the video till the end as you will learn\na lot of useful tips on how and why to keep your liver naturally healthy. Let's\nget started Our liver is the second largest organ\nnext to skin and it is in charge of hundred of different functions ranging\nfrom fighting infections to manufacturing proteins and hormones and\nhelping clot your blood. Liver is a vital organ which supports almost every other\norgan in the body. In fact liver is so important that if it\nstops functioning even for a single day a person will simply die it filters your\nbody's toxins such as drug and alcohol and pushes them out of your body.\nMost of bad liver problem ranging from hepatitis to cirrhosis may have no\nsymptoms in the early stages. 80% of liver conditions are linked to\nexcessive alcohol consumption and hepatitis. Being overweight and having\ndiabetes or high cholesterol levels are risk factors for cirrhosis / fatty liver\ndisease. Cirrhosis is a risk factor for liver cancer. People suffering from\ncirrhosis are at risk of developing liver cancer. The five-year survival rate\nis just 15%. All types of medications can be potentially toxic for the liver.\nHealth supplements aren't without risk either. They also can poison the liver\nwhen consumed in excessive quantities or if not used correctly. Now, let's discover\nthe natural ways to regain the liver health and learn how we keep our liver\nhealthy. The first ingredient is turmeric. Turmeric is rich in Curcumin, which\nis one of the potent herb or spice that is proven to help repair and regenerated\nliver tissue of diabetic group and also redevelop the liver's micro vascular\nstructure. Turmeric is rich in antioxidant that has liver protection\nand regeneration properties. Intake of turmeric health remove inflammation,\nreducing oxidative stress, increasing collagen deposition and help recover\nliver tissues to regain normal pattern of central veins and sinusoids hepatocytes\nand portal triad. It also help to develop liver blood vessels into\ncounts and expand sizes thereby increasing blood volume to the area's.\nThereby curcumin found in turmeric is potentially useful treatment to\nregenerate and repair liver into healthy and normal\nfunctions. A useful tip is to use either fresh turmeric or whole dried turmeric.\nThere are high chances of adulteration in powdered form of turmeric. So avoid\nbuying turmeric in powdered form. What I do is when fresh turmeric is available\nin the market I buy fresh else I get whole dried turmeric then I break the\nwhole  turmeric into small pieces with the help of Pastor stone and then use the\ngrinder to make it into a powder form. In a go I prepare the turmeric powder into\nsmall batches that lasts for a week only. I consume it by mixing it with the fresh\nwhole  black pepper powder to increase its efficacy. The key point here to remember\nis when you're dealing with the fresh herbs or spices is to understand how\nmuch you take. For the beginner never exceed the limit above 3 grams per day.\nIn fact split that 3 gram dosage into 3 parts then take about 1 gram of the\nmixture 3 times a day or so. The second ingredient is Roobios tea. Roobios is a herb\nthat is found mostly in South African region. The leaves of Roobios herbs are\nused to make tea which has tastes and color somewhat similar to hibiscus tea.\nSteep the leaves for about 15 minutes in the hot water. You can add slices of\nlemon to enhance its taste. Roobios tea supports liver regeneration\nand reduce the liver fibrosis following chemical injury. According to the study\nafter tenth week of Roobios tea intake the liver tissue will begin to\nregenerate and after 42 days of regeneration all the biochemical\nparameters will reach to healthy level. It is recommended to drink Roobios Tea\nnot only for the Prevention but also along with other therapy for all liver\ndiseases. The third ingredient is Korean ginseng which has proven to accelerate\nthe rate of liver regeneration and ameliorated the liver injury after partial\nhepatectomy in rats. The fourth ingredient is an ayurvedic herb which is\nlicorice root, mulethi or or Yashtimadhu, which significantly enhances the liver\nmass and function also speed up recovery from liver damage induced by surgical\nresection. The studies has proven that the compound\nfound on liquor eyes known as glycyrrhizin accelerates liver regeneration\nand recovery from liver damage in partially hepatectomized rats.\nPrepare tea out of licorice root and heal your liver. Always buy the whole\nroot for making tea as the powdered licorice may be adulterated and it's\npowdered sediments deposits under the water. So, buy the whole licorice root\ninstead of powder. Also the powdered form of herbs loses its quality soon and we\ncan never be sure. Whether it is 100% real herb. So it is always better to get\nthe whole dried herb and powder it at home in small batches and once it's\nfinishes prepare the next one. Try Roobios leaves and licorice root tea\ntogether. As licorice root add natural sweet flavor to the tea and you need not\nto add any sweetener to it. Did you know Glycyrrhizin a compound found in herb\nlicorice is recently featured as powerfulanti-SARS virus agent? Now,\nyou can imagine the healing power of licorice herb. In order to prepare\nlicorice tea just add few licorice root sticks into the boiling water and let it\nsteep for 15 to 30 minutes. Optionally, you can add other herbs available at\nhome like Tulsi, sweet or Holly basil leaves, mint leaves, rosemary leaves, sage\nleaves etc. Additionally, add slices of lemon and enjoy. The fifth ingredient is\ngeraniol, which is plant oil obtained from a large number of plants that are found\nin the nature including geraniums and lemongrass. The result of scientific\nstudies suggests that geraniol plays a significant role during liver\nregeneration. So enjoy your lemongrass herbal tea. The sixth ingredient is\nvitamin E (or alpha-tocopherol). Studies have shown that vitamin E or alpha-tocopherol improves the rate of liver\nregeneration. So add more food rich in vitamin E such as nuts, seeds,\nhazelnut , pine nuts, peanuts and especially almond. An ounce of almond\nhas about 7.5 milligram of vitamin E, sunflower seeds are high in vitamin E as\nwell providing over 8 gram in 1/4 of cup. Increase intake of sprouted seeds for\nexample 1 cup of sprouted mung bean seeds contain about 0.1 milligram of\nvitamin E. Add more green vegetables into your diet. Spinach is especially rich in\nvitamin E with one cup providing about 4 milligram, turnip greens broccoli\nasparagus also contain vitamin E with one cup serving of each providing about\n2 milligram. The 7th ingredient is an herb that I love growing into my herb\ngarden and that is oregano. Studies have shown that carvacrol obtained from the\nOregon oil significantly increases the liver regeneration rate in rats\nundergoing partial hepatectomy. So add these herbs into your soup, salad, curries\npestos or just prepare a herbal tea out of it. I like to combine Oregano\nwith licorice. Both of these herbs are proven to be useful for liver health,\nand licorice add sweet taste to the tea. I hope you like this video. Hit that like\nbutton down below.

cappella flavors I had come in the other day the dumbass here ordered two lots of peach instead of a peach and a pear so I had to put two lots two orders in a second order I put in was double the cost of the first one because I just basically bought almost everything they had so I'm gonna have a huge cappella line but I need a couple of flavors for a clone that I'm working on so I had to have it but instead of it coming yesterday like the rest of it did because of the July 4th weekend my order on the Friday night was right at the end of the day when I realized I've messed up so it didn't get shipped until Monday then no shipping on Tuesday because I forth now it's like in Tennessee someone's coming right next Monday or Tuesday which which sucks ass I was really hoping I'd have it now and I could put together this clone over the weekend but oh well we'll wait see what comes but not going to go too much into these I'm going to wait until I get the other cappella order and then I'll go through all of them at the same time but I got lemon Sicily pink lemonade peach with stevia stevia stevia steadier it's safe well I didn't beast a via [ __ ] I got a juicy peach double apple no I didn't double apples from before juicy apple let's try that again Fuji apple banana and mango says just do this properly now lemon Sicily pink lemonade peach with stevia juicy peach Fuji apple banana and sweet mango hair god that was difficult one it all i could do was just name seven flavors i've got in front of me and I couldn't do that one thing I am impressed with straight away I will tell you is the mr. banana it's really good it smells fantastic tastes fantastic I made a recipe with it straight away don't know what the recipe you like but I just wanted to get that banana into something and vape it the Fuji apple is well is really good if you go to a cappella site the first thing I show you is a new Fuji apple making a big thing about actually the packaging that they sent me they had a big thing in their Fuji apple they also sent me two coasters which I thought was cool but two capella coasters I like that there's a nice touch so yeah once I get the other ones which I've got I don't know ten to fifteen flavors come so I'll have like 20 new capella flavors and we're go ahead and taste test them all and I'll give you my thoughts on I can tell you now the ones with stevia in them are sweet as hell so cool it's not quite as sweet as the super sweet but it's right up there they're very very sweet but very nice as well okay well let's leave that over there and let's go to this recipe this recipe is something that when I made it well to start fresh when I I was looking online at something and I seen someone either post or mention I think they mentioned a commercial Buse which was some mango ice cream and I thought that sounds really good so I set to work on it and I thought not just mango just get some other tropical fruit now so we went mango guava papaya and then I put some lycian in as well right at the end just to give it a something that it all actor takes which it does give it I mixed it I've ate it and I was like oh my god it's real good but the mango was a little overpowering so I thought why we leave it would let it steep it may die down and then the creams obviously get better but I went ahead and put another recipe in my phone ready to make if it didn't speak powered thought it would but lucky enough it's deep well so now the mangle has calmed down the ice creams have come forward the creams have come forward and it's a really really nice vape place kind of like something you would be shot bored not last one after but it takes like I got thinkers of the sweetener I got in it um but now it does taste like a very well Ranga juice which I'm real happy with we did put it together John from jfm put it together the other night um we teamed up on Wednesday and done a live feed and he made a banana waffle and then he made this one here with not the exact ingredients but I think there was only one that was different he shook him bake it and liked it but once it's steeped it really does come together well but anyway I want to share this recipe with you and I've already pissed away five minutes doing nothing so uh let's go ahead and take a screenshot like always do it's called tropical soft scoop which you know that because that's the title with the video or it will be when I make it and I'm actually going to put this recipe up on a site called 99 deuces I've mentioned this before one of my live feeds and I've mentioned it in other videos and I think I've mentioned it on the Facebook page but I mean you're going to be hearing a lot more of it I'm going to be putting all the recipes like doing this channel over on there they're there supporting me in in certain ways and I've likewise I'm going to support them so yeah it's going to be a good partnership and that's a really good site the only downfall with it right now is there's no weight measure on there on there calculator there's no milligrams but talking to the owner one of the owners said it's coming real soon they are working behind the scenes getting a lot of new stuff ready and it's very excited grunting I'm I'm chuffed to be part of that so yeah from now on all my things are going to go over there the next clone that I do which I've almost finished I'm not going to talk too much about it I think you all know what it is but I've got it very close and I think I'll crack it next week that's going to be posted everywhere it's going to be on the Facebook page on ELR 99 juices on here despite everywhere else own posted because it's going to be a blinder I can't wait well I've got already is enough to post out there and everyone go wow that's that's awesome but it's just missing this one little ingredient and I want it and I think I know what it is so that that's what I ordered but anyway we've pissed away some more time the recipes up there let's go ahead and mix I'm mixing 30-mil oh and I should show you the original one is right here but look at the color of that I mean this beautiful I don't know what gave it I cut it maybe the mango itself is that color because you can't tell in these flavor out bottles there's the yeah I said I guess there's smoke the smoke point the dark bottles okay what was I going to do I was going to change that to 30 mil change it to wait and we'll start with flavor arts manga and I should have ordered some more that cuz I don't have much and I know this is going to be one of my regular vape snakes it smells good I wonder if this is the real orange one no it's not something else must have done it maybe the guava is orange 24 1.24 grams okay let's put this back as I go all of a sudden that I've gone quiet I'm concentrating that goes there I think yeah I think it does anyway looks like I should alright the next one is guava which is a fairly new one I've got really impressed with this one I like this one a lot guava by flavor are very unusual smell really like that it just just goes so well with a mango okay point four seven and I ended up going point five one Wow not selling this share our we although I you need to do point four seven okay papaya by PFA that is well just smell it is fantastic going to point six two I've got one of the dogs from rolling around on the floor in front of me acting like an idiot he's the same one that threw up on the live feed last week at the struts nasty-looking ship was it happy was it the puppy I don't remember no I think it was him I don't know there's one of them they throw up in one night as I was papaya I still think I've got her in the wrong place my stuff that's not where did the life she come from sorry I know messing around trying to get this back where it should be always got to come from there next design all right okay cappella vanilla bean ice cream which is my go-to ice cream oh and watch I got a video coming up on ice creams as well it will be in three weeks from now because I'm about to mix them but more of our informative video not so much of a recipe video it's going to be about the year like the vanilla bean ice creams in general which one I like best and why I like it best and what they're like after they sleep and all that good stuff Joey you want to go lay down go lay down good boy Misao don't edit any of this stuff I'm pretty sure she just let out a bunch of this crap it's only 11 minutes so far I'm finished a mix yet I Anila whipped cream I smell so good I love this stuff kind of really goes nice with the ice cream it is really kind of put more than Hilary now I like the vanilla taste so really tells you you've got an ice cream in there just find using the vanilla whipped cream and then the next ingredient which is um dairy milk by TFA I just find you really do get that like premium ice cream taste it's not so much just throwing a bunch of creams at it is this one's kind of got that thicker it's not thicker but kind of like a real rich Dairy Dairy cream by this Dairy Dairy Milk but it really does give you that like cream sauce is it there it says dairy milk he should say Gary cream because that's what it reminds me of new English folks know what that's like I can't you can't get cream in the States okay I've never seen it never seen it in the grocery store not proper cream you know the butter cream and butter milk and all that stuff but don't actually see like just a pot of cream you know whereas in England we get single cream double cream clotted cream yeah missile it up stuff especially when you're cooking ah all right throw that one away let's get a new pipette there we go I'm going to put the nicotine in this as well so I'm going to glove up in a second actually do not do that camera I've wasted nothing your Folkestone I love the way I dispenser sweetener I fill the pipette up and only use just a few drops here we go now the original recipe had 1.5 percent swing and I changed it to one I just thought 1.5 was just a tiny bit sweet too sweet some of you that don't like sweetener this recipe really doesn't need it for some reason this last month I have gone sweetener crazy you know all my other my past recipes that I've done you know some people who have come in or there's a bit higher you notice but there's a bit that the reason why was no there is no sweetener in them you know at the time I didn't like sweetener now I've kind of got back on it a little bit which is on the bit pissed off because it it takes away from some of my old recipes right now I put the sweetener back I put sweetener in them they're all fantastic but they were great before but now I've got on the sweetener kick I can't get off of it so I'm going off to her I'm slowly cutting down especially it's like she is up it's super sweet we're only using just a little bit of it 1/6 because it is very strong I taste it in anything I put it in when I first used it I used it like 1% you know just giving it a try and it overtook every single flavor that was in there all I could stall I could taste slightly ok give it to see it hasn't got where does it get that color from it's like help plus one hell of a transformation I've got vegetable glycerin in here not I don't have a 80/20 mix in this one so I've gone from mostly VG mainly because it's ice cream I just find the thicker sweeter software taste of the VG is goes much better with the ice cream I believe but everybody want too much harshness you want plenty of may feel and stuff I don't really want big throat hit with live ice cream doesn't quite go hand in hand oh and I really lucked into a recipe the other night I am that double apple and something else I have over there double apple and some other Apple which I like both of them and I thought well let's make an apple recipe I love that I love apple vapes I put it together and tried to be smart and put something else you know captain of it is blackcurrant blackberry or something just like half a percent of it just ER and then I mixed it up and I was like oh god I've wasted 30 mil of that and then I added a bit of sweetener with it mix it up again ice a little better anyway I just left on the table here and just took it so I put a label on it just just in case but I thought it ain't gonna vapor it ain't going to steep Aid and taste any better well it did going habit you know I think it's on the desk over there but I've been vaping it all day I took it to work with me and it was actually a really nice fake but it is super sweet it's called sweet apple but it was too sweet so I'll have to go back and have a look at what the recipe is on that and probably just take the sweetener right or leave just a tiny and main in there and and actually make a video on it and it is one of those ones that you know Chris here messed up it wasn't it didn't come out as I thought it would and it was a mess up but it was one that actually works after it's steeped out a little bit which I'm really surprised specially with kind of ingredients that it is normally you know you've got those fruits together normally your initial vape on them is and it want the harshness and want nothing like that or sweetness or anything it was just the taste the taste was a bit funky in one right I'm very surprised they steeped and they all come together so something died down something else come up and then they taste good no ok well that's this we're going to put a label on it and actually asleep the top off on a glove up put some nicotine on it as

since our latest food review let's do another one here right now by popular demand I've had so many people over the past couple years Sam God man what are you bringing back the food review and the answer is right now item number one today this is the new Red Bull coconut can you see that Red Bull coconut berry is actually what it's called the Red Bull Company founded in 1987 in Australia and they are the leaders in the energy drink sector they sell around seven million cans of Red Bull every year and so without further ado let's crack her open I love coconut been to the Caribbean a number of times it's one of my favorite flavors of anything and so I'm really excited to try this definitely has a smell of coconut when you open up the can that aroma just smells delicious let me give a little nutritional content here 110 calories per small can so really that's not that bad 200 check this up 280 percent of your recommended daily intake of vitamin b6 sounds good to me here we go Cheers Red Bull I got one thing to say to you where's the coconut like it tastes Albury I don't even think I taste coconut in there it smells like coconut but I sure can't taste it it's Albury redbull coconut berry me item number two here it is brand new in Canada it is the new coffee crisp thins why why do they do this I have no idea 180 calories sorry hundred and ninety calories per 36 gram bar but unlike the regular coffee crisp it is thin let's try it out check it out oh so it comes in it comes in four all right so it comes in four let's try them up Cheers [Music] mmm it's okay again I don't get the point copy crisp is one of the best selling candy bars in all of Canada they sell a ton of them and there's a number different kinds of them they've got macchiato and they've got like what are some of the other flavors the coffee really there's a lot of them anyway this one it's okay this just like coffee Chris no reason to rush up and get this one as opposed to the other ones it seemed ding ding all right guys listen do you want me to bring these videos back full time maybe your new one every week all you gotta do is click the subscribe button I go to my channel hit the bell

welcome two weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on this episode we are looking at the similarly titled and similarly logoed we dose that's right we were taking a look at we dose we toes crunchy I think the name of the company is we dose we can see back here they really like you to know that name we chose we dose we chose loses all meaning when you say it enough we chose Medicaid his deck and the products name is we nose crunchy they make other products as well that aren't also called we dose you would think they wouldn't name their thing the same name they name their company but whatever I traditionally haven't really liked chips I haven't really found one that hits that sweet spot from me that's perfect I kind of like some of the original baked goods I kind of like some of them in Gooch and I found that those goldfish from enjoy edibles we're actually quite potent but they tasted so disgusting I couldn't ever imagine eating them again so I'm hoping that these we toast crunchy will be the pot chip for me going forward so if you've never turned in two weeks before the way our reviews work is I'm gonna eat this product I'm gonna eventually eat the whole thing not necessary for you to death do a lot of Cheetos in here excuse me we knows but they don't come back to you guys in precisely two hours to let you know how I'm feeling how high I am because I consider that the most important part of any edible review not so much how it tastes but how it makes you feel alright so let's go ahead and open it up see what this products all about how it tastes how it smells and then two hours from now most importantly how its gonna make this feel my guess it's gonna taste kind of like stale Cheetos with a little bit of wheat taste the weed odor is quite strong coming from the bag you can see we've got a lot of Cheetos in there look like regular ass Cheetos nothing too surprising let's go ahead and give them one a bite here not too still that's good what not bad um definitely a little bit of a wee taste to it nothing that's gonna prevent you from wanting to eat the the whole thing work that's gonna make you gag certainly um just a little bit of a pair at the end but mostly just tastes like Cheetos and not even that stale so they got a leg up on the competition um well so you know how they taste if you like she knows you're gonna like these there is a substantial amount in this bag certainly more than your typical like grab bag and she is so it's gonna take me a while get through these bad boys oh [ __ ] I said bad boys um these sons of [ __ ] how about that it's gonna take me a while you spend some [ __ ] why they're all male I don't know why I use masculine not sure but let's go ahead and I'm gonna finish these sons of [ __ ] off and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeds and I'll see you guys soon peace Wow guys I am rusty it has been I'm coming up with my big tolerance break here I boosted my tolerance back up but I'm rusty I realized that I forgot to tell you two very key important facts about we dose from two hours earlier one how potent it's supposed to be this is a hundred and fifty milligram product although it's hard to find that on here you have to do a little bit of math it says oh there it is at the very bottom one hundred and fifty milligrams per bag should probably be a little bit more prominently display than that a little weird that it's that small but so this is one hundred and fifty milligram animal and it cost me traditionally it cost ten dollars but I got it on a discount for eight bucks so an affordable edible so again hundred and fifty milligrams for eight dollars affordable and bulb and I would describe we dose as it's alright it's alright um I'm not outrageously high I'm pretty high I would say I'm at whatever my tolerance was about the same as it was before equivalent to about a 5 maybe maybe about a 5 and a half or so me not to get that weirdly specifically granular because what's the difference between a 5 and a 5 and a half nothing um but but yeah they tasted I mean just like Cheetos so if you like Cheetos you're gonna like these they weren't stale the we taste wasn't that bad and I'm moderately high for an affordable edible so I've nothing bad to say about we dose and it's not really gonna change my opinion on on the chips sort of edibles I still I'm not gonna reach for these first but if I was looking for something a little bit if I was looking for something salty and this was at the dispensary and you know just was looking for not confectionery this time around maybe I grabbed a bag of weed oohs but for the most part I'm gonna stick with the confectionery you stick with the candies just I think they're a little bit more potent that's a better vector for THC but if you uh you know like the salty stuff you might want to give widows a chance because again it's it's not gonna set you back too much at 8 bucks a bag here so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you all in the next review peace that was okay and I I'm not a practice on throwing those two alright guys see you later", "iTnjdMMePHQ": "welcome back to these guys the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary tell you which animals are worth your hard-earned dollars okay so today a new product a new brand try come try comb trick them treats I don't know I tried to research it couldn't find out how to pronounce it anyways I've got I'm gonna say try come try come try calm treats trick them I bet try come treats here white chocolate brownie 150 milligrams of THC so of course this would we want to borrow meets many reviews where I'll just come in taste the brownie eat it up and come back to you guys in two hours and let you know how we're feeling so this is their as I said they're white chocolate brownie you can see they're some interesting packaging brownie with some white chocolate chips on the top it's got some handy info here it tells you when it was made born on 324 the batch number how much THC and on the back handy Nutrition Facts which I always like to see so this whole brownie has 319 calories and again 150 milligrams of THC never had triking trace before so I am very excited to try it looks like a lot of glute no staple surprising okay alright I gotta open up here here is our brownie smells good very slight weed smell not much very very very slight not gonna get you busted anywhere for sure that's my brother okay fudgy white chocolate chips are good very budget um maybe the slightest hint of a marijuana chase at the very end but the otherwise the brownie is delicious I mean it's actually very good Wow okay try come tricking try cone however you say you didn't return my mouth full so you pass step one guys the taste test tastes delicious step two most important part how does it make you feel I'm gonna polish this up and I will be back with you guys in two hours to let you know about that most important of questions thanks so much for watching and I'll see you in just a bit hi guys I'm back it has been about two hours since I've had the try come try cone trick immune treat the white chocolate brownie umm 150 milligrams runny and I feel a little bit not especially high not but you know it's not it's not nothing I'm not particularly disappointed 150 milligram an\u00edbal this seems about in the you know average range for one of those but it did taste good so if you have a low tolerance but I'm looking for something that tastes good on this 150 ml grandma runny will certainly do the trick for you but it's not the most potent 30 100 50 milligram edible I've ever had that being said it's also thrown away the week from the weakest I've had as well but it does have a nice taste so you're going to enjoy it not way but not much more else to say about the white chocolate brownie from trichome treats be sure to stay tuned and look for more trichome treats reviews from weeks here in the future thank you so for watching and

camera and the native microphone but if you look behind me here we're out here in beautiful Signal Hill Southern California beautiful beautiful view so what are we talking about here today on wheats we are talking about tek oh there's snickerdoodle 160 milligrams cookie today oops got it upside down there so you can see our cookie 160 milligrams and it's a shitty little packaging I've had one gko product in the past and I actually quite liked it it was there brownie today we are gonna try there snickerdoodle cookie it's a little less potent in there brownie had 160 instead of the 200 of the brownie but I'm still looking forward to it because I'm a snickerdoodle fan and the one tki oh I had it was pretty good so let's go ahead and open it up give it a taste if this is the first time you guys have ever tuned in to wheats the way our reviews work is I'm going to eat this cookie or maybe all of it in front of you just don't want to bore you to death and then I'll come back to you guys in about two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's actually the most important part of any edible review alright so here's the snickerdoodle it smells a little bit like we know a lot like cinnamon and let's give her a taste stay still a little bit of a weed taste to it not too bad um mostly it just tastes like a snail very stale not very good snickerdoodle cookie so about what you'd expect from marijuana edible and about what I expect from TKO because I remember the brownie not tasting so quite so good but having the more important part it was quite potent so sorry for talking with my mouth full see you guys in two hours welcome back to week 2 boy it's been two hours since I had bt k o 160 milligrams snickerdoodle cookie and um quite a bit uh not in love with it but I do like it um it's an affordable cookie I think it cost me eight bucks so really on the cheap end for 160 milligrams Emmel and right in the average range for being high in the 160 milligram and of all I mean it's not a kirova or it's not like a bang bar it's not outrageously good but for that price uh it gets me where I want to be at a at the right price so no complaints there it did not taste great I am a fan of the snickerdoodle cookie so I was a little disappointed in and how bad this tasted I mean it's not disgusting you're not gonna have to gag it down it's just kind of stale kind of dry not the best tasting cookie but you know it is what it is and again it is a really affordable so you sort of get what you pay for in that regard but I do recommend it I do recommend the TK OH snickerdoodle cookie just like their branding I had in the past it is a pleasant little surprise I think I like the brownie a little bit more than the cookie but you know that's about a toss up there so again the TKO 160 milligrams snickerdoodle cookie if you see at a dispensary near you and you're looking for something a little bit cheaper don't hesitate to grab one well guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeks I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on the next review peace well [ __ ] that was awful I'm sorry that's pathetic hello and thank you so much for

show grow get your stash box you won't be disappointed [Music]", "vvxWQ41b2eM": "so in this video I want to talk about the serving sizes of a common snack at least common in our household which is just a spoonful of peanut butter and a glass of milk assuming you can have both of these items I don't know that there's anything much better than just having them together but one of the problems though is that unless you know that you're getting the right serving and you can easily over eat either one of these since they're so high in fat so what I want to do is give you an example I've got my scale here I've accounted for the weight of a spoon without any peanut butter so I know how much it weighs and then I did just I kind of just took a big scoop which is something that we would typically do where you just you know here this is a two tablespoons and I weighed it and then you know just pour yourself a glass of milk as well and again this is something that we used to be very guilty of so you kind of look at this and you say I've got a glass of milk and then a serving of peanut butter so I'll have my snack here but what you know you don't realize until you actually weigh these out is like this spoonful of peanut butter when I waited out was twice the serving size of 33 grams so serving of peanut butter is about 190 calories we're just we'll call it 200 to make the math easier so I mean this is this is 380 or almost 400 calories just right here on this spoon which is no you know kind of not really a snack anymore and then also you know you just you pour yourself a glass of milk without really thinking about it you just you have a glass so that must be a serving right well it's serving a milk as a cup someone trying to do so spilling but so that's I measure out a cup so this is what an actual serving is compared to what you know most people probably just doing what we used to do and serving a milk is 150 calories so assuming we just took this big scoop of peanut butter in this giant glass of milk you know we're doubling the serving size of each of those so that you know this snack is all of a sudden 700 calories which is now a meal and not a snack so when you do that everyday that's obviously you're going to be way over your calorie limit assuming your you know you're not accounting for that many so no just something to be aware of again I'm not a big advocate that says you always have to you know measure out your food or weigh everything but it's at least important to be aware of how much the serving size should look like as far as how many craniums or how many cups so so hopefully that was helpful and if you're like us my wife and I eat peanut butter milk every day hopefully you at least get the the right serving sizes", "s-88X4_GzBQ": "Howdy folks hows it going welcome to my virgin\nkitchen today i'm showing you how to make your very own peanut butter from home. Looks amazing right and I can't tell you how\ndeliciously simple and easy and basic and novice yet tasty and just satisfying this\nis you can make it as chunky and as smooth as you like, it's minimal ingredients hit\npause now right them all down if you want to have a go, it's very similar to when we\nmade Nutella the other day and this is basically how you do it. Get your peanuts and pour them onto a baking\ntray then drizzle over a little peanut oil a pinch of salt, then mix it all around to\nget it nice and coated. Slam it into a pre-heated oven you wanna cook\nthem for around about 10-15 minutes just for them to brown but you can actually customise\nthis bit aswell because the more you brown them the deeper the colour and the taste is\ngonna be, once you are happy with your peanuts and I did just say peanuts this isn't the\ngiant reese's peanut butter cup video we did, just leave them on the side on the tray just\nto cool down naturally about 5-10 mins they don't need to be stone cold but just let them\nrelax a little bit they've been having a hard time in that oven. Put the cooled peanuts into a blender i've\ndivided my mixture by two just because of the size of the blender i'm using then you\nwanna add in your golden syrup, pinch of salt and the peanut oil and then just whizz it\nall up and let it break down naturally. After the first minute or so of blending it\nmight be like a thick paste and you don't want it like that ok, so rather than pouring\noil in and being tempted like that add some water ok because you don't want it to be like\nan oil spill and continue to whizz it up until you're happy with your texture. After about 3 or 4 minutes it'll go super\nsmooth. With it all broken down and it nice and smooth\nyou've effectively made peanut butter, there was me thinking peanut butter, with the butter\nin the title actually had butter in it and i'm sure the store bought stuff probably does\nbut that is it and it tastes amazing, here is a little shot of it in a bowl I didn't\nwanna do anything with it at this stage because I just wanted smooth peanut butter but what\nyou could do then is add some cocoa powder you can add some nutella and make a nutella\npeanut butter oh my gosh that'd be good, if you wanted to make it chunkier maybe break-up\nor bash some peanut pieces and mix it through - chunky peanut butter! Keep it in an air tight jar or container and\nspread it on, eating it til your hearts to content.

peanut butter.", "iLwOzA2asFk": "[Music] 102 beats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking another look at an edible sort of an edible I don't think you really eat this one but we are taking a look at trophies trophies mints here a little bit less milligrams than we normally do this is only a 60 milligram edible or mint but I decided to try it because I like the concept but mints I like the concept of smaller more discreet edibles so I decided to go ahead and give it a go it does again fall under our normal normally smaller than our average dosage but I really really want to give this a try so the packaging is pretty basic here just little plastic packaging let's call the information we need on at those 60 milligrams of THC four milligrams of CBD it's a hybrid mint flavored yada-yada-yada lab tested which is nice to see and on the back it's got the testing results which is always great to see and then it's got zero calories solvent free gluten free sugar free non-gmo and vegan and then it's got some directions on here as well cut the trochee to the desired dosage I'm just gonna take the whole thing obviously pop it under your tongue and leave it alone wait a few minutes to fill the tingle that's the cannabinoids absorbing into your body and lastly enjoy effects within 30 minutes wait an hour before dosing again we're just gonna do the whole dose at once as common here on weeks and then the last thing I want to tell you guys is I picked this up for about $10 at my dispensary which is pretty expensive but I was able to get a deal and get it down to closer to $7 so not too bad for a 60 milligram a table it says fast-acting and long-lasting so let's give the trokey mint a shot got my scissors here cuz I've been burned too many times trying to open heart open packaging so there we go we'll just cut it and here is the mint a very small little square doesn't really show up there on the camera but it's got four little perforated edges if you want to cut it into fourths of course we're not gonna do that we're gonna do what it says take this and take it sublingually pop it right under our tongue here and then I'll let you on our case and the answer is bad ooh it tastes like a mixture of very strong minty like Altoids e-type flavor and then we'd look oh I don't want it under my tongue it's a nasty tasting nasty oh do you not like well guys I'm gonna leave this on my tongue there lol switch it will hopefully be pretty quick cuz it's gross and then I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how this trophy mint is actually working on me hopefully it's gonna be doing something because it's causing quite a bit of anguish right now so I'll check back with you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeds and I'll see you in just a bit peace it has been 2 hours since I've tried the trochee 60 milligram hybrid mint here and I really really did not like the taste it was something spectacularly awful look disgusting but 460 milligram animal I'm pretty pleased with the results I'm not outrageously high I'm not even very high but I'm gonna solid 5 probably somewhere in that range maybe 4 460 milligram edible that you took sublingually it's not bad I I actually I like edibles that are a little bit different in terms of not just your standard cookies brownies and things this doesn't have any calories no sugars that's nice and it's pretty discreet you can pop one of these bad boys under your tongue at the airport or whatever and feel good to go so I think I like it I'm not sure I'm gonna recommend it because it is kind of expensive for what you get and it's not gonna get you out rageous lehigh well the reason is I'm not gonna I'm not gonna recommend it for the cannabis patient that or for the cannabis user that is a heavy user if you're a heavy cannabis user you do a lot of edibles go and pass in the trophy it's not gonna get you high enough if you are edibles curious and never really done many edibles haven't done any edibles at all or you want something small discreet yeah give it a try I think you're gonna I think you're gonna be happy with it it's not for me necessarily because again it's just too small of a dose but I did like my experience with it so uh I'd say I'm pretty positive on trochee but I'm not necessarily gonna say run out and grab it if that makes any sense at all I certainly hope it does um so that's gonna do it for this trochee mint medical with what does that say now I have to read this here Oh medicate with confidence that makes sense all right guys while I medicate it with confidence thank you so much for watching weeds guys and we will check you out on the next review peace", "UMVFbNtMvog": "[Music] all the wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at not inedible and not a cartridge we're taking a look at a drink bowl that's right we're taking a look at yet another drink today our first look at the oft requested agua de Fleur I hope I'm saying that correctly here it is a product of Los Angeles on the back you've got your nutrition information looks like to's eight ounce servings a hundred and ten milligrams in total of THC not sure exactly how that's flying in the modern era here with hundred milligram limits probably still an illegal product would be my guess so this is a mango flavored I believe they have a sort of awful font that's hard to read um oh let's read some of their ostentatious texts here agua de Fleur water of the flower agua frescas or fresh waters date back to the early 15th century when Aztec farmers would crush their fruit and mix it with water for refreshment with culture and tradition in mind we present you with medicated aqua Aguas Fresca's and joy shake well drink cold I would say it definitely doesn't need to be shaken well if you can see there it has a lot of stuff settled at the bottom so let's give it a good shake although there's not a lot of room to shake in there they leave a lot of empty space making shaking more difficult but we'll do our best to make this a homogenous mixture right Oh genius I can't remember so here we go in terms of drinks um drinks I usually find it be okay I usually like drinks there's some that I like better than others I still haven't found one that's as good as ASP that's the best I've ever had um cannabis quencher I like quite a bit the G drinks I like their double strength one's a whole lot so I am quite excited about this and I picked this up for a very affordable twelve bucks at black market dispensary and Wilmington at California right next door to Long Beach so let's one last shake open up this mango flavor and son of a [ __ ] give it a sip smells like mango and weed so if you've never seen a week's review before or if you just need a refresher guys the way all of these work is I'm gonna drink some bit of this product in front of you here just enough to let you know how it tastes all that good stuff but rest assured I'm actually gonna drink all of this and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours after I finish it to let you know how I'm actually feeling because that's what you really care about um you want to know if it tastes terrible but you really want to know if it's gonna get you high so guys let's go ahead and shut me up and give us a taste that's not too bad um a very sort of mellow Mingo II taste not overpowering yeah it's more of an agua agua frescas kind of fruit water taste there is a cannabis aftertaste a relatively strong one but not one of those ones that makes you want to you know run rub your tongue on sandpaper but if you are very sensitive the cannabis tastes you're not gonna like this but if you can handle a little it's it's totally fine and actually for the drinks it's it's on the lower end usually the drinks are among the strongest edibles for cannabis taste for having that cannabis taste this is not that bad so yeah I'm not too displeased with the taste I'm gonna go ahead and drink all 16 fluid ounces of this guy here and then I will see you guys in two hours to let you know if this odd wood floor is agua duh more gore OGG would if you should get this at the \u00e1gueda store yes all right guys see you in two hours bye [Music] because it mentions them there on the back boy this ain't no aqua just snore you should run to the Aqua to store to pick up as much aqua de Flor and perhaps even a little aqua d'amour I think it's pretty good guys I think I'm pretty happy with this one [Music] in the sort of six range which is not bad for a hundred and ten milligram edible or drinkable in this case a pretty affordable at $12 taste wasn't bad as actually for a drink all in all I think this is a one to keep your eye out for some people have recommended it to me I can see why if you see at a dispensary near you and you are interested in drinks I think you're gonna want to give this one a shot especially if you're really sensitive to the weed taste this one is probably the least offensive tasting of any of the weed drinks I've had it's not good tasting by any means but it's not it's not gonna make you wretch so this thumbs up for me I'm quite pleased with this one a agua de Flore mango flavor before I give it the ultimate run out and buy it recommendation if always when I get something that I I quite like I like to do a follow-up review just to make sure and I've got another flavor I think maybe pineapple OTO review so look for that as well and hopefully that one will be another home run and guys before I bounce I want to share with you a little cherry on top or on this case a little mango on top another one of those movie films one of those cinematic experiences that the kids go to and and and [ __ ] whatever and that is the movie that came out last year got a little bit of buzz called the Florida project holy moly from the director of tangerine don't let if you haven't seen that movie don't worry this movie movie stars basically a couple of six year old kids and a couple of six year old kids who live in a motel a shitty shitty shitty motel right outside of Disney World in Orlando and it just follows their lives basically over the course of a summer and it also has willem dafoe as sort of the supervisor of this this building the project manager whatever you call that the person who does all the maintenance and stuff a bad description really really great film on something very different that was about as much story as the movie has to be honest there is a story to follow there but that's not what it was going for the movie packs in quite a lot especially with such small main characters but it's got quite a bit to say and it is absolutely beautiful the Florida Project I know it is currently streaming on Amazon Prime check it out Willem Dafoe is not creepy in this one so that's good maybe anyways a major major major thumbs up for the Florida project and a pretty big thumbs up for aqua agua de Flor I almost forgot the name and there 110 milligram mango thanks for sticking around to the very end of this cherry on top guys I'm never sure if you do but I really appreciate it if you do and that is gonna do it for this video that's gonna do it for this review that's gonna do it for this cherry on top that's gonna do it for pretty much everything wow what a ride we've had together bye guys peace", "LI3hBe5-Q18": "hey everyone thanks for coming back and also what I mentioned thanks for your support and our the messages I've been getting from you guys I really appreciate that I'm here today to review superior protein by Olympus lab now is this a protein of the gods I don't know about that but they have been around for a while now and to be honest I have tried some of their products I have friends that have tried some other product we've all enjoyed them never been disappointed so when I found out that they were gonna be coming out with this protein I was really excited to take threw their hat into the game and I'm actually looking forward to this I do apologize goodbye copper anything like that or my boys gives out just bear with me I'm a little bit under the weather but like I said I'm excited to try this and I wanted to get it done today and try for the first time with you guys so bear with me now they do have five different flavors it's gonna be like a fruit loop maybe fruity pebbles one they have an oval a peanut butter cup they got a mocha chocolate and a gingerbread and the flavor I'm gonna be trying is that going to call why so cereal it's a blueberry pastry now they're all gonna be cereal thing they're all gonna have like cereal pieces set up and if you notice lately it's kind of been the trend with all the protein companies out there they're coming out with like cereal team proteins now there's another there's two addition to look like a regular addition and a muscle-building addition now this one is I'm gonna be trying this the muscle-building edition it's like one extra ingredient in here that I'll go ahead and kind of touch up with you guys a little bit later on as well and I'll go ahead I'm gonna be trying this out now I'm not a big blueberry person I mean I like blueberry muffins I just don't like blueberry pop-tarts or anything like that so I know you think it's kind of weird when it comes to putting up and called weird picky but I just say hey I like keeping it simple that I'm a simple guy but if anything is gonna make me this more interesting because I'm stepping outside the box oh I'm interested to see what I think as well now just to go over some of the all the things that we always look at a protein here it's going to be have first - 23 grams of protein in here it is a 50/50 blend of whey protein concentrate and casein protein now I myself am a big fan of blend because like in this one the way it's gonna be the fastest acting location into slower digesting so it gives you that flexibility to drink it in the morning pre-workout post-workout at bedtime basically you can drink it anytime you want and I feel I'm always like I said I feel like it's more even beneficial when you have the both of them because I've seen studies going both ways so when you combine them like I said I'm just a big fan of blend it does have 6 grams of carbs it has 2 grams of sugar 1.5 grams of fat and 5 grams of BCAAs not with the aminos it does list every ingredient or every amino here with the amount that's what also is open label which I'm always big kind of you guys know that now it is sweetened with super loads and hopefully I pronounced this correctly the second one is going to be a source of fame potassium will be the second one that they sweeten it with now it does have a digestive plan and coz consists of fiber ingredients as well it has a velocity which is like a pattern ingredient and it's like when combined with protein and it helps increase protein synthesis and then now the difference that I was talking about with the muscle building addition and the regular one the muscle building is gonna have 125 milligrams of Pharma GABA and at an ingredient and not to get too nerdy or get too much into it but like there's a study which I'm going to put a link to in my description if you guys want to read up on more about it but it's basically the study says it produce it's like a it produces an increase in resting serum of girls hormone so you can read up on that more if you follow that link now that's a got - it's after post-workout when you consume it after post-workout now I did mix this with 8 ounces of water and it calls for and you know me with protein I'm gonna mix it with water to get a better feel for the taste now everybody tastebuds are different so this is just gonna be how I feel about this in general so I already pre-mixed it so let me give it a quick shake here now believe that this case it sometimes casein functions are a little bit thicker this doesn't look that bad at all I can't see some of the cereal pieces I don't know if you guys can see it but you can't see some of that as it comes down like I said it does seem to mix pretty good so let's go ahead and give it a try okay guys so definitely you can tell the blueberry is there now when I grabbed us the protein itself it was good it was okay it may be a book okay so when I took a bite a little cereal pieces now that's where the flavor really kicked in for me like it enhances it like brings it all together like that's it like a really good combination right there with those suitcases and everything it just brought it all together for me like it really made it go from like above okay to like really good now I can see myself doing this in the morning like having a blueberry muffin but it's actually better you know healthier option or you can even do it you know post-workout to take advantage of the farmer Gavin in this case or at night do you know if you get those sweet craving that sweet tooth you can use this that's a healthier alternative for that and be okay with it so if anything this actually gets me going to want to try their other flavors and see how they taste again for me the cereal pieces really really enhanced the flavor like I said it probably is the reason why you have a little bit of sugar in there and the carbs but it made a big difference for me I really enjoyed it I'm gonna be drinking this post-workout for the farmer GABA probably at 9:00 in the morning and I will definitely be trying this again later on I will definitely buy it if you guys have any comment you can put it at the bottom of the page or as you already guys know you can always send me a message through Facebook or Instagram you guys know where that information is on the description until next time I'll see you guys later", "0o3k8wtFibo": "I got amnesia from the pottery welcome today learning to be featuring Carolla edibles and flowers we're going to show you two different effectively how between all the different flower Cary's - okay the

thing that we were talking about today is going to be teensy bomb is going to be eight indica dominant hybrid my stuff's in here with it as well the terpenes really lemony lemony is going to give

but it's also needed for energy to get creative throughout the day and you want something that's fun purposes gets you through the night okay thank you guys so much for watching our Corolla episode today next we're gonna have a new popular week so stay tuned", "TU9XWC-ok0U": "[Music] so we all know peanut butter and bananas are a really good combination so i figured why not add peanut butter to banana bread so here we have our ingredients list three over ripe bananas one and a half cups flour three quarters cup sugar quarter cup melted butter half teaspoon salt one teaspoon baking powder half a cup peanut butter one egg in the meantime preheat your oven to 350. so let's start by mashing the bananas these are just over ripe a little bit riper would have been better it gives you a little bit more banana flavor but these will do so these are medium to smaller bananas but this is a small loaf so it'll be fine okay so give it a good mash i always tap the masher on the side of the bowl just because they get stuck but the bread machine is what i use to mix it you'll see in a minute so don't worry about mashing too fine the machine will do the work for you now in the bread machine i select the dough cycle so for me it's number eight selection and i'm going to press start and it has a delayed start but what that does is it gives a good mix to all your ingredients you can do this by hand but by letting this machine run for 20 to 30 minutes and then calling it quits after that and scooping it out you kind of save all the work of having to mix it really thoroughly so the machine is kind of the lazy way of doing this but it really works well so here you have the mashed banana and the one egg next is your melted butter quarter cup so you're adding all your kind of wet or moist ingredients first just like you would any other bread machine recipe going to add your three quarters cup of sugar some people like more they'll add a full cup but i went with three quarters of a cup now we add our flour a cup and a half and then at the end we'll add our baking soda and our salt i only use a quarter teaspoon of salt because there is salt already included in the peanut butter now the peanut butter we will not add right away we're going to let this run for a good five minutes as you see here any give it a chance to really mix well um you don't want any dough balls so give it a good five minutes before you add the peanut butter here you can see i just sprayed a little bit of water just to get some of that dry flour off the side you don't have to do that i just that's a habit of mine so after five minutes you can see it's pretty well incorporated and you want to add your peanut butter so whether you use a sweet bread or a different setting on your bread machine the whole point is to let it run and do the mixing and kneading for about 30 minutes 20 to 30 minutes after you start so once that's done you're done with your bread machine you can shut it off and unplug it and then we'll go from there but yeah let the machine do all the work it's the easy way again you can do this by hand but i found this is a fairly easy and quick method so we'll let that run and you'll see after about 30 minutes you'll have a good nice smooth mixture so this uh loaf pan is a small one it's about eight inches uh the opening is about eight inches and this is a homemade uh anti-stick mixture that i make out of crisco oil and flower equal parts so i give that a decent coating you don't want to stick to the pan even though this is nonstick we all know they don't always do what they say so you remove the pan from your bread machine use a good spatula and start what i've done is i've removed the paddles as well because sometimes the paddles will come off and you don't want to end up in the gooey mess in your loaf pan so remove the paddles first give it a good stir also and make sure there's no unmixed flour sections in the mixture so it was nice and consistent and well mixed so now i just use a spatula to get all of it out so this is for a small loaf you could up the recipe for a larger loaf pan and we'll just finish off getting the rest out of the bread machine pan you could also add nuts to this recipe but i figured the whole point of this is to add the nuttiness flavor of peanut butter so you can add walnuts or pistachios whatever you want to your recipe but this is just basically peanut butter added to a basic banana bread recipe so i'll just smooth it out you'll see after baking it will rise above the lip of the loaf pan so we'll put it in our oven this has been preheated to 350. now my oven is not a high efficiency one with convection or anything it's just basically old school so we'll do we'll set it for 60 minutes and bake at 350. now what you can do after 50 minutes especially if you have a convection oven and it's cooking faster you could double check for doneness at around 50 minutes so this is about oh 20 to 25 minutes after being put in and here it is completed after one hour you could also check for doneness with a toothpick by inserting it and if it comes out clean it's done if it comes out dirty it can go in for another five to ten minutes so you'll get some cracking sometimes uh it's bigger than other times but it's completely done inside so we'll just pop it out and you can see it comes right out doesn't stick at all let it cool for like i would say a good 20 minutes to 30 minutes we'll give a couple of slices off the edge here and it's a nice consistent moist and it has a peanut butter flavor now i do a half a cup but you can add maybe three quarters a cup just don't overdo it on the peanut butter because it'll take uh maybe too long to cook or a little bit too moist but i found about a half a cup it just adds that peanut butter flavor so thanks for watching everyone you", "p6amPyc7350": "hi guys this is shane k shank reviews uh today i'm gonna be reviewing this ata vape apple freeze

where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review if I seem a little giddy er than normal that's because we are doing another edible review and not just any other edible review we are doing another the folks a review de Paul say chocolate tears my favorite edibles in existence these guys are amazing there are chocolate these uh well these guys in Kanaka are my two favorites here the chocolate I have tried their mint chocolate and their white chocolate and both were incredible tasted delicious and as potent as any edible I have ever put into my body this is only a 90 milligram edible but it hits three times as hard easily and if it tastes like any of the others it is the best tasting chocolate I've ever had as well so uh default say chocolatier there's no way to say it without sending like an [ __ ] unfortunately they are distinctively different as you can see here on the back let's read their stupid text here captivate your senses with the exquisite bliss of the false a hand crafted from the finest cacao and a premium collection of California cannabis our artisanal chocolates redefine the world of edible confections they kind of do actually to be honest I you guys know me you know my favorite way of eating edible this is actually chocolates I think chocolates is just plain chocolates is the best way to go for edibles and if I'll say is my favorite of those um it's better than Kiva it's better than bang it's better than 420 bars it's better than it's better than what else what other chocolate bars are out there whenever ones are out there this is the best of them all so far now we have to give it a review before we can definitively say that the dark chocolate is the best amongst them so let's go ahead and get straight into it here now this is very expensive if you can see uh right there at the bottom not sure if it's gonna focus or not this actually cost me $25 a my dispensary for a 90 milligram which is insane but that is the highest I've ever seen this this is the the tax that you pay at my dispensary ignore that price it is still very expensive for what you for as what it's advertised as but it is worth the price so let's go ahead and open up this default hey dark give it a taste here so if you haven't seen any of our previous reviews the heat chocolate comes in a very strange shape and he's like trapezoidal shapes they're each at five milligrams that's what it gives you a little diagram there here's our chocolate and it's very foil or very fancy foil wrapper here and here my friends here is the good stuff the default say dark and all its weird triangles and trapezoids and whatnot five milligram pieces let's break some off give it a taste well I didn't get that perfectly square but that's okay oh good let me leave you be very honest about this this is not a good edible this is amazing chocolate this is not really good for an edible chocolate this is damn good chocolate that I am more than happy to eat and as a by-product I get [ __ ] stoned as hell this is incredible stuff this is incredible stuff mmm it's so good I like dark chocolate I'm a dark chocolate fan so I'm a little biased but yeah this is the best chocolate i've bes edible chocolate I've ever had and one of the best tasting chocolates flatout period I that I've ever had mmm well guys Devante has done it again in the taste department but for the more important aspect is it gonna hit in the potency department for that guys you're gonna have to wait a couple minutes or a couple seconds rather me however I'm gonna wait two hours come back to you guys in two hours as I just said and let you know exactly how I'm feeling so thanks for watching wheats guys and I will see you in just a bit peace pink look how red I am so high right now guys and that's after only 90 milligrams ah duffau say works their magic yet again my god I love these guys Ayanna bash idli love them they are three for three the dark chocolate was exquisite I am at an eight eight and a half somewhere in there I could not be happier with that with with this product with these guys this is next-level stuff this is I struggling to come up with terms to describe it but I I absolutely love it I could not love it more if you guys I mean there's just there's there's no other way to describe at this point other than simply it's worth tracking down not only is it worth grabbing if you see at your dispensary it's worth researching to try to find to give it a try it's that good so guys go to weed Maps as much as I hate telling you to look at weed maps go to weed maps search for de pon say find out your closest dispensary make the trip it's worth it give it a shot DePaul's say the dark chocolate my favorite yet no the mid chocolate still my favorite I don't care they're all great give them a shot thanks so much for watching weeds guys over the moon with this one thank you so much for watching and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "qLs6H9ExcS0": "[Music] you show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking our second look at on the drink brand agua de Fleur this time their pina I think as in pineapple pineapple flavored one we reviewed their mango flavor not too long ago these are 110 milligrams pick them up from a black or gray market dispensary in California for $12 each so a pretty good price I really enjoyed the first one for a drink the taste was pretty neutral and not to cannabis II just the right amount of fruit flavor and it got me sufficiently stoned so I wanted to go ahead and do a follow-up on these and make sure that they're gonna get my recommendation so here we go with our second went aqua de Flore this time their pina flavor that says shake well but they don't give you a lot of room to actually shake well so I'm gonna take a sip and then shake some more [Music] what's the been good pineapple flavor slight cannabis hint of cannabis taste but totally totally manageable hmm yep um the taste is totally fine again there is a Hannah hint of cannabis in there it's not totally devoid of cannabis but the drinks are usually very very very heavy on the cannabis taste and this is not at all this has the pineapple is the the strongest note and not the weed so in terms of taste I really really am quite pleased with aquata floor but as we all know it's not so much about how it tastes it's about how it makes you feel and guys I'm gonna polish off this 16-ounce bottle here and then I'm gonna come back to you like all our reviews in two hours to let you know how I'm actually feeling because that's what you're in it for thank you so much for watching wheats guys and I will see you back here in just a bit peace I am back in a sense two hours since I finished the agua de Fleur 110 milligram at Pina here and my opinion is largely unchanged from my first time that I tried them and that's this is a quality product um it's not the best tasting nor the most potent 110 milligram edible on the market but it is probably the best tasting drink on the market and it's one of the more potent ones for it's listed milligram egde especially in terms for price at 12 or 13 bucks I can easily recommend this one to you guys if you like the drinks especially with the easy to swallow flavor this this is a real win for me I'm pretty pleased with it I don't think we'll be doing any more reviews of agua de Flore in the future just because I don't think it's gonna be necessary I think at this point it's safe to say that this is a thumbs-up product I may however grab some in the future for myself just for a pure recreational you say that strongly about it it's probably my second or third favorite drink hanging up there somewhere with zaspar and cannabis quencher and again very affordable happy to recommend agua to floor to you guys and before I bounce though I want to share with you guys a little cherry on top a little something that you can enjoy throughout your week that isn't necessarily we related or can be enjoyed without weed and that is the Amazon Studios really I actually I don't think it's Amazon Studios but it is on prime new movie the follow up from I have no idea how to say his name your ghost lera most larga most something the Greek director of the lobster great movie I'm gonna recommend his follow up movie the sacred the killing of a sacred deer excuse me on Amazon Prime starring Nicole Kidman Colin Farrell and a very very creepy young man named Barry Oh Keegan it is a movie about a heart surgeon who befriends the son of a patient that he accidentally killed in surgery and it is very very very disturbing and I absolutely loved it it's also very very funny if you've seen the lobster you probably know what you're in for check it out on Amazon Prime if you're looking for something a little bit more spine-tingling for your evening so guys that's gonna do it for this oddly de Flore review and that's going to do it for this little cherry on top again that was the killing of a sacred deer you can find on Prime right now thank you so much for sticking tune or staying tuned guys here at the Very Berry and appreciate it as always and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "aKhKMN5ti7Y": "[Music] what's going on everybody it's robin for the sake of that guards before i start this video make sure to subscribe to the channel hit the notification bell stay updated with all my [ __ ] videos follow me instagram fitness follow the band divided mentioned on spotify everything you need to know will be in the description box below give it a thumbs up it would appreciate it helps the channel grow and it doesn't cost you guys a [ __ ] penny this is sarah as you guys probably already know i hope so hopefully you guys have already subscribed to our channel you better sarah raynock s-a-r-a-r-e-n-o-k boom it's got a ring doing everything instagram youtube all that [ __ ] everything so i got american dream nut butter um i reached out to these guys and they sent me over three containers so we're gonna be doing all three of them um american dream nut butter that got two almond uh almond butters birthday cake and cinnamon toasties and then they sent me their peanut butter double stuffed fluffed boom i'm excited for that one so probably asking yourself what's the price point well on the almond ones are you asking yourself on the almond motor ones the price point is it ranges from like 14 to 15 and that is per 16 16 ounces 16 ounces is actually a fairly decent sized container so i'd say the price point's kind of fair especially because the peanut butter ranges from like the low 10 to like 13 range and that's for 16 ounces as well so obviously the peanut butter one is cheaper because peanut butter is just cheaper um it's just cheaper you know almond butter is more expensive peanut butter is more uh cheaper it makes sense right make sense right make sense right so that is the um that is the price point um by the way you could use coupon code opperman fitness and it will get you 10 off so actually it's a little bit cheaper than i said and no i don't get a kickback it's just because i'm reviewing this they sent them and it's to help you guys out you know what i'm saying it lets them know that i sent you to them you know what i'm saying it's really nice so operman fitness will get you ten percent off but before we before before you go out and buying this stuff we gotta review it and give you our honest thoughts all right let's let's see i'm very hungry so the results may be skewed just a little bit but before we do let's break in into the um the label action so you have 159 calories per two tablespoons 11.6 grams of fat 4.4 carbs 2.5 fiber 2.5 sugar 7.4 grams protein very precise i've never seen companies really do that you know they're going the extra mile here they're giving you the points of each grammar that's pretty damn that's pretty damn something that's pretty damn solid yeah so the ingredients on the um the almond cinnamon toasties is pretty basic actually almonds hydrolyzed whey protein isolate protein isolate sugar cinnamon molasses natural artificial flavor alcohol prophylene glycol water cornstarch xanthan gum and stevia pretty basic pretty pretty natty if i have to say something so i already got these ready to roll so that way it stays on time it's already ready to roll let's go let's go so which one you want to try first and i'm gonna go ahead and do the scoop and kind of mix it up a little bit and give these guys well we're gonna try this one first time which one the toaster one because you already mixing it up that's true so this is the consistency it's a little goopy it's a little goopy but it feels right you know what i'm saying it feels right it feels right it feels right if it feels right you you go for it you know what i mean that's what the consistency is all right i've been saying first of all that's true that is true all right okay let me give you the honors thank you cinnamon toasties it's not a strong cinnamon okay you definitely tell it's almond butter but it does have that it does have a nice cinnamon cinnamon cereal in the background it's like it's a very good mixture of both and it's a great texture yeah that's that's salad i like it that's really good absolutely like i said it's not that blows the macro butters out of a freaking pork oh my god 100 this texture is on point and the taste the macrobutters neither were on point yeah i mean unfortunately unfortunately they dropped the ball all right so you want to rate it as we go or you want to wait um let's wait let's wait just so you can get reference yeah all right so this is the birthday cake also almond butter also almond butter and i'd say it's consistent yeah like their batches are very consistent look at this i would hope so yeah i mean they are they are big you know they they're not some newbie well there's there are small they're small they make it in small batches the company says small batches right here well yeah but i'm saying like yeah it's been around for a while yeah that's true like i i know of them for over a year they they changed their name they were something else before then they changed their name to american nut butter so this is the birthday cake it looks very similar to the other one other than there's some sprinkles in here um hopefully it's not just sprinkles for the birthday cake i mean yeah because you know you let me have me first last time oh man that's exactly what it says it is you don't like it i mean i was never a fan of birthday cake i [ __ ] i love it i mean it's okay i love it but it's not like all right it's not something i would buy i love it let's see i would say it's so consistent to the cinnamon toasties you could tell it's almond butter but it does have a birthday cake mixture in there and it's not just sprinkles i could taste like the cake batterish type of taste it's not just you know yeah it's not just sprinkles yeah so here's the thing i'm excited for this one this one looks pretty intense it's that marshmallow oh oh my goodness gracious there was a [ __ ] ton of cookies and cream look at that on the back this is the peanut butter double stuffed and fluffed look at that look at that all right why why are you taking so long let's go all right which one you want like a piece like this yes marshmallows double stuff all that look at that [Music] all right i'm gonna do the same thing there we go super peanut buttery taste of marshmallow so you get the cookies yeah i think it's exactly what it says i don't understand the fluff though does that just mean marshmallows right yeah i don't double stuff means oreos but the marshmallows that's a good quick a good quality peanut butter yeah with oreos or marshmallows 100 this is on point yeah that's snacks all three of them kind of smack honestly this is my favorite one yeah maybe i'm not the biggest almond butter fan like i never really have almond butter that's not flavored like i don't go to the store and buy almond butter over peanut butter i never do i love peanut butter but if i get almond butter that's flavored it's kind of the only time i really have ever had almond butter is this is the companies that have been doing this almond butter protein mixture thing so i do like almond butter but honestly for the the price and the macros and everything and the taste i feel like the peanut butter is probably the best route to go if you do buy these now if you're an almond butter fan then try out the almond butters me personally i think i'm gonna be honestly buying the the peanut butter ones and i'll probably be reviewing some more of the peanut butter flavored ones because it just makes sense from a price standpoint macro standpoint taste standpoint and just overall that's just my opinion what do you think i mean almond butter they say it's healthier that's why they started doing them yeah i've always i've always done almond butter instead of peanut butter just from a health standpoint but it just depends how it's done like i've i've always had like just a pure almond butter no inclusions definitely flavor i've only had that probably once in my life i've had it i'm almost like i'm just like yeah it's okay i mean you've obviously had it more than i have i've had it consistently and i used to i used to make pb and j's but it was butter not the same 100 but it's good i i like all of them i like all of them too i think they're they're very consistent and i would love to try the other flavors because these three absolutely on point as far as ratings oof i actually kind of want to give them all the same rating me personally um i don't know i mean which one you like better the best peanut butter it's tied between the peanut butter and the cinnamon toasties okay right i like the cinnamon toasties i'm not a birthday cake fan yeah so i can't really that one that one has to be probably like the same because otherwise i like knock it down just because i don't like it like it's good i just i'm not afraid see me personally i'm thinking all three of the exact same rating and i'm trying to figure out what rating that is same i mean you're going to rate the birthday cake lower right slightly i mean it's good i'm actually going to rate it the same because just because i don't like it like doesn't mean you wouldn't yeah that's true you have to be you have to be fair about it like you know it's a good flavor it's just not your thing it's not my thing that's why and that's the way i try to rate things i try to be as unbiased about it as possible even if i'm a huge birthday cake fan i'm not gonna rate it more than the toasties just because i'm a birthday cake fan i actually think the cinnamon toasties is just as good as the birthday cake it would be more of a preference thing at that point so i actually think that almond butter is better than the peanut butter as far as taste yeah really like just how it sits yeah all right ratings um i'm gonna do a three two one on this whole thing because i feel like they're all the same unless you're unless you're gonna write them differently are you gonna write them differently no i'll write them the same really yeah all right ready three two one nine oh [ __ ] that's awesome we are on point you can't make this [ __ ] up guys a nine all three nine basically that means i mean this is only three out of 20 flavors that they probably have i would say that they're all probably gonna be about a nine they're very consistent their batches are the same even the two different almond butters the exact same consistency sometimes when you add different flavors and different inclusions it kind of changes the consistency i'd say they killed it they killed it overall and i think you guys should absolutely try these out if you're a fan of the the nut butters and the protein nut butters and i would say actually the texture is probably one of the best textures i've had from butter from the the butters that are like protein butters some of the times they're usually a little gritty they're a little like sandyish um so these are like more creamier like i honestly think they [ __ ] killed it here they [ __ ] killed him they did so use opera fitness like i said i don't get any [ __ ] from it i'm just helping you guys out and i think if you're looking for a macro friendlier than peanut butter and a little bit more of a better taste a little bit more of a different taste absolutely we should try them out and uh that's all i got to say anything else to say that's it all right so follow me on my social media follow her sarah raynic s-a-r-e-r-a-r-e-n-o-k it'll be in the description box below everything in your description box below give this video a thumbs up it helps the channel grow and other than that thanks uh thank american dream nutbutter for sending this over and give me the opportunity to review it on my channel i really appreciate it and other than that guys we'll check you guys later [Music]", "eBS2joIc0lA": "Hey guys, Dr Axe here from draxe.com. Today, I'm going to share with you the five\nwarning signs that you're zinc deficient. Zinc deficiency is something that's very common\nand can cause a number of health issues. Let me say this as well, I estimate about\n75% of people out there today are deficient in zinc. Here are the five warning signs that you are\nzinc deficient. Also at the end of this video I'll talk about\nmy top five zinc-rich foods you should be getting in and what to look for in a zinc\nsupplement. Number one warning sign that you have a zinc\ndeficiency is if you're immune compromised. If you tend to get sick frequently, if you\nhave immune system issues, if you've ever come down with any sort of chronic allergies\nor anything like that, that's a big warning sign that you are zinc deficient. So again, if you're immune compromised, if\nyou get sick often or you're always that person that gets sick, that is a major warning sign. Also, if you've had any other disease related\nto immunodeficiency, that's a warning sign you're zinc deficient. Number two warning sign you're zinc deficient\nis if you have leaky gut. Leaky gut is a condition where proteins can\nleak through the gut and cause systemic inflammation, and that's also relate to food allergies,\nthyroid problems, adrenal fatigue. But number two warning sign that you are zinc\ndeficient is if you have leaky gut and you have malabsorption, you're not digesting your\nnutrients well. Number three warning sign you're zinc deficient\nis if you struggle with diarrhea, if you ever have loose stools. That's where, again, your stools aren't firmly\nformed in the toilet. That's a big warning sign that you're zinc\ndeficient. Also if you have inflammatory bowel disease,\nlike irritable bowel syndrome, any of those issues whatsoever, even gas and bloating. Those are warning signs you are zinc deficient. Number four warning sign is thinning hair\nor losing your hair. If you have thin hair or are losing your hair,\nzinc is an essential mineral that really supports thicker hair growth and also just supports\nyour body growing and repairing and healing. Number five warning sign you're zinc deficient\nis you have any sort of inflammatory skin issue, especially acne, eczema, dermatitis,\nor psoriasis. All of those are warning signs that you are\nzinc deficient. There are other warning signs, but I want\nto talk about what people are most deficient in zinc and what causes a zinc deficiency. One of the biggest things that causes a zinc\ndeficiency is high levels of emotional stress. If you are emotionally stressed out, over\ntime your body has to utilize zinc and that mineral to heal and repair the body, to repair\nthe brain, to repair the skin, to repair your organs. Zinc is a reparative mineral that actually\nis even critical for protein synthesis and utilization in your body. So if you have had, let's say, a loss in the\nfamily or a very stressful job, and you're not sleeping enough, any of those things,\nthat is a big cause of zinc deficiency. The second most common cause of zinc deficiency\nis over exercise. Triathletes, marathon runners, and CrossFit\nathletes are some of the people that are most susceptible to a zinc deficiency. So again, if you work out a lot and maybe\neven have overworked out in the past that can cause zinc deficiency. The third most common reason you're zinc deficient\nis if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. Obviously when you're eating for two that\ncan cause mineral deficiencies, and so again, that can cause a zinc deficiency. Last but not least, typically aging women\nor elderly, they tend to have malabsorption, so they don't absorb zinc well, so they tend\nto have a zinc deficiency as something that can happen. So if you're going to get more zinc in your\ndiet, a few things need to happen. The number one thing you need to do is consume\nmore zinc-rich foods. Some of the best zinc-rich include, number\none, pumpkin seeds. Pumpkin seeds are very high in zinc. Also, oysters are high in zinc. Another great form of zinc is going to be\ngrass-fed beef, is going to have some zinc in it. Then sprouted nuts and seeds, chia seeds,\nflax seeds, even almonds, getting some seeds in your diet, and then peas are also a good\nform of zinc. So getting some green peas in your diet can\nalso increase those zinc levels. Last but not least, you need probiotics as\nwell. Probiotics, taking a good quality probiotic\nsupplement and consuming probiotic rich foods like kefir and fermented vegetables like sauerkraut\nincrease your absorption and digestion of zinc. Remember that it's not just what you eat,\nit's what you digest. So again, getting more probiotic rich foods\nin your diet and supplements can actually improve your overall zinc absorption. So again, remember, the biggest warning signs\nyou have a zinc deficiency are immune issues, leaky gut, bowel issues, like diarrhea, thinning\nor losing your hair as well as inflammatory skin issues like acne. Those are warning signs you have a zinc deficiency. If you want to learn more natural cures and\nways to improve your zinc, hey, check out draxe.com. You can find more information.

Hey guys, thanks for watching this video on\nzinc deficiency symptoms with me, Dr Axe.", "HLSejK469YU": "[Music] you show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking our third look at a tincture product today and our second one from the folks at yummy karma today we are taking a look at their mood magic 240 milligrams tincture here and as you can see I picked this up at my dispensary for 25 bones which is a really good price for a 240 ml of gram a tincture although it is a little bit more expensive than their drift away tincture their 300 milligram er which I've seen as low as twenty dollars now this one here is designed for as it says on their website and is designed for menstrual cramps and menstrual pain which it is my time of the month I'm feeling a little bloated a little sore a little cramped so I'm really hoping that this mood magic relieves my menstrual pain and cramping I'll be sure to let you know for sure so uh what we're gonna do here what we've done for our previous tinctures is I'm gonna do about the same amount that I did with the original tinker the drift away I'm gonna try to do about a hundred milligrams and they say that one full dropper is about eight milligrams of THC so I'm going to try to do about 12 ish in total I'll do a couple here on camera just to kind of let you know how it tastes how it feels all that good stuff and then I'll come back to you guys two hours later to let you know how this mood magic is landing so if you hadn't tuned in to my first yummy karma review where we did the drift away the one that helps you fall asleep I was surprised by several things from the yummy karma folks whoops oh the dropper is not in there to start with oh it's a different kind of bottle than the other one so there were a couple things that I was surprised by one was how affordable it was tincture is usually quite expensive and this is quite affordable in two I was by how inoffensive it tasted this one does say I as I had assumed that it is a coconut oil base I assumed the last one was as well tasted vaguely of coconut so I was very surprised at how awful it tasted so if we can figure out how to get this little wrapper off we'd be in business and we would start the review proper let's see what we have to do here with the teeth that looks like that was the trick okay childproof lid mood magic package genes nice packaging is fine like it like the bottle everything's it's got all the directions that you need on there this one is actually packaged a little bit better the other one the other one was just a pure bottle there was no stunning wrapper on the outside it was much harder to read I think it was printed right on the bottle as opposed to in a wrapper so this is a lot easier to read a lot easier to get the information from and I like it quite a bit so let's open this childproof lid here smells fruity and coconutty and let's get ourselves a dropper so here is the liquid it looks cutter Li putrid it's green gross vile looking stuff but it really doesn't taste that bad if it tastes like the drift away so the way we take our tincture is sublingually which means under the tongue we leave it there for about 30 seconds I do a couple of drops at a time leave it there for about 30 seconds and then come back to you guys and I'll let you know how it tastes and all that fun stuff so here we go all right accusing our Brewer air yeah Bob not bad that is even a more neutral taste than the other one even a less coconut base it almost tastes like nothing at all I don't feel like I've done a gag or nothing nothing I it's it's it's really it's really quite wonderful I mean it doesn't taste wonderful but it's just it's kind of magic how moon magic even how I'm neutral that tastes well guys I have about three I have to do another two of those and buy two of those I mean to not just droppers but another two mouthfuls and then I will not gonna do that all on camera because it'll just be boring but I will do another eight drops and then I will come back to you guys in two ish hours or so let you know how long it's been and give you my thoughts once I'm nice and high so guys I'll see you in just a bit thanks for watching wheats see you soon all my menstrual cramps pains and discomforts disappeared thanks mood magic well guys I can't really speak to that aspect of the mood magic product I can speak to the aspect of does it still get you high and the answer is yes this guy is high um I'm probably at like six and a half and climbing it's actually a little bit early coming into you guys I'm coming at you guys really only about an hour and 15 minutes in but I have some things to do and I can feel it escalating and that's with about the same amount of tincture that I took roughly equivalent to the drift away I might not feel as high just yet but I am taking a little bit earlier and this is 50 milligrams less than the drift away but I'm still gonna recommend it I still think this is a great product I still think as far as tinctures go this is the best how Hugh bar in a way that's out there for tinctures except looking at you house brand tincture that is the worst value and tincture even though it should be the best its advertises at the best but it's the worst value see rambling usually pretty good sign that I'm high so yes I really like this an another winner from Yummie Carmen they're really starting to grow on me have like their popcorn and I've liked their tinctures I'm starting to really root for these guys the yummy karma mood magic 240 milligram THC tincture another winner from them and guys before I balance here on this review I want to share with you a little cherry on top something that's not necessarily weed relator something that could be enjoyed with or without weed but just something that I love that I want to share with you guys so in another life and this is a great for possible cherry on top of it cherry on top sin the future and another life I was an avid avid board gamer I had hundreds of board games and a collection loved it played them every weekend obsessed over them I I have not played board games in a very long time well in several years I've kind of quit that hobby cold turkey but there are some games that I would love to recommend to you guys the first one I'm going to recommend is so simple you can learn this game in literally I think the the rules come on like less than an index card sized piece of paper you can learn it in 30 seconds but I have probably played this card game called no thanks exclamation mark sorry a little indigestion there so again the name is no thanks it is a very quick card game played with some poker chips cards numbered by fate 3 to 35 or something like that and a bunch of poker chips and it is a super fun game that you can play with 3 to 7 players takes about 15 minutes to play and as I said about 30 seconds to explain I'm not even gonna bother to explain it here you can pick it up for $11 on Amazon that is a perfect game to play you know when you've got friends over when you got family over when you're going on vacation wherever the case may be it plays great with 3 it plays great with 7 and as I said it's 11 bucks on Amazon you have no excuse for picking it up if you have any inclination towards playing board or card games or anything like again that is no thanks exclamation mark on Amazon 11 bucks pick it up you'll thank me later and that guy's is gonna do it for this cherry on top and for this review here on weeds I appreciate you guys watching as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "D0249hg5o0k": "hi everyone and welcome to for moms like me okay so today I want to talk about a particular particular food product and all its health benefits so for those of you who are not allergic to peanuts a very good source of protein magnesium vitamin E fiber and and also contains lots of antioxidants is peanut butter so I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with this brand is gist I've actually like this however while doing some research we found out a few things about the gist product and the gist brand that we may not you know may have you thinking twice and I know that for many of us moms especially when we go grocery shopping and we are walking through the aisles and we're trying to decide on what foods are best for for us and our families it can get really overwhelming so I'm hoping that today with this video that I can at least make buying or purchasing one one item in the grocery store just a little bit easier for you okay so let's go back to the jiff brand and let's take a look at the ingredients so first off it is it has roasted peanuts it contains sugar 2% or less of molasses fully hydrated vegetable oil mono and diglycerides and salt okay so there are a few red flags on this list first of all sugar the less sugar that you can consume the better we all know that sugar is a harmful product it tastes good but it can contribute to obesity weight gain diabetes and lots of other ailments that you don't want to be near at any point in time so you can always do without sugar one of the other ingredients which is vegetable oils now this actually is a trans fat and we all know how dangerous trans fats can be the club the arteries they cause heart disease I mean it's one of the main contributors to cancer so we really don't want to be ingesting any form of vegetable oil whatsoever another on the list that's a huge like red flag are the mono and diglycerides so the rest lag about these products is that if a trans fat and we all know how terrible trans fats are so why do they use the mono and diglycerides in in the peanut butter well it's prolongs of life so it allows the products to in the shelves for much longer period of time which I guess is okay for the manufacturer but those that trans those trans fats do not do well for us at all it clogs arteries it causes heart disease it can cause inflammation in the body which can lead to stroke I mean you want to stay far away from these trans fats so now that we know that our tried and true were tested and much-loved Jif it's not all that good for us what do we do so they are some of the options in fact while doing our research my husband and I discovered that this brand which you may already be familiar with which you probably pass on the aisles in the grocery store all the time because we did it's actually much better and I'm going to tell you why so here are the ingredients in this particular Smuckers which is a natural creamy peanut butter so the ingredients are peanuts and 1% or less assault I mean seriously how much I mean how many ingredients you actually need to add to peanut butter besides peanuts right so this my friends my dear moms out there this muckers peanut butter is a much better peanut butter brand for you and your family so when you're at the grocery store next time and you're trying to make that decision which peanut butter is all the dates out the door and stick to smoker's okay this is the better brand and there are actually our options in this so if you like your peanuts or crunchy in your peanut butter they've got the crunchy version so there are some choices okay guys so now that we know which peanut butter brands are the best I'm going to share with you just two recipes or should say just peanuts snacks that include peanut butter that you can you know give to your kids or you can also enjoy as a snack so this is a slightly different take on the good old peanut butter sandwich except we're using only half a slice of bread and smothering it with peanut butter and then because the Smuckers is just a little bit tart it has no sugar added at all we're just sprinkling a tiny tiny bit of brown sugar dressing brown sugar here another great way of enjoying peanut butter as a snack is with your favorite fruit for me it's a dipping of the apple slices into some peanut butter or just smoothing a thin coat of peanut butter over some grape fruit and that just makes for a great snack for not just you but for the entire family thank you so much for watching and see you guys next time", "8u8QIKIKKT4": "[Music] with be very good I'm going to be doing a review for you roots to certified organic hemp protein powder we're gonna see how it tastes we're going to go over the nutritional profile a little bit and we are going to just look at whether or not this is an effective protein powder for meeting your daily protein needs so let's go ahead and get right into it so first of all what I like to say about hemp protein powder in general is that it is very high in magnesium and one serving of this protein powder contains 48 percent of your daily magnesium needs it's also got a considerable amount of iron a decent amount of vitamin A and a little bit of calcium there's also from what I know even though it's not listed on the ingredients in here there's a fair amount of zinc and hemp protein powder so that's something that is really good for everybody but especially if you're a man and you want to keep your testosterone levels high then you're gonna probably want to make sure you get plenty of zinc so this is just one good source of zinc and I am going to go ahead and look at my cheat sheet here and share a few other things about this hemp protein powder with you first of all it is organic certified and that means that first of all there are no genetically modified organisms and in addition it's not processed with hexane some proteins are processed with hexane and this one is not and I wanted you to know that so you're getting a clean pure product and you don't have to worry about any harsh chemicals that might have residuals in the product so that's good to know another thing that you might be interested in knowing is is that hemp is an excellent or have protein powder as an excellent source of fiber and that being said if you're looking to lose weight protein in general is good in the sense that is very it is very safe so you can go a lot longer after having a meal that is higher in protein without filling hungry than you can if you're having calories from fats or carbohydrates so that being said hemp has a double kind of a goodness if you're looking to lose some weight first being that's high in protein and second being that it is high in fiber so it gives you that full filling and it'll make you feel satiated so you can go longer without eating or you can use it as a meal replacement for something maybe that's less good for you that's less has less nutritional value that is something that is just not good for you so hemp is good in that sense as well and of course it's good for vegans because it is a plant-based source of protein and there are no ingredients in it other than him so you know you're getting something that is completely vegan friendly if you are a vegan and it does come up short in three amino acids and those are leucine lysine and tryptophan now that being said hemp protein powder does contain those amino acids and a lot of people actually say that hemp protein is a complete protein because it has all the essential amino acids and it does the fact that it's lower in those three than some other protein powders means that you might want to balance it out with some other type of protein powder however if you're just looking to supplement your protein I would look at this as a source to get your extra protein that you wanted to get from supplementation and it is has a fair amount of those well I should say it has plenty of the other amino acids and there is one that I want to mention in a minute that is not an essential amino acid but that might be of interest to you if you are into weight training and I'll go ahead and get into that in just a minute but I also wanted to make sure that you know they Lusine is one of the main amino acids involved in muscle repair and gaining muscle mass so and leucine isoleucine and valine are the amino acids that are most attributed to protein synthesis muscle gains and muscle recovery so hemp protein powder has less of those than most of the other protein powders that I've seen so you're gonna have to take more of it if you want to get a strong extra dose of protein supplementation that being said you should be getting most to your protein from food but this is a good way for getting your extra protein that you need if you're in a hurry and you don't have time to make complete meals something like this is a really good way to supplement and it also is high in omega 3 fatty acids and so Omega 3 fatty acids are good for all kinds of things and for your skin some people have said they like hemp protein powder because it it makes their skin feel better and look better omega-3 fatty acids are also good for keeping inflammation down and that's really about your omega-3 to omega-6 ratio and the omega-3 to omega-6 ratio of hip protein powder is pretty good so there's that benefit of having hemp protein as well and so there are the other thing I wanted to mention the other amino acid that is not an essential amino acid but it is one of the protein amino acids that your body uses your body does make this protein but there has been shown to be benefits from the supplementation of this particular amino acid and that amino acid is arginine so arginine is a precursor to nitric oxide and night Tricks oxide in case you're wondering I didn't say nitrous oxide and that being said arginine helps your blood to flow better by helping the inside of your arterial wall to relax and that allows your blood to flow better and so as a result arginine can help your body's to circulate nutrients better and that's why I think that even though it's a lower that it has lower amounts of protein in general potentially and this is my opinion but there is some evidence to say that there might be some then there is some evidence that might support this opinion so that arginine helping your blood to get those nutrients more circulated in your body might help you to use more of the protein that you do take which is coming from him and also there's something called Avastin which is the type of protein is the most digestible type of protein and that is one of the types of protein that is in hemp protein powder so the studies that I looked at were about mice and I really wanted to be sure about this so let me just say it could have been about rats so it wasn't done on humans but what they did find was that it was that arginine can prevent you from gaining fat even eating the same amount of calories so in this study they fed rats a very high fat diet in order to make them gain weight and the rats that were supplemented with arginine they gained maybe a third of the amount of fat that the rats that were not supplemented with arginine gained having the same amount of calories so I showed that arginine did help to prevent gaining weight and how it did this was by the way that it helped the muscles to metabolize calories more effectively and so that's what the studies showed so that being said there are some good things about him to consider and I mean hemp protein powder specifically and you have any worries about THC meaning like the specific compound that is in the marijuana plant that gets people high you don't have to worry about that when you're eating hemp seed protein powder it's not going to get you high you get the good stuff without the stuff that maybe you don't want to have so that let's go ahead and wrap this up with just giving away the most important amino acids for most people the ones that most people care about that are in their protein powder and those are leucine isoleucine and valine so for isoleucine in a sermon here you've got 400 milligrams leucine you've got 600 milligrams and valine you've got 500 milligrams and let me just go ahead and go over how many servings there are per container so you're gonna have to take a little bit more of this to get a higher amount of protein but in this particular have protein powder you're going to need four tablespoons to get only 11 grams of protein so that's not as much as many other supplements give you that being said this is a fairly inexpensive protein powder and it is high-quality so you could potentially take more of it if you really wanted to up the that dose of protein from a supplement so like I said 11 grams of protein per serving and there's only 15 per container so now you've got the breakdown this is a good supplement I definitely recommend it it's a high-quality supplement with no other ingredients and it oh I almost forgot the most important thing let's just go ahead and taste this you can see that I'm willing you gotta gain some muscle mass here if I'm gonna open this up though okay a little right do a nice tablespoon here mix it up one thing I have noticed with the hemp protein powder is that if you let it sit the fiber kind of goes to the bottom so you might want to shake it or mix it again if you let it sit for a little bit but you can see it's didn't take me long to mix it together and right now it's well mixed so let's go ahead and give it a taste if you've ever had hemp seed oil which is good for omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids then you will recognize the taste of that oil in the hemp seed protein powder and that's what has the omega-3s in it it's a little bit gritty meaning I can I can feel the fiber when I drink it it's not gonna be for everybody but it's definitely a well-rounded taste I don't mind it but it's definitely going to be an acquired taste for many people so that means said you can make your own decision about whether hep protein powder is going to be for you it is definitely unique and different than most other protein powders like I said so but I think it's alright so there you have it that's hemp protein powder highly recommended I definitely give it the things very good stamp of approval and I'm gonna continue to take this protein powder in combination with other ones unless I learned that I really just don't need any protein powder at all and if you liked this video please give it a thumbs up share the video also I'll have a link in the description to where you can get this protein powder help support paint very good keep us making these kind of videos but thanks so much for watching and I look forward to seeing you [Music]", "daIf5HnQWVs": "hey what's up everybody protein bar review guy here just finished uh shoulder workout and it is time for a protein bar remember i'm a advocate for a whole food diet you know natural food lean proteins fruits and vegetables healthy fats so really the only time that you want to go for one of these glorified candy bars is after a workout immediately after a workout all right so the criteria for our reviewing score today is going to be ingredients protein content macros calorie count taste texture and that will lead us to our overall score one through ten all right today we have robert irvine's fit crunch first let's talk about the ingredients here protein blend the first one is whey protein isolate whey protein concentrate soy protein isolate well that's not good peanuts vegetable glycerin vegetable oils palm and palm kernel sugar sorbitol gelatin bovine palm oil brown rice flour malt to tall that's not a good one and water okay so here we go on ingredients i'm going to give this one a four basically because we all want to avoid soy as we know let's talk about the protein content this is a 190 calorie bar only 16 grams of protein 14 grams of carbs and eight grams of total fat at nine calories per gram that's 72 calories of this is from fat so that's over a third of this bar is fat another reason to just have one of these after your workout okay um so again protein content that's not really a lot i'm gonna give this a 4 as well for protein content and for a macro score because it's not even uh you know hitting the bar of 20 grams of protein in a serving now i do understand they make a larger version of this bar that's almost 400 calories i think that's way too much this is the 190 calorie version so everything's cut in half pretty much and uh yeah so i'm going to give it a 4 on protein content for not having even 20 grams in 190 calories all right let's talk about the taste let's give this thing a shot here looks pretty good look at that chocolate some kind of stripes on it there that's pretty good for taste this is the uh chocolate peanut butter chocolate peanut butter version anything chocolate peanut butter is okay in my book i love chocolate peanut butter this has some good crunch to it look at the layers there there's a cookie cookie in there was you know some crunch and some peanut butter on top of that i'm gonna give this a nine this tastes very good and uh texture i'm going to give it a nine for texture as well this is uh you know it's got the crunch it's got the chocolate smoothness of the chocolate we got the creamy peanut butter in there i'm not really sure on how they could improve this i'm going to give it a 9 though maybe i don't know maybe something out there is better than this overall score though we're gonna have to put this down overall score i'm gonna give it a five that being because of the ingredients that i do not like um the macros that i don't like the low protein content and really the only saving grace on this bar that even got it to a five total score is the taste and the texture okay everybody that's it for that one remember just have one of these and some protein after your workout you'll be much better off all right remember to hit like and subscribe below thank you very much and uh that's it for today protein bar review guy", "clmv3F_rj9Q": "[Music] hey Jack I'll do a Moscow me old brother always

the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary I've got my trusty spatula and my trusty thing in Nutella why do I have these you might be asking if you have not tuned into one of these before it means I am reviewing gummies and the reason I have this Nutella is so that I can have a little bit of fact before I eat these gummies I find that having a little bit of fat in your system before consuming gummies enhances the high of that gumming so let's just take a little lick of Nutella here the best part about any edible review because who doesn't love just some freaking Nutella all right that should be that should do it for my fats now what kind of gummy are we reviewing we are reviewing lol edibles candy I have actually had a couple people asked me to review this I reviewed one lol edible product in the past that I did not like very much the Elwha edibles flamin hot cheetos this here is a candy it is blueberries our belts Meghnath be gorilla glue glue hybrid so you can see on the back they've got a plea to add them on social media they've got a missing lot ID batch number and best before date not on there so we don't know if we're gonna be doing okay says do not mix with alcohol first time I've ever seen that I don't exactly know why you shouldn't mix the two other than you don't like getting crunked but uh who cares I am really hoping this lol edibles redeems not only lol edibles which he's a really dumb name I mean it's just a colossal II stupid name I'm hoping it not only redeems them but also gummies in general if you've never really seen weeks before I have never been a huge fan of gummies or candies I finally get you less high than the confectionery edibles but maybe this will be the one that turns it around we shall see alright so let's open this up here these blueberries sour ropes alright that is a strong weed odor very strong you will smell that from a distance away as I think so be careful opening this somewhere in a closed area where you don't want people smoking weed because that has a very strong weed odor as do these ropes themselves these look a lot like the Buddhist hours which I've had in the past and reviewed hmm there's a considerable weed taste to them not overwhelming the sourness definitely helps not as sour as the Buddhist hours but still pretty sour with a stronger weed flavor so hopefully that means they're more potent than the the Voodoo sours Oh sure if I mention this this is a 300 milligram animal should should be pretty potent but then again gummies your mileage right back again fairly strong we taste but the sourness really helps them overcoming with it all right guys so I'm gonna finish these here off-camera I'm not gonna bore you to death eating you all these things here in front of you and I will be back in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because as always that is the most important part of any edible review all right guys please please please wish me luck let's hope these are better than our gummies in the past and ll WA edibles in the past and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know the results thank you so much for watching weights we'll see you soon peace guys I am happy to report that while not perfect and while not my first choice in any of the categories lol edibles the candy blue ropes blue berry ropes blue gummi ropes are are a nice little revelation they are not the most powerful 300 milligram edible I've ever had they're not the most tasty gummy I've ever had but I would say they are probably my new favorite gummy I am I do feel quite high not as high as I would be on a 300 mm gram confectionery edible like say akarova for example but that's a comparing you know something with like the best of the best I guess it's substantially better than their flamin hot cheeto knockoff that I had a while ago so you know it might be a combination of lowered expectations I was also a little tired going to this review so that might also be contributing to like my feelings of being high but overall I'm I'm I'm pleasantly surprised I know I used that phrase a lot but this was a welcome surprise I I had two strikes going against it one being lol edibles which I had a bad experience with and being a gummy which I've mostly found to be disappointing and I found it to be okay so that's you know that's good that's good I would not probably buy this again but if you are a fan of gummy edibles or if you really like sour gummies this is certainly better than the Voodoo candies I've had which are 375 milligram anibal's you might want to go and pick this up but for me it's it's a nice little surprise so thank you so much for watching weeks guys that's my dog walking in and we will check you out on the next review

"hey what's going on guys so it is 6:00 p.m. Tuesday afternoon just got off of work we were in the field today so that's why I look sunburned all dirty but I wanted to give you guys a shoulder update because you've been so supportive you know sending me all to get wells I really appreciate it you really don't know how much it means to me so I'm telling you right now it means a lot but I haven't hit any upper body work for the last three days I can hold this you know this camera right now pain free it's definitely getting better but it doesn't mean I'm gonna be hitting the gym anytime soon and hitting upper body right now I'm hitting legs every other day but I still can't do back squats because it still hurts my shoulder so I'll show you what I'm doing today I'm going to the gym hitting legs so I'm just kind of working my way into it I don't want it to be where you know I'm starting to feel better I hit the gym and then it hurts again it's just a constant battle so I've had this for the last six weeks or it's been off and on just want to get rid of it so I'm gonna take the time let it rest let it heal and get back and do it slowly so doesn't make some pre-workout food I'll show you what I'm making show you what else goes on today I'm just in kind of log hope you guys enjoy it hope you enjoy the video and I will see you in a little bit so I was craving chocolate peanut butter so that's why I made a chocolate peanut butter banana sandwich I use that better in peanut butter spread which is like two grams of fat per serving a lot of you guys hate on that it's not that bad I mean the consistency is different but it's better than Walden Farms peanut butter anything's better than that so it's two tablespoons of that some Walden Farms chocolate syrup speaking of Walden Farms and 126 grams man on some bread and on the side I had one cup of vanilla Greek yogurt with a little bit of cinnamon and one scoop of Dymatize Cinnabon protein powder which is absolutely awesome a huge cinnamon fan the reason I'm craving chocolate peanut butter so if you're the military or in the army you need MREs you know that like chocolate peanut butter is like the most sought-after thing and an MRE that's also needed today which took me back to Ranger school if you could find chocolate peanut butter in Ranger school that like made your day people would trade for that so I could be like hey man I'll trade you my chocolate peanut butter which is this little packet for your entire entree and there were people that do that people were so you know crazy for chocolate peanut butter they want to check out peanut butter so bad during Ranger school they would trade like majority of their meal and you know so to this day I'm a volume guy over like you know quality quantity over quality I'd rather take a lot of food that tastes all right then a little bit of food that's like absolutely amazing so I want on there so trade your chocolate peanut butter do you go to Ranger School so this was my second workout trying out these SPD knee sleeves so far really enjoy them they're a lot bigger they're a lot tighter than the Reeb ands so one consideration if you're gonna pick them up you probably could go one size bigger than that Speedy's you know I bought a large and the rebounds I bought a large and SPD's and I definitely could have fit in an extra large in the SPD's but so far they provide a lot more protection they're a lot bigger like I said they cover a lot more of the knee and they don't slide down with miry bands where occasionally so in the past you know we could've been using them absolutely loving I mean worth the money even though they were really expensive but I do highly recommend some sort of knee protection when you're in a squatting or doing any kind of leg presses that's why I like to use them but one thing I did want to cover that a lot of people have been asking me is how I'm responding to this injury how I'm getting over it how it's affecting me because it's it's not a big injury you know it's a it's a shoulder injury that might take a few weeks to recover but for any of you guys that love going to the gym as much as I do even taking one day a week off from the gym is tough thinking like a few weeks off I feel like an eternity but I'm using this time to my advantage and teaching myself increasing my knowledge on this sport because you know with my schedule right now I go from work I go to the gym I come home I make food the next day and the day is pretty much open so I don't have much time other than the weekend to read about all this stuff and teach myself even more even though that's what I've been doing but I just feel like I haven't had enough time so in the days I'm not going to the gym now that is my michael doing legs i'm using i'm doing research on strength conditioning recovery i just picked up some new books on non linear periodization and i want to start incorporating the conjugate method some different stuff that i can educate myself incorporate into my training and as well as you know give you guys advice no I start hanging on clients I have better you guys programs so that's one thing I'm doing right now that's one thing you guys do if you have an injury you have days off you're having trouble dealing with those increase your knowledge on what you're doing no matter what it's gonna be it doesn't have to be about the gym if you're taking a day off from doing something you can't do something 24/7 there's nothing you can do 24/7 that I can think I'll cut my head and you still love doing it all the time find another way to increase your knowledge on it and that's what I'm doing right now so I'm actually looking forward to taking some time off from the gym I love my body heal up teach myself the things I don't know increase my knowledge on this sport so I love to hit the gym I'll show you what I'm doing now four legs that I can't incorporate back squats for the time being so see the gym so I know my last vlog I said I was taking a complete week away from the gym and it was like two or three days after that and I was like are I'm hitting the gym I'm hitting legs at least so I've been hitting legs every other day and that's the plan for the next week maybe two weeks until I couldn't start incorporating some back and a little bit upper body still no pressing movements though so my shoulder completely heals well this gives me a good opportunity to mess around with some movements that I haven't incorporated in my training program for a while because for the last couple months I've been so focused on powerlifting specifically the squat you know some extensions some curls some RTLS hack squats here and there but nothing too crazy that I haven't incorporated before so now that I'm reading and you know expanding my knowledge on non linear periodization I can you know I have a personal experience with different exercises that can start to incorporate and building this new program that I'm going to develop for myself and since decreasing my frequency you know quite a lot about 50% still not doing upper body anymore or for the time being while my shoulder heals I feel really good outside of the gym energy levels are back I'm feeling my alpha self again and now there's this huge debate whether you can over train the body in the muscle groups but you can definitely over train your central nervous system your central nervous system can get taxed and it is affected by stress and not stress just by you know personal problems but stresses the gym training putting stress on your body your personal problems or work not sleeping enough everything going on in your the world and my central nervous system was just taxed a little bit so treating this kind of like a deal owed whether it's one two three weeks however long it takes for me to heal up but I'm definitely feeling better I needed that little break that little step away from the gym just because my schedule is so hectic right now so this workout is kinda like an example working around your injury so now right now I probably could back squat but it does put some pressure on my shoulder so I'm just taking a little break from it so today I did about four or five sets of hack squats working up to an RPE nine going pretty heavy I go and heavy on hack squats because it's a pretty controlled movement m'angil me and the leg press is now light press has never been one of my favorite exercises I just feel like for me personally it just doesn't feel very effective I had put some pressure on my lower back which I try to avoid at all cost but I like going lighter weight more reps anywhere from 15 to 25 reps four sets of that and after that I jumped into extensions and curls which I've been super setting lately before my workout pre exhausting the muscles getting in the squats but I think after I get back into the gym after this injury heals up I'm gonna start off with squats again so I can you know I like treating the squat that left benching and beating the workout so I can judge my performance in my strength gains and then using the other stuff that's hypertrophy work but pretty exhausting the muscles before going into anything with extensions of curls has really been effective for me it's something I really enjoy because he gets that burning feeling the muscle like drops at superset to take that bodybuilding feeling you know well it's flowing in there you get the pump and you just feel really good in the gym so that was today's workout and overall pretty good so I have no affiliation of quests but I will tell you the quest s'mores bar so you guys find out is one of the best protein bars I've ever had and I tried the muscle palm combat crunch this weekend cuz everyone's raving about it and tell you the truth I really wasn't that impressed they didn't like strike me as a bar other than something you pick up in a gas station like it was big 100's wasn't crazy about it I got like the chocolate chip cookie dough might be chopped it was a dark chocolate one but it did say anything special so another thing I love picking up occasionally are these these vegetable bags you just throw in the microwave I got these at Trader Joe's but determined for five minutes are done it's very convenient filling not any carbs a lot of fiber so I'm making that shoot what I'm having to end of the night it's a lot of food because my last meal like being a lot of volume so like I said a lot of volume tonight I've some green beans 10 ounces of red potatoes fried in coconut oil with some parsley salt and pepper one cup of egg whites was one serving of four Mexican cheese 4 ounces of ham and then on the side here I put some Boathouse salsa ranch in a separate container for some reason you know they do this in restaurants and just creates a good vibe in an environment I like it in my own so there's no need it's not necessary but it just looks cool and then on the side here one of these Diet Hansen diet tangerine lime sodas which is absolutely awesome I cut a six pack of these in like a week so guys that wraps video hope you enjoyed it this is my Tuesday my entire Tuesday after work you saw I'll talk to you next video", "PJjJ-9Lr_Xw": "[Music] what up homies welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary classic episode today that means it is edible time guys and one that I am pretty intrigued about what a novel looking product we have here today and that product guys is blood man's edible nugs 250 milligrams which I picked up in a dispensary a gray market dispensary in Orange County for 20 bucks so 250 milligram bud man's edible nugs what the [ __ ] are animal drugs you might be asking yourself well here's what they are but man's edible nugs thin mints hybrids they look like nugs of wheat they look like little nuggets of or a little uh what do we call knucks weed nugs but they're not they're actually disguised uh they're not nugs at all there are little bits of chocolate Thin Mint hybrid actually so it looks like a nug of weed but it is in fact an edible how fun how fun so we are going to have an experiment with this we're gonna try these nugs here and hope that they are going to get us blasted because I would love to love these I love how fun they are that's a great price for a 250 milligram an\u00edbal um and I always like a novel product so let's go to smell here mmm most cannabis tea and mint tea as one might expect um so if you guys have never tuned in two weeks before and if you have I'm sorry you have to hear this for the trillionth and a half time where our reviews work is I'm gonna eat all these nugs these edible nugs here uh maybe not Alden on in front of you in camera but I will finish him over the next few minutes or so and then at the end of that two after two hours have passed after two hours of driver having consumed these I'll come back to you guys to let you know what I think because that's what you're really gonna for you don't care so much about how it tastes you wanna know if it's gonna get you high so for that guys you'll have to wait the two hours but first we got to do a taste test what am I talking about so here's our little edible nuggie there it is looking very much like an ugh smells like mitten weed mmm that's not bad and as the texture of like a Hershey's cookies and cream candy bar if you've ever had that sort of white chocolate with little bits of like crunchy bits of cookie in there with some mint taste let me see if I can get a cross-sectional here well you don't get a much better idea but you can see like the little cookie bits in there maybe um a little bit of cannabis toast but not too bad for a 250 milligram definitely not gonna dread finishing all of these off they're not bad at all um I wouldn't say they're pleasant but it's it's not going to upset me to have to eat this whole can here which is a nice plus so guys I've really got my fingers crossed for these I'm hoping these are gonna be a little a little nugget of gold how about that so guys to find out for sure if these are gonna work for us you have to do stick around for a couple of seconds otherwise I'll see you guys in just a couple of hours for me to let you know how I am feeling thanks for much for watching wheats and I will see you in just a bit it has not been two hours since I checked in it has not been three hours it's not even been four hours and I do apologize guys it's been closer to the 10 hours and why is that well that's because I think that bud man's edible nugs might be an really [ __ ] impressive product this put me out rarely do edibles get me sleeping anymore and this one got me sleeping on the couch last night that's why I'm here to you the next morning to check in with you guys cuz I fell asleep these hit me really hard I was super super impressed with them I would say they're definitely 250 milligrams I really enjoyed the taste the price was right it says 20 bucks but I think I got a discount for like 17 everything about this was a real win for me um just in case any time I find one of these products that seems to be just an anomalously good product I do like to double check make sure it's as good as I had thought initially so I wouldn't tell you to hesitate to pick these up I'd say you know if you seemed at your dispensary grab them but I will be reviewing another flavor in the future for sure just to make sure they're as good as I originally thought but for right now I can tell you guys bud man's edible nugs is is a true winner absolutely over the moon with it cute thumbs way up thank you guys uh really really happy with this one now I'm just repeating myself so that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on the next review and hopefully it'll be as good as bud man's here thanks for watching", "8Fm4Ucd3Pec": "hey guys what's up this is Robin once the reviews thank you so much for watching tonight we're gonna check out the Smuckers natural peanut butter this is it right here you can pick this up at Walmart I did the price on this for a 16-ounce jar is two dollars and ninety two cents so what we're gonna do today is we're gonna check this out comparatively to one of the original og peanut butters jiff and this one is also the same size 16 ounces you can get this for two hours and 22 cents at Walmart so it's about you know 70 cents difference for natural versus not as natural just to put some background behind this jiff is one of my favorite peanut butters Peter Pan's okay to Skippy's good to grew up with these you know my whole life since I can pretty much eat you know putting this on toast the peanut butter and jelly waffles french toast definitely something that I've had all my life and you know looking at the ingredients on this lately I've been thinking okay what are these natural peanut butters like they have all these crazy natural peanut butter jars and companies now that that talk about natural and you know and these are not as natural so what we're gonna do is we're gonna compare the ingredients on these and then we're going to taste each one of them on a piece of bread just to see which one tastes better because I'm curious you know as some of you guys are about the natural peanut butters I've been eating a lot of food lately that is that is you know better for you you know it doesn't have as many ingredients and you know bad ingredients and so this is just another one of those that I'm gonna experiment now the ingredients on the Smuckers peanut butter very simple there's basically two things peanuts and salt and then the chip one is not as bad as you think so a lot of people are looking at these peanut butters like the Peter Pan and shadow my dog just walk right by some of these peanut butters have like palm oil and some other items in there that make the peanut butter you know really creamy and really you know tasty they enhance the shelf life and all that stuff this one only has you know both suspect things this one has roasted peanuts and sugar and then there's 2% of molasses that might actually be you know suspect two fully hydrogenated vegetable oil so that's the vegetable that keeps this stuff really creamy and in kind of like in one piece that's intact and then it says rapeseed and soybean that's probably not as good for you either but this does have less of the bad stuff than some of the other brands as well eight grams of carbs two grams of fiber three total grams of ink actually two grams of added sugars and seven grams of protein so you know protein wise and the ingredient the bad list of ingredients is not that bad on this one now we take it to the smokers we have about the same total fat and sodium seven grams of carbs which is about the same as this one so these are both local carb alternatives for peanut butter and eight grams of protein but what you don't get in this one is those crazy ingredients right all this has is peanuts and salt that's it but you can see what the consistency is just from the jar right well you can't see this you already know this peanut butter is gonna be you know in one piece but you can kind of see the peanut butter kind of swirling around in here really loose so that that's a little concerning to me but that's what natural peanut butter is supposed to look like now okay so we're gonna put these two together we're gonna put these both on pieces of bread and let's see how different tastes because if I'm like you if you're like me you're gonna want to know if you're eating the natural peanut butter stuff that it's actually gonna be tasty because if it's not tasty I'm going back to the jiff man I'm just gonna be honest with you so let's check it out and see how see how this one does so I'm gonna use a piece of nature's own let's see nature's own white wheat which is one of my favorites too we're gonna cut this thing in half because I'm already a dinner so no need to fill up anything okay all right just to show you the Jeff tastes like I've already been eating this one but you can kind of see here that the jiff is going to be very creamy very much what you'd expect you know those of y'all they've been eating peanut butter your whole life you know the deal right creamy peanut butter all right I'm going to spread this on this all right so this is kind of what it looks like on the bread very very recognizable if this is making you hungry going geez go out to the kitchen and get you some peanut butter okay and you know because peanut butter is gonna be a little thicker you know sticky a little bit but it's all one piece right you could shake this for days and nothing's gonna come out now Benna sanitize my knife a lot of paper towel real sanitizing and now we're gonna chuck it we're gonna we're now we're gonna open this one up and there's a nice little recipe on the top there you guys want to have a recipe for a caramel dip you got it again this is the just a brown presentation very similar to the jelly right I've always had Smuckers jelly and that's that's pretty much all I've had out of smokers my entire life but now we're gonna dip into the realm of this peanut butter so let's open it up this see what it is okay no snap no pop so like you would put the jelly alright so as you know if you've seen some of my videos I like this build stuff all over the place and I'm gonna try not to do that tonight this is what it looks like as we saw through that through the glass it's very very loose on top now I'm pretty sure you got to stir it up so I'm gonna take my knife I'm gonna stir it up a little bit now you can see it's very loose it is very loose and I'm kind of curious and I've already spilled it over the top on this side it's almost like I mean it's just it's just very loose man it's like paint it's like I'm strolling around painting now I don't know how long I'm supposed to swirl this for I mean it's not gonna get super super creamy like the regular peanut butter but I'm assuming this is it right I'm assuming this is it yeah I mean it's very simple the consistency feels just like paint ladies and gentlemen let's just hope it doesn't taste like paint all right I'm gonna slap some really I'm going to slap some on my bread and it literally is dripping off the bread okay if I can show you that okay all right it's it's a very loose man not a fan so far of the consistency okay Smuckers peanut butter let's do it okay it's very loose did I mentioned it was loose it's very loose it means like the peanut butter is like the peanut butter is like you know drenched into the bread almost it's just it's like jelly I mean it's literally like jelly even though I have some jam that really sticks to the top and is a lot thicker than this I mean look it's not bad it's not bad it's just it's it's not peanut butter it's just not peanut butter let me try it again I mean it's peanut butter but it's like I don't know man it's like it's almost like a dip let's call it a peanut butter dip is what it is I feel like I'm dipping my food in it can you see that it's dripped on my hand here let me get you a better picture there you go I mean it's like a dip I'm gonna real able it's almost end smokers a I letter or email and say man this is don't call peanut butter and it's not creamy I would not say this is creamy you would not call paint creamy hey creamy is not the right word now look those of you all that know about you know this natural peanut butter stuff if I'm supposed to keep stirring this around look let me just try that real quick maybe I'm just getting the top side and I'm really supposed to stir though I was trying to just stir the top so let's try it again I may be doing this wrong guys doing a real-time okay so as I'm as I'm going a little bit further down I'm going all the way down now it's still okay it's not as watery but it's still very very loose man it is very loose alright let me try it again those are you all that know this stuff put it in the comments see if I'm doing it wrong what not but so far I'm just not feeling it I'm a I feel like I'm just dipping it I feel like this is like non and I'm you know dipping it in some in some Tiki masala sauce or something it's just that loose look I have to time it I have to time the drips this is not spreadable stuff this is just like very loose okay all right now look I know it's something y'all thinking a man back in the old days we used to put this on toast and put in the microwave and get it kind of loose and you know melted and stuff and that tastes really good that is true so I don't want to take the consistency away I don't want to take the the fact that it's you know really loose and very drippy and forget about the taste now the taste isn't bad now does it taste like this no it does not taste like this and you will definitely know the difference between the two but if you are you know if you're wanting to eat a little bit better and you know I will say it's a little bit better because all it has in there is peanuts and salt and this has got some other stuff in there that we don't really know about you know who knows what rapeseed is I do know that you know like the vegetable oil and stuff that's that's not good for you that's not that's probably GMO or something like that and that causes you know this to look like you know it does but it's not as good as just natural peanuts so if you are worried let's just say this if you are worried about those ingredients and you're just like you know what I just want to eat you you eat a ton of peanut butter and you know I don't know you want to you want an alternative you want an alternative to regular peanut butter let you say that this can be a good buy no go ahead and try it you know it's 292 it's not like it's you know sick bucks and you're just gonna you know break the bank just to try some natural peanut butter it's only three bucks so you could try it out if you like it then go for it you know the only problem I have with it really is that it's so loose it's so drippy it's not like regular peanut butter you got a you know I guess after a while when there's nothing left it's not dripping but when you got a lot of it on your knife or your spoon man you're gonna be you know having some trouble now I just thought about this now I do eat put peanut butter in my smoothies so I have a smoothie recipe that I have with tail bananas sometimes some pineapples and then I'll do some peanut butter and then I'll scoop a protein powder now in that case I can see where this might be better because it is loose and it doesn't the blender doesn't have to you know you know chug along on this thick you know the thick regular peanut butter it's already very loose it might blend invert a lot better dad I can see where you know the natural peanut butter might work a lot better but for me if you've got kids or you got whatever and they and they they like the you know this consistency of the Jif peanut butter and they like the taste better you may not be able to get them to switch over so it this is all you know subjective if you guys like the natural way and you don't mind it dripping everywhere and stuff like that and you just like the taste of you know natural peanuts and nothing else in there and you're very concerned about that then give it a shot it's only three bucks like I said so leave me some comments thank you so much for watching

episode of wheats the marijuana review show where we review edibles and help you make sense of your dispensary showing you which animals are worth your hard-earned dollars today we're looking at a new brand TK over edibles there are 200 milligram Bharani they proclaim it to be an award winner but don't tell us what award day one say award-winning best edible right there on the package no ingredients and no nutrition information very small brownie square tiny little thing very basic packaging so TKOs and they call it that because they sing it's going to knock me out but TV sends for technical so that is a very boring looking square ass browning smells like weed has a pretty high we'd smell or a pretty potent D weed smell I'm not optimistic to tell you the truth this nothing about the screams this is gonna be a good one it smells bad looks funky it's kind of hard but I'm willing to the doubt and it was affordable this was seven dollars at my dispensary for a what they say is a 200 milligram edibles so we shall see but let's give a taste no wait okay not good not good aroma yuck it's no koruba salted caramel or brownie but in this case guys looks we're not to see them it looks it tastes as bad as it looked there's a lot like weed there's a pretty great flavor very dry kind of stale taste in people it's not very big so yeah okay pepin back up here I have got to polish this off which is something I'm not looking forward to once I polish this bad boy off that's customary with our weeks many reviews I will come back to you guys in two hours and let you know how we're feeling and let's cross our fingers that work feeling pretty good because otherwise man I go in through some nasty food for no reason okay well with that I will see you guys in two hours and wish me luck I hope hope his ropes see you then hi guys I am back it has been 2 hours since I had the TK hoe edibles award-winner brownie and I gotta say it has been a pleasant surprise pleasant surprise it tasted pretty awful admittedly and while not quite a TKO it still packs a pretty good punch for a 200 milligram edible I'm pretty high right now I was not expecting this so maybe the awful taste was due to its onion advertised potency potent delicious every time is their catchphrase I can tell you at least one of those is true and at least one of those is false the third one I don't know so with that being said if you see a TKO edibles brownie in the dispensary near you it's affordable this cost me seven bucks and as long as you are not particular about taste as long as you are okay with the foul tasting edible give it a shot it's a potent edible for a fair price but if you're really really conscious about a flavor that's gonna be a hard pass so that's it for this review of weeks we will check you guys out on the next episode and thank you so much for watching", "M4N_txeOrm0": "hi I'm Shawna Williams with avian owls edibles we're an edibles line created from White Mountain health

would show you something new that I have found out there so this is fatso cocoa nut butter and this is fat so crunchy salted caramel nut butter okay so I found these guys on Amazon and I was really excited about them because their macros are awesome so we're talking for one tablespoon of this that you get 90 calories and 7 grams of fat 3 grams of protein and only one nut carb okay so that is pretty amazing with that if you are diehard strict strict keto they do contain some tapioca fiber and so that might not be your favorite thing that I was excited to see the flax seeds I was excited to see that they do contain MCT oil which we know it's great for the keto diet and that they taste delicious so I thought I would show you the consistency of them and while I'm putting them on my chocolate so let me scoot you down here for a second all right we're there yeah so chop oh right we all love a topple so this actually this one just came today or the other day and so it has not been living in the refrigerator it does relate to refrigerate these after opening and I will show you why okay it is really really liquidy especially at the top so it does require some sort of stirring to it okay so you can see it's woo thicker at the bottom but I am I'm gonna do that for you going to just top my chocolate some of that okay yeah that's gonna be a big old mess all over my counter in a second but that's one I have open and left in the refrigerator for a little bit of time and you will see that it is much more solid and that this peanut butter one is much more chunky okay so this one if you are a chunky peanut butter fan I would highly suggest the crunchy salted caramels so easy as that and now those are going to fit directly into my macros because my chuckle is only when that carb and even for one tablespoon of that that's also going to be just one net carb so we'd love to hear you have tried the fatso nut butters before and if you have let me know and I'll just be over here munching on my lunch talk to you later bye", "wiNg6_-llbw": "hello everybody this is dr. Bob DeMaria with another episode of ask dr. Bob some very good questions as always and we do appreciate your questions I'm 45 and at hysterectomy two years ago because I had an enlarged uterus for c-sections you mentioned that they left your ovaries and you wanted to know what to do about any kind of hormone replacement therapy you've been told to use progesterone you were told not to use progesterone this is my thought when it comes to hysterectomies and what do you do afterwards your goal is to support adrenal gland function and all the other hormonal or endocrine glands in your body like your thyroid for sure I'd support the ovaries you may consider having a thyroid panel done you want to see how your thyroid is doing you may consider having a urine iodine loading test done to see how much iodine you have in your body because your ovaries need iodine your breasts need iodine you want to make sure your liver is functioning optimally we rarely use progesterone or any other kind of external hormonal cream including estrogen that's a very good question dr. Bob why do I take for eczema in my ears and when you were going through it you saw a black currant on my website thank you for going to the website and you mentioned something about being post partl I believe that you are still nursing a one-year-old this is what I'm thinking for you you may consider as all of you would have had children or babies to consider the biomega test or the Omega test that we have on our website you want to see what kind of oil you have in your body we have had great success using black currant seed oil with eczema but you may have other issues like liver could be compromised from having the baby and you might not have enough oil in your body postpartum depression is also common after having a baby very good question I also know that sometimes you could have a food sensitivity that's one of the reasons that we also encourage the fit test so hundred and thirty foods so you might be watching your oils really good but have a sensitivity to wheat or eggs or I'm not sure if you're consuming those foods you could have some irritation dr. Bob what would you suggest for someone who has diverticulitis you're a 68 year old old female I would definitely make sure you don't have parasites in your body you can do that through a CBC with the differential and if your eosinophils are elevated or if you're using a fill count as elevated that may suggest parasites if your monocytes are elevated you could have a food sensitivity you also may consider the fit test to make sure you don't have a food sensitivity obviously someone along the line you got inflammation your colon and it could have been from not eating enough of green food so you're gonna want to go slow there's a lot of different opinions should you eat seeds or not eat seeds you want to make sure that your body is not inflamed you want to make sure you have enough oil in your body so you don't have inflammation in your gut a lot of times with the optic mint optic in profile will see a little carbon dioxide which may suggest l-glutamine which we use for gut health you may consider a personal consultation with me and possibly even a nutritional microscopy to rule out parasites I suffer from constipation I take flaxseed but it doesn't always help I drink a lot of water exercise daily there's there something else I should do I would have your thyroid checked probably all most common causes for constipation is a sub part thyroid plus make sure drinking enough water and make sure eating enough greens greens are important that green juice not smoothies real greens romain broccoli cabbage cauliflower dr. Bob could fibromyalgia in some cases because from Candida you know it's always a possibility but most fibromyalgia from my experience is adrenal gland exhaustion we also use a product called Li xym for type which is a plant-based lithium last question good question dr. Bob what do you think about foot baths it's kind of interesting we used to utilize that in our practice several years ago and we've had great success with that I've had people have skin rashes go away joint pain go away some people have an overall sense of well-being it just depends what you're using it for it's not it's not a wrong thing I like to have everybody try something but it makes a difference in their body great questions on dr.

great fat burner so I'll take these every single morning religiously and I'm gonna do my faster car but I get it back my first meal will consist of Assad meals they actually fell on me deliver to me which is great for people who want to move like I'm always a move behind this is to tighten something for me - meal prep so for them to send me my meals are prepared but back to this is I have one cup of oatmeal plain and then I have egg whites it's six ounces of egg whites so this one's probably not yeah so that's my first meal after that I usually try riding a couple of hours outside you might pre-workout meal and go training yeah so which would consist of six ounces chicken a cup of rice or the rest of the meal is not paying attention I'm just giving you a little snippet of it you want to find out every little detail I mean go check out the 30 Day Shred which is cheap and also I'm actually as I'm getting older I've become very conscious of what I put in my body as we get older our body changes so it is great looking great on the outside but how is your heart health how's your liver you know these are things we don't think about when you're like 10 to 15 years later boom it's it so I

skipped the beat the oxygen probably got there taking this is nectar and this is mental Mitchell food is for helping you accomplish to the function another product works when you start taking this nectar it's another product probably beautiful heart liver and kidney health another product I'm taking is tumor I started off with this product this is I think about the world the main ingredient is perfectly which is actually our blush so from that I switched over to Rosie this is super tumor which absorbs it to the blooming rapidly I take it for arthritis and illness and anti-inflammatories great so this is a great product man other benefits too my main purpose of taking it was for the actual inflammation all right I'm gonna give you guys one more little trick I do so when you're eating

anything you [Music]", "f4ZMupHvXnU": "I've used you note ii/3 cleanse DNP I've tried ever the thing that I found the mole in the pharmacology realm so guys they're more pleased 22 start calling today we're gonna be talking about my top fat loss tips as well as talking about some of this stuff I've done in the past for fat loss and you know my overarching opinions on it as well as you know kind of some overviews of Pharmacology but mainly the tail end of this video or the bulk of it is going to be some tips that I'm nearly positive at least some of these you're not going to have heard on other channels and are going to be unique things that you might want to delve into further yourself that's gonna help with mostly with adherence to your diet which is the number one killer of people not getting a lean pretty much so the first thing I'm gonna touch on before I get into it like when I first started bodybuilding I did the same thing you know the same mistakes that many of you guys have probably done before just you know did the dirty bulk thing and you know I just like thought more food equals more muscle so I just got fat as [ __ ] and I went up as high as I think at my highest I was like 255 260 or something and it was like one of my first bulk so I was just fat as hell and then in my subsequent cut I had to lose like almost I think it was like 70 to 80 pounds or something to get the single digit like fat percentage again so it was just like disgusting unhealthy not recommended but anyways the things that I incorporated to get shredded in the past like even much leaner than I am now stuff that I used to do when I used to prepare for you know bodybuilding shows and stuff and just for you know my own personal recreational torturing myself to get as lean as [ __ ] possible some of the stuff I did so the first thing I kind of want to just like glance over quick is some of the pharmacology because I know I'm gonna get questions about this is I've used you know t3 Cleanse E&P I've tried everything the thing that I found the most effective in the pharmacology realm of like fat burning you know fat burners necessarily not necessarily something that burns fat directly but something that's going to enhance my fat loss in some capacity is something that crushes my appetite so stimulants is something I used to leverage quite heavily I'd never use anything as hardcore as like phentermine or adderall or anything like that even though those are super effective purportedly but I used to use stuff like the ECA stack the federal caffeine aspirin stack I used to use heavy-duty stems over-the-counter stuff nowadays when I want to suppress my appetite I just use guerilla mine rush and I find that actually works better than the ECA stack at the tail end of some of my cuts when I would get into the single digits I would need to incorporate melanotan too as well now what you might be thinking why would you need to use a injectable peptide that makes you tend to get cut and it's not you know for some crazy fat-burning effect even though it may you know enhance insulin sensitivity there's some interesting data on that if that it [ __ ] destroys your appetite it actually makes you kind of nauseous but when you're super super hungry the nauseousness almost balances out the extreme hunger and just leaves you in the middle and you're just like not hungry so that was something I keep Steves - I don't necessarily recommend it I also tried meridia - which is like a prescription medication that's been discontinued for appetite suppression and I didn't find much from that anyways as far as anything else DNP I didn't like it I'm cranked my appetite through the roof and I found a counterproductive to be honest and it's just like you know wrecked my workouts and just you know made me feel and look like [ __ ] Clint worked really well for me t3 I used to abuse t3 like an idiot and it you know I definitely stripped some muscle off my frame even on anabolics if you overdo t3 you're gonna lose muscle um it's very very catabolic but something that I do think should be you know highlighted is that a lot of people during prep I don't necessarily think that t3 is you know a mandatory thing but if you're like getting into a deep deep cut and you're severely depriving yourself of not just you know micronutrients as you get into a deeper deficit you're also you know depriving so many macronutrients that your body can't even function you know correctly and can't even facilitate proper thyroid hormone production whatnot and you're stressing out and cranking her TSH up and stressing up your thyroid to get you know even mediocre function it may be prudent to perhaps incorporate t3 to take stress off of it like a similar you know mechanism to how you would think about using insulin to like relieve the beta cells and the pancreas and Bloods do not you know insulin resistance a lot kind of stuff a sort of similar thing and my opinion should be you know explored further when it comes to thyroid usage in even just like a replacement amount or like a high normal you know like physiologic high normal amount during a cutting phase for those who are going like into a really aggressive or a very long drawn-out cut that's something you might want to work with with the rocker but anyways anything else injectable l-carnitine yoga in barn engage seems to work well in a fasted state prior to cardio prior to cardio being very important actually prior to fasted cardio being very important with these three in particular but other than that that's just some of the pharmacology stuff that you know I know people are gonna ask about and want to know about as far as fat loss goes and those are things that I felt were worth touching on but anyways some of the diet practices now and sort of like hacks for sticking to your diet this is the biggest weakness everyone asked so how can you get lean as hell without cheating on your diet so first off I want to make clear this is not necessarily healthy recommendations this is not about once you start getting steep until you know 500 plus calorie deficit it's no longer about hitting your micronutrient needs adequately like if you could that's great what some of those foods simply just aren't satiating unfortunately and on top of that you're gonna have to start incorporating things that otherwise are not necessarily you know the healthiest thing to use you know a lot of Xero kept kind of like zero calorie artificial sugar type stuff or you know things that may not even be food at all but anyways that's what we're gonna be gonna insist so just be clear because I have a lot of you know health and longevity related content to and this is not indicative of a daily diet practice I would is strictly for aggressive cutting so the first thing getting rid of all your post workout shakes I don't know why people still do this in their cutting phases they still have liquid calories and it's like the least satiating thing you can have replace all your liquid calories with actual food and ideally something that takes you or I'll get into the density of the foods and whatnot later but anyway it's the first thing you should do is get rid of all the liquid calories in your diet and replace it with actual chewable food ideally the next thing carbonated drinks so you know it's sparkling water or something that you know can help sort of like artificially promote satiety feeling in your stomach something else to zba if you've ever had it's like kind of like calorie free diet plot basically but it's stevia flavored instead of aspartame and sucralose and honestly even if you have Diet pop if it has aspartame sucralose if that's what you need to stick to your diet I'm you kind of just gonna weigh out the you know health whatever like reward on that because at the end of the day it's not like there's conclusive evidence that proves that having one can or whatever a day for a span of 16 weeks is gonna like ruin your life so it's getting up to you but anyways that is a very effective thing is incorporating diet pop as well black coffee is also a very tried-and-true method for suppressing your appetite and most people screw this up by adding you know what sugar MCT oil they're like keto bomb things or whatever and adding a bunch of extra calories to it thinking that it's still you know like diet friendly when in reality you should just be adding like stevia to it for you know sweetening and then after that like that's you know there's stuff you can add on top of that or zero calorie too but I mean one of the biggest mistakes I see is guys who think they're using you know uh you know like nearly zero calorie coffee and they're you know writing it down in there you know macro calculations at zero when in reality they're adding a bunch of unnecessary extra [ __ ] into it and stevia if you haven't tried it you know it tastes like real sugar pretty much zero calories it's not gonna crank your insulin through the roof it is a you know pretty good alternative next thing is sugar-free jell-o so this is probably one of the most overlooks diet hacks in my opinion it is it tastes you know super sugary tastes like you know a good dessert you can also get the the actual like fruit flavors or way lower calorie it's like ten calories for serving you can make an entire blocks of this stuff that makes a giant bowl for like 50 calories or something and up to double check what it is exactly but it's very very low and then you could get you know like there's like the chocolate pudding versions which are more calories obviously but they're still you know pretty light considering how much you can actually either this stuff and it tastes really damn good when I get really deep into a cut sometimes I'd have like a full bowl this stuff every single day just because it's it's very satiating and it gives you that you know that sugar hit that you sort of feel like you need even without actually getting it because it is just artificial sweeteners in this thing at the end of the day and you know like - so here it is two full packages are only 80 calories so that's a ton and like you'd be shocked if you saw this stuff you'd be like this is 80 calories it's nuts and it is a very good diet hack for adherence at least makes thinking to a diet way easier next thing is you know exact a Lurie sauces dressing syrups condiments spreads and dips there's a lot of stuff you can go into with this or you know like pancakes syrups that you can make you know like protein pancakes and put pancake syrup on it there's a salad dressing some of the salad dressings or way to calorie dense and people don't count them into their macros I ends up they end up like gaining fat they don't realize that they're Caesar dressing is super [ __ ] fat dense and they just think oh I'm having a giant salad and that's what my coach told me to do it's like Brett they don't put the Caesar dressing on it with the croutons like you got to use either a low-calorie dressing or just eat it with you know something that is more conducive to hitting your macros one of the biggest mistakes with the salads is people that just like they think that they're eating a salad they're sticking to the diet but in reality it's like a [ __ ] 700 calorie thing that might as well have a two cheeseburger instead I already mentioned the diet soda another thing sugar-free gum so this is a good way to it's like five calories per piece keeps your mouth busy and also promotes satiety in the body and can help prevent you from getting as hungry I don't know if a lot of people know that or not but it's I don't hear talked about very often is the chewing effect kind of like the signals that sends your brain in terms of satiety and it also gives you a bit of that you know appeasing your sugar craving next thing is so I already talked about the salads too the main thing is have like a giant salad but don't you know put in the garbage in it like just be aware of if you're going to put in that [ __ ] just you have to be very meticulous about calculating because a lot of people don't way of dressing they can just like pour it on an eyeball it but I can almost guarantee you you're off so if you're going to use a dressing you low calorie one or actually weigh the bottle on the scale pour it on the thing and then weigh the bottle and find the difference and make sure you're actually sticking to your macro allotments or put the salad on the scale and then add the dressing it's another way to I'm probably smarter way to measure it now I'm thinking about it and make sure you're staying within your macro allotments cuz a lot of people they just either way too much or they shouldn't even be using it at all because it's you could be filling those calories up with something far more satiating than that another thing pb2 peanut butter so this is something that I used to add into my oats to make them not taste like ass and they're pretty damn good honestly so this is basically like 85% less fat the normal peanut butter PB to peanut butter is an all-natural powdered peanut butter product deriving from peanuts and our slow-roasted then for us to remove the fat and oil basically this stuff is like the diet friendly version of peanut butter and some people like to be honest I'm not like a huge peanut butter like fiend like some I don't know what what's with chicks and peanut butter it's like the number one thing they want when they're dying for some reason but anyways it's good don't get me wrong when you use it in this in this form you can use two tablespoons of it is only 45 calories and it's 5 grams of protein there's like no fat so it's kind of like you can add it into protein shakes to make them taste really good you can add it into your oatmeal you could put it into protein pancakes you can put it into french toast I guess if you wanted to you could put it into pretty much anything that is makes sense to put it into I don't know but it's [ __ ] good to be on and it's not something I would eat year-round but for an aggressive dieting phase you know it's very good to add flavor to your meals that you would otherwise would be impossible to get because normally you'd have peanut butter you'd have 1 tablespoon was like you know 2 to 3 times the calories of this so the next thing this is one of the most overlooked hacks in my opinion that no one seems to talk about shirataki noodles so these look and taste well I don't know if they taste exactly the same as past the noodles but they're close enough if you're an aggressive deficit so they aren't carb dense whatsoever and they have no calories whatsoever pretty much so the fact the brand I use has zero calories in an entire package this stuff is a fantastic dieting tool in my opinion because you can cook two whole packages of this stuff and have a giant you know a chicken and noodle bowl and it it can you know it's only like 250 calories it's just it's just the chicken that you can't towards it and whatever sauce you put on it so you can have like a giant bowl like [ __ ] as big as you want and you just have to count the chicken breasts in the sauce basically like the noodles are almost nothing but they still fill you up and they are like to be honest if you if you're at like maintenance or in a surplus and you eat these noodles you'd be like this is [ __ ] like I don't there's no way I'd eat this but when you're in a deficit stuff that normally you think is not that appetizing is like insanely good so if you can get this stuff fill up a big bowl of it cut up some chicken breasts in it put in some sort of you know with low calorie sauce if whether it's like Frank's right a hot you want to mix in some muster whether you want to put in an artificially sweetened you know like barbecue sauce or a you know some sort of like low-calorie pasta sauce or something like it's [ __ ] good and you're gonna thank me when you try this one thing I used to use is this stuff called a seal sama sugar-free teriyaki sauce and I'd put it in these off shirataki noodles with chicken breast and it's unreal I'd make like teriyaki chicken bowl also the sugar free guys BBQ sauce it's only five calories 1 gram one gram carb zero grams sugar per tablespoon and the main issue I found with like low-calorie barbecue sauces they were always too thin and they run like water but this stuff is thick it's like almost identical to a normal barbecue sauce and it tastes very very good it tastes nearly identical to a super calorie dense one with tons of sugar in it and this stuff can be a game-changer for putting on your meat that's yeah so anyway it's really good trust me and the shirataki teriyaki sauce or knob the seal sama teriyaki sauce is unreal - another think huge protein ice cream blender containers so like you have a you know like whatever blender you have doesn't matter if you can make protein ice cream you can make a very low calorie on satiating dessert basically and you know that's a good opportunity to put in the PB to peanut butter in it - you could put in you know some chocolate protein you can even put in some of that powder jello stuff if you can end up getting like a chocolate flavor or something you put in the PB - you mix it up boom you have like the most ridiculous giant you know just put as much icing in as you need and you make the most nutty you know good tasting whey protein you know giant ice cream dish and it's like you know a couple hundred calories max just don't burn your blender out like I did because I've actually done that before where my Vitamix I literally overheat it because it's trying to make too thick of ice cream so vitamin C is probably not a good bet if you're going to be in the market for a new blender cuz they overheat super easily with protein ice cream which you would think not because it's such a highly touted machine that cost a lot of money and I was kind of annoyed when it burned out on me also low fat popcorn so the 94 percent fat free one or whatever that one's pretty good too also another tip as far as not necessarily the food carbohydrate timing so one thing that used to completely ruined my chances of sticking to my diet was if I first of all if I ate too early in general that was like something that could really screw me over because once I spiked my insulin up it's like opening the floodgate the floodgates and then I just want to keep eating if I can just not eat for like the first eight hours I'm awake that gives me an eight-hour window to fill up with all my calories and then I sleep for eight hours so it's kind of like a 16-8 intermittent fasting split which I feel like is very good once you start to get into a steeper deficit it's very hard to spread your meals out equally I find it's just easier to sit here to my you know like a severely calorie deprived diet model in a more condensed eating window I guess and then because once I start eating like I said my insulin spikes up and then I'm just I'm just going I can't stop but before that point I can really hold it off with some of the stuff I mentioned earlier like the the sugar-free the gum the you know the diet pop the stimulants the blah blah so the Bolanos had all that kind of stuff but yeah the not having carbs in your first meal too if you're going to do the intermittent fasting thing or even if you're not the first meal having carbohydrates like I said when you spike your insulin up that is when like I'm sure you've probably noticed if you've done keto diets versus carb dense diets in a deficit when you have the carbs it's typically when it's going to spike your appetite more and it's when you keep your blood sugar stable that it's a lot easier to adhere to your diet and not go you know ravage your pantry and like fall off your diet completely so typically I would allocate your carbohydrate consumption around your workout window or just later as late in the day as you can simply because once you eat that first carbohydrate dense meal the floodgates are open at least for me they are so I kind of try to hold it off for as long as possible and to me this was super super helpful in sticking to my diet if you have really bad cravings to a keto diet might be worth trying just because like if he can't stick to your calorie allotment with carbs in your diet like your blood sugar very very stable with keto is something that some people just need to adhere to their diet like whether it's optimal or not for performance and whatever it doesn't really matter if you're not sticking to the diet you know what I mean at the end of the day you have to hit your calorie allotment so next thing high-protein diet so you know some people they want to argue about how much protein you need up one gram per pound is too much or it's too little one point five is overkill aboah bla a date of the day protein I find the most satiating of all of the macronutrients reason being fat everyone says it's so satiating but it's so calorie dense a guy would use to have you know a meal that was like perfectly ratioed between like protein bit of carbs and then fats and I'd have like I'd have like 10 almonds and it would be like the equivalent of a few ounces of meat that I could have had otherwise that I finished in two seconds it just wasn't satiating at all so to me fats is like if you're in a keto diet obviously it can be you know leveraged way more because your stable blood sugar wise but when you're in a carb diet and you're deprived of calories to me fats is very difficult to gets a shitty from at least in my experience so I would typically push the protein higher not necessarily because I think it is critical for muscle preservation more so because I think it is more useful for sticking to the diet in carbohydrates I try to limit more so for the reason of the insulin like I said when you spike it up it starts to create these cravings that you may otherwise be able to avoid if you just ratio doubt your macronutrient Kapoor proportions a bit differently on top of that satiating proteins swapping out red meat for white meat slowly but still hitting your macros so let's just say your diet your bulk you have you know a few meals of you know six ounces of extra lean ground beef or something like one of the easiest things you can do to start to cut down on your calorie intake is just switch out the red for white meat like just from that you're gonna be eating the same amount of food visually and you know texturally I don't know like the way your stomach recognizes it in terms of the amount but it's way less calorie dense so you're eating the same mount you know perspective wise but in reality there's way less fat in it and way less calories so it is more satiating in that you're not basically having to deprive yourself of quantity as much it's kind of hard to explain it but basically it's like you're eating the same amount but it's way less calories so you're eating less calorie dense options it's just a very easy way to kind of reduce your calorie intake without actually having to start pulling out like quantities of food so that is one thing as well as if you're not gonna switch out for white alley switch for higher quality cuts of red and get leaner cuts like switching for ground bison versus regular ground beef the difference in just the quality of meat to but also the calorie amount per ounce it's pretty significant also another thing I don't really do but is actually useful for some people is getting meat that is harder to chew so if you have a steak versus ground beef obviously you're gonna chew the steak longer which not only causes your body to release more hydrochloric acid and actually digest it more properly and absorb the nutrients that promotes a shitty but it gives your body a chance to trick itself into being satiated quicker so by that basically I'm sure you've probably heard of before where it takes your body a certain amount of time before I can send the signals to the brain saying it's full if you eat something that's very very easy to chew you're giving your BC a like going over that feedback system quicker than you may otherwise want to because if you can get that system to kick in faster before you've ate as much you're going to get to a point where you feel full with less food do you know what I mean so typically if you can find something that's chewier you're going to get those signals sent to your brain before you accidentally overeat you don't want to over eat past the point where you could have otherwise felt satiated already if you just had a you know better choice of meat essentially also ensure proper gut health and stomach acidity so this is something that goes overlooked by most people especially those with autoimmune issues and gut health issues this is a very critical component that not only is going to massively impact if you even absorb micronutrients to begin with but also that your body is satiated because you're actually absorbing what you're trying to digest so rather than have something just like sitting in your stomach or causing a backlog of bacteria or causing autoimmune issues from undigested proteins that are sitting there and causing fermenting and whatnot you want to get enough hydrochloric acid in there and you want to ensure you have high enough stomach acidity to actually break down what you're eating and make sure it gets processed correctly and assimilated in the body into all these target tissues and you get your micronutrients and not just get them into your stomach but they actually get absorbed because this is going to make a big difference on not only performance in fat loss but just you know how you feel as well after the meal if you feel good or you feel bad you feel satiated you don't feel satiated another thing so swapping out very obvious like high calorie dense things for low calorie dense things so things like milk you know switching that out for an almond milk or something like that those are just really you know easy things to knock off the list kind of thing like as you go through the first most obvious way to cut down on calories is just look at what you're eating and then try and find something that is the same quantity you know originally like perspective wise it's the same amount of food but it is less calorie dense so you know that could be like I mentioned the red meat thank finding higher quality leaner cuts or switching to white when needed stuff like that another thing having more volume in your meals and more fiber dense meals is going to promote satiety as well it's pretty obvious most people know that but it's worth mentioning nonetheless hydrating your calories slowly and incrementally increasing your energy expenditure something I see as one of the biggest mistakes of cutting is guys who cut their calories way to aggressively off the bat and then they essentially encourage metabolic adaptations far quicker than they would have otherwise had occurred should they have cut slower now I'm not saying if you have some sort of like deadline you shouldn't cut aggressively but what I am saying is that typically I always had been a result when I reduce my calories slowly and increase my calorie energy expenditure slowly - rather than just crash dieting and this would keep my more muscle on my frame prevent me from having to go as deep into a deficit to achieve the same body composition I was trying to chase all that kind of stuff like the people who cut to you know a 2,000 calories off the bat they lose fat crazy quick for the first few weeks but once a plateau where do you go from there you're gonna go to girl levels of you know calories like you know a 220-pound guy eating like 1800 like no you're not at that point you just [ __ ] yourself so don't do that because that's one of the biggest mistakes I see another thing this is the last thing 10 minute walks so this is somebody I got from Stan efforting it helps for digestion and insulin sensitivity more steps are correlated with increased longevity and best body composition are always from those who have good energy expenditure I'm sure you are you know this but you don't have to revolve your life around cardio which is you know first of all adhering to cardio is something that can be difficult so if you can do just like something a little here and there maybe it's a bit easier for you for me I find the 10-minute walks more enjoyable and funner and just a lot easier then the you know like 45 minute blocks of cardio instead and so they actually just study on this blood sugar levels were measured with fasting blood samples blood glucose meters and continuous glucose monitors the researchers found that when participants walked for 10 minutes after each meal their blood sugar levels were an average of 12% lower than when they took a single 30-minute walk each day so instead of doing an allocated 30 minute block once a day doing a 10 minute walk after each meal kept blood sugar levels are much lower and it has a net positive effect on your body composition as well as I feel it just helps digestion quite a bit after you have a giant meal the last thing you want to do just you know sit there and let it you know ferment and [ __ ] like the ideally you want to do some sort of process that facilitates nutrient partitioning and I feel like the 10-minute walk really helped accomplish that and it helps blood glucose control which at the end of the day not only is something that is optimal for longevity but it is also something that helps encourage fat loss and just proper digestion processes in general so anyways those are all my tips so hope you guys enjoyed that and found some of them useful and insightful and applicable to whatever you're doing so thank you guys for watching please like subscribe check out my blog more place where they'd saw Colin

for watching talk to you soon", "suKRTPKPwi8": "today we are testing some peanut butter okay so I'm sure a lot of you guys know how much I love peanut butter what did you what do you mean what did I use that for don't tell me you eat peanut butter is getting kind of feels weird in it no it's getting feel good man peanut butter is literally fantastic usually I just grabbed whatever peanut butter is right there but today once and for all we are going to figure out which peanut butter is the best peanut butter okay I don't know why them [ __ ] it asked me so goddamn cold in Colorado but I cannot wait till I move it is literally 144 p.m. and it is 24 degrees why is it so cold we've officially arrived at this [ __ ] [Music] we have officially acquired the peanut butter the bag broke but I got peanut butter we have peanut butter and lots of it we have jiff H extra crunchy we have Skippy creamy we have creamy great value we have jiff creamy we have great value crunchy we have Skippy super chunk and then we have Jeff normal crunchy so that makes for a total of seven jars of peanut butter okay we're gonna start out with crunchy and then we're gonna go to creamy after that crunchy stay creamy I'm excited about the super truck sounds super chunky oh that's a good question I hold is jewel-like Oh welcome my brother he is hey so we're gonna try them and write them in a scale of one to ten great values though honestly from at least a nine it's so good yeah but I feel like the Superchunk be better solid eight I have to leave room for some other ones at least try to finish your body now Jeff crunchy which as you know the crunchiest thing of all times it's not even focusing what is you're wrong you're literally crying let's look at me you're literally crying coming are you sure this is kind of a deer's after the first bite of peanut butter I just want should I try the crunchy thing because literally the crunchiest thing you will ever use mmm you actually like it mm-hmm okay I disagree I disagree you can't have too much crunch and that one too much crunch maybe a little maybe a little too much so I okay I'm gonna give this one like a six or a seven and this one's an eight no no this one's at a great value is that a nine this one's at a six or a seven the German I write them both eight cuz this one is better peanut butter this one's better crunch so they're around the same they both have flaws they both are better so this one's actually less crunchy this the extra crunchy chip is crunchy er than the normal punchy the actual nuts are extra crunchy another good boy this is less nuts but the nuts are more country yeah this one's a solid nine I'm gonna drop the great value country down to a seven and put this one in line okay so this one was what from you I nine a nine I think this one was a nine great value was a seven and then the Jeff one was like a three peanut butter connoisseur over there you thinking what are you gonna that is some points mmm none actually really good also why are you moaning how's it really good no peanut butter is exquisite the crunch is immaculate those were my vocab guess that means an order of best to worst it goes he's like like like that okay so what extra crunchy was good right yeah no we're not stacking them and then that guy right there no we're not why are you making they used to be you're just eating the Superchunk yeah um I have to get some others myself really good would recommend Skippy super truck and now we move on to smooth no you literally just put your whole mouth on it so this build you ain't gap slated eat you guys lay the entire top of this with this man you're our preemies I can't agree with this I can't agree with this I think the chip is probably gonna be the worst then great value then skipping what are you Joey I had a lot I add a lot to all of your videos not your friend hey what do you want to use this one so far what do you what do you think an eight okay give this big creamy their trunk ease their country is garbage absolute garbage not even in it's just bad not great value creamy I really did like cause an earthquake and he did my third helmet does you pull the Japan and what stays the same honestly this one I get stuck on my throat so I like it better they taste the exact same they're pretty much the same looking if you took off the labels you would barely be able to tell which is which with creamy peanut butter it's like all the same I think the main difference those the great values of like half the price but it tastes the exact Sam also the great value is more less sticky no no the great value is like half the price for these I think it's honestly better let's open this bad boy if I have too much more peanut butter it's one of my teachers you gonna stuff up if you throw up on my desk I'm gonna be so mad I'm gonna have this peanut butter in my mouth two years now what do you have this one for raining you must died eating it so honestly these are better yeah I feel like the other day skipping in last then Jeff then great value Oh less sugar less sugar but less carbs more carbs then so different it also unique with steak no you're not taking pretty funny oh yeah I forgot you spend it all on peanut butter ya gotta rate every one of them but the creamy ones in order and then we'll decide where the crunchy ones go in between them so hey it's just super chunk was the best and then it goes Jim crunchy just so there would be that one that one okay this is my order and then really the crunchy oh we know oh I put this one at the end yeah I was gonna say the worst fixed order I'll put the links I'll put some Amazon affiliate links in the description below buy them if you want to support the channel I don't know what I'm trying to accomplish but something feels off and I feel like if I'm playing more you look back all my twitch [Music]", "mnr3f1UZuMU": "[Music] hi welcome to diamond delight animals my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and for the rest of you guys thank you so much and welcome back so I've I've been asked about chocolate in the past and I have never been able to successfully get it to set at room temperature using cannabutter then the other day when I was doing the truffle demonstration I was using the shortening to thin out our chocolate for decorating it dawned on me that shortening sets at room temperature in chocolate will stay set at room temperature so I made up a an infusion with shortening instead of butter and I do it just like the small infusion like all other ones I'll run a quick little thing for you here on it but if you want more detail on it you can check out the small infusion video so yeah so I get a small infusion of shortening and yeah I'll show you how much better that works and the reason being is butter has a melting point of fancy it's between 85 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit so basically a little room temperature a little bit warm it's going your chocolate is going to melt or sorry your butter is going to melt however shortenings melting point is 95 to 115 degrees fahrenheit so it's got a lot more stability so you know that if you've got shortening butter on the counter you notice you're shortening nice and solid where your butter might be a melted mess on all that hot day and and that's the reason is because of the higher melting point so I think that into our chocolate does not affect our chocolate and it allows it to stay set at room temperature now I'm doing this demonstration with candy melts if you want to do it with real chocolate that's not a problem but you will have to temper it I hate tempering chocolate one of these days I will do a video on how to do it exactly personally I hate it the candy melts taste great and they just work so easily so I'm going to show you that demonstration with it and so check this out so M here's our chocolate he's nice and snap and you can see it's not all melting and the squishy let's see if you can hear it hoping that came through on the micro on the thing and then for our peanut butter cups any time I am a peanut butter cups in the past all the recipes that I have I have looked up add anywhere between two to six cups of powdered sugar and I'm like that is disgusting one time I made it and it is it's so sweet all you get is sugar and with a hint of peanut butter and it still doesn't stay set at room temperature it still kind of oozes out and it just it's just not a proper peanut butter cup so off I go and do my research and stuff look up the actual ingredients in a rescreened a butter cup Wow I can make certain things work for us and I've managed to come up with this come up with this for us so check this out it's a peanut butter cup that I did a little earlier look at that Center there's no using or squishing out looks just like a peanut butter cups and they spin chocolate layers yeah that's alright I'm going to show you guys how to do this alright now with regards to doing this recipe it's really good because you have full control over how much sugar you want to use you can use just a little bit or a lot of the powdered sugar because we're going to use all-natural peanut butter and so this is great for people who are diabetic now if you can't use sugar what you can do is increase the tapioca search that we use and in a honey or maple syrup or I got I got syrup as your sweetener and yeah you can eliminate sugar as well that's because we're adding in our salt if you're on a salt reduced diet you can either eliminate it altogether or as little or as much as you like so this is really good for anybody who is restricted with diet as well as if you're a diabetic you can use the dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate use dark chocolate alright guys so let's jump into those ingredients of what we need to get started let's make some chocolate that material D car being in a smaller mason jar at two forty four forty minutes and then I've just got my shortening I've used one cup of shortening mine's yellow because I've used the butter flavor so I'm gonna be using the my shortening in place of butter for a lot of things so I decided to go with the butter flavor and a pot of water now you need the pot large enough deep enough but it is going to be able to cover your oil or your shortening once it's melted with the herb in it it's very important that your oil is always covered by water so I'm just gonna place this in here into the water and I'm gonna let that melt up just gonna boil that up and let that melt down while my herb is d carving and then we gotta cool it cool the deeds cool our herb yeah you can always use a French press instead of a mason jar it's nice because it already has the built in the screen for for helping when you have to now you can also use a French press for this I usually use the French press however I thought more people have a mason jar so I just go the mason jar method today alright so I have just added my plant material to my shortening and I've just given it a mix up there and they still mix up I'm gonna place there in the water and like I said the one thing is very important is that your water is above your shortening line you never want it to go below and the reason is is if you do your shortening is going to get hotter than what we want it to but keeping the water on the outside and completely surrounded maintains a constant temperature for what's inside if you allow that to go below your shortening will actually heat up a lot a lot higher and look and can burn your plant material which we don't want so I said I'm gonna let that go for two hours every once in a while I'm gonna come by and give her a shake up and if you're wondering I was using shake that's why I don't have any larger pieces in there and that's it and we're just gonna let I said go for two hours okay so you just want to have it on the mild simmer like that just where there's little tiny bubbles on the bottom of the pot but it is not boiling or vigorously boiling so what I said keep that temperature down a little bit patient is done put in and make sure that you strain it really well with a fine fine mesh strainer a cheesecloth or you can get one of these hold on you can get one of these bags from magical butter and it has the superfine it catches all the really fine sediment far as I said cheesecloth and that will work as well you put it into your stand mixer or if you're gonna use a hand mixer you're gonna be standing there for about 20 minutes we're gonna set this to low and we're gonna let this go for about 20 minutes as I said now if you used regular shortening yours is gonna be a lot lighter a very light light green and because I used the butter one is very yellow so mines it's gonna probably be darker than yours if you didn't use the butter but yeah just pour it into a container it will solidify and you can use it just like butter in most of your recipes all right so for our peanut butter cups what we're gonna need is about a hundred and fifty grams we're gonna make six large ones so we're gonna need about 150 grams of Hershey's chocolate if you want them to taste as close to the Rees peanut butter cup you want to use the Hershey's chocolate if you don't really care that much any milk chocolate will work and essentially what about 150 grams and for candidates about three of the small bars probably I think in the States it's like two or you can just use one large one in and around oh we got chocolate in my peanut butter oh all right we are going to need 1/2 a cup of peanut butter - the bar wrapper you're going to want an additional about quarter cup to a half cup we are going to want 1 cup of powdered or icing sugar a tablespoon of either can of butter or can of shortening now the shortening is going to give you a more solid product especially at room temperature because butter melts at a lower room temperature that'll be a little bit softer at room if you use the shortening they're going to stay firmer you're going to want a tablespoon of tapioca starch 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and about a teaspoon of milk doesn't matter what kind of milk and that's for our peanut butter cups for our chocolate bars you're gonna want either if you do not want to temper your chocolate then use the chocolate candy melts they taste great they work amazing they're pretty much idiot-proof if you do want to use real chocolate and you're experienced and you know how to temper go right ahead I've done tempering a few times I hate tempering so I'm going with the candy melts and you absolutely want to use the can of shortening not butter and as I said because you're shortening has a melting point of 95 to 115 so you are chocolates are going to stay set at room temperature that's all we need for the chocolate side so let's jump into our equipment and what we need and then we'll get this some of this stuff made up here all right so what we're going to need for our peanut butter cups are some cupcake liners either medium or large I've got the large here a cupcake pan to put these into to warm up gonna need pair of scissors and spatulas a bowl offset spatula and a spoon and your mixer with the blades for our for the peanut butter cup as well if you've got one of these is as a candy dispenser a chocolate dispenser these are great especially because we want to get these same amount and we want to do it quickly and easily now here's a little trick for you to create a whip when they normally come they don't have they're like this and you have to push them they're not automatic but you can create an automatic trigger by taking elastic just make a slip through it and then just put it across the bottom like so and now you've got an autumn trigger in that smart all right so that's it for our peanut butter cups for our chocolate we just need our mold pretty much now what you read I really do recommend getting the polycarbonate molds because they work so much you come out with a really professional-looking chocolate I don't recommend the silicone ones because one it's difficult to get your chocolate bars out of you have to peel them out quite often they break as well as you don't get quite the same shine as you do from the public cabinets or the plastic molds work really well as well so I think that's about it usually me you know I forget something I'll throw in there later but I think I've got the major stuff covered so let's jump into our making our peanut butter cups first alright so the very first thing we're gonna do is we got to cut our cups down to size so the easiest way to do this I'm gonna do six so I've got six of my liners here is fold them in half like so and then you want to cut about a half an inch or an inch off an inch off and you're just gonna go try and go evenly all the way around see now we have cups that are roughly the same size the weight side I just put them and get your tins and then the next thing we're going to do is we're going to get our chocolate our Hershey chocolate melted or your clean milk chocolate we're gonna get that melted now you can either my you can either melt it in the microwave I do mine at 30 second interval first then 20 then 15 then I finish it out at 10-second intervals until it is completely melted you can do it over a double boiler so any pot or a proper double boiler you can use or one of those candy melting pots any of those methods will work so it will work it just perfectly fine whoops I'm just gonna set that aside and if you want to if you've got if you are using the can of shortening you can add about a teaspoon or so a can of shortening to your chocolate if you'd like to but I'm just gonna get that melted up and then won't get everything put together alright so I've got my chocolate melted here it's all nice and smooth and like so so now you want to take a little bit about a teaspoon or so let's see you just drop it into the bottom we're gonna move it around now this is a little difficult to work with I find it's easier to take them out you can use the back of the spoon to go around the bottom and you want to bring it up around your edges and remember you just want to keep it a thin coat then you want to try and get as close to that top there as you can you just dip the back of the spoon in if you need a little bit more like so so I've got all the sides relatively evenly covered here drop it back into the mall and into the cake pile or the cupcake pan smack that down now if your bottom is not all filled just take a little bit more and just just lightly enough so that you just have that little light coating on the bottom so these are a bit of a pain to get doing even I'm just gonna do that again to all of them I find the offset works a lot better I'm just gonna finish the rest of these out and then we will get the peanut butter part going if you find this a little too much in the bottom you can just drop the excess all right so now that I got all the chocolate into my cups here just gonna clean off the top and then we're gonna set these aside let them set up while we make up our peanut butter filling all right so for peanut butter filling we're going to put in our half a cup of our all-natural peanut butter we are going to put in our our can of shortening but we do we want it melted and the reason that we want it melted is because if it's all if it's at room temperature and it's more than solid it may not evenly distribute all through your peanut butter it'll be little you can end up with little clumps of it so you definitely want to make sure to melt it get that in there and we are going to our to our Center we are going to add our powdered sugar our tapioca and our salt and we're going to sift that through and any hard chunks that don't go through just to start those and now we're going to need our mixer first of all so we don't end up with flying powder everywhere you just want to fold that in to your peanut butter and your can of shortening or your butter and we're going to add in our teaspoon of milk and we're just going to start our mixer on low now what will happen is it is all going to clump up like this it's gonna clump up like like this it's gonna kind of look like rinoa that's okay don't worry that's what we have the extra peanut butter for this is what we want it to do to start with so just continue to mix it until it's all broken down into little chunks like this and now we're gonna take our peanut butter with our mix and we're just going to drizzle something a little at a time until it starts to come together and form a nice mixture looks like I'm gonna need this might need a little bit more than that half cup we'll see actually I think I just used a quarter cup they're a little bit more big spoonful here just a little bit so the texture that we're looking for basically is like a peanut butter dough so we don't want it super stiff but we also don't want it really really some loose so we do want it basically like a dough like this so I do want it a little bit looser because that's a little too firm but that's the best is what we're working towards so I'm just gonna scoot it a little bit more peanut butter now so now if you've got it like this it's coming together so now we're just gonna knead it a little bit so I said it should be like dough you're just gonna need this up a little bit and then I'm just gonna take pieces of it and I'm just gonna kind of roll it trying to get it roll it into a rope here about the size of the bottom of my cup the diameter of my cups and then you're going to cut about quarter inch discs I only need sex we got a lot of dough here then we're going to take two of them and stock them together like so now if you used butter yours are going to be a little bit looser if you use the shortening they're going to be a lot firmer and that's because there's no water in shortening there is they go two to three percent of water in butter so we got those gonna get my cuffs well then we're gonna take two of those disks and squish them down your mold and then you can take your tray and you're gonna work them so you just want to make sure to fill in your cup until it's almost right to the top of the where your chocolate is cuz you know on the Reese cups it's a very very thin layer of chocolate over your top so you want the build up to almost the top you just want to leave just like a little millimeter or so of space for your chocolate topping and you want to try and make sure that's even as possible I said mine's a little bit stiffer yours if you use the butter will be smoother and they will flatten out nicely and evenly into your molds when you smack them down like so and for your extra peanut butter if you've got it you can just store it in a in any kind of airtight container and use at or at a later date trying to pop those into the fridge for about half hour now here is a peanut butter one the center that I made up earlier this I used with cannabutter so you can see it's a lot looser and more workable it's not as stiff as the one with the shortening and so this one as I said when you put it in to your mole into them into the complet cup and you smack them down they just spread out really nice so now for our chocolate bars what I've done is I added my my shortening I melted my shortening and I added it on into my chocolate and you're just gonna mix that around with it kind of all coated and we're gonna you're gonna about your chocolate in your preferred method alright so you've got your melted chocolate now it's really important to stir it well not vigorously because we don't want to create a ton of air bubbles but we want to make sure that it is well well stirred so that our shortening is properly incorporated into the chocolate and you'll know that by there will be no streaks it's going to be one uniform color and texture you won't see any kind of streaking now I've lined up just put a piece of parchment paper down so it can catch any of the excess that we scrape off so that none goes to waste and if you don't thoroughly stir it like so to make sure that the shortening is properly and well incorporated is you'll end up with streaks in your chocolate you don't want that you want to have that really pretty solid look to it okay once you're happy with your chocolate before we put it into the mold we're gonna top it out a little bit to get out some of those air bubbles so you're gonna shake it agitate it and there we go and they're just going to pour it into our molds now when you're pouring your molds again you want to do it nice and evenly fairly quickly and evenly so that you get that nice smooth if you do it in kind of sections pour a little bit shake it out you'll end up with different layer looks to it you don't want to have that basically oh look at that I calculated that pretty good and then you want to get a spatula spatula like that and you're gonna go hold it straight to the top OOP and just go straight along this will pull off your excess [Applause] off your edges I was gonna give this a final little shake and tap down any excess get out any of the excess uh uh access air bubbles want to make sure those sides are clean so you take out a nice even nice clean chocolate and once you're happy with your mold it's gonna go into the fridge for 20 for a minimum of 20 minute it needs that time to crystalline to crystalline crystallize something like that it's a technical term in chocolate to let it come back together so it needs at least I said 20 minutes in the fridge do not put it in the freezer to speed this up it needs to be the fridge so while our chocolate bars are setting we can put the tops on to our peanut butter cups so I just remounted my chocolate my the remainder of my Hershey's chocolate here and we are going to just add a little bit to the top and just smooth it out easier key spoon camera we just want a nice thin coating just seal up that top smack her down so you're just gonna smack them down until the tops are nice and even and then you're gonna pop these back into the fridge for 20 minutes to let that talk chocolates set and then we are gonna take everything out and see how everything looks all right so the chocolate bars are set now if you don't want to get fingerprints on your nice pretty chocolate you want to use latex or rubber gloves so you take them out of the refrigerator well let them sit for just about 30 seconds a minute and then we're gonna give them a good smoke whoops one broke not too hard and you need to flip them over and there we go beautiful chocolate bars and I'll show you once they get to room temperature that they will actually stay set it won't bring out the peanut butter cups and check those puppies out now here's one thing I want to show you you might see on some of the chocolate here there's some slight imperfections it's not completely smooth and clear it's nice and smooth and shiny that was because there was some my mold was not a hundred percent clean I thought it was your molds have to be really a hundred percent clean with hot soapy water and completely dry otherwise that will happen to your chocolate so well let's have a look at our peanut butter cups and we'll wrap this the puppy up oh sorry and then for your just for your chocolate or to keep them you want to use a thin some thin tin foil and just wrap them up like a little Christmas present I'm not very good at wrapping presents but there you got it and then you can always make your own wrappers just from you can print out on paper you can make your own paper wrappers for them all right so I got my peanut butter cup set now if there's any chocolate kind of stuck to the to your cupcake liner and the tin you just want to scrape that make sure that's loose and then you should be able to just take up there we got our peanut butter cups so let's have a look at one of these suckers there we go so what I do to avoid is for the edges what I would recommend them to do two rounds of coating the edges and that will help take care of that issue there and then have a look inside of them so you can see if you've made these before you would just open them up they would have squished all out and check out those insides looks just like a peanut butter cup isn't that cool and these taste so good with so much reduced sugar to all those other recipes out there and in a way that you can actually make them vegan or let's see vegan yeah if you use the vegetable shortening and you use the tapioca starch with the you can use powdered sugar I think that's not an issue but if you don't want to use powdered sugar you can increase the tapioca a little bit and use honey or maple syrup or a guard at not a car I got I got syrup one of those replacement syrups you can use that as a sweetener and avoid the sugar all together you just has a sin to have to increase that tapioca somewhat you just kind of have to work to get till you get to that text that consistency texture but other than that that's why demonstration there for you today if you have any questions at all as always please don't hesitate to ask and I gotta get this stuff off my fingers and and I hope you enjoyed that you guys have an awesome rest of your day thank you so much for watching [Music]", "aSxxD-JPXuE": "this is just stupid I was like like harder to breathe deep breath I'm always one step behind what hey what's going on guys thank you for cooking on the video you look beautiful today hopefully you're having a great one if not you will by the end of this thing I promise you I need to go to the grocery and I need two things only two things now what are the chances I can go there and only buy those two things kind of rhetorical [Music] so we got the two things that we needed but the real challenge is can we just take this pick up and leave I feel like eating an entire jar of peanut butter is one of those things that sounds fun it sounds good at the time but once you get into it it's probably not going to be as easy as you think but we will find out tonight so as you can see about a brand new jar of peanut butter hasn't been open even though I'm sure I have plenty in here so it does look like I have a few others here just in case one isn't enough but I'm a feeling after one jar of peanut butter I'm going to be good so in college we referred to this as pre-gaming things have definitely changed over the years so this is the part where you're supposed to go over the rules of the challenge but honestly I'm kind of just winging this as I go along I know I'm going to eat the entire jar but I figured it would it be that interesting to just watch me eat out of a jar so it'd be so much more exciting to watch me eat a sandwich plus everything is always better on a sandwich this might be like Mario Kart where I just create new challenges as we go I might throw a banana peel on the road or something like that I don't know let's just put something together [Music] I kind of regret this already this is going to be this is going to be interesting I think the funny part is going to be me trying to speak after all this peanut butter in my mouth I was thinking should I be allowed to drink anything and if I don't that's going to be extremely challenging but you know would be even harder if I have a drink in front of me but I make the rule that I'm not allowed to drink it sometime that DNA my shirt comes out that's my bag okay I'll make a deal with you guys if I can get two bites with no drink you have to like the video honestly this can kill me I might choke to death this is I wish you could really get an idea for how much peanut butter this is all right listen I'm kind of scared but we're gonna do it our mom would come back I want to move the camera so bad I don't want to wash my hands and Millie's done alright so that wasn't a good deal for you guys I could do more bites if I can get if I'd be a half of it done with no drink you have to like the video [Music] got um I could our mouth is like glue oh my god alright this is just this this is an absolute mess so alright one more bite and we're halfway through [Music] all right the rule should be I can't I don't oh my god what's in my chest hello I really need a drink really really need a drink [Music] this is just stupid I'm like like harder to breathe deep breath it's like all stuck right there why am I doing this oh come on come on we're gonna do it we're gonna do it hmm all right guys all right got half done I feel like I feel like I can still do better we're gonna do we're going to do one more bite and after this bite if this is not record on but this camera is not recording still okay we're good I was going to close you know freak out okay so we're going to do one more bite let it clear a little bit [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh my gosh I want to drink that so bad one more bite [Music] don't do it don't do it okay one more [Music] [Applause] oh my gosh this is a record so long as my camera stayed in one place I'm freaking out that it's not recording till this thing shuts off can ruin my entire video got [Music] come on trying to strategically bite here I think we're going to make it through no no no drink um maybe I don't know if you guys can see down here but as you can imagine a lot of peanut butter has fallen off so even though I finished this I still got dug up some work to do but if I get to the sandwich with no drink thing you guys now we made it guys sure some weirdo out there wants me to lick this off my fingers I'm sorry call me a cheater it ain't happening [Music] you'll have a drink don't worry I'm still here I'm still here all right yes all right please it's not too bad now it's I think it's just a natural saliva what you kind of gross the sale out but okay she took us it's not on a peanut butter it's not like an appetite thing I could probably eat three or four of these appetizers but it's like glue just building up in your stomach you know so we've come this far I do have to change the camera angle because this is driving me crazy but can I'm going to leave you here if anyone was wondering that clip was 11 minutes long so about 11 minutes T almost an entire jar of peanut butter not too bad [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay I tried to change the camera settings as quickly as possible but note to self I should have just done that whole jar by itself if I want to be harder that was the hardest part but the whole thing there's so much just stuck in my gums and I'm gonna go up I'm that drink I gotta do it that Oh close to you rich homies here's what's nothing honestly as I'm not going to sit here like lick the plate and lick it out of the jar that that's a bit extreme for me so this is to me close enough some of you guys are going to disagree but that's fine almost or I'm going to call an entire jar of peanut butter in about like 12 minutes in the jar there's 14 servings 190 calories per serving if I can do that in my head 200 times 14 would be 2800 back out 140 like 26 60 somebody check me on that I think right around 26 60s so not bad calorie wise but it's starting to kind of settle in my stomach I think we're just going to call it here guys I mean in a shorter video but what do you eat after a jar of peanut butter sushi the answer is sushi it's the perfect complement to a jar of peanut butter I got to get my cards in I think I'm still traumatized by that full day of Kido video I just released that today and I'm not even kidding when I say that sucked you know what we're gonna do why is the sushi we're gonna do a PS giveaway I just created a Facebook page which I you guys know I don't use Facebook but I figured it was time to just break down and get one I really want to interact with you guys more on there so I've been able to do some Q&A s been able to post some videos hopefully get my channel out there so excuse me to try and draw traffic to that Facebook page all you have to do is go on that page like it and share any of the videos that were posted there I guarantee you some of your friends what to see me put food in my mouth I almost guarantee especially it's at this one this one will be posted on there by the time that this videos are always that would help me out so much and I'll go through I'll pick a winner any PS product that you like deal all right what other poor food decisions can we make tonight so I figured you might as well get some extra carbs and protein in these banana chocolate chip bagels definitely where Tommy approved and some people asked how much of my daily intake of protein comes from PS select anywhere from seventy to ninety eight percent I love it tastes so much better than chicken and the great part is you can always save 30 percent you Travis a piece I'm calm we'll take it easy on dessert though no junk bowls tonight just some low-fat mint chocolate chip ice cream it's not too bad and that's how we're going to end up video a little bit different type of challenge today but I hope you guys enjoyed it I kind of like it just I don't feel like I'm going to sleep feeling like death so do you guys want to see anything else there's something you have in mind that you want me to do that you would think would be entertaining or be interesting just be different than what I'm doing day in or week in and week out I guess thank you so much for taking the time out of your day

does help meant a lot you made this point you had to like something right feel free to click on the videos inside of my head hang off me a little bit longer and I look forward to talking you guys next time", "kzUkTaLpy6g": "the no fate channel checking in and today we're getting a little bit nutty because today we're gonna be reviewing my proteins peanut butter and then we're gonna have a battle of the butters because we're gonna be pitting my proteins peanut butter against my current favorite Teddy smooth unsalted all-natural peanut butter let's get started [Music] [Applause] I am a huge fan of my protein calm they are known for delivering low cost everything supplements gym accessories clothing and now peanut butter one of the reasons I do so many reviews of their products not only do I love that company but some of their products are really really good and some of their products not so much and that's why I do these reviews to hopefully help you decide what's gonna be right for your wallet what's gonna make the most sense so flashback to Valentine's Day had an awesome sale I rocked my own coupon code no fate 24/7 and got this 40 ounces of peanut butter for $30 $3.77 and I figured let's do a headset comparison so currently my favorite peanut butter is an all-natural peanut butter made here locally in Massachusetts Teddy smooth all-natural unsalted we're gonna do a quick head-to-head comparison and then more importantly we're gonna actually do a taste test because you could have the same exact peanut butters macro wise but how do they taste right when you put them in your mouth you want to make sure that you get that really great peanut butter taste which is the reason that you love it your kids love it and I'm excited to do this actual review so let's just quickly do head to head let's talk about ingredients 100% peanuts that's always good to see when you just see one ingredient on the ingredients profile here we go ingredients dry roasted peanuts let's see where is this made manufactured in Aurora Illinois us of a good to see manufactured in Everett Massachusetts e town locally made obviously so that's one of the reasons I'm able to get this at a very very low cost let's talk about servings two teaspoons servings two teaspoons calories 190 190 16 grams of fat 16 grams of fat 7 grams of carbs 7 grams of carbs 3 grams of fiber 3 grams of fiber this has 2 grams of sugar and this has 1 gram of sugar whoo so already this has one less gram of sugar which I guess is a better thing than this one 8 grams of protein 8 grams of protein across the board ingredients calories macros nearly identical everything but let's talk about cost that's one of the reasons I love my protein comm is because they are so so cheap so inexpensive but they still deliver on that quality I picked this up at $3.77 I'll put that right up here so you can actually actually see that's what I paid for it that equates to nine point five cents per ounce if I did my math correctly now I picked this Teddy smooth up on a sale keep in mind it was not only a sale but it was local to Massachusetts so it's probably cheaper than if you bought this in California because they have to pay shipping and get it out there two dollars and 50 cents for this container and that equated to fifteen points something cents per ounce so obviously that my protein is cheaper so both of these are brand-new let's open them up have a discussion do a taste test and then we'll do a spread test and go from there okay so hopefully you can see this without me actually spilling this I don't have anything to take a photo of it with because I'm using my phone for this video with any type of natural peanut butter that doesn't have a lot of preservatives in it you're gonna see separation and as you can see with the teddies peanut butter you get a lot of separation at the top 100% natural and that is going to stir in and not be a problem it's as expected and you have hopefully you can since you have some separation with the my protein not nearly as much as the Teddy's but you have to have some separation and we have some peanut chunks in here even though this is a smooth peanut butter I do see some peanut chunks in here let's give these a stir and then let's do a taste test [Music] a few takeaways from stirring the peanut butters as expected with the teddy peanut butter super smooth easy to stir and only very small very very small specks of peanuts in there you if you look really really close I don't think the camera is gonna pick it up you can see there's super small specks nothing you're actually gonna notice when you bite into it truly a smooth peanut butter however my high-protein shame on you I don't know what your idea of a smooth versus a chunky I'd hate to see with your chunky peanut but I mean there's just chunks of peanuts in here I'm not making this up literally just just cups of peanuts and I don't like a chunky peanut butter but this is this this is a hundred percent chunky peanut butter I don't know what they're chunky looks like man oh man let's do a taste test I have a pretty good idea what the Teddy tastes like already so I'm gonna start off with the my protein chunks aside my proteins peanut butter really really good no deviation from my expectations a very good peanut butter regardless of the chunks I mean it's really really good at me no issues with with taste whatsoever let's try Teddy's smooth peanut butter here [Music] so comparing both my protein and this teddy peanut butter for taste I have to give it to teddy peanut butter now I don't know if that's because of the chunks I will say both of them tasted very good but obviously that teddy smooth peanut butter with those dry roasted peanuts for some reason just gives it a little bit more of a kick a little bit more of an edge with regards to that taste and obviously when you expect a smooth peanut butter and you get one that I would call medium chunky there is some disappointment there at that level as well I'm gonna throw in how both of them spread I'll put it I'll put it here I'll put it up right here how they spread on toast to give you an idea of what they look like spread out and all that good stuff all that that delicious peanut butter footage final verdict regardless of my proteins added peanut chunks in there smooth peanut butter we're gonna call this one medium chunky peanut butter okay I still recommend this to many of you and I'm going to enjoy eating the rest of this myself reason being is the obviously the price you're not gonna find a cheaper peanut butter that's going to deliver quality it's the ingredients are 100% peanuts there's no added sugar no added anything which is what you're looking for at a lower price I mean if you go to Costco if you go to BJ's Wholesale Club you're still probably gonna get a better price per ounce of peanut butter than my proteins peanut butter because of their sales that they run a few ways to save money on those sales number one way to save money is to be a new customer if you've never used my protein calm before I'll put an affiliate link a referral link to be a new customer they love getting new customers because everyone who's a new customer ends up being a repeat customer you use that referral link it helps me out it saves you more money than the existing customers and you're gonna get this thing for a steal the second way to save money on top of all of this sales that they run all the time and I do mean they have like these crazy sales all the time is to use my affiliate link and then use my code no fee 24/7 to get 40% off on top of all those sales it's the code that I use when I buy stuff from their them because it ends up being the cheapest I will tell you if you can find a better code or get a better deal do that but you're not going to ever eat I've looked it's always my code that ends up being cheapest and that's why I use my code if I could find a cheaper code guess what I would use the cheaper code because I'm a pretty cheap guy hopefully you found this video informative if you have any questions regarding my protein or my

showing you a little quick tip on how to measure peanut butter isn't it annoying when you measure some kind of peanut butter or butter and to give you top measurements and when you measure it out it's so hard to get it off of the measuring cup like this there are two ways that you can do this I'm gonna show you guys one way with using this because I feel like a lot of people have this kind of measuring cup and what you can use is a cooking spray like um aerosol cooking spray something like something like this take it and spray it well you don't have to get exactly this brand but you know it's cooking cream there's Pam and all that stuff so I think okay so just spray this bad boy okay just a light spritz yep just a light spritz so once you've measured up your peanut butter you can easily take it up just like that that's it for the quick tip today and I hope you learned something new today and if you're not already subscribed please subscribe there's the scripts there's a subscribe button on down bar and definitely let me know what you want to see in future videos I also have other videos that you can check out and you know yeah that's it alright bye guys", "vOQzw9idPxs": "[Music] this is fokin that's peanut butter this is a brand of peanut butter that I absolutely love I've tried it in the past and every flavor that I've tried is absolutely delicious I do have two new flavors that I haven't tried yet so I'm going to let you know what I think along with a few others that are my two my favorites actually so just stick with me and I'll let you know what so I'm gonna start with the bee's nest this is a honey blended with a peanut butter so first when I open the jar I get that fresh roasted peanuts smell I just love that you can tell it's it's real peanut butter and the ingredients are just drivers good peanuts whipped honey safflower oil and sea salt so very simple ingredients so you know you're gonna get a really good product with this so if I'm going to stir it it's very very creamy this is a really good blend of honey and peanut butter and it's it's sweet and salty all at the same time I say job well done because what this is one of my favorite combinations is peanut butter and honey and this is spot [Music] next up I have the snozzberry honey so again this is a honey and peanut butter spread that has dry roasted peanuts whipped honey dried raspberries added to it along with the safflower oil and salt so when I open it up it's again when I start stirring it it's very creamy and one thing there you can see all the dried raspberries the snozzberries in there and I'm so excited about this one I can smell the raspberry - this is now this is an excellent combination it reminds me of peanut butter and jelly in a jar and one thing I love about bouken nuts is when you get a flavor you get times of mixing so with every bite I am tasting that sweet peanut butter with honey along with a rez dried raspberry I mean it just tastes like peanut butter and jelly and that is one of my favorite combinations so like this is really awesome good job [Music] next I'm gonna try the white chocolate which I've tried this one before and it is absolutely delicious it tastes just like white chocolate melted into peanut butter but I'm gonna show you anyways I mean it's very very creamy just the right consistency like this is peanut butter it's not too drippy but it's just just absolutely like heaven on a spoon I mean this is so sweet like white chocolate I mean it tastes like a Reese's with the Reese's white chocolate and I mean it's just like that perfect amount of sweetness and you get a little bit of saltiness with the peanuts but tastes like fresh roasted peanuts with white chocolate I mean absolutely delicious and the final flavor I have is cookies and cream actually it's nuts about cookies and cream which cookies and cream is actually my favorite flavor of anything so if I can find anything that I think that can actually pull this off I mean I'll come I'll keep coming back for more and one thing again this is just so creamy and like you can see all the chocolate fits in here I mean this I absolutely love love love this flavor it tastes like an Oreo literally blend in peanut butter I mean I can't get enough of this I literally could eat the whole jar and that is one thing about coconuts I love their slogan they say you can eat the whole jar and I know why because it is really that good I mean I'm something like some of the jars they actually have the calorie count for the whole entire jar if you eat it but this this is nail like this I mean you get that salty sweet peanut butter but it literally tastes like the cream and peanut butter is mixed in and then you get the chocolate cookie Brook bits that are crunchy I mean it's got the texture the taste and the spreadability so you better believe it when foking nuts actually says you can eat the whole jar like they actually have that slogan on the jar the whole calorie count and everything but I can totally understand why this peanut butter is absolutely phenomenal so if you're a peanut butter fan and you're looking for something that has that added flavor or something different definitely go give this a try you won't be disappointed I had to break all these peanut butters I honestly really have nothing bad to say like the flavors are all very much on point I love the sweetness with the honey and the raspberries and this Knott's Berry and this cookies and cream it literally tastes like cookies and cream mixed in so like all these are definitely a 10 so this one more bite of this I mean it's so [Music] mmm okay maybe another taste of this snozzberry yeah I just can't get enough of this mmm I'm definitely gonna go order more this is not gonna last long okay I gotta try the white chocolate Ian I tell you there's nothing better than peanut butter on a spoon okay I just love it very very very very good", "312FS4Qa2sM": "this is a little out of the norm for the type of videos I usually put out there because this video is about a new peanut butter I just discovered that so this matter that this video is out of the norm because people love nut butters most people love nut butters you know what I'm talking about most of you that are still watching I thinking yeah that guy's right I love me some almond peanut cashew pistachio walnuts butters peanut butter arguably the king of nut butters is ubiquitous at every store across North America if you live in a country where you don't have peanut butter in every grocery store convenience store gas station I'm just sorry I'm really sorry I live in the states now so I eat peanut butter with every meal every single day does that seem excessive perhaps but that's a healthy right chocolate-covered macadamia nuts are healthy right most nuts are healthy ish but let me add a caveat most nuts are healthy when Edin in moderation do you think eating nut butter with every meal is in moderation who cares moderation is what you say it is eating peanut butter with every meal is moderation for me because I could eat it a lot more often a lot if you enjoyed this video be sure to give it a thumbs up and subscribe to this channel so you don't miss any upcoming content the focus of this video came to me after I saw a friend's Instagram post where she had found this and she said it was pretty good so after seeing the name and the flavor crunchy salted caramel I knew it had to be mine thanks to Amazon Prime the next day it was mine but I wondered is this too good to be true is a salted caramel flavor peanut butter really legit I'm gonna compare this to my other staple chip and we're gonna see how they stack up just to give you a little background on my nut budding eating habits I do also make my own walnut butter I've made a video on that in case you don't know how to make nut butters I'll link to it at the end this video is going to be comparing chip creamy peanut butter with fat so crunchy salted caramel peanut butter you ready alright let's look at some stats the fatso says that one serving size is one tablespoon whereas chip says that a serving size is two tablespoons so all I'm gonna do is double what fatso says so the numbers can line up let's start off with calories fat so comes in at 180 calories per serving size whereas chip comes in at 190 calories per serving size winner person how about total fat fat so comes in at 16 grams of serving size chip also comes in at 16 grams of serving size the difference is seen in the saturated fat chip has three and a half grams of saturated fat whereas fatso has four grams of saturated fat per serving sizes it's not much but Jeff wins that one that's so an Jeff have no cholesterol and no trans fats a significant for trans fats about let's talk about sodium Jeff has 140 milligrams of sodium per serving size fatso has none that's a wing system carbohydrates fat so as six grams of carbohydrates jiff has 8 grams of carbohydrates depending on if you like carbohydrates or not both the winners let's talk about dietary fiber that's a 4 grams per serving Jeff 3 grams per serving fibers a good thing about so winds moving on to sugars that so has two grams per serving size chip has 3 grams per serving size that so wins no one needs sugar in their peanut butter routine everybody loves to talk about protein vegans watching this where do you get your protein answer in the comments below fatso has 6 grams of protein per serving size chip has 7 grams of protein per serving size Jeff wins the protein round let's talk about cost for a second this is a biggie jiff I looked on Amazon and jiff cost $10 and 56 cents for 32 ounces so 2 16 ounce containers cost $10 and 56 cents and that is 33 cents an ounce that's so cost $11.49 for 17.6 4 ounces that's 65 cents an ounce that's almost double the cost of Jeff Jeff wins the cost round let's talk about flavor for a second which one do I prefer and this is probably the most scientific that this video is going to get I've tried both I've tried a lot of both and I like that so better why well it's the caramel miss in the peanut butter I wish everything was covered in caramel I could eat caramel with a spoon and I often do just like a dispense of caramel crunchy peanut butter let's talk about marketing for a second this fatso crunchy salted caramel peanut butter is marketed as high performance peanut butter as an athlete I like that let's take a look at their website fatso peanut butter is an all-natural peanut butter enriched with plant-based superman's let's just scroll down just a little [Music] and we learn what's in the jar well what's in the jar peanuts supercedes high performance fats and tapioca fiber okay what draws my attention is the supersedes you had super to anything and it makes it healthy and makes you a better athlete all of that high performance fats every jar is boosted with coconut avocado and MCT oil MC t is medium chain triglyceride oil it increased healthy cholesterol and promotes high performance fats who ever knew there was such a thing as high performance fats let's take a look at the fatso peanut butter site on Amazon we see here things like vegan peanut butter with plant-based super fats again super use of some great great words that will draw people like me into this product

really gonna make me a better runner and I'd like to see it on your site too okay there's one more thing on the Amazon site I want to share with you and I want to share this with you basically because I'm not very articulate and I think this person who raided the fatso peanut butter she says it better than anybody the first time I tasted this I thought my ears were ringing but it turns out it was the Seraphim and cherubim singing in my ears I cried a little brights were brighter and darks darker personal injury lawyers heard about it and they actually went out of business because they realized no more pain and suffering in the world was possible the ocean temperatures dropped by a full degree I can't wait to see what will happen if i smear this stuff on downtown arts and entertainment

and it's time for another protein bar review today is robert irvin fit crunch this flavor is caramel peanut all right the criteria same as always ingredients protein content macros calorie count taste texture and that will give us our overall score one through ten this one's gonna be pretty quick we reviewed robert irvin's fit crunch chocolate peanut butter the other day i'm a big fan of anything chocolate peanut butter this one has caramel too and it looks like it has peanuts and chocolate so i'm excited um let's look uh ingredients pretty much the same as the other one uh not a fan of the soy protein isolate in this one as well as the other stuff geez there's a lot of this is a long list look at that i think this is because this one has caramel in it the other one didn't so this this ingredient list is about twice as long as the chocolate peanut butter one so same thing 190 calories this is i guess the half size bar they make another one that's almost 400 calories that's not what i'm looking for but this 190 calories 16 grams of protein 14 grams of carbs 8 grams of total fat so again a third of these calories are from fat not really the best thing so ingredients i'm going to give this a 4 protein content i'm going to give it a 4 there as well for not even reaching 20 grams in this 190 calorie serving macros i'm going to give it a four there as well calorie count calorie count we'll give it a seven because that's i think that's about right where they should be you know i don't you know i'm not looking for a a protein bar to be a meal of you know four or five hundred calories i'm looking for it just to be a you know a quick spike after a workout and then uh you know tied me over until i get home get some real food real nutrition you know chicken complex carbs or whatever healthy protein you want complex carbs vegetables whatever um so yeah macros um calorie count we're gonna give it a seven let's see how it tastes it's really good it's basically like a candy bar i mean this is like eating a milky way you know it's got caramel tastes great um if you remember i scored the robert irvin fit crunch chocolate peanut butter i gave that a nine for taste and texture i'm going to give this one a 9.1 just a little more because it does have a caramel in there as well as the chocolate as well as the chocolate and peanut butter combo i guess this one gives you little chunks of peanuts in there instead of peanut butter but you still have you know the creaminess of the chocolate the cookie crunch you have the chunks of peanuts in there and then you have the you have the gooey caramel in there so that's pretty good so 9.1 on taste and texture and uh overall score i'm gonna give this a 5.1 i gave the chocolate peanut butter a five i'm going to give this one just a little edge more 5.1 simply just because it has chocolate peanut butter and caramel um so that's the review for today hopefully this helps you out everybody at the grocery store so you

dispensary and on today's review we are taking a look at a brand new product one that I'm not even a hundred percent sure what it is just yet uh and that is a new edible I think maybe a lozenge I'm not sure what is in here but what I'm talking today about is a level blends pro tab hybrid so I think the company's name is level or level blends all these things have really obscure names there's something that says level there and then it says level blends on the back calm and then it also says Pro tab hybrid I believe it is level blends and I think the product is there Pro tab hybrid something very curious about this is I picked this up at a legal now recreational dispensary here in Long Beach where I live uh but this is not a hundred milligram edible this is actually a 250 milligram a table it is 10 pro tabs whatever those are we're gonna find out together at 25 milligrams each I'm not sure exactly how they are getting away with this I I don't know it if this product is considered compliant with the regulations uh traditionally you can only have at most or at minimum ten servings and a hundred milligrams maximum so this again has 25 milligram servings and 250 milligrams total so I'm not sure how they're getting away with it I know there is a caveat for tinctures tinctures can go up to a thousand milligrams but this is not a tincture so I'm not really sure what they're doing to to bypass the law but I was excited to see it because I like high potency edibles and uh I like things that are small and discreet as well and this appears to be that in spades whatever it is so let's find out it's got a weird way to open it it's got kind of like an old-school like a CD sticker ething on it I'm gonna peel that oh cool it kind of peels in a interesting little pattern so that I'm gonna pull this down and did I do something yes ah okay batch numbers made numbers expires packed on a bunch of cool stuff there on the back okay it says a swallow Pro tab with liquid effects should be felt within 30 to 60 minutes so you know what that means guys it means I'm gonna pause I'll be right back I'm gonna go get some liquid I didn't know that requires I'm gonna go grab a cup of water see in a second I'm back I've got myself some water I am ready to find out what Pro tabs are if I can figure out how to open them I see two arrows pointing in opposite directions it's not really a good indication of how to open it okay wait there we go that's something whoa here we go they are little tabs they look like pills but they're not let's let's take one out uh yeah here they are they're like little aspirin II looking things don't really have an odor to speak of but they're little tablets not what I was expecting I was expecting maybe like one of those Lawson jizz or things that dissolve in your tongue not little pill things interesting so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna eat every one of these or swallow or whatever it is that you end up doing what Beast all 250 milligrams and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to let you know how I'm feeling I'm really excited about this one I am very hopeful that this is gonna be a slam-dunk product because I would love love love for to finally have a pill form of THC that that works because all the capsules I've tried so far have been dog [ __ ] so we shall try the pro tabs from level blends here we go I just swallowed it I'm not sure if that's what I'm supposed to do um we're not swallow Pro tab with liquid effect should be felt within 30 to 60 minutes fair enough okay well I will swallow a couple more of these and then I'll wait a half an hour and swallow the rest of them there we go you have three more no case look there's kind of a wee taste when they go your tongue it is all very quickly I found out as soon as it that one hit my tongue it started to disintegrate and get kind of powdery and weedy tasting okay well pro tabs guys I am very very very hopeful that these are going to be a new product that I would love because I've been looking for something like this for a very long time so again this is the pro tab hybrid bi-level blends fingers crossed that this one is gonna be the pill that we've all been waiting for alright guys I will check back with you in two hours and rest assured I will finish these off between now and then and I'll let you know exactly how I'm feeling thanks for watching weeks see you soon I [Music] am indigestion let's start over that's bad let's do that more Jeff [Music] welcome to the Future guys the future of actually about three hours later just got out of a movie wild ass movie that knew Paul Feig comedy thriller thing I can't even remember the title the title of movies terrible a simple favor I think there might be a terrible title man what a weird movie that is I can't believe that's a major block a major motion picture almost that that somebody let that those movie stars in that movie happen no judgement what I am here to pass judgment on however is Pro tab hybrid a classic high amplifies your body and mind right there there 250 milligram Pro tabs and again the pro tabs and we're just little capsules just tiny little pill size excuse me not capsules just um the flattened pills I have no idea what that term is I know there's specific terms for each of the shapes and sizes but forgive me for not knowing this is not a oilfield thing and the verdict is gavel bang bang bang bang bang the verdict is this is without a doubt the best pill form of THC I have found yet that is not to say it is perfect I don't think it's a it doesn't feel as equivalent as some other 250 milligram anibal's maybe like it's you know but that's it's it's still good it's it's on the good and for a 215 milligram edible or I on the end of acceptable too good but in the form of having something that you can take in a pill form especially if you're taking lower doses than I am in being able to just pop one or two before a concert and before a lecture for all you kids in college you know whatever the case may be I quite like the pro tab I am I'm pretty pleased with it to be honest it's the first one that I will buy again I would buy this again for certain occasions again when I'm looking to take something maybe in a smaller dosage and something very discrete you could certainly just stick this at any kind of like pill bottle take it on an airplane don't take that advice for me never heard that but yeah it is just a little bit pricier than other edibles but that is in line with capsules although it's not as expensive nearly as expensive as some of the other capsules on this was 30 bucks at my dispensary there about plus or minus taxes which can be substantial in Long Beach but I did not feel at all ripped off by this not in the slightest again this is a pretty positive one for me I'm pretty happy with I [ __ ] I think I got the name wrong the whole time again I think it's level blends pro tab I'll look that up and the title will be right so that is gonna do it for this review here on weeds I don't think I'm gonna share with you guys a cherry on top I you know what I'm just gonna say that little rant I had about whatever the shitty title of that weird Paul Feig movie is a simple plan oh wait no no this is what I do that yeah this is the second part of the video well I'm higher than I thought yeah I don't have a cherry on top for you I I didn't I feel like you guys didn't deserve it this time um step it up you know you need to step up your game I'll step up mine I love you though

was a hippie [ __ ] anyway I want to show y'all something right here I went to the store and I didn't pull the shopping with Chris video because quite frankly the day I went to the store I was in a rush and really didn't have time to show what I had but one item in particular I bought that I've been getting requested to buy was some water Farms calorie-free peanut butter okay now a lot of you guys already know this I'm one of those guys that really struggled with dieting not because it's hard it's just because I love fast I love peanut butter I love walnuts I love pistachios I love olive oil those are some things that I really can't live without not because they're healthy and they they fight inflammation but because quite frankly that makes everything taste so damn good all right so I gotta keep my fresh nuts on that peanut butter on deck honestly if I was in started to compete I would have to drop my fat from 65 down to 50 which would be [ __ ] torture for me all right if I can find some kind of alternatives to peanut butter that will probably change my life for the better so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna open this [ __ ] up as you see it's new I've never tried it in my life a

going to open this [ __ ] up I'll be right back all right jeez and gents hummus and whole Nets as you see I just opened this [ __ ] and I'm not gonna taste it yet but it feels kind of like peanut

gonna be any good but let's try it come over to our man here we go you witness it for the first time me trying this [ __ ] oh hell no I look at this [ __ ] this is all whipped real peanut butter the

looking at I believe the final product in the kirova 5 dose 250 milligrams line the reverse the reverse tip I believe being meeting it's a chocolate cookie with a vanilla dip as opposed to a vanilla cookie or a sugar cookie with the chocolate dip so you can see there you can also hear my dog in the background we've got our ingredients as you normal flour brown sugar sugar canna butter chocolate chips it's chocolate pudding mix cocoa powder vanilla bark baking powder and vanilla extract so this is 250 milligrams of THC which I had mentioned before and I picked this up in a dispensary in Huntington Beach for I believe ten dollars which is a fair price I generally love the kirova confectionaries and I hope that this one is yet another winner so let's open it up give it a taste broad communal no we can add a dog okay alright so we got this open here and it's a little bit smooshed no big deal so it's not the perfect shape of our cookie a little [ __ ] up in the packaging or shipping somewhere along the way but that's okay right so let's give it a taste hmm okay it's good let's grow up no we taste no weed odor it's a very soft cookie almost like if you ever had a pumpkin

creamy peanut butter on the right weighing in at 40 ounces is Walmart's great value brand of creamy peanut butter I don't eat peanut butter very often but I really do like peanut butter and I've always wondered if there really is a difference doing a side-by-side so this is really gonna be interesting and I'm looking forward to this so right away well looking at the packaging obviously I mean I you'd have to agree that jiff wins I mean GF is just the standard I think when it comes to peanut butter I mean look at those colors it really stands out and in Walmart is just obviously budget peanut butter so now which one of these are the better value so for the jiff I paid $3 an 85 cents for this 28 ounce jar this works out to 13 cents an ounce for the Walmart I paid $2 and 26 cents and that is for a 40 ounce jar and that works out to 6 cents an ounce so that's a huge difference when it comes to value the jiff cost twice as much than the Walmart does so let's open these up and see what we got and the Jeff is sealed so obviously I knew I'd be that way but you've got that neat little seal says jiff on there and it neat and I don't know what jiff stands for it must be just a name somebody made up at some point in time but that's nice we have these little tabs on here that hopefully I can open this and that's not really easy to open so that's obviously a childproof lid because I can't open it I'm gonna have to hand this off to a child so they can open this up so here we are here's the Jeff peanut butter and it looks oh my gosh I'm surprised it looks like peanut butter oh my gosh alright let's try the Walmart great value brand and let's open this up and see if I can open this one and it's exactly the same way except what's it say on top it says sealed for freshness well that's nice to know also the pull tab and I was able to open that one and wow that looks like peanut butter imagine that well looking at both of them I don't know the Jeff seems to have a little bit maybe a little bit darker color maybe a little bit richer color didn't want to Walmart brand this is the Walmart in this the Jeff and yeah seems like the jiff just has a richer color to it let's see about the smell let's smell a Jeff and see what that smells like hmm that smells like peanut butter that makes my mouth water nice savory smell that peanut butter tastes peanut butter smell so let's smell the Walmart brand to see how that smells it smells different I'm surprised it still smells like peanut butter actually I think the Walmart smells better it smells more like peanuts that's interesting in my mouth is water and we having trouble talking because of it who doesn't like peanut butter alright now a real test how does this stuff taste so let's start with the jiff and just get a little bit there and it's nice and smooth just as you expect peanut butter to be let's see mmm that's good my goodness not too sweet tastes like peanut butter alright let's try the Walmart great value and the Walmart great value actually seems a little bit stiffer it doesn't seem as creamy I'm serious where the jiff is definitely more creamy and the Walmart brand is stiffer so I find that interesting let's see how it tastes hmm Wow Walmart's really good too wow this is gonna be tough alright let's try the Jeff again hmm that's about what I figured I mean it's peanut butter but this is interesting okay I've got it actually you're gonna be surprised I think the Walmart tastes better it really does a Walmart tastes better but the jiff has a much better smoother texture undoubtedly and I think I know why the Walmart brand tastes better it's because it seems like it has more sugar it seems sweeter and I mean who doesn't like a little bit of sweetness in their peanut butter but the main thing is gonna be how this tastes in a sandwich so here we are we have our sandwiches made up and we have the jiff on the left and the Walmart on the right and I got to tell you I can really tell a difference now in the smoothness and the creaminess of these two peanut butters the Jeff was a whole lot easier to spread on the bread than what the Walmart brand was you can just see how cream it is just right on the bread it was really easy to spread where the Walmart on the other hand was significantly significantly more more stiff and much harder to spread on the bread so that's a huge difference right there so let's see how these taste on a piece of bread so let's try the g-f right now and see if that changes anything mmm boy hmm that brings back memories you can see how smooth that is it's just it's almost almost running off with a piece of bread yeah it's really glossy and I know why and I'll tell you why in a second what the difference is and why this is so let's try the Walmart great value brand and you can see it's you might be able to tell it's less glossy than what the jiff is let's try that mmm Wow in a way I'm surprised in a way I'm not now I'll tell you why the Walmart peanut butter definitely tastes better than the jiff that may surprise you but I'll tell you why Wow they're both really really good there's no doubt Jeff is a really good peanut butter but I'm surprised how good the Walmart peanut butter tastes well here's the deal to make a smooth a creamy peanut butter you have to have more peanut oil in there and the more peanut oil you have it's gonna be kind of covering up the potato your going to be what you're gonna be diluting the taste of the peanut butter by adding more oil so it's a compromise between having a good flavor with a lot of peanut butter taste to it or having a creamy peanut butter so the creamier it is the less peanut butter tastes it's gonna have so that's a compromising depending on which way you go Walmart is less smooth because it has less peanut oil in there therefore you're going to be taste more of the peanuts in there more of the peanut taste so it's a compromise so really when it comes down to is what's more important to you how well it tastes or how easy it is to spread on your bread I suppose if you have kids you rely on kids to make their own peanut butter sandwich you might want them to use the jiff because it's gonna be easier for them to make their peanut butter sandwich as for taste my goodness the Walmart brand just tastes better so if you're using this in fudge or some recipe like that it's really gonna make it stand out compared to the jiff if the if the texture of the creaminess is not that much of a factor oh my gosh the Walmart is better it really is the Walmart is better it just tastes better for me and my money since I don't care a whole lot about the creaminess and how easy it is to spread I'm gonna go with the Walmart it just tastes better and it's a whole lot less expensive than what the jiff is I was really surprised by this result I thought peanut butter was for the most part peanut butter I'm surprised that there was that much of a difference in these so thank you for watching food fights and please subscribe so we can continue to try it before you buy it we'll see in the next video take care you", "ZX-qukotXWU": "[Music] we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are taking our final look at least for some time at enjoy enjoyable edibles this time we are taking a look at their 350 milligram IV notations chocolate chip cookie this is our third in their 350 milligram line of the new packaged enjoyable edibles we have taken a look at their fruity crispy and at their peanut butter brownie found the peanut butter brownie we pretty good and they're pretty crispy to be pretty disappointing that's usually the case when it comes to the sort of rice krispie treats or the fruity crispy treats I've often find them to be a little disappointing and this one was certainly no exception these do claim to be lab tested by SC labs but I am doubt I do doubt they are 350 milligrams they do seem a little bit less potent to me but we'll give them the benefit of the doubt on this one here and hopefully that it's hopefully they are being honest about the milligram egde on this one so this is the plain chocolate chip cookie hopefully it tastes good chocolate chip cookies can certainly go either way terms of edibles so it's a big flat boring looking cookie they're very dry it's like cannabis odor to it but not too bad incredibly dry looking cookie let's go ahead and give it a bite here it's like taking a bite out of the Sahara and there is a cannabis aftertaste well I put it right about in the middle in terms of taste of edible chocolate chip cookies they've certainly had better and I've certainly had worse it's very dry there is a little bit of a cannabis aftertaste but it's not horrible terrible there's an edible edible well the first half of the review is done don't worry I'm going to finish off this cookie here and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know the most important part of the edible review notice whether or not I got higher or not and this time I really have no clue how it's gonna go down I hope to come back to you guys in two hours wasted as [ __ ] but I am skeptical so we shall certainly see be sure to stick around yourselves guys and we will find out in just a bit peace welcome back to weeds guys much like it's peanut butter bar predecessor the chocolate chip cookie is pretty good it's not the best edible I've ever had I don't a hundred percent believe it's three hundred and fifty milligrams it feels like more like a hundred and fifty milligrams somewhere in there they could be totally wrong I would love to see their lab tested results they claim to be lab tested by SC labs I'm gonna take a look at their website enjoyable edibles calm I see something different if I see something I'll be sure to I'm making an addendum to this video to let you know but otherwise yeah I still like it for 15 bucks it was still a pretty good value I still feel pretty high and much like the peanut butter bar it is a different kind of high it's a more but of a body high I feel kind of buzzy it's it's Pleasant though I like it but it's different than some of the other highs that I've had so yeah whatever they're using produces a different kind of high end me that has a more of a body buzzy kind of high so if you're looking for that maybe give this a try yeah it's kind of uh it's worth it's worth mentioning because it is different for me so I still think I'm gonna recommend this I'm not gonna recommend the fruity pebbles fruity whatever it's called but the chocolate chip cookie and the peanut butter bar I think I'm gonna recommend go ahead and pick them up I don't think they're as potent as recommended but if they're as cheap or cheaper wherever you grab them I think you'll be pretty pleased with them so that's gonna yeah yeah that's gonna do it for I think for our enjoy series don't get the crispys stick with the baked goods like these something that has a lot of fat and all that good stuff in it so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you watching as always thank you so much and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "_iZhqhBBTxQ": "what's going on buddy - boy opera finish take a hashtag for our such as Vinny makes you guys subscribe the channel hit the notification balance they're all up to date with all my videos follow me on Instagram an opera fitness and follow my band divided dimension on Spotify shameless plug before I start this video I got the perfect bar the original refrigerated protein bar dark chocolate chip paints bottom BAM dummy guys I tried a lot of these and I'm a fan of this is the dark chocolate chip peanut butter which is very similar to the outright chocolate chip peanut butter or peanut butter chocolate chip whatever they call it so I'm pretty excited about it you got 320 calories 19 grams of fat two grams of polyunsaturated you have 14 grams of monounsaturated fat 3 grams of saturated 2 grams of polyunsaturated 14 grams of monounsaturated 25 carbs 3 grams of fiber 18 grams of sugar 15 grams of protein and the sugars main boat the sugar is coming from organic honey then there's a Cedars pretty sure the only the only thing that sweetened is with is uh yeah looks like they just use honey for their source of sugar so it's a low yeah that's right because it's a low glycemic index so yeah they use honey to sweeten their shake because all organic there's 20 plus superfoods I don't know I don't know what's considered a superfood but there's 20 of them in here and then yeah but all the fats are healthy so this is pretty much a healthy as bar if you ask me very healthy it's opening up and give her a taste test Fred dimension these are the lie I didn't mention these the only bars I know of that you have to they have to be refrigerated so that's a little interesting I love the texture it just crumbles and it's definitely it's definitely peanut butter it's got that thick consistency see always getting thirsty you're eating peanut butter man this is this is good this is damn good I really them guys this is a damn good bar that's a nice chocolate chips on top it's organic it's got a awesome peanut butter taste keep in mind these are only at like Target and like random-ass places I think it's at Target Kroger Publix can't run the other place Oh Whole Foods those are the four places that I know for sure have them at least a quarter's our website they got a bunch of other flavors I think this is only like the third or fourth one I've tried but overall I'm a fan they're round like 250 peace which is pretty extreme if you ask me I mean maybe a dollar fifty dollar ninety-nine would be more preferable if you ask me well you know how everyone has they always jack up the prices look like you can't get anything healthy for a cheap price anymore forever I'm saying it sucks to try to eat healthy because it's expensive shipped so that's a damn good bargain keep in mind it says dark chocolate but I don't taste any dark chocolate I don't even like dark chocolate it's very bitter very uh [Music] not enjoyable that tastes like a regular charcoal chip to mean overall I think it's a great great product tastes awesome I'm a huge fan actually huge fan I'm gonna give this a 9 out of 10 9 on its head and that's

uh today i'm making not making dinner i am making uh a called a snack i like them for breakfast making peanut butter oatmeal bars um they're kind of a knockoff of those nature's valley ones that you can get they're kind of newish um and i just i think they're delicious um i love peanut butter i'll eat peanut butter any which way i can so first thing that we're gonna do and this is a super easy recipe that's my favorite part is it's literally one bowl mix everything boop boop in a pan and go so we are going to start with um some oatmeal sorry that was really noisy so we need one cup of uh quick coat cook oats dump that in the bowl there and then we need some flour we need a half a cup of flour if you want to make this gluten free you can use oat flour which is actually pretty easy to make just take your oatmeal and run it through a food processor um which i actually did the first time i made this one recipe but i'm not i don't have any gluten insensitivities so i just use regular old all-purpose flour but feel free to substitute with your alternative flowers as needed it will bake up just as nicely so half a cup of flour and then a little bit of maybe a half teaspoon of baking soda and a half teaspoon of salt so that's our dry ingredient so i'm just going to give them a little quick mix and then i'm just going to add the wet ones directly in to the bowl okay so let's do some sugar next um you need three quarters of a cup of sugary substance um i for this recipe i'm gonna do half a cup of brown sugar and a quarter cup of honey but you could do more honey if you wanted to um the original version of this i made had more honey in it it's just so expensive um so i just use more brown sugar than honey but feel free to go the opposite direction as needed um quarter cup that was a half a cup of the brown sugar so a quarter cup of honey and honey and peanut butter taste so nice together so you want to use at least partial honey and not just go straight for the brown sugar um see if we can get the rest of that to come out here it's also really sticky to work with one of the reasons i don't use honey in a ton of recipes is it's just so messy but it really does taste really nice in this recipe so definitely use it um so now let's do some peanut butter so we're doing three quarters of a cup of peanut butter so scoop out so i've been buying the big jar lately because i make these a lot because like i said they're great for breakfast because i not a morning person a lot of times when i'm getting ready for work i do not have time to eat a real breakfast i know i should but these have so much protein from the peanut butter um they're really you know they're delicious and easy and you know you just feel a little bit better eating something you made for breakfast instead of like a granola bar they're also more filling than a granola bar i think that's half a cup and then let's use this quarter cup measure so we can get our three quarters anybody make a three-quarter cup measure i've never seen a three-quarter cup measure so i always use a half one and then a quarter cup okay so there's our three quarters of a cup of peanut butter i love peanut butter like that's my favorite sort of flavor combination is peanut butter and anything peanut butter and jelly peanut butter and honey peanut butter and chocolate um peanut butter and spice like i love a peanut butter sauce a peanut sauce um for like chicken and stuff it's delicious so next we need a little bit of vanilla we need one teaspoon which is like approximately a cap full a couple extra drops and an egg which i'm going to crack into my measuring cup i already used so that way if there's any shells they're easier to see then dump that in so then these dirty measuring cups out of my way my egg shell get rid of that later okay so then you're going to mix it in um you can use a hand mixer um just be super gentle with it because you want to keep some of that oat texture you don't want it to get all beaten to a pulp and that's what i found using even the hand mixture on low as i have a tendency to beat it to a pulp to get the consistency so it's a little bit harder by hand but it's gonna be your result is gonna be a lot nicer um but if you don't like that sort of you know bite of oatmeal um then feel free use the hand mixer use a stand mixer you know whatever is easier for you so and you just want to mix until everything is incorporated you don't want any loose flour you want all of those all that oat to kind of get peanutty and i'll show you in a second here kind of a you're looking for when you're done get that last little bit of flour incorporated so yeah so this is what you're looking for something kind of this checks texture it's going to look like peanut butter with oatmeal in it um because that's what it is so you need a parchment lined baking dish um these are going to come out of the oven still super soft too soft to cut and eat so you need something that'll let you lift it out so it can cool and then once it's cooled you'll be able to cut them into bars um so don't try to put it in just a greased pan because you're gonna hate yourself so yeah just dump it in you can do an eight by eight or nine by nine square i have this weird like small rectangle pan that i like to use um that's about the same maybe a little bit more space than the 8x8 or the 9x9 but if you're using the 8x8 um then you'll want to bake these a little bit longer than i do um but i'll show you what they look like when they're baked so you know what to do and then just kind of push them almost like you would with a rice krispie treat or something kind of you know spread them out evenly until they get to the edges okay so once you have them spread out in one layer um they're gonna go in a 325 oven for i'm gonna put them in for like 22 minutes then you want to check them um it may take up to 30 and especially if you have like that eight by eight maybe even 35 minutes um forgot to add anything to these a lot of times i like to add chocolate chips or chopped peanuts um or raisins you know like a little extra something something but they're perfectly delicious without any okay so these have been cooling for about two hours um and i transferred them to a cutting board and here they are they make about 12 to 15. these ones are about this width um if you do the eight or nine inch pan um they might be a little bit thicker but they're delicious great for breakfast this porter one's a little stinky so i'm gonna go ahead and eat it now peanut butter", "TUPSwa4HzSA": "[Music] hello everyone welcome two weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary cuz nobody likes going to the dispensary spending twenty bucks edible getting home eating that gross thing and not getting high at all that's what we're here for so today we are looking at another product from looking at their cookies and cream bar today I have reviewed a couple of bars in the past and I have enjoyed them immensely they're not the best tasting things but they're 225 milligrams and they come in an incredibly small package really really worth it they hit as hard as advertised so today we are going to try the cookies and cream variety and I'm pretty excited about it alright let's open this bad boy up here and give a taste all right excuse me guys just a moment here roads rough roads there we go awesome okay so I've got our edible here here's its fancy little packaging on the inside shows you what it looks like nine little squares of 25 milligrams of weed each of course we're going to wear that and just eat the whole thing maybe even in two or three bites so without any further ado let's open up this aluminum foil and eat this sucker all right so there we go there's our cookies and cream bar nice and handsome looking slightly to Roma medium to heavy we taste but the cookies and cream parts good so it helps with the we taste but like with all the other punch parts there is a definite we taste in them so if you are sensitive to taste really hate the taste of marijuana give them a pass but for being so potent for such a small package I know I can move a pass than the taste front alright I believe this cost me $12 in dispensary in Southern California so they are pretty affordable for 225 milligram edible as well alright and with that guys I'm gonna polish this off and I will check you guys in about two hours to let you know how we're feeling thanks so much for watching I'll see you out of them I'm back it's been two hours welcome back punch bar cookies and cream like its predecessors it packs a wallop with just such a small tiny little package you gotta love that discreet this is my least favorite flavor I've tried so far just you know but it's a matter of preference if your cookies and cream white chocolate kind of fan you'll probably dig this one the others me don't like white chocolate don't like it as much as the others fair enough but I do how like how it makes me feel so if you see a punch bar in dispensary near you and it's not too expensive grab it you'll be happy you did unless you are really really really sensitive to taste I need something else and then you'll probably be happy that you got that but if you aren't that sensitive to taste get a punch bar yeah thanks for watching weeds guys we'll check out in the next video hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if there are any products that you want me to review in the future please leave a comment below and I'll be more than happy to try to find the product to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "ESpV0uweeeQ": "do you like chocolate do you like peanut butter do you chase protein I do have to answer yes to all three of those questions I normally eat a different brand of fetching bars but they don't have anything with peanut butter in them and just every now and then I've got out of peanut butter so I saw these at Walmart and purchased these and I'm going to give them a try the pure protein chocolate peanut butter bars it has a free bar in it you can turn down a bargain like that the pure Prai chain child like peanut butter caramel has 20 grams of protein for 119 calories it provides 15 percent of the RDA for calcium six percent of the RDA for iron I paid six dollars and 18 cents for this and it had the free bar in it so I got seven bars but normally at six bars there's the manufacturer's information as well as the website and phone number and you can pause this if you look closer look at the ingredients ingredients list see what the Pierre appraised for me I've always liked well it's a little bit smaller and the wrapping of all this bonding smells good so I'm really kind of looking for something just like gotta melt I carry punching bars with me in the car I eat one every day it worked for lunch some lists already about it melting there looks like it's got some crunchies in there it's got that caramel little layer it's got the chocolate around the basic look like a candy bar so I'm hoping the taste is good first heist is a young it's not bad comparing a quest chocolate chip cookie dough bar which has 200 calories and 21 grams of protein to the pure protein which has 190 calories and 20 grams of protein if your proteins on the bottom request is on the top so you see a difference in the size the quest bar is a little bit stickier the pure protein bar is a little bit thicker it looks more like a candy bar let's look at the inside of them well a bit harder to cut so stickier so the quest bar on the inside the pure protein bar on the inside I normally eat quest bars every day from lunch I really do like quest bars the peanut butter quest bars or not my my favorite so I was looking for something that was a little different this pure protein when it's really good I've had some pure protein bars the pastor didn't care for this one's really really good I'll be buying this pure protein peanut butter bar it has more of a candy bar flavor it's got that chewy nougat in there it's got a great peanut butter flavor little crunchies so it's a nice treat 490 calories in 20 pounds of protein thanks for watching my review at the pure protein chocolate peanut butter bar remember it's for you like subscribe leave a comment share this video photographer it and if you have time before you go wash down the video because I have a lot of them up

bar that I know of damn let's go and open up and give a taste test and I'll tell you what the I think of it very very similar to most protein bars I'd say it's pretty similar to most protein bars oh yeah it's got a nice protein it's got a nice peanut butter smoked okay okay say what you definitely need something to drink it's got that peanut butter consistency where it makes you thirsty no I'm saying nice install ma'am I've got a nice clean bar tastes nice meeting birthdays I will say this done making me thirsty I just bring that boom I taste like it's real food he's like it's a real peanut butter there's nothing like fake tasting going on to the dish room here in vain it's all gang that's a damn you barb I'd say it's really comparable to the right bar no the only thing that's missing is

you barb guys this I like the consistency too I really do hmm have you guys another elroy bar yet that's exactly what this days like kind of it's pretty similar the only thing you're missing is the chocolate chips which they do make a protein or a perfect chocolate chip peanut butter bar so I'm assuming that one's gonna taste really closely all right Bart but guys it tastes like real peanut butter there's a real good taste that consistency is awesome it's all real food it's nice and soft easy to eat the only thing I could say is it makes you thirsty but I mean that's peanut butter you know Sam it's a nice sweet peanut birthdays how the damn debar makes me thirsty guys it's good it is good it's got 20 superfoods gluten-free low glycemic index does they use natural honey instead of cane sugar and  I don't think this cane sugar is their king sir I only see honey in here as far as the sugar source so thankful where it is guys mmm this is a damn good bar and this is only this is only at Whole Foods and Target I'm pretty sure that like our stores around me you know their website you can see there's other places that they carry him but these are pretty good bars this is not the first one either I tried you know the other two would Joe think they're with Joe and they're pretty impressive bars for what they are I like them I'm gonna give that a 9 out of 10 I think that's a

at Meijer so they're not cheap but you do get to how many bar five bars per box so I think they're both about the same amount of calories 190 calories per bar protein okay so these are just creamy peanut butter and those are chocolate peanut butter chocolate so I think we should try just supplying first there's no special way to open them about believe jet bars are made from these are a chocolate layer to granola bar delicious creamy Jif peanut butter for a truly tasty snack and then you just say chip bars are made with chewy granola and our delicious jiff cream Egypt peanut butter for the great taste you know and love yeah easy to eat on the go and a good source of protein everybody is sure to make you smile Munson and these are made they went a hundred one hundred ninety calories 100 of that in fact Wow over half these are made in Orrville Ohio but they're a bunch of Canada which ones in Lexington yeah it's Jeff yeah yes there's a sod there's the top oh it smells it smells wonderful every smells but it smells like your peanut butter bar that you ate every morning that's good it reminds me a lot of peanut butter ball mostly even more except mine has actual peanut there and though it doesn't and that's what our minds like 170 that is really good though that is it's very good the only thing I miss is the peanuts yeah yeah I like that texture fighting through the pain a little bit but these taste like peanuts salted sweet salty peanut bars yeah these aren't as good they aren't as good but they're right there if they had got peanuts these are good they're not something I do all the time so far but um but they out really bad well good flavor to them the texture is good and the granola is not hard and crunchy which I hate hard crunchy granola it's good in salt and yeah overall it's pretty good here's the top one looks promising that looks exactly like the other one except there's chocolate ominous tune to smell the package it doesn't have the strong peanut strong peanut butter smell smell it smells good it like peanut butter but it doesn't smell as strong as the pure peeler Bombur that chocolate peanut better play off of each other really really well I like this move that it's not sweet chocolate I like it but this is why I said the chocolates not really strong so don't don't expect to get wow that's really gonna toppling but the chocolate peanut or go good together that's why I kind of like it but it's not like a racist Oh No strong chocolate no right but I do like the texture of the granola the granola is a good texture is soft chewy not dry yeah that does give you something to chew on but I think for me I like the peanut butter better just because I'm a peanut butter lover and it has that true Jeff flavour that peanut butter did you compare do you think it's very comparable to the peanut butter yeah humor is good it's not sweet is like the pure peanut butter right but it is really good not take all these whole things there if you like peanut butter try them out that's really all you could do at 3:49 it's all hot four five bars because nah not the necrovalley ones are only like 250 to $3.00 dollars though but these are a dollar more but still well we're trying out if you like being in them yes absolutely so hopefully you enjoyed getting to see those out of the package like we did and thanks for watching oh I did whatever on the inside sorry just is a quick aside there's the chocolate one either one I'm on the inside that's what they look like on the inside with the granola sorry no you guys to see what she said thats i wanna show you", "dMAuvYk-isQ": "[Music] let's grab a british apartment for this day before i start this video make sure you guys subscribe to the channel hit that notification stay up to date with all the videos follow me on instagram and i'm finishing follow my band dev item and shine spotify everything you know be in the description box below give it a bit of thumbs up doesn't cause you guys penny helps channel gross i really appreciate if you hit the thumbs up button let's get to the review today yay let's get to the review today let's show some gains first a little bit of gains there we go there we go there we go all right so the review today is on skippy protein peanut butter who the knew that skippy had a peanut butter that was has protein i didn't know i had no idea i was scrolling through amazon and it was like in the recommended or something i'm like skippy's got protein peanut butter so i got both flavors they ain't got no inclusions or anything they just got the standard og flavors here crunchy and creamy okay by asking yourself well how much does this cost well on their website on on on on amazon's website four dollars for a tub so it's actually pretty pretty reasonably priced four dollars for a regular tub of peanut butter um you know i got both tubs for eight bucks it was free shipping with prime i believe so price point's solid you know um when you're looking at the label it's basically just peanut butter with a little bit more protein just a little bit so two tablespoons 16 calories about 210 calories 16 fat 3 grams of saturated fat 6 carbs 2 fiber 3 sugar 10 grams of protein um and it's basically just peanut butter the ingredients is peanut butter roasted peanuts sugar hydrogenated vegetable oil soybean rapeseed to prevent separation salt and pea protein peanut oil um so typically i'm not a fan of hydrogenated oils usually i get natural peanut butter if i get peanut butter at all you know with like palm oil or something but i really want to try this out so um hydrogenated vegetable not a fan of definitely would suggest uh getting the the real peanut butter that doesn't have hydrogenated oils uh go with the natural peanut butter that's got like palm oil or whatever so anyways that's my opinion on that let's go into a taste test actually i'll open it up show you what the texture looks like and then and then i will show you all right then i'll do a taste test okay so i already got these ready to roll that's what it looks like it actually looks exactly like regular peanut butter this other one boom it's like peanut butter with peanuts on it here we go regular peanut butter here we go taste test the texture is exactly like regular peanut butter it tastes like regular peanut butter and i got this weird aftertaste going on it tasted like regular peanut butter yeah it's like it's like lingering in my taste buds it literally tastes like regular peanut butter for like the first minute almost and then all of a sudden it's like what the hell was that i don't know what that is i don't know yeah there's something going on with this i hope it's not just a batch i'm gonna go this other one guys there's like a weird aftertaste and i can only assume that it's the pea protein i can only assume it's the beetroot all right here we go with this one looks exactly like peanut butter okay there's a roller peanut butter let's see if there's a weird aftertaste going on okay yeah i think it's there yeah it's there i don't know what it is i'm not a fan of it it's gotta be it's gotta be the p protein it tastes like regular peanut butter and then it out of nowhere has this weird aftertaste not a fan of them i thought i was gonna be a fan of them skippy how the can you come out with this i have some weird ass going on the name brand guys skippy  skippy unbelievable i don't know what that weird taste is it's got to be pea protein though guys it tastes like regular peanut butter it looks like regular peanut butter and then out of nowhere and it's delayed it's delayed this weird taste comes in so as far as ratings i'd say the front end is decent really good it's a normal peanut butter type of taste and then the back end not good so got to call a spade a spade here guys [Music] yeah uh ratings i'm gonna give this i'm gonna give them both 6.5 there's just something not right with it something not right is this out of deep nope it's indeed these are brand new 6.5 guys not a fan don't don't get them don't try them i mean you can if you want to but i'm not suggesting it so other than that guys

"0YYKYGDfC-A": "[Music] welcome ladies and gentlemen to my new food channel um let's get started and make some homemade protein bars that are very healthy delicious and have low calories all right guys just to get started we're gonna put three quarters of peanut butter uh in this little saucepan that i have here this saucepan actually allows me not to burn anything if you don't have a designated saucepan then you can use a bowl and heat it up over simmering water in a pot but for this video i'm going to use my own little sauce pan that i have i'm going to use three quarters of this peanut butter it's extra creamy it's from the independent supermarket store if you live in canada i think they're amazing it's one of the best peanut butter in the market in my opinion it's super creamy and apparently there's nothing in here that is really bad for you and the calorie count is quite low as well i think it's almost very dodgy i don't know how they they managed to make peanut butter super smooth and super silky creamy without adding anything crazy in there but here you can see this is almost like a nutella texture i think it's great and it tastes great it's insane [Music] just like that fill it right in here make it almost full don't tell me this is not satisfying all right next we're going to be adding a third cup of honey i use this one it's manuka honey it's got the active ingredients that you know the healthy manuka honey has from new zealand i'm not actually going to measure it accurately i'm just going to you know do it as much as i think it's necessary to put it in here and if you want to be very accurate and of course you have to measure it uh i however don't really care so i'm just gonna put as much as i think is sufficient but you're supposed to put one third for it to be sufficiently sweet next i'm gonna put two tablespoons of coconut butter so i use this one this one is organic um and i ran out of coco coconut butter oopsie okay that's not a problem instead i'm going to be using uh olive oil so this is my emergency replacement of my coconut oil i'm gonna be using olive oil instead it doesn't really matter i'm italian anyway we put olive oil on everything olive oil is really healthy too so two tablespoons of that in here as well and then what we're going to be doing now is basically heating the pan up on a super super low heat it's only supposed to heat up so that the elements can actually mix and become one substance so it's not actually necessary to cook it forever or to actually heat it up to a abnormal hot temperature [Music] this is essentially it this is how it's supposed to look like uh right now it looks like basically liquid caramel which is really sexy i have to say i mean look at this look at this soft smooth texture right there this is so satisfying jesus christ anyways i'm gonna leave it at that that's how it's supposed to look like you're not supposed to heat it up any more than that alrighty so let's continue by transferring this into a pot to this pot [Music] here next we're gonna be using two cups of oat flour that i have already prepared here i'm gonna use already prepared oat flour if you don't have oat flour you could theoretically just buy normal oils and grind them up and make your own flour i prefer to just buy it so you don't have to do the extra work um but you put two cups of oat flour into your mix [Music] all right next we're going to be using the key ingredient which is my protein powder i'm really fond of this brand because they're not using anything bad there's literally no chemicals in here it's pretty natural it tastes really really good as well so we're gonna be using two scoops for the mix [Music] put two scoops of whey protein into the mix just like this [Music] we're also going to be using three tablespoons of milk flax seeds three tablespoons so the next step now we're going to put some cinnamon here you can really put as much as you want you should start with either a quarter of a teaspoon is the minimum and then you can go as crazy as you want i don't know how how much you really like cinnamon i like it more so i'm probably going to put around half a spoon or an entire teaspoon of cinnamon powder it's really up to you i like it personally a lot i think it's a it adds great flavor to the to the protein bars and it's also really healthy so and we're going to put a quarter of a teaspoon of salt um i'm just going to use rat uh just table table salt add that in there put a little bit of a little bit extra i like it when there's a little bit of salt in there just adds more flavor i know it's not the healthiest but whatever then we're gonna add some chocolate again you can put as much as you want uh it's recommended to start off with a third cup of chocolate chips i mean you can put as much as you want i'm probably going to put exactly a third because i don't want too much sugar in my my protein bars i want it to be lean and healthy it's just supposed to be a daily kind of healthy ortional snack that you can make at home which tastes really really great [Music] alrighty as a last step now we're gonna mix everything together that we have in this little bowl here and then this is going to create our final dough [Music] me [Music] [Music] [Music] so so all i've done in the end literally is i added a little bit of water because when you see that the consistency is a little bit dry um you want to add a little bit of water just to make really dough out of it and it's going to look basically like cookie dough like now and then what we're gonna be doing next is with this on a tray and then we're gonna leave it in the fridge for one hour i only found this tray so i'm gonna be making some very skinny looking protein bars which is probably going to suck but whatever it's the only thing we have right now this is another technique that i use sometimes i just fold the baking paper and it's very easy to create those these smooth smooth edges alrighty so we prepared the dough uh the dough looks pretty excellent i'd say to solidify this i'm gonna put it for exactly five minutes in the oven 200 degrees celsius and uh just just for it to solidify i don't want the chocolate pieces to completely melt i'm literally just gonna put it in for five minutes so that the shape doesn't doesn't crumble and then i put it in the fridge for an hour or so and then we can cut the shape and it should all look amazing [Music] also just to show you guys the texture of the cookie um before you think what is this on my nail this is cookie dough right there okay so don't think anything else anyways um look how soft i don't know if you can tell look at that oh this is exactly what we wanted [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so it's ready the next day um to be very honest with you guys i already tried the bar last night while i was watching netflix unfortunately i was too tired to take a video um the bar itself was really really good i was planning on having one instead i had five that's how good it was i think the consistency was was actually amazing uh inside it was pretty gooey outside it was nice and and not crunchy but it had that that texture to it it's just perfect when you bite inside of the cookie or the bar i'm gonna call it the cookie bar uh the only thing that i would probably change for next time is to add a little bit more honey and put less salt because i think it was a little bit too salty it wasn't salty by any means i just thought that the salt was a little bit too dominant but i also have certain ideas to add some hazelnut and maybe some oat milk for next time see what happens uh it's i'm basically gonna record my first trial next week see how that goes and maybe it's gonna taste better nevertheless i i thought it was probably gonna be a more honest review to try the the bars the next day to see if the consistency is still that good um so i'm gonna have uh my first bite now all right guys i got the bars here they're still looking pretty good i don't know if you can see it in the camera properly and this is how they look like it still feels quite gooey actually the inside wow the texture is really really interesting i don't know if you guys can tell but um maybe if i try to crumble crumble it a little [Music] bit hmm it's really good as i said like the aftertaste there's a little bit of you just taste it there's a little bit too much salt but the taste itself is really good the consistency change it's not gooey inside anymore now it literally has the almost the same texture as a protein bar just just the meat without the chocolate covering on top so you have that very similar taste it's almost like a i don't know how to describe it it's almost like you know those those christmas cookies uh the same texture but it's a full-on protein bar and it's super healthy i mean there's there's oatmeal in there there's flax seeds in there there's manuka honey we have cinnamon which is actually very healthy i don't know if you guys are aware of it protein powder and all that so this is for sure a healthy snack i'm actually just gonna have i guess four pieces a day it should cover my daily amount of what i should be eating and as i said next week i'm probably gonna film another video where i'm going to attempt of doing these bars again but i'm going to put less salt i'm going to put actual coconut oil i'm going to put old milk and i'm going to put more cinnamon and a little bit more honey and i'm actually also going to change the brand of the protein powder i found another one that probably has a better better flavor for this kind of product um but yeah thank you so much for watching if you guys want to try this at home have a go at it i think it's definitely worth it and tune in for next time", "xMRNJMX3OX4": "[Music] what's going on but it's your problem for this a cash today guys before i start this video make sure you guys

that's on instagram snapchat and a youtube we have nuts and more so long long time ago i reviewed the nuts and more and um i did not like them i thought they were pretty bad um but long story short i got this birthday cake one for christmas right and i'm like it's got a new label on it i haven't really  with it in a long time long story short me and sarah tried it literally on christmas day and that's what we got left so we've already tried the birthday cake but we like this flavor so much i was like i'm gonna try buying some other flavors and get a little bit more of a you know uh you know a little bit more of a variety and see if we like the other ones too because i was not expecting it to like it that much and it was so good um and she thought the same thing so i bought i bought salted caramel i bought cookie butter and they have a ton of other flavors like a ton so um you know i'm a big fan of the the whole nut protein butters and um i was really impressed because you know all the other brands i've been following like the bomar the uh the cookie butter from uh well it's called kings lion now they changed their name um and there's other cookie there's other nut butters that i've been a big fan of so these ones definitely thought it was a good idea to try them out so when you look at the price point these are actually really really affordable um compared to like the bone marrow like i said and the king's lion nut butters and all the other ones oh american dream butter that's another one uh the price point was actually 12 or 13 for 16 ounces now i believe the bulmar is only 10 ounces for 10 and i believe the uh the kings lion is like i can't remember off the top of my head but it's around like 15 a tub and that's for like 16 ounces so these are actually like more affordable than like the other nut butters and i actually got it on a bogo 50 so i actually got it for what 18 for two so i actually got these for like nine dollars a tub now i'm not saying that there's always gonna be a sale or not but definitely they are an affordable type of nut butter when you're looking at the macros i'm gonna go ahead and look at the salted caramel one i'm not really sure what the one that's on the screen is gonna be hopefully it's the same one but they're pretty much the same 190 calories i think they're all the same yeah they're all the same 190 calories 14 fats seven carbs three grams of fiber one gram of sugar four grams of sugar alcohol 11 grams of protein ingredients are pretty basic peanuts whey protein isolate natural sweetener which is xylitol peanut oil palm oil flax natural caramel sunflower less than in sea salt super basic label not bad um so we already know what the birthday cake one is we're gonna go ahead and redo it and then we're going to give us the ratings and we're going to try these other ones let's do the other ones first time all right all right by the way i already did stir these up when i first got them they were super i mean super like wet on top and like you know you had to mix it up otherwise it was going to look good so the texture is definitely like perfect almost like look at that look at that texture do you think that texture is perfect i think it is yeah this one is actually different well i already got the spoon wet so i guess we're gonna try it all right go ahead try it out all right i'm gonna show you the texture of the other ones well we'll do it when we try all right all right boy you are in my house i know salted caramel peanut butter what you think good look at that oh man here we go tastes like peanut butter you definitely got like a little bit of a caramel background i like it it's definitely not better than a birthday cake though i don't know that much this is just straight-up peanuts you're not tasting salted caramel ever so slightly we'll write it out when i when i taste it i don't think of oh caramel you think peanut butter i think oh straight up peanut butter and there's like some like aroma of a flavor right like i'm like struggling to find it it's not like in my face yeah i agree it's not super apparent um this one is this texture is a little bit different this is the cookie butter look at the cookie butter on this one it's like it's less soupy and i mix it up the same so i don't know but that's that's the texture you're getting here as the texture you're getting this is i'd say this is probably more of a perfect spreadable texture cookie butter here we go it's not giving me that biscoff taste it's doing me more like um peanut butter gingerbread ish this is like straight-up gingerbread tasting and i'm not a fan i like it but it's not cookie butter it's like gingerbread peanut butter what's the ingredients natural flavor i think it tastes like there's no ginger in here or anything it tastes like straight-up ginger i'll tell you that much it's good i think this might be my least favorite one i think that's my least favorite too the birthday cake that shit's almost gone guys going to the birthday cake i'm not a fan of this one so the birthday cake is even less like the other ones like it's like super thick i mean look like it's not going nowhere like it's but it's i'd say this this texture is really good too like i don't know i don't know which texture i like the best but yeah it's not very spreadable it's it's kind of thick and it's not really going anywhere it's almost like a dough we go i love that one it's like peanut butter and then like vanilla birthday cake texture is great get like little crystals of like sugar or something maybe sprinkles i'm not sure you get this you get the little sprinkle crystals i don't even like birthday cake but i already know this is my favorite you know like birthday cake it's like you don't know me it's like i don't know where you guys i think i think our subscribers here know more about me but why do you like it then i don't know because it's like good it's like i don't know it tastes like literally what it says it's birthday cake peanut butter but i think they did a really good job with it i don't even want you to close it i don't have to all right we're going to rain them i'm thinking cookie butter's my least favorite um i'm ready to break that one are you ready to rate this one i think so three two one eight point two five oh you really didn't like that one 8.25 i recommend anybody looking into it to not get it unless you like gingerbread salted caramel hold on okay three two one eight point seven five and the birthday cake you ready you ready that one um i'm thinking i don't wanna i don't want to miss you you don't want to miss smoke no i don't want to misspeak misspoke past tense well you're eating the whole jar while you're thinking so i'm trying to be fair here hold on salted caramel get 8.75 so all right i'm ready right three two one nine point five yeah i really liked it a lot i'm trying to i thought you're gonna write a little bit higher like 9.25 or something i gotta it definitely hits that nine factor because like i'm not a fan of birthday cake flavors but this for some reason smash for some reason it's a really good flavor yeah um you know i might try the other flavors if i get my hands on them eventually but so far these are the three out of like 10 flavors they got obviously i i like these damn doggo back there he's exploring um i like these butters a lot um i mean when i tried them literally like four years ago they were very very trash and i didn't even know they reformulated them i thought they just put a new label on them i thought they just put a new label on them oh my god give the video a like for doggo so everyone say hi to max everyone's saying hi to max oh my god everyone has to give the video like now it's coming come on like i swear to god if i see a dislike i will hunch you down i will hunt you down dammit you don't want to know what'll happen all right guys i hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure you guys follow me on my social media it will be in the description box below follow sarah will be in the description box below everything you need to know will be the description box below oh jumped over you jump yeah finish it close it just close it um what else are they going to say about these oh comment down below if you guys have tried these the new formula what you guys thought comment down below your favorite nut butter and other than that guys i hope you guys enjoyed this video and we'll check you guys later", "bRFl9FtRv4M": "today I'm going to try these v8 protein bars they're new we bought these admire for basically five dollars which is a little on the high end for a bar I'm usually you pay like 250 between well if you get my setting in for two dollars sometimes most of the 250 to three dollars so five dollars is like really expensive this figure one is the chocolate peanut butter it's 210 calories per bar which is Aloha - there's the picture on the back of what's in it so it has peanuts and chocolate and carrots soy proteins brown rice syrup and sweet potatoes and I think it's 1/4 cup equivalent of vegetables in each bar so you get 1/4 of a cup of vegetables which you can hide your vegetables in stuff that tastes better than vegetables and that's a good thing so let me get this open and I'll be right back but about that it's having difficulties here's what the bar the package looks like so if you you see him out by themselves si I'm gonna listen even admire I think I know I saw a guy at Meijer I've never actually seen in anywhere else I've never seen me Walmart on a proto or any place I've only seen in a minor that's a good event here's the bar in my hand pretty dark they're getting soft though I mean that's a very very soft bar the plumbers kind of do it's gonna bitter up it's got that grimy sand fill which I don't like so once it maybe the soy protein they have that in there now and I look for things that have soy protein and I get those because that I do not like the texture at all that grainy it feels like you're taking a handful of dirt and evening that's how that's what it feels like you've got the small grainy texture don't like it at all flavor-wise it's it's just okay this one's not the best ones you know um I don't mind the texture because for me it gives my teeth something extra to chew on and it makes me feel like I'm cutting more to eight that probably sounds crazy but it just does I didn't think it was bad now I would eat these down i mean i wouldn't buy them again but if somebody offered me one yes I know yeah the greatness I'm nobody's is a much finer grain though I can feel on my tongue I feel under my tongue and fill all my teeth I mean it's just gross I need to go brush my teeth I don't actually like the flavor of this it feels like I can actually taste the vegetables I know it's maybes crazy but it seems like why I've had another one I don't remember having that flavor to it at this one this one I can taste something in there I just don't care for and then chocolate and peanut butter just aren't really awesome know anything about it's a little bit of a peanut taste it's not really peanut butter it's more just a pea white peanut flavor um I would never look at these again when I eat it yeah if I was starving to death I'm gonna eat it as the way of sustaining myself but not dying but beyond that I wouldn't eat these again I would give it a two honestly out of five because they're just not worth especially for that much money that's crazy money to pay for something that's really crazy money I would give it a three yeah that is a lot of money so yeah thanks for watching", "0YTCBvAZZfI": "today Kevin and I are gonna try the brand-new beat-up protein bars they're all peanutbutter flavored there's three of those there's a three-night Tina or directly from the company from beat-up they have free shipping it's always free shipping which i think is pretty cool because shipping keeps me from ordering from a lot of companies there's been many times where I would order would order in a heartbeat and then it's like the shipping is outrageous and $20 packages and $15 said right exactly some places there was something I was going to order something from I remember what Bart was yeah I won't play on here but I was gonna order a different bar and the shipping was gonna be as much as the bar the cost so I said no not gonna do that anyway Valerie told me about this oh thank you very much Valerie we bought three of the other flavors of be approaching murder we haven't tried those yet I wanted to try the new ones for you and she said that they're so good you don't have to heat them up she said of course they're gonna heat it up but you don't have to need them up so we're gonna try we'll go over them as as we try them first what we have is just plain peanut butter right yeah this be the letter B you P be up and they sent me the Box had a note it is that they they thanked me for ordering from them and they sent me a trial sizes of two of their other ones that I had just watered GNC but that's okay cuz they didn't have to send me anything I hope that was pretty cool so Kevin is trying to open this package carefully for you because I normally ask me pictures of everything before we add them but with these I wanted I couldn't use the information quite correct because of its kind of just you can have said you wouldn't know read it so he's trying to open it carefully so that I couldn't take pictures of it flat looks like a piece of peanut butter fudge there Chris this peanut butter bar is 220 calories just too bad that's the whole bar it smells like you're paying about our College not quite as peanut buttery when you taste it no no I'm gonna flavor there at all it's not a powerful peanut butter it has a very mild flavor but I like it there's a lot of things that I don't like the peanut butter immediately and the peanut butter turns me off and this actually has a nice peanut butter flavor even though it's mild very much I think super-marv so that was good I don't know I don't know wolf sings like you've got a spoonful peanut butter and you've already gotten the peterborough you licked it to get this a little bit of peanut require it up to that's what this one is it was very soft though very saw oh yeah almost like a creamy texture almost like a yeah there's no like there's light at the top and dark at the bottom I guess depending on which way you hold it and do you see how it's been danger that's all that's how soft it is so it's not a hard bar I mean that's that's nice and it has some marbling of that white in there these aren't super dense bars not like cuss bars are good but they're very dense bars these aren't they don't seem very dense you might be able to see that color better there I'll taste the vanilla yeah definitely don't really get much of a feel our overall the end I don't wish them any peanut butter it's all vanilla what kind of vanilla would you compare that with like a cream can't even all maybe yeah I've got an opinion about the first two I'm like I say yeah I'll try the car but yeah that's kind of it kind of is like a cream candy it's very it's a very light light flavor the peanut butter you don't hiss the peanut butter at all no they called it vanilla marshmallow cream yeah so if you're like yeah that's what I'm getting from it it's more of a that's more of a marshmallow flavor than peanut butter and what is this like that looks like a beat them candy this one is peanut butter and jelly this one has like little chunky things on the bottom and it is 210 calories a little chunky thanks the other ones yeah I don't know what they are but the other ones were peanut butter they didn't have any of that I got one you definitely get like a strawberry flavor mm-hmm good thing she's jolly me it tastes like strawberry well that's the kind of jelly I would think it was with no peanut butter yeah it is it's strawberry yeah no peanut butter no no peanut butter it says it has peanuts in it I'm sure guys with their ground up so that you don't I'm saying if you're buying them for the peanut butter I wouldn't bomb just because you're not gonna taste the peanut butter and in the first one it was so mild my opinion I'm gonna go on further that if you're buying any of these for flavor you're going in the wrong flower because I don't really think the peanut butter and jelly wouldn't had a lot of that strawberry berry flavor but it wasn't super strong it wasn't like you were actually eating something it was just like I don't know I can't describe like you've gotten a spray of like a strawberry spray in your mouth and it's gone you know I mean it's literally that light it's like I know exactly what it tastes like you know those little puffs that Gavin got those little flavored little puff things at dissolving your that's what it's so light of flavor that I in fact now comment I was gonna wait for it's over the end I don't like the texture of them they like did you like the texture I know I don't care for it I like something to billow more substantial like I'm actually eating something these when you eat them they almost dissolve in your mouth and have almost like little grains of nothing just like they go away it's just I didn't learn that I was just me Kevin's particular about his bar I like I like a little bit of texture make me feel like I'm eating something when I eat these I feel like I'm eating something there's nothing really to - there's no do you think it was because you took a small bite no cuz I would take that size by anyone who took a bite out of three of them so yeah but I would take that cells bite anyway I'm not gonna I'm gonna take a small by anybody making my honest this these weren't horrible by any means they weren't bad but for three dollars I think I'd rather buy a quest bar or something like that over these what was your favorite out of the three just because it had the only one that really hanging flavor was the peanut butter and jelly that's like the best because and I agree with him it had the most flavor out of any of them now the vanilla did have a vanilla / marshmallow flavor to it and it was nice but it was mild definitely the peanut butter and jelly had the most flavor so if you're if you're thinking about maybe which one of the three if you don't want to spend six dollars then I would get that one if you had to choose one just because you're gonna get a lot of flavor from it but I do have to agree with him that if you do want a lot of flavor you would want to choose the quest just because they do have a lot and they're not that many more time well actually some of them are less scour yeah yeah the best ones their little tagline is life is not what you are it's about what you can be and with the right fuel be up believes you can unlock your unlimited potential that's why we go where no bar has gone before blending the highest quality nutrients with select mouth-watering ingredients to deliver advanced nutrition that simply tastes better it's time to be active it's time to be healthy it's time you better above all it's time to be up I just do not agree about the simply tastes better I just done I'm sorry if you're fans of the bars I know the person I recommend to these two you really like something but they should he likes to be fair she likes the quest bars a lot - yeah the quest bars are just so much better they are they are better and as a matter of fact in her last trip to the restorer she showed that she bought the wrong questions so but anyway traum yeah I'm always open to new bars because you never know when you're going to hit something that's like wow three others and we will be trying those and they might have a lot more flavors than these I don't know that she had ever tried the peanut butter she told me that they were brand new she's tried the other one and to be honest the quest peanut butter ones don't taste any good either no the quest peanut yeah yeah I don't like the gamey we didn't like any of the quest Peter but I don't think we liked it so to be fair yeah maybe it's just the peanut butter because they really can't put peanut butter in there because there's so much fat and calories and peanut butter that they can't use that so maybe maybe it's just the peanut butter you thought about that yeah we did not we wouldn't recommend the peanut butter quest bars to anybody know some of these so but we'll be trying the other ones soon so hopefully we will like those better so thanks for watching", "Kp5TaYlOy3M": "today we're gonna try test out which crunchy peanut butter is better the whole thing's coming from I really love Trader Joe's organic and no salt crunchy peanut butter but I don't want to risk my livelihood a supermarket to buy them so now I disorder my peanut butter online why online all these brands I'm not familiar with I don't know which ones better so I would have punched for them just try test out and so from my left to ride a ranked is ranking by the calories so the life it is a smallest calories per serving is 180 this two is 190 these two hundred and what why try each of them I will tell you the nutrition fact and test so the start and this is peanut butter and cold hmm has another crunching side that should be goose as to test taste okay really crunchy mmm pretty sweet oh okay this is on the sweet side mushy total sugar is for G Chu ji no sugar how about sodium mohandro okay yeah I need a water to refresh my page okay so peanut butter cold is on the sweet side it has a sugar for gene sodium 100g pathan that's one Skippy is that how pronounced escaping skipping skipping skipping oh wow so has a really smooth texture to it it has a good texture of like a mix of a creamy and a crunchy yeah my dogs here he's crazy he's dripping Skippy mmm they've rid of roasted peanut butter while the penis well hmm headstrong [Music] sorry that's my dog yeah you know Bobby I know you want them but let me finish in the first let me try first one I'd give you the one of the most healthy well game this was a little more like extra added like flavor inside I see this one has more sodium 125 compare this one personally is 100 this 125 sugar Oh actually this one has less sugar 3G so 1g lie less okay but this one has a more sodium 25 mg sodium okay I think skippy definitely tastes better than the peanut butter in a cold so we'll leave this one out so escapees here Skippy oh can you say it Skippy chief do you have is that how pronounced nah I'm not sure because tastes more important than the part on pronunciation right again that's my dog I know Bobby bigger boy see damn hmm the deep river the realistic the ruleset  is very similar to escaping but I feel it it has more than natural peanut butter taste that more added sugar or artificial flavoring let me check the nutrition factor sugar 3G ok is the same as ask AP sodium this one has less sodium okay no wonder why this is less artificial mmm I personally like that kind of natural peanut butter taste so I think I like this one better so far Jeff Sosuke peace out Jeff so number one my favorite my favorite favorite this one the peanut butter I got it from Weidman's [Music] mmm British sweet just a very similar like that keen about a coal OC oh wow okay this sure was the same 3G sodium's by 130 mg so I think maybe that kind of sweet anaphase your taste is really coming from the sodium I don't I don't really like that this much yeah this one's up sorry bo-buddies gonna wait alright last one last one is a Peter Pan right oh wow so this one just seems really dry that's too something out another story is why buy these they from brands I'm not too sure about the mega sizes and this one says 16 ounces this one says 40 ounces I have no idea how big each of them and turn out 16 the regular on em I'm thinking to buy and this one's a double size by the way I'm you know I have a bow B and I we can finish with a boom re alright last one let's try no really crunchy how's this big franchise like mmm on a dry side it's really dry it tastes like has lice out of facial taste but just really dry okay so it's less sodium sugar is the same at this one it's really dry hmm I think if this one's more a little creamier I will very hard to tell we try and look better oh come on Bobby just wait a little moment but personally I like Jeff better I think it has a really good texture the creamy and the crunchy together and also it doesn't have that strong artificial taste I think the artificial taste is really coming from the sodium how much is sodium it is when when they put too much sodium inside the solving inside it tastes like sweet like kind of weird it just covered up peanut butter a natural flavor so I really recommend all these companies Skippy peanut butter cold can you please add a more buna a light sugar I think the peanut butter is soft it tastes amazing you don't need any other artificial flavor just cover it up and please no did I tell you how BIG's the teaspoon this is a teaspoon sighs and the serving serve the serving size of 2 teaspoon like this size before I think all those feelings are teaspoon I didn't know teaspoons measure bird so it's okay I nice ones teaspoon I just my tea spoon so this is my tea spoon finally I highly recommend a G and tell me what's your favorite bread or peanut butter what do you usually eat with I love to hear from you thank you bye", "M9PwQcBc7W0": "hey guys I am super excited I just got something in the mail and I thought I would open it show you guys what it is and maybe taste a few of them so I have the super fat this is the variety pack of nut butters that this company's super fat makes they actually reached out to me I looked into their company and their ingredients because that is a big deal to me I want to make sure that the ingredients are clean and everything before I try something and share it with you guys so let's go ahead and open this up so there's five different flavors in here there's a protein the second flavor is a macadamia MCT and probiotics interesting there is the macadamia coconut but I think it sounds so good a cacao coconut and a coffee and MCT so this is what they look like so my first impression is actually like I really like these because I can travel with these so nut butter is an amazing way to get your belly full on the go and it's just a great source of healthy fat and protein and all of that good stuff so if you're on a paleo or ketogenic diet I did look into these and they are both though those diet friendly it's also they're also vegan and quite a few of them have some really great ingredients some of them have a stevia and some of them don't so let's go ahead and try these so um you do have to like knead them a little bit I do notice just feeling them that macadamia MCD and probiotics is a little thinner which I actually like because I like putting nut butters like on top of my oatmeal or even like into my smoothies and I don't like them super thick when I use them that way if I'm drinking like if not drinking but if I'm eating these like on the go I wouldn't really care but I'd like to have a nice like drizzle on some toast or something like that so let's try the macadamia MCT and probiotics so this is made with macadamia nuts MCT oil powder cinnamon pink Himalayan salt and a probiotic in here so mmm okay good it's like not too much cinnamon but enough cinnamon to give it like a nice flavor this MCT oil powder does not leave a actor taste or even a taste at all I can't taste it honestly just takes taste like a really good nut butter and then I want to try the cacao coconut so this is gonna be like a chocolaty coconut butter almonds and cacao butter a couple other different things Emily and salt mm-hmm this is good okay it's like kind of like crunchy with the salt okay that's the cacao coconut that is so good it's a little thicker than the last one but I really really like it coffee and MCT this would be a great way to either fill yourself up for breakfast I already know I am going to be putting some of these in my bag for myself and my son just as like snacks on the go and then we all know I'm sure we've heard of if we're not even on the keto diet the ketogenic diet is definitely all about those healthy fats and proteins which all of these have so it is a great way they're all really low in sugar there's no added sugar to any of them I'm gonna need this one a little more and I think this is the last one I'm going to taste with you guys I'm super impressed by those other two but I just wanted to try these with you guys and tell you my first impressions this company actually like I said earlier reached out to me I had never heard of them before but once I looked into them I was definitely interested because they're like I said earlier their ingredients are really clean the only thing so this one has stevia and we're gonna see sometimes stevia to me leaves like a little bit of an aftertaste errand I don't like it so I'm a little leery of this one but let's see wait okay so this one has stevia in it too and I literally didn't even taste it I was like wait okay so the cacao coconut has stevia in it and I didn't even taste it that is it that is actually huge because every other product I've ever like ever tasted whether it be bars or protein powder anything like that that has stevia in it I can like immediately taste the stevia and it turns me off and I don't like it I won't eat it I won't normally buy things with stevia but God guys this is good okay I'm surprised now that I know there's TV on there let's change it home mmm okay this is good this is the coffee and MCT I am a coffee lover this is good and this actually has like real coffee and it freeze-dried coffee in it some cinnamon Himalayan salt macadamia nuts almonds it contains caffeine this would be an awesome one so you have in the morning with your coffee or instead of your coffee this is good and I can't taste the stevia okay this is awesome so I'm actually really enjoying these I got two of these boxes the variety boxes so I got all five flavors I got two of each of them so it comes with ten things in here and I am like super impressed so if you guys want to check these out I'll put all the information below and yeah if you have any questions for me I'm gonna taste the macadamia nut and macadamia coconut and the protein after I get off of this I actually really like to that they have the tops that are really sealable so you don't have to like eat it all at once you can use a little bit of it and put the lid back on and use the rest either later the next day so guys I'm super impressed super fat check them out I will link everything below if you guys have any questions for me or for the company and yeah I wanted to share this with you guys and see what I thought and let y'all see my reaction to it I think I like this so I'll talk to you guys later bye guys", "oa9U6KM_6zg": "- You'll only need a\nfew simple ingredients and less than five minutes to whip up this easy peanut sauce recipe. It's great for dipping your favorite fresh spring rolls into, or drizzling over any and everything that needs a sweet and spicy kick. Hey, there. I'm London Brazil from Evolving Table. And today, we're doing a quick kitchen tip where you'll learn how to make a homemade peanut dipping sauce. It's super easy to make with only six ingredients. So let's go ahead, jump straight in, and see what those ingredients are. The primary ingredient in the sauce is, of course, peanut butter. Smooth peanut butter is preferred as well as one without any added sugar. This gives you the chance to adjust the sweetness of the sauce to your preference. Next is soy sauce. Regular or a gluten-free kind, such as Tamari, works great. Coconut liquid aminos may also be used if you're avoiding soy. An acidic component gives\nthe sauce a nice tanginess. rice vinegar is the most common and authentic type to use, but fresh lime juice\nmay also be substituted. Some type of sweetener also makes up a good bit of this dipping sauce. Brown sugar will taste the best, but honey and agave nectar may be used if you'd like a healthier alternative. If you're on a low carb or keto diet, you can also substitute with a non-nutritive sweetener, such as Stevia. The spicy kick comes from a bit of either chili garlic paste or Sriracha sauce. Add as much or as little as you'd like, depending on your desired heat level. And a clove of crushed garlic. Garlic powder can also be substituted if that's what you have on hand. So go ahead and grab a medium-sized bowl, and either a whisk or a spoon. Add half a cup of smooth peanut butter. If it's pretty thick, microwave it for 10 seconds or so before adding to help soften it up. Two tablespoons of soy sauce or a gluten-free kind, like Tamari. One tablespoon of rice vinegar or fresh lime juice. two tablespoons of brown sugar or honey. One to two teaspoons of Sriracha sauce and one clove of crushed garlic. Stir until smooth and well combined. Slowly add in warm water one tablespoon at a time to help thin it out. Whisk well after each addition. You'll end up adding in somewhere between three to six tablespoons. I've added in five tablespoons of water to get mine to be a good\ndipping consistency. Peanut dipping sauce will store well in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. Or you can use it all up after making these fresh spring rolls. Thanks so much for hanging out, I'll see you in the next one.", "3BbEq48M2Ug": "B small B small B small C what you told you know who it is Chris Jones represent possessive greatness and right now it's

you", "Yloi6x9XQ2o": "good morning YouTube BAM it's a little after 8 a.m. on Monday June 24th and yeah we're talking today so I just got back to my house I am in the process of unpacking from my trip this last weekend and you can hear it I don't know probably not but yeah I'm making a cup of coffee and we're seeing it get the day started so yeah I think I'm just gonna hang out for a second here my hair is really pretty I'm sorry but yeah we're gonna hang out here drink some coffee drink some water probably do some reading I've been reading I got my little personal library grew a lot in the last week I'm trying to grow I'm trying to put together like an actual library kind of sort of thing so that when I buy a house one day I can have a library and yeah I had a lot of books so anyway yeah the book that I'm reading at the moment where is it I think it's in my backpack yep that would make a lot of sense if you follow me on Instagram and saw it I'm gonna story the other day but it's been really interesting so far definitely recommend I got on Amazon I'll put it on my Amazon page but yeah that's where we're at right now just made up some coffee smells delicious and I think I think I'm gonna try dulce de leche guys it's I'm gonna do a live taste test of this on here I got my new the beaumart order came in while I was gone I'll check all the new stuffs today so I'll try the almond butter I'll try dulce de leche obviously and then the new flavors all American butter everything kind of came in at some point over the weekend so we gotta try all that but yeah I just want to enjoy the video say hello gonna make up my coffee right now and we're gonna try I'm gonna try some protein okay we're gonna add some protein I usually do like a quarter of a scoop or probably a little more today just so I can get more of the flavor I can't find the scoops of using a spoon that was a lot less than I thought it's gonna be oh well since high volume alright yeah we're just at 10 grams 10 grams of this oh it smells so good yeah this is the bomb our nutrition and it's their not their newest protein cleaver they released another new one over the weekend but yeah it's this protein dulce de leche if you try any of these use the code Charlotte help support me let me pay rent but yeah so I asked a milk ad will have much protein I did 10 grams and then just mix with the rapid mixer Bomar sells one Thank You cannon Amazon these things are amazing I don't know how I ever survived for that milk brothers I'm not a caramel person so this could be interesting certainly I that is amazing I think I might like this in my coffee more than [Music] protein hazelnut coffee which if you watched my history up stories you know that is saying something I'm actually really shocked right now how good this is I was honestly I didn't think I was gonna like it because I really don't like thick caramel flavored stuff I don't know I feel like people think it's weird that I taste tested by adding into my coffee but I don't drink protein shakes so comparing anything by just drinking it it's like a bad comparison you know like I never drink it like that I always drink it and coffee I always put it in oatmeal pancakes whatever I never just drink it so this to me is a fair comparison but yeah it's this is phenomenal yeah I'm gonna go so Mike watch and read and come to you guys later did I mention its own like 8/10 yeah it's like really early for me alright so I just read for a little while it is no no fine and I'm gonna go to all the I like being oli right as they open at 9:00 but

style a lot but usually it's like potatoes and fish but say the Bryce and eggs it was kind of nice change so we're gonna stick with that anyway yeah now I'm just gonna make up some up coffee I'm gonna try this cold brew concentrate that I got earlier I'm just gonna follow the recipe the Lexie done posted on her youtube a while back so we're gonna see how this goes I'm so picky about coffee so we're gonna up the best but yeah what she did is just 1/2 of a cup of cold brew concentrate be our new half cup almond milk I like vanilla almond milk you know it's just ok this is about stuff I shouldn't hurt it that's good and then realistically I probably should in the water second but it's time then just some water my giant ass Britta there we go sure that'd like some cinnamon [Music] Hey okay it's pretty good the vanilla almond milk definitely helps and you can outsmart ice did have an accent cinnamon and so yeah like oh I'm gonna add cinnamon sure yeah okay Penzias cinnamon sugar this is just like so good I'm just gonna add oh that sound a lot better better definitely better yeah this stuff is really really really better I guess I shouldn't be stupid but it's really bitter it's not bad um just definitely needs I honestly might say a little more water whatever this is like subpar it's not great so gonna drink this you need some school we're gonna take a shower and then we're gonna taste some nut butter so that's gonna be delicious what does it mean the finger guns today I'm saying this is young you know thumbnail all right all right I'm done I'm done I'm gonna drink this whole work alright everyone we're gonna try some nut butters so I've got all of my nut butters this is honestly ridiculous but all of these came on was bond so I won't try them but I don't know putting waiting to put them all on stuff individually it's gonna take too long so I just tracked like five or six grams of each of these I'm just gonna try them so I'm gonna start off with the boom iron butter apple pie I already smell so good I took the little like freshness seals off of them all I didn't taste them I promise took everything in my power not to like the lid but I just like scrape them on the side

what how do you make an almond butter she's exactly like a freaking muffin Wow okay that is delicious the all-american butters they're little thicker than the Bomar ones from what I can tell us so far but yeah Wow also ten out of ten but are they just literally just like a muffin doesn't taste like I mean tastes like almond butters obviously ell me buddy but they nailed the muffin flavor somehow all right never I tried lemon cookie I think I'm gonna get different spoon job you guys here we go oh my god this is so good power I don't really make these things taste exactly like what they are this literally tastes like a lemon cookie like I'm sure Chuck is like the only way I can describe it that's enough I'm gonna apple pie better just because I'm more of an apple versus a lemon person oh my god good though it's like um it almost tastes like lemon meringue pie - Wow all I could say as well all right and now the star of the show actually they're all stars because they're all my butter so obviously they're all stars the double stuffed and fluffed peanut butter supposedly this has axe with chunks of Oreos and the marshmallows in it oh my god there's literally I got the camera this deserves to be acknowledged there's literally chunks of marshmallows I don't know if we're gonna be able to find that Wario chunks oh I found the horror chimes hmm and the marshmallow oh my god I'm gonna try and like get as much of the Oreo and the marshmallow is possible in this little serving that we're having over here all right well guys what my fingers got some on here here goes nothing this is delicious Wow yup and that's my favorite I knew it was gonna be so good okay three spoons later that's really shame or snacks tracked I believe no strawberries and a cheese stick so I guess I'm gonna go and cut off some strawberries and you cheese stick oh yeah this is a wonderful nut butter party I really enjoyed this and I want to do this every day I just like get new nut butters every day to taste maybe please yeah all of these were phenomenal I can't get over this okay I don't you guys how well you guys didn't build to see it but like that's clearly just like Oreos and at the bottom of here like I mean my nails are trashed but like look at the or the marshmallow or maybe that's Oreo this fitness section is done hundred way too long but anyway all of these nut butters 15 out of 10 he's the Good Charlotte if you don't try any of them out just because she's gonna help me pay rent anyway that's that I'm gonna eat some strawberries in a cheese stick finish one more school assignment I said one name to mark and then and I'm probably going to go over to Zach so we're gonna make some dinner in a little while [Music] it's almost 6:00 now and I'm still I may have gotten a little distracted I was doing well from my accounting stuff and then I got I don't know you know sometimes you just wind up on YouTube and you just end up there but yeah so I ended up watching Jeff nipper it's one of his new video of him training with timber wolf who I don't know who that is but I just followed him on Instagram anyway been an interesting video on marijuana and shrinkage training it was noticeable and that made up like 30 minutes of my day just makes it have my collagen and my greens and then I'm gonna try this new iced tea with lemon that I have from all these okay well you're supposed to mix one of these into one of these are eight quarts of cold water I think I'm just gonna open it and just like add a little I guess no no that's what we're gonna do we're just gonna try it I'm saying I haven't taken my greens in my collagen actually did I yesterday Thanks not a million I was driving by yesterday so I didn't okay this doesn't break everywhere alright so I'm gonna mix this a secret to collagen some people will say that their collagen gets clumpy secret is use room-temperature water not cold water so certainly this is a really cross color oh my god I'm a little scared it's gonna be fine right right I don't know I'm used to crystal light like lemonade that's what I've been doing for the last like week are you can have moment pretty good yeah that's pretty good link the lemonade's probably would have it better but whatever I'm just gonna drink this need to finish this stupid attire man why it's taking me so long I just keep getting like distracted and there's no like time limit on it so I'm just kind of like around doing nothing and pretending you get getting stuff done I don't know I'm really good really good at deep pocket she's gonna drink this get a head over to Zach's it's gonna make some dinner it's gonna be lovely and you know catch up with you guys I don't know I'm really just sure you guys want to make it dinner okay so I know have already made it exactly I'm just finishing up making it dinner it's literally like the same thing I ever lunch but I just that's good right there have you had the race may need and the veggies are silicon and then zucchini and rubber but I bought some this week and yeah it's been yummy so far this looks good why can't I stop touching my hair okay just show you guys I guess the middle that's right the middle sup Sofia zucchini asparagus we had some Psychopaths just let's play with each other all day long parlous don't be rude veggies and then the rest of the rice I just did this everything seasoning I've showed this in a video before is just in the local place and then we had some tilapia air frying okay so the air fryer sloppy it actually turned out really good so we like to see and then I added some feta because I'm addicted to feta cheese we are aware of this stuff is like literally addicting if from Trader Joe's I went through a week but I think we're just gonna hang out and probably not do anything nervous tonight it's gonna be wonderful he's not thanked okay all right it is 907 and I have to say really outdid myself with this one's a little ice cream bowl I don't know Sunday whatever you want to call it six delicious so anyway yeah we have two almost two servings full of this I did like 125 grams just 20 grams of blueberry checks look at those look 20 grams tea be fit and then two of these because I had to generate excited it's like the highlight of my night somebody that comment didn't asked if I like don't need anything sweets I don't really buy anything sweet when I did my grocery haul but I obviously do this is like me I don't know I usually get my ice cream over here just so I was in a meeting dinner and stuff over here and it's easier just to like keep it all at saks it's not my house I also know a ton of freezer space for some reason but yeah anyway I'm gonna eat this going to take my iron probiotic and fish oil in a while drink

have one where i'm working out but today we are going to be looking at a product now this has become a big part of my diet as i have focused more on nutrition and that is pb2 um over the past about two and a half months uh i've lost about 15 pounds i went from that kind of like skinny fat to uh i you know done having like abs and stuff so i feel like i've learned a good fair bit about nutrition in that time and i've gained a new favorite product which is pb2 i'm a lover of peanut butter but it's just not very diet friendly but pb2 on the back of their packaging says this screen fair be creative can be reconstituted with any liquid of choice water juice etc so today we're going to be testing what are the best fluids of varying viscosities to mix into your pv2 the way this is going to work is i'm going to have glasses that have a little bit of pb2 in them uh and other ones i have are liquids and then i'm going to rank them best on i guess this is my left but it'll be your right hand side to my right your left i believe um so i'm gonna grab all those and i'll catch you right back here okay i have moved the camera back so that you can see this fleet i have assembled so moving from left to right and then i'll hit the ones in the front we have water and then almond milk and then milk these are like my my like three standard ones that i feel like um and then it says it encourages you to mix it with juice so thinking on that terrain we have the only juice in my house uh cranberry juice then we have one that i like to put on my oatmeal and that is syrup and then we have one that i've never tried with two that i've never tried up in the front and that is coffee here and chocolate sauce here so let's get started start out we have a classic also i'm gonna rate them i'm just going to go from my left to my right with the best one i'll put them like here we'll have the pb2 king and the pb2 disaster will be all the way over there so started out quick mix [Music] on this peanut butter i put too much liquid so i'll definitely have to adjust that for the others but as far as taste goes just going to drink it because i put way too much in you know it's your standard it's going to go in the number one spot for now but you know it's your standard one it's just the water that one um off the top of my head this is uh going to be 60 calories just 60 because that's just the pb2 um you know it's fine it doesn't really have much of like a taste to it if you put too much water which is you usually have to put a lot of water to kind of spread it across whatever you want um or else it ends up having um more of a like granular consistency like you don't put much water in it it has like the consistency of like a peanut butter cookie okay so our next one is going to be almond milk we're going to put a little bit there this time because last one the water i kind of ruined with way too much liquid for this one we're going to get a much better mix on and almond milk actually surprisingly spreads pretty far i put barely any in there and it's it's it's pretty liquidy so almond milk is definitely better than water because almond milk itself has a very like slight nutty taste and so it really like adds to the lack of flavor that pb2 has because that's that's a motorcycle but what my like main criticism of it is is if you don't have it like concentrated enough it doesn't really taste like much this definitely makes it taste like a lot more so it is going to take the top spot i'm just going to put the liquid associated with it i'll put in front so that maybe you can see what it is i'll move this over a bit because there's a lot here so up next okay so next up we have milk i believe this is two percent milk but i could be wrong about that this one i have not tried it with milk yet um but i'm intrigued because i feel like the way pb2 is made um there's like no fat in it so maybe if you had like a fatty or milk um it could bring some that fat back and it would taste more like peanut butter than uh pb2 which you know not complaining about the pb2 taste but you can tell that it's not all there you know that's good i don't know if it's better than than the almond milk one though um but like yeah pb2 like if you're like me and you crave peanut butter it's it's gonna save you like actually um because what i was doing before was i would just like have like a serving of peanut butter on a spoon like once every like two weeks and just take like a massive hit to my calories just be hungry at night which is obviously not a very good way to do it so this stuff is amazing um go back to taste this one again it's not better than the almond milk i think i stretched this one a little too thin um but whatever water is going to get moved down even further kind of be expected though it's water so doesn't really add anything alrighty so the next one is cranberry juice now at first when i thought of this video i was like oh i should do like the cranberry juice in the fridge because that'd be a weird thing and then i actually read the back and it says to mix it with with a juice of your uh of your uh of your choice um i don't know if they're calling almond milk juice although you know i i'm sure it's good with cashew milk but almond is my is my nut of choice if it is to be milked add a little bit of the cranberry juice this this scares me but also intrigues me because you know there's like i feel like there's like candies you know they're like peanut and then like some like quirky flavor they're like oh that i don't know i was about to say coconut but that's usually almond uh they add that to you like almond joys but this this just scares me because it's it's not okay that's gonna be a too liquidy but it's fine cool okay i'm just gonna i don't hate that actually go back for more wow i was really expecting to hate that but actually eating the most of this that i've eaten of any of it you know i think i might then this this one was a joke but it's it might win over i got to go back tasty almond again the the almond milk do i like a a milk nut more than i like a milked berry a juiced berry i said milk berry you can't milk a berry they serve very different purposes i definitely think that i like this one more than i like the skim milk yeah okay this is here's my ranking i actually do think this one's the best tasting one yet but it's the least versatile so i'm going to rank it not as the highest because um what are you going to put this on i guess i guess it makes sense that this would work because it's like uh it's like a peanut butter and jelly spread but it's just like in the peanut butter so i guess in that way it makes sense to me but i was not expecting that you know what i'm gonna say it it's the best one it's you know what i was having trouble thinking about putting it there but if i think of it as a peanut butter and jelly spread i have no qualms with putting it number one alrighty up next we are breaking into a category of three of them that i would call two of them i would call gluttony and the other one i would call an intriguing combination so we have coffee hershey's chocolate syrup and maple syrup here now the maple syrup i have tried before um i would recommend if you make this i i'm thinking about starting to experiment with a recipe that i'm thinking up and it is maple syrup with um the pb2 i put in the microwave at one point because for some reason it was early in the morning don't judge me for this but i thought maybe it would like melt more and i wouldn't have to add more liquid no like water to dilute the taste or like um water to dilute the taste or like extra syrup which would add calories but it actually just ended up uh caramelizing the sugar in the syrup and turned it into like a toffee so i'm thinking of making some sort of recipe involving that you see this is just so good this one this one is great actually like this is amazing now i use a syrup that's 50 calories per tablespoon you can get you know you can get syrups that are zero calories um and that's great and all but syrup is just one of those items i use like a fancy one that i i just don't skimp on uh on the syrup calories i find that it might in my my case i find it worth it so this one this one's just the best so far um it all these other ones they can't even begin to compare so we're just going to move everything on over to make room for the new king in its rightful spot and that is maple syrup and pb2 a match made in heaven really okay up next we are two from being done and i'm going to try it with the coffee next because i have a feeling that the chocolate syrup might might upset this whole order so i guess coffee makes sense i don't know i usually have both of these things uh in the morning and the breakfast time so let's see here i'm also a little bit afraid the acidity of the coffee might make this just really really disgusting but we'll have to see there's a bit of a wetter mix this this uh this go around but that is gross that is something i will not be tasting anymore of that is something i will not be ingesting even another smidgen of that's that's really bad i'm gonna move it to last place already um now up next chocolate syrup alrighty so now we're gonna move on to the last one this one this one has been calling my name the whole time i am a huge fan of all things chocolate and my favorite candy of all time is like reese's reese some people call them um but is is those peanut butter cups and so to me this just sounds like the perfect combination really um this sounds delicious i'm gonna go ahead mix it all up it's very very viscous here but that just excites me gets me excited to ingest it look at that it's like it's like cake batter but it's not it's chocolate peanut butter hopefully goodness that's pretty good you can't taste the peanut butter very much which makes me sad but if i mean i'm not going to recreate this ever because it's a calorie disaster but if i were would definitely definitely be more pb2 in this wow that's really good you know i was thinking you know i'm only gonna take little tastes of each of these but uh it's fine i just won't count the macros for this uh for this video which one do i like better though oh that's a really difficult choice syrup or chocolate comment down below which one you would choose but you know what how far is he gonna move the things that's the real question i'm so surprised by the cranberry like i don't know it's just it's actually really good like if you want something on a sandwich and you want like not as much like sugar and calories from your jams or jellies because you can get low calorie ones but oftentimes they don't taste as good and you you know want that just do this this is great it's five calories per cup of cranberry juice i believe so this is probably like a tenth of a calorie um and you know pb260 it would be amazing but i think just because of the amount of pv2 i put to the chocolate powder it is going to be second place behind the syrup which is amazing and so here it is the official ben minnow ranking ladder whatever you'd like to call it of pb2 so the king the undisputed champion of pb2 maple syrup it's absolutely amazing close second very close second chocolate syrup also pretty delicious and then third place really not what i expected at all i expected this to be ramen but where almond milk was or maybe even coffee i thought coffee might actually be good but cranberry juice surprisingly very very good and then we have our almond milk a good standard if you're doing like protein shakes i always use almond milk my protein shakes so what i would recommend would be like a scoop of chocolate protein powder your two tablespoons of the peanut butter powder and i usually use about six ounces of almond milk for that uh ratio um that's a really really good protein shake um it's it's a little bit on the thicker side pretty rich it's you're really satisfies like that that like like milkshake craving um and then we have our two percent milk which i thought might actually be higher um but i just make sense this is a pretty low fat content um so it ended up just being okay water i kind of botched the amount of water i used in this as it's already begun separating out but the water one is actually really taste dependent on how much water you put in you're going to want like very little water compared to what you think you would want and then at the bottom coffee i had high high hopes for coffee but it really really disappointed like that was actually really really gross um i don't know something about like the the bitterness of the coffee just made like uh a nasty nasty salty flavor not something i like at all okay guys that's gonna be it for the video thank you for watching like subscribe comment what you would want to see next um i enjoy making videos i enjoy the people watch them um just a fun thing to do make content editing's fun for me somehow um yeah i love making videos i'll keep making them see in the next one thank you", "tXlf9odGIOc": "new videos every day thank you so much for tuning in today's topic peanut butter and jelly and I've done my best to dress up like peanut butter and jelly and I'm wondering if you think I look like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich or not so let's talk peanut butter and jelly now there are a lot of different peanut butters out there I've just chosen a couple cuz I want to kind of give you you know a basic idea so the first thing that caught my attention was this bright blue label and it's because usually these reduced-fat or sugar-free whatever versions of the food usually they're way way WAY worse for us than just the regular version of the food so that was my hunch I picked it up sure enough I was right so just looking at the front of this we can see reduced fat 25% less fat great for you it actually says great for you on the label but if we turn it over we can kind of just take a quick gander at this ingredient list it may be a little hard to see cuz it kind of curves around here we've got roasted peanuts corn syrup solids soy protein isolate sugar and then fully hydrogenated oils which are trans fats and we know that the trans fats with these are the partially or fully hydrogenated oils these are probably the very worst fats out there for us so in this reduced fat product that's great for you they actually have trans fats which are actually I believe they're now banned in the u.s. so it should just be a matter of time right till hopefully this isn't contained in here anymore Sarek ortho phosphate copper sulfate tocopherol acetate paroxetine hydrochloride and it's not you know this isn't about you needing to know what all these chemicals are the idea is that they're so freaking many of these different chemicals that you can just go in said a food label see how many ingredients it has and that's your red flag and you know to put it back so I don't have to sit here and go through each and every single one of these the whole idea is that we can just glance at this see wow that's an awful lot of ingredients for something that should just be peanuts and know that that's kind of a red flag so then we kind of pile on top of that we've got soybean oil soy protein isolate and corn syrup solids and most of those are our GM products genetically modified products so even though it doesn't say genetically modified on the label we don't require labeling in the United States chances are these corn and soy products are actually genetically modified unfortunately so to kind of start looking at something better now this is the same brand again but this one says natural and actually it's it's way way way better for you so I'm gonna kind of hold these up so you can kind of compare them and you can just by glancing at it even if you you know even if you can't actually read what these are saying you can see this is roasted peanuts sugar palm oil and salt versus this whole three lines that goes around the bottle halfway around the bottle really really long ingredient list so this is gonna be a much healthier product simply because it doesn't contain all those crazy chemicals in it also it doesn't contain the fully hydrogenated oils those trans fats that we saw in this reduced fat version so this is going to be a far superior product and then to even go one up from there this is my favorite brand of nut butters it comes in a glass jar which I always think is nice it's in glass instead of plastic but again very comparable ingredients on these two so this one is dry roasted almonds organic unrefined cane sugar palm oil and sea salt so again we've just got a couple of ingredients now some products out there well I would say or even superior to this maybe they don't even contain sugar and then you can add a little sugar or add a little honey or add something to it if you want it to be sweet but you could probably even find products that really they're just 100% peanuts and that's the only ingredient and that's gonna be way better for you than this kind of frankenfood peanut butter over here with all these crazy ingredients so let's move on to the other half of our peanut butter and jelly sandwich my favorite part which is the jelly so maybe you can let me know what's your favorite part is that the peanut butter or the jelly what's your favorite flavor of jelly are you a strawberry jelly grape jelly kind of person let me know what I have here this first one is sugar-free peach preserves so again we kind of have this label on the front that looks real clean sugar-free looks like maybe this is gonna be a healthy product but let's see what happens when we turn it over okay so looking at this ingredient label water peaches poly dextrose from Alpha bextrum locust bean gum natural flavors potassium sorbate calcium fluoride yellow 5 and yellow 6 so not only do we have these artificial sweeteners but we also have artificial colors which are actually banned in several different countries so yellow 5 or tartrazine is banned in Norway France and the UK but this happy little healthy-looking peach preserves actually has this artificial color in it we also have these different preservatives we have the ever ominous natural flavors and I've discussed this in a couple other videos but basically there's a whole list of chemicals that can go by this rather unassuming name natural flavors and some of them are extracted from the anal glands of beavers a chemical called castoreum but again you're never gonna see that name of that chemical on the label it's just gonna be listed as natural flavor so maybe the natural flavor is something that isn't so bad but we really don't know and that's why I personally choose to avoid things that contain natural flavors because just really don't know what that means we don't know which chemical that is so one other thing I want to point out about this label that I think is interesting because they've actually put a little asterisk by a lot of these ingredients and it says ingredients not in regular preserves and literally it's every ingredient on this label except for peaches and fruit pectin so I think it's funny they've actually come right out and say here's all these other ingredients that we've put in this product that you don't find in normal preserves so this would be the bad guy and then let's look at something that this is actually my favorite jelly that I use anyways and then so I was really happy when I was actually able to include it in this video and again we can kind of look at the back we've got wild blueberries sugar cane sugar concentrated lemon juice fruit pectin and that's it so it's actually colored with the actual blueberries it actually doesn't have any artificial colors in it at all and it does have added sugar so again this isn't gonna be a super healthy product so to speak but just comparing it to some of these other ones it's definitely the lesser of two evils so an even better bet from here would be to maybe just slice up the fruit and put it on the sandwich and not even use a jelly type product but if you are at least look for one that doesn't have artificial colors and artificial sweeteners in it and you're gonna have a much healthier product much healthier PB&J sandwich to speak of so I want to thank you for watching this video I want to invite you to leave your topic requests so if there's a particular product that you'd like me to do the brilliant comparison on let me know if there's a food that you're wondering about is it healthy or not leave me a comment and let me know the whole point of the series is to help you feel more equipped to go into the store look at an ingredient label really just glance at an ingredient label and know if something is healthy or not so thank you for watching this video you can learn more about me and my

peanuts are mostly good fat And a recent study shows that peanuts are a very great factor in weight control, because of the fiber, protein, and good fats, they keep you full for a longer period of time.", "LiKSrTCc_DU": "hi Jeremy the tall trainer here and we did a peanut butter and jelly sandwich lesson in our bootcamp classes where we met people who will measure out peanut butter jelly and and we had them weigh them in grams right amount of wool slip of paper there and so it made a whole bunch of sandwiches couple sandwiches in each class and if we look over here we've got a whole bunch of numbers of what these measurements were and so these where I go too far and I have a warning for you you know because we're doing peanut butter jelly is a lesson in bootcamp and in our classes it doesn't make it a health food it doesn't make it an anti health food you but we chose to use peanut butter jelly sandwiches for the example because it's common think most people know what it is it's easy to demonstrate measuring when we burn jelly and has a typical serving in the fight about program that we use instead of the typical serving of something we were talking about a little bit in this lesson but if you see if you did a day's worth of people thirteen hundred and eighteen calories worth it only becomes a 1.5 minute DPA you can see there's lots of red in vitamins and minerals a lot of s in the Indian vitamins and mineral category so we know if we had just that it's probably not the best food to have so we're gonna have to have some other stuff there can be some healthy things you could get from it but you are gonna have to try to find other things that have more nutrition in them to just supplement so we're not endorsing peanut butter and jelly just because we're doing this as an example how many calories in each sandwich so here is what we got so we had people measure lots of different people to see each other's measurements they just made a peanut butter sandwich the way it seemed right to me and I would argue that people tend to shade on the lighter side when they're making a peanut butter jelly sandwich in front of their personal trainer so they might actually be a little more than this if there were in such a tested situation those things are more relaxed there unless time sensitive too but we can see there's a big range here in fact none of these numbers are the same there is a huge range we have 331 is the low on the range and it looks like 598 is the high and numbers all throughout there so quite a bit of variability in these sandwiches that people made using the same type of bread the same type of unibrow the same type of jelly so if we lose that much variability man you know here off a couple hundred on some of those foods you think you've had it for near 31 maybe you've had a 598 you know say you're you're you're looking at almost double the calories you think you're getting in with with your food there's 100 calories you know that's enough to really throw off your day if you're off that much on all your food you're gonna be very very awful over the long term if we book it compared to typical serving typical serving they've screwed 40 calories in the Vitamix once and so sometimes people say I hear ideal sandwiches just a goodbye jelly sandwich and they put it in there the I have to understand what's done in so if you love that and but you actually hates one of these 500 or 500 or more calorie sandwiches you're gonna be here the off quarter that you're inviting a lot of error into into your food log and a lot of frustration because if you think you're having three or thirty calories but you're truly having 500 or 600 calories you know you're gonna feel like you're going hungry well actually you're not and so you think you should be losing weight you lose and I'm stuck I don't get it it's a lot of times that is the cause and measuring measuring will help you narrow that down a bit more so a couple of lessons that I want you to get from this on one management's are always different in which we're trying to plate a certain number so when you're measuring you know things if you're trying to get up on today I'm gonna put this many grams of peanut butter on my sandwich I stopped when I put that much on they're suppose to much I can even dab a little bit off and go in there that's the way you can make the measurements consistent if you're just throwing things together if you're not measuring at all you inviting tons of berry if you're just measuring after the fact you're still having a lot of error in there I measure ahead and for you eat it measure it typical serving is like calling someone a typical human so that typical serving of you know about 330 there you know where is this because you know I don't see anything typical about any of these sandwiches they look really typical you know all these sandwiches look tippy I don't I can't tell the difference between them necessarily stuff stuck between them you know but here we see the calorie amount you know there's nothing typical about any of these and there's nothing typical about here those people I've never met a typical person you know so so don't don't be tempted into saying well I just have a standard for this you didn't have standard anything you know everybody makes them it makes the things differently everybody prepares their food differently you've got to keep track of what you are doing as a person not with a typical person is drop your off a little bit on the food what if you're off on all of your food that way let's say you're you're 20 percent off and of 2,000 calorie diet you know that 20% is gonna be you about 400 calories for a calories enough to really frustrate you over the course of the day you know if you know a lower calorie number we've had people actually as much as 100 percent off so they think they're eating 1,200 calories really they're eating 2,400 calories very easy to get too many calories in and that's why I recommend you know doing measurements measurements do not take long people learn that while we go through the lesson there is it's very quick to just give they get that way with the bread zero out the scale you know write the write the number down get peanut butter on there write the number down zero the scale and do the jelly it was very very quick so then take long and what measurements do is they provide awareness results come from awareness measuring and logging create that awareness by allowing you to know what is going on now you have factual information you have data to figure out you know what you're doing what's going on and now you can make decisions based on reality not based on typical serving you make decisions based on okay this is actually how many calories I have calories are in that food do I want more of that do I want less of them you know is that gonna help me or is that not helping me and once you have the awareness of of going through and actions tracking some of these things you can make better quality decisions which gets you more results and less frustration so that is the peanut butter and jelly lesson in a peanut shell so there's a Jeremy tell trainer saying have fun be safe", "KZw53ePGkvo": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying for our x-bar protein bars these were sent to us from Kristen at our X bar so thank you very much I have the peanut butter peanut butter and berries in a bitter chocolate and maple sea salt we actually tried the peanut butter but I think it's been years ago so we're gonna try it again we're and I would like to taste it compared to the other ones that have peanut butter as well this one has three egg whites 14 peanuts to date no BS it is 200 calories for the entire bar they're all 12 grams of protein it's pretty good it smells good it smells just like peanut butter I got with date the main ingredient is some dates and then peanuts mm-hmm that's good mm-hmm that's a good texture I'm recovered thanks gluten-free 200 mm-hmm how about that one go Andrew yeah and it has enough peanut flavor three you could tell it's peanut butter to tax your enjoy Hank that's peanut butter with you take the dates - so there's no thanks the days but even though it's the first ingredient I don't think they're as powerful as they have been in other art yeah it's there this is the peanut butter and berries and it has raspberries is the very corner - oh no this one's also 200 calories you see mobile husband really nice the raspberries turn you can you know Mike we've just been called raspberry I really don't taste peanut butter I just said raspberry and you know why that's very seeds in there too he seems a little young um and I have no idea I haven't watched the review that we did from years ago when we tried the peanut butter I'm that we may or may not have even liked it then we may have really we may have said we really liked it like we do now but we have tried so many bars from that time to now that our tastes could have very well I understand but I do I don't think these are these are fairly soft mm-hmm they're not super soft but they're fairly song and they're a little sticky and it feels like you got something to chew on so you you get some you know you're working out a little bit just a drink shake or something like that it's something you're working at but not working as hard as like quest bars or anything like that but just like when we started when we first started doing reviews of chocolate we had really not had as much chocolate other than what is available in the United States like Hershey since we've had chocolates from all over now our taste in chocolate has drastically changed and I think our tasting bars has changed to some chocolates still not very sweet though and we taste it's like if you were to watch this review oh yeah I don't like I said I don't remember what we thought but it's lava will be different and that would be why and this one is the peanut butter chocolates 210 calories three egg whites 14 peanuts two dates no BS Cocco a seesaw I don't get peanut butter mm-hmm can't touch with peanut butter it's kind of over in with the date to the chocolate that cocoa come but I like the cocoa boy room then I get the sea salt it it's a little bit of that bitter cocoa flavor but it's not bitter like him do that's better you know it's just a nice dark chocolate there yeah that is a nice bar yeah after than the other two of them yeah I would really like the texture but I think that's worth 210 but I do get that salt sea salt yeah and it's really good it adds to it it I think it needs that little bit with that bitterness of the cocoa and it's not really bitter bit but it adds something to say this one is the maple sea salt it is five three egg whites five pecans four cashews today nothing we were having this is the highest calorie yeah it's 220 calories you feel the salt in there like so that maple white on yellow it's not a good choice of colors you can see what you just saw look at all that saw maple water Sunday I don't like do brain I don't care for that alright and say I like that one better than the other make one with that from them but I don't you know it's just for me not good because I kissed pecans in there - mm-hmm I don't know and I like the flavor of the pecans and the cashews I like the flavor of the nuts in it I don't like the flavor of the maple yeah gallica it was very very strong it is strong but it's and it's for me it's a maybe it's the pecans and the and the salt together come make takes a little different to me I really enjoy it yeah I would not get that one again yeah see how a good though um it's not a favorite I would give them my favorite one here is just the plain being about the plain peanut butter what the book maples my second okay I like the peanut butter I like women that water we drop them that's the order I like them no ruin the peanut butter peanut butter embarrassed and I really like the raspberry I like the chocolate because of the cocoa and I personally would not use maple again I would just I would switch out the berry and the maple because I didn't care for the baby that much better huge raspberry Louis and I like raspberry so yeah so that makes perfect sense you know that about us that I like raspberry more than he does so but you know but these are really good bars I would definitely get them again Kristen sent me extra so I appreciate that I'll get to enjoy these and another one I hope you all enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "FALNwA4uDhU": "[Music] Korona virus outbreak in the salt soy Liston midships then the mint chips has a bunch of coloring um at the other day this is not the this is not the cleanest protein bar out there it for the most part of it is but they do have some things I forgot mark actually made a video about it saying that like like two percent of five percent just it's the ingredients that are not like clean or whatever healthy so today there's better choices as far as being health concern what there's a lot worse to and this is all real products so let's go ahead and open it up I'm pretty sure there's gonna be a 10 because the mint one VI not the mint one but yeah the peppermint one was was a ten so this one this one looks like it looks like a regular alright bar like a cookie and cream one but it's got some in action we go oh yeah it tastes exactly like regular touch now super meat you know for the most part it tastes like a regular white bar but just in the very back you get a little bit of mint action just a little bit [Music] maybe I'm getting burnt out on I'll write bars it's really good obviously 9.5 but it just doesn't give me that let me know

dispensary and on this web view we are taking a look at the final product to review from a cushy punch their 100 milligram sativa variety flavor is strawberries the strawberry 100 milligram sativa variety of cushy punch we've looked at their 200 milligram TK o which I found to be kind of lacking and then we looked at their 100 milligram indica and in an experiment we also look at the 100 milligram hybrids and I found both of those to be not too bad so I hope that this is on the better end of the cushy punch I hope it's as good as the other two 100 milligrams I found those to be much better than the 200 milligram sort of surprisingly I would just go with 100 milligrams in terms of cost because I think it's about just about as potent as its 200 milligram brother so without further ado let's going to open this up and eat her down and what's gonna happen after that guys after I finish this I'm going to come back to you in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling because that's the most important part about the edible review not necessarily how it tastes but more about how it actually makes you feel so here we go looks like a like a little jam packet or a little jelly packet or a little butter packet it's got four little blocks in there and after we get it plopped out you can see it with its four a little squares but we're going to ignore the little squares there just plug the whole thing in my mouth and one go mmm not bad definitely a little bit of what we taste so much better than the infused creations or the what's the other one I can't remember the name off the top my head but any of those ones that are just like the gummy bears with the basically just like THC oil sprinkled on the outside this is a lot better this is more like the flourish although I don't think it's quite as good as the flourish so now that I've slurped it down I'm gonna wait two hours to see how I'm gonna feel you guys however have to just wait a couple seconds I'll be back right after this break here and I'll let you know how I'm feeling see you then it's been two hours since I had the cushy punch that's the name of it the cushy punch should sieve a hundred milligram THC strawberry flavored gummy here and I gotta say this might be the least hi I've been from one of their hundred milligrams it seemed like the hybrid and the indica hit me more that might just be because I've heard this about um because she punched before that they're not the most consistent some are code and some aren't and that might just be the case with this sativa I'm not not high just more at like four four and a half somewhere in that range instead of the six five and a half six is the other ones so a little bit less than before but again that just might be this particular batch where it might be that sativa doesn't quite hit me as hard but it still is better than my original impressions of could she punch way back when when I had their TKO at the very very beginning I still don't think it would be the first thing I reached for at the dispensary but it won't be the last thing I go for like my opinion used to be so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching it as always and we will see you on the next review peace okay", "vAd2MnnDEn4": "hey guys welcome back to our channel if you're new here I am Judith and today's video I am going to be eating a hundred milligram edible for you guys I did get this on 4/20 and I am barely going to eat it with you guys just because I don't know it's been in the fridge it's been getting cold and I thought why not do it today today is my day off so your grocery and yeah so I'm gonna consume this a hundred milligram edible for you guys and see what it does to me I am a huge smoker so I don't know if it would hit me as much but honestly it probably will because edibles hit different than smoking like honestly honestly if you eat edibles they will hit like major but yeah so I'm gonna eat this for you guys hopefully I don't feel like I'm dying and then from there who knows this video will probably be a short vlog and yeah I'm just gonna go about my day on an edible and see the effects of what happens so let me set the camera for you guys and then open this oh so I am in my little sister's room I am at my mom's house and yeah there's nowhere else I'd rather take a hundred milligram edible than my mom's because if I freaked out which I probably won't but if I freaked out my sisters are here and my mom is here and everybody is here so if your girl feels like she's dying everybody is here hominy yeah yeah so let me set this camera up for you guys and then let's do it okay you guys I'm so mad at myself because I literally broke the freaking edible and I didn't want to do that I wanted to show you guys exactly what it looked like and your girl is just not paying attention if you guys have ever tried these let me know in the comments down below and what you guys thought about them so I've tried these before they were good and let's do this again so here we go I'm gonna break this seal for you guys know it's childproof it's childproof you guys it doesn't even have a little cut for you to follow do you have scissors money so you legit might need a knife or some scissors to open the packaging which is always good that's like an a-plus because if you have kids or you have little adults around you don't want them to easily access these things because yeah Oh Jax is sad he's crying outside right now but I don't want him inside because he's just gonna he's just gonna bark and do odd things possible but he's sad because jenna so just dipped or she went somewhere I'm not sure but okay so I went ahead and cut it open I'm sorry my nails are a little rough right now one is really bitten your girl has been super anxious and nervous and if you know me you just have a lot of anxiety sometimes and believe it or not I get and I get anxiety attacks and it's just a struggle you guys so if you guys know what they feel like or you guys are also going through the same thing I hope that you guys are doing everything possible to just stay calm and everything is gonna be fine you guys I always try to remind myself that but anyways it smells so good these are dark mint chocolate bars and they legit smell like dark mint chocolate they really do you guys let me push them it to the front they literally broke it in there I am so upset with myself but they still looks so good okay let's do it I'm gonna eat the whole bar you guys so let's do this they are look look at how they're packaging for their chocolate is like go ahead and hold that for you guys look at that it literally tells you the milligram of each little bar that is crazy I don't even remember eating the other one and I don't remember being this excited about having the milligrams on the bar I don't know I guess yes yes if you guys how do you say it um if you guys are dosing or how would you say I money you just oh yeah mone is smart she okay so if you are micro dosing and you are a big believer or a big person who does micro seeing these are exactly what you need but let's do this image it tastes like dark chocolate man mm sorry 20 milligrams yeah 820 milligrams right there let's go ahead and eat oh my god I'm such an idiot you guys and you guys are not telling me so apparently it doesn't give you the milligrams on here I just assumed that they did but no it doesn't it actually says THC on the bar d\u00f6 oh my god I'm either dumb or I'm blind you guys I'm so dumb but it does say THC on them on the packaging and lets you know that each bar is 10 milligrams so I just assumed that that's what it was on that's what was written on the bar but you know what it's still cool it still lets you know how many milligrams each little bar is and honestly dude the reason why I like these is because ok 30 more milligrams and then it's 50 milligrams total and you can't argue with that [Applause] and I got this one this one didn't break yeah so this one didn't break you guys and 15 milligrams for this little bit is yes yes I love edibles that are tiny but they pack so much like a little brownie that's 100 milligrams like thighs the best because you don't have to eat as much like it legit gets to the point it's not like you have to eat 50 cupcakes to get 100 milligrams like no I love that they high dose these things so that you can eat less of it but get more of a punch like those are my favorite edibles look 20 more milligrams what is that now 70 milligrams oh my god I'm freaking myself out honey you're gonna be here with me okay my sister said if I feel like I'm dying she's gonna be here with me you're gonna remind me that I'm not dying she was gonna remind me I'm not dying guys honestly I can always have I can always be having a bad day but once I get on camera for you guys and I talk to you guys I just make a difference I do feel better I do feel the best I could be sometimes but yeah like I really like being here with you guys you guys motivate me of course I do want to do big things when I'm older I hope you guys stay to see what the [ __ ] that J and J twins are gonna do in the future my sister has a boyfriend and they're hella cute you guys so shout out to all the couples out there especially my sister's relationship because he is so nice you guys like so next so nice oh hi there any more milligrams and that's gonna be a total of 100 milligrams you guys so recently hmm yeah I would buy these again mm-hmm yes mm-hmm so recently I took half a tab with Hubert he took the pool tab you guys I don't know I don't know people could do the most and still survive but me knowing I'm gonna take a full time I know that it's gonna be full-blown everything like everything I'm gonna see God I'm gonna see [ __ ] mythological things everything so I took half a tab right you guys I swear I couldn't stop laughing like I was trying I was trying so hard to keep it together because like I wouldn't look at Hubert and I was just like in my mind it was so funny like to even look at him was so funny like I didn't know I didn't know why looking at him was so funny and while I was doing that I was applying to new things so that I can get my life together and go find better things so I was on my laptop like the laptop looked cool whatever but then I started to realize oh my god oh my god it's hitting like my half tab is hitting and that's why I only take half a tab Jax our guard dog our long-haired dachshund or jealous long-haired dachshund even after the tab was over and we woke up the next morning I even asked him I was I asked him how his tab fell and if he felt it and he said smack - smack but yeah I am my my half tops max I didn't think it was going through because I've never had great oh my god looks so young with short hair so I never like I never really have good experiences with papertabs usually jalisa gets us gel tabs and those are the ones that really really like always boom like and these paper tabs one time we took them and they just it didn't work out so yeah lesson learned gels are my favorite my point is don't be afraid to microdose don't ever feel like you have to eat the whole edible or take the whole tab like no I even take quarter tabs and I feel good I feel like I could take a quarter tab and go throughout my day or take a quarter tab and drink and have a good time so everything is possible you guys don't hurt yourselves but I will come back check up with you guys and see when this hits so I'll make sure to time this for you guys let me check and you're gonna wash my hands because I do not want to lick my fingers so it is currently 138 I will come back whenever these shit's hit which will be in like 30 minutes hopefully or maybe an hour who knows no one ever knows um yeah and I'll check up with you guys and see you later my dude shoutout to jealous because she is hooking it up with some boiling crab but yes but yes okay so it's been like 45 minutes okay you guys so it's 229 now and oh my gosh that's so weird why is it doing that anyways so it's 2:30 you guys and I am pretty faded I don't know what that means that's so weird oh it's doing it's like something the camera can see but not us okay guys so the edibles definitely hit you guys I was watching a really good movie right now called private life it's called private life and I was crying you guys I can't stop oh my gosh this edible is definitely hitting I was watching this movie called private life and if you haven't watched it you guys need to watch this movie like the movie is so it's real and I like that so yeah the edibles this is like 45 minutes after or 15 minutes after so like about an hour it took me to really get the feeling like I am super faded right now you guys like I'm just like deeply in movies right now if you guys want something that's gonna hit you guys should definitely get some wounds and if you like the mint flavor with chocolate this is definitely that so yeah thanks for watching and I will see you guys in the next video", "fqhdgU1s_MY": "hello everyone it is i the beast and i've returned from the cellar to bring you yet another fantastic installment of beastly reviews yes indeed and today's product is so large it had to be stored in the cellar because you see a product with uh with promised level of flavor this high you can't just store that in your regular cupboard no no no and obviously as you can see by the packaging we have returned to the wild world of recess and their peanut butter confections and today's product specifically is a reese's peanut butter confection with a mallow top now a mallow uh for those uh unwashed among us is a marshmallow i assume unless i'm completely wrong and i'm the unwashed one uh oh yes okay there's actually a couple of marshmallows there and this goes along with the whole easter motif got the little easter eggs right there see very very small but you can see them nonetheless and of course the packaging is very reminiscent of the old reese's peanut butter eggs so um i believe before a quick note before i continue i believe that uh around october of last year i did a review on a product uh called the franken cups which is i believe these are similar but i'm not positive about that nevertheless uh i figured i would do this video because sometimes uh a second taste makes all the difference in the world the first taste may not have really captured the essence that they were looking to convey and i feel since i'm a very fair beast that i should give them a chance to redeem themselves without further adieu let's uh open this bad boy up shall we i didn't bother uh making fun of the uh or lampooning rather the ingredients for this one because you see i'm going to eat these regardless because reese's peanut butter cups are pretty fantastic okay there you can see right there very white malloy top and uh bottom uh-oh i'm sure this has happened to you at one point but let's see what the actual concentration looks like very very thin layer of mallow a top a mostly peanut butter filled chocolate shell all right looks pretty interesting looks very mallowy but how does it taste eh that's what you're here to find out today bottoms up i don't honestly recall if the franken cups tasted like this first taste this is gonna sound pretty odd um okay now i'm getting a bit of it my very first taste of this it tasted a bit like reese's pieces which are very odd i mean you wouldn't think that it would um as far as i know they don't make those uh candy shells out of marshmallows maybe they do i don't know but that was an odd flavor but as i um as it marinated in my beastly palette the uh the mallow started to come out of it might as well finish this bad boy off shall we although it looks like someone painted it up with white house it actually is um i assume mallow i can't really say for sure again there's the concentration bottoms up really not bad but still you see there you go again i just put this in my mouth and i'm starting to get the sensation of reese's pieces but obviously that's not the intention um i i taste the lightest bit of melon so i suppose my main takeaway from this product overall now at this point would be that it makes me long more for the mellow cup the mallow cup is actually i don't know if you recall these but i believe it's an old it seems like an old timey candy but uh yellow packaging red writing i think that they've never changed the packaging in 60 years maybe that's what it is but uh basically rock hard cups with broken open complete white marshmallow goo they're pretty good they have a nutty flavor but they are better than these as are regular reese's peanut butter cups making these a bit obsolete in my opinion i don't see the need for this uh they're okay but they're not fantastic they definitely don't have the strong marshmallow flavor that i would have liked and um it doesn't taste like a fluffernutter either it's just sort of its own thing that's just not that fantastic in my opinion no offense to the reese's people but uh i can't give this more than a six out of ten but if this video for you is more than a six out of ten please do me a kindness and like and subscribe bc reviews instagram beastly reviews on youtube uh there's all kinds of great content over on the youtube and the instagrams so uh yeah if you enjoy me i certainly enjoy you my friends have a fantastic day and i will see you next time talia", "V2RJkayjAzA": "hi and welcome back to another review today i am looking at skippy i've seen this advertised on tv recently and i thought i'm gonna go and have a look and see if i can find this got it from asda 2.40 okay um it's a 340 gram tub and it's peanut butter it's an american peanut butter now this is extra smooth creamy peanut butter so without further ado let's get stuck in let's give this a try skippy skippy skippy oh my god it's got got one of these foil tubs that these foil lids that almost impossible to get into unless you've got a knife and my glamorous assistant is going to pass me a knife any seconds look what she passes me she's trying to tell me so wow there you go smell that right okay it's smooth it smells like peanut butter it looks like a peanut butter what does it taste like it's darker than normal peanut butter apparently i don't know i just i just do as i'm told right yeah it's very smooth it's a bit like me but i might wanna when i'm out on the nighttime bit smooth i wish all right no she's pinching me peanut butter there it is on the spoon on the spoon wow do you know what normally i struggle with peanut butter i like peanut butter but i struggle with it i i never eat all of it because it's too bloody dry doesn't matter whether it's crunchy which they do this in or the smooth which is what i've got it's still dried i'm kind of it all right this is smooth it says creamy believe me it's creamy and the creaminess to it means i can sit down and eat this with the spoon out of the jar i don't eat no toast no bread no nothing whatever you put this on that guys is nice very very nice wow that's the best peanut butter i have ever had right so where am i gonna go with this this is easy right um it's a little bit pricey 2.40 whatever it was um it was two you want it yeah 240. so price wise could be a little bit lower but if you like you're a peanut butter leather you've got to go and try this i've got to go and try it it's amazing wow there you go wow what can i say well done i don't know who this is made by um probably a company called skippy i suppose um wow i guess if you're allergic to peanuts you probably shouldn't try this um but anyway let's give this score enough waffle um i'm giving this a very very very good score i'm giving it and this is a personal score for me i'm giving this 9.5 9.5 what can i say wow guys go try this you won't be disappointed um and if you are it's probably because you don't like peanuts i'm out of here um until next time take care and um i'll see you again soon", "rS00qtRV7Ok": "hey everybody all right my name is soleil today i'll be talking about these peanut butter cups i came across from the company quest so before i get started if you hear little peter patterson background it's my dogs i just got back from work and they're really excited so all right so i came across the brand a long time ago they're known for their protein bars they have pizza they have chips they have a whole bunch of things and just recently they came out with peanut butter cups which i was really really excited about to try because there are a few brands i've tried lily and i want to say weight watchers that have also come out with keto version of the peanut butter cups so i am pretty stoked so this is the box that i got this is you can get this either from the site i also got this from amazon um it says there's one gram of sugar per serving 11 grams of protein one net carb and a serving is two cups which is also very nice there are 13 carbs and you have four dietary fibers eight erythritol so again it turns into one net carb pretty excited so you get [Applause] a whole bunch of them what do you get let me see 12 12 servings to be exact so i've opened up one of the packages let me go ahead and get close so you can see it okay let's see if it's gonna go there it goes all right all right so here we go opening it up [Applause] looks like a regular little peanut butter cup okay oh it's hard wow okay [Applause] it's good though yes it is protein a little bit of protein taste but i mean for the most part i'm kind of torn because like the weight watchers one you only get one for serving but i think that one tastes better or the better you get two per serving it's really nice and it's still really good the lilies one is a little i want to say it's bad it's just not um close to the real thing it's um very keto tasting i guess but um this isn't bad i mean when i was tasting the protein and i was like literally having to like focus on each flavor so earn that though i like it it's a little a little firm now but definitely fixes that peanut butter cup need like i ever wanted peanut butter cup this is definitely going to be it so when you so much fats in it too so i guess this would be considered a fat bomb um it's got 15 grams of fat nine saturated so i mean i think this is pretty good it's definitely very keto it's got high fat high protein low net carb one gram of sugar which is great so yes i definitely think this is really good i can see myself purchasing this again and i definitely say check it out so again you can get it off the site you can go to amazon they have it so all right that is it um i just recently also purchased uh keto glaze pecans which i'm going to be doing a video probably tomorrow on those so i will um i will definitely be posting very soon so all right i hope you guys enjoyed my video and i'll see you guys next time [Music]", "XpaEnLTYPWk": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying some peanut butter we're gonna be trying the Skippy creamy peanut butter and have the creamy recent speedo and the reason we're doing this review is because Tyler asked me if we would review Reese's creamy peanut butter we have reviewed the Reese's creaming with chocolates in the past but we've never reviewed this and I thought well I don't want to just review one vina better let me at least throw something else in there that we've never had so the only other the only kind of Skippy that we've reviewed has been skipping Naturals we've never reviewed just regular Skippy peanut butter and I haven't had it in a while so we're but Skippy I know they do so I figured we would try these and let you know what we think of them so the the Skippy was $2 48 cents the Reese's was $2 86 cents and they were both from Walmart so there's only 40 cents difference and I've had some people say I didn't even know they made Reese's creamy peanut butter they have it's been out for years and it's made in Hershey Pennsylvania and then the Skippy is made in Minnesota so it says fuel the fun no preservatives artificial colors or flavors similar to all peanut butters see nutrition information for fat content it's seven grams of protein per serving visit us at peanut butter calm which you would think it would be like Skippy calm it's peanut butter calm basically woops magnetic I know gluten free two tablespoons 32 grams is 190 how are you look forward thinking they bumped up quick yeah they out Oh smells really good so it in if as far as calories go I think that's the same as Jeff I think Jeff creamy peanut butter movin it's also yeah I'm thinking that's the same to it yes and I think that's typical of most creamy peanut butter 194 - no no I got such a huge house I got something too too clingy - legs how many licks does it take that's good but it's nice peanut peanut eat your peanut buttery it's like justice I don't think so either Jim is a lot stronger penis I think it is too dad and that's Frank and I know some of you have been eating Skippy since the day you were born but that does not have the strong mmm peanut butter flavor that I'm used to in Jeff cuz I've had Jeff my whole life I mean it's peanut butter but boy I'll tell you why I would think there's something missing I know it is you were giving me that blindfold but I'd be like that's disappointing yeah because yeah because he does not have the flavor at all no rosin it's very surprising so may our expectation is just really hot because we drop it Jeff yeah because we've got Jeff and I know how good Jeff is the texture is really good though didn't creamy so this people want to know people are gonna want it does this taste like what you get in peanut butter Scott the peanut butter cup yes and yes I'm gonna stick the spoon in there that I've linked up we're gonna give you it's ours yeah we own it we haven't it's my huh not stick our fingers in um do you remember years and years ago look he remembers the very first room world how many of you out there watched the first world world on MTV that guy was crazy cuz there was puck I don't even remember his name I cannot I don't know where that came from his name was puck and so it's like seven singles they're young they're living in this place MTV has thrown together in this fishbowl and we're gonna film on them watch on so we're all sharing this jar of peanut butter he got some of those nasty fingers but he was a dirty part he was dirty he did not wash he he did snot rockets I mean he was not busy for that review he was a bike messenger anyway he stuck his fingers in the jar of peanut butter that was everybody's and I mean it was this whole to do on the show but I mean who does that here just that sad I didn't run your have type of the review I don't know what did okay you talk about you feel I haven't even drive it you try it's good it's still not strong as jitter it still Ansari's Jeff but it's stronger than the skipping hmm you know it's not be a buttercup it better no no at least I don't think it is no because it doesn't have the grittiness a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup there's a there's a grittiness job but it's a good prettiness it's like everything yeah it's sugar it's like peanut butter and sugar grittiness that's cookies nothing now tried it again if you I'm gonna challenge you because peanut butter is not that expensive if you've been eating Skippy for years and years and years I'm gonna challenge you to buy I don't even know if we have any are you going to get so gonna go to go somewhere I don't know cuz he actually takes it to school with our site or not we have any I'm gonna challenge you to buy you know we go to buy a jar of Jeff I bet we're gonna try it we got we have to yeah you know what because we may be wrong maybe no the stronger player hello uh yeah it's stronger mm-hmm it's stronger we'd all actually peanut butter um where is this mine it's a Lexington now they have a smoker's plant in Lexington it was Jeff Huber and when they buy smikers yeah visit us at gift um it's the smoker this is this one in particular says Orrville Ohio and that jeff has a stronger peanut butter flavor than either one of things it does so um would I buy the Reese's now over the gym I would if you're I just think some people are probably on it for the name to be honest but I like I still choose Jeff Susie mom's chuja sous chef I think that's the trick I think the Reese's is good yeah it's got a sweetness to Annie all that stuff so it's a good peanut butter and if I wasn't buying Jeff they were out of gym I wouldn't mind at all binary yeah because the Reese's is as far as these three goes I'm not we're not talking about any other ones out there but as far as these three the Reese's is the second best yeah definitely the Skippy that would be excluded I'm sure it's terrific between two slices of bread I'm sure it tastes great with jelly whatever but when you get it next to something else it does not shine at all so Tyler I hope that answers your question I hope you all enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "iwMgD51_zEk": "first off I just want to give a little disclaimer saying that I do not condone the use of any legal or illegal mind-altering substances the contents of this video are created purely for education it's inevitable that there will be people who consume these substances therefore it is extremely important to educate people on the effects and how to properly use them so edible pot is a lot different than smoking it it's more potent it's processed in the body differently and the effects lasts longer the difference with edibles is that the active ingredient the chemical that gets you high THC is processed in the liver before the user experiences any effects the original THC from the edible is converted in the liver into a more potent metabolite 11 hydroxy THC it's estimated that this compound is about four to five times more psycho active than normal THC and because the edible has to go through a portion of the digestive process before effects can be felt it can take 30 minutes - as long as two hours before a user feels any effects because of this people who don't feel any effects after an hour so might want to reduce only to have the entire thing hit them like a train all at once an hour later so my advice just wait it out it may take a while but it will come on and unlike smoking cannabis in which the effects last about two hours and gradually drop off after a quick climax right after inhalation edible pot takes its time before it reaches its peak in effect and this peak lasts longer typically the effects of edibles lasts four to eight hours when it comes to the effects there are certainly similarities between smokeable and edible weed but there are some properties that appear to only occur strictly on edibles there are two main reasons someone would want to consume an edible the first is for medical benefits such as aiding symptom relief of stress or anxiety or to help one sleep and the second is simply just for recreational purposes just to have a high and have a time aside from these two reasons there are actually a few people in the psychedelic community who use edibles and very high doses in a similar way to what one would use LSD or magic mushrooms for but we'll touch on that aspect at the end of the video so now we are going to get into what you can expect to feel from the different doses of weed edibles but firstly it's important to know that tolerance is everything tolerance plays a huge role in your experience and if you're an everyday pot smoker you'll likely have to take a much larger dose of an edible that someone who has no tolerance to THC in order to feel the same effect so take the following effects of doses I give with a grain of salt as this is just generally what you can expect to feel when you take this particular dose so first off we have the micro dose and this ranges anywhere from one milligram to about 2.5 milligrams of THC it's unlikely you'll experience any active effects from this dose but it is possible for people who are hypersensitive to the effects of THC this dose is more just for purposes such as mild relief of pain stress anxiety etc people who Micro's THC edibles might also report increased creativity and focus the effects of this dose are pretty passive you likely won't feel any different fundamentally this can be somewhat compared to people who micro doze LSD and magic mushrooms who do so for similar purposes next we have the low dose which ranges from two point five milligrams to about 15 milligrams and the two ends of the spectrum can be very different especially for people with low tolerance to th see someone consuming the edible for medicinal purposes will experience stronger symptom relief and this dose can also be used for people who have trouble sleeping you may begin to feel a sense of euphoria and that classic high feeling where coordination is slightly impaired and overall perception is altered but if this dose the high is unlikely to be overwhelming and because of this this may be a good dose to try for a first-timer in my own experience there isn't a significant difference between this dose and edible in your average smoking weed high the medium dose ranges from 15 to 30 milligrams someone with a decent THC tolerance still may not be feeling heavy effects here but for many vistas can make them pretty high it's at those dose that people may start to feel negative effects such as anxiety and paranoia you might ask if people use weed for relief of anxiety stress then how could this dose bring on anxiety and stress well THC has biphasic effects which means the substance can have opposite effects in different doses anxiety can be reduced in lower doses but can actually be stronger in higher doses so if you're taking edibles for symptom relief it is important to be aware of these biphasic effects the drug in half coordination and perception will likely be altered at this dose that agree to which it is altered will likely depend on your tolerance some people might start to get the classic red eyes from being high maybe some people experience close eye visuals for me personally I tend to have a close eye visual on low to medium dose weed that looks kind of like this let me know if you have experienced the same type of visual in the comments the high dose ranges from 30 to 50 milligrams this dose will likely bring a significant high even to someone with tolerance and for someone with low tolerance this can bring an extreme high their coordination will definitely be impaired somewhat you might feel a strong euphoria maybe you'll feel very laughy some people's mouths get very dry and get cottonmouth this is due to THC mimicking a naturally occurring chemical called an and amide which binds to cannabinoid receptors in our saliva glands which causes saliva production to decrease you might also get the classic munchies and just want to absolutely binge eat it's important to remember that the effects of THC impacts everyone differently so no two people's high will be exactly the same and you likely will only experience some of the effects I listed not all the very high dose ranges from 50 to 100 milligrams I would say it's more likely than not that you will probably experience some negative effects at this dose but the high may become so intense you may feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed people often experience a rapid heart rate panic nausea in headaches at this dose so definitely don't venture into this realm if you don't know what you're doing for someone with an extremely high tolerance this dose might not be too heavy but for the average person this will likely be overwhelming there are still medicinal benefits at this dose but is only used for people who really need it as this dose is sometimes using cancer patients to boost appetite and is also used for people with certain inflammatory disorders personally any dose at this range or above just completely puts me on my ass the come-up is nice for me as I feel very laughy energetic and social but once the effects really start peaking I honestly begin to struggle to stay awake and wish to do nothing else but to find a cozy place to lie down and fall asleep this may have been due to the strain though as THC isn't the only psychoactive chemical we it's just the most prominent CBD is the chemical that aids with sleep and this chemical also plays a role in the overall effects of the weed and the amount of CBD in the strain will most definitely impact your experience and finally the extremely high dose is going to be anything above 100 milligrams I've heard of some edibles having 250 milligrams some having 500 and even some containing as much as a thousand milligrams obviously the effects will get significantly higher as those increases a 100 milligram edible might not be incredibly strong for someone with a very high tolerance but certainly 500 milligrams is going to put anybody on their ass be very careful of consuming edibles this powerful as there will certainly be negative effects due to the intensity it's in these very high doses that have experienced visuals reminiscent of a psychedelic trip on say LSD the visual might be something kind of like this and speaking of psychedelics there's many people who report having psychedelic like trips from high doses of weed edibles the world-famous Joe Rogan likes to discuss edible pot as along the same lines as psychedelics such as LSD psilocybin mushrooms and DMT saying that edible pot can take you down the rabbit hole there's a comment I found from someone on reddit that I thought described as similarity of the psychedelic feeling on high-dose edibles perfectly not long ago I did a hundred milligrams of THC edibles and had zero tolerance on my couch my eyes closed and no music it was awesome and the peak was over three hours I swam through the psychedelic mind a tunnel with many doors and behind each door was a memory of mine I went through them and had Total Recall I could recall past memories memories of being born my first laugh before thinking and the experience that my first thought as an infant the pure thrill of thinking now the effects of THC in the brain is nowhere close to resembling that of a psychedelic classical psychedelics interact directly with the 5-htt to a receptor in the brain and cannabis does not do this from doing research it seems to be that weed edibles tend to resemble psychedelics more often for people who have already had experiences with psychedelics in the past it's likely more often that this psychedelic feeling is also associated with strains with higher THC levels and lower CBD levels as CBDs antipsychotic effects will likely lessen the psychedelic effect but if you find yourself feeling like you're in the middle of an intense psychedelic trip I'll say what I've always said before let the experience consume you surrender to the substance let your mind flow freely and try not to attach yourself to these thoughts just simply observe don't make any attachments so that's about it for this video hopefully you have a better idea on what you can expect to feel by the different doses of weed edibles if you're new start low THC affects everyone slightly differently so see how you react to the substance stay safe consume responsibly and you'll be fine if you seek to support my work on a deeper level consider joining the patreon I run a book club on there where we read one book a month about topics we go over on this channel if that interests you definitely consider joining as always guys have a great day and peace [Music]", "x63XfDHIZZs": "how's it going my name is Jeff this is my very first attempt at like a an informational type video for YouTube so bear with me I'm making this video because I've recently got interested in dieting and really watching my calories very closely I was trying to lose the last couple of pounds for summer I've been tracking my calories on an app on my phone called called my fitness pal and it's really led me to look for substitutions I can make in my normal dieting that would help me avoid some of the crazy calorie bombs and the snacks I like and so in doing that I've come up with a couple of really cool recipes for what I would call ultra low calorie snacks and it's not things that you would use as a normal meal but it's when you're really jonesing for that specific snack which today I'm going to talk about peanut butter and jelly sandwich one of my favorites how could you make a really super low calorie version of that in researching those types of dishes I can't I came across the Walden Farms products and Walden Farms maybe is what brought you to this video not if you haven't heard of them Walden Farms makes a line of products that would traditionally be the really really high fat type products or additives to dishes you might make they make zero calorie versions so zero fat zero carbs you're a protein zero calories across the board so today the key thing I'm gonna make is a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and this is going to be just a half a sandwich it's going to be a forty calorie half of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and you could of course do the eighty calorie full version if you wanted but I'm gonna do the really low calorie just the snack version if you were just jonesing for PB&J but you didn't have any calories left in your daily allotment so the key ingredients there and this will be kind of a combination video I'm gonna talk about how to make this peanut butter jelly sandwich but also review the two Walden Farms products that go into this so the first is Walden Farms whipped peanut spread hopefully you can see what it looks like there I'm a little bit far away from this but you probably can and the second is Walden Farms grape jelly they call it grape fruit spread so and again if you look at some of the ingredients on these they're made with a whole bunch of things that the the alchemists at the Walden Farms put in there it's mostly water and vegetable fiber as they're thickening agent I've seen there's cornstarch and several other ingredients peanut flavoring in the peanut spread and other artificial flavors in the the jelly so okay bread starting off with our bread this is called nature's harvest whole grains multigrain bread it's a new product and it's a forty calories slice of bread and it is a normal sized piece of bread it's normal thickness I would say similar to a regular piece of Wonder bread the way they pull that off it's a 22 grim slice of bread with six grams of fiber which is how they make it the right size but such a low calorie allotment so starting off with our peanut butter or Walden Farms peanut spread there's been a lot of YouTube videos on this product and reviews online people are pretty split on the product which is why I wanted to add my opinion into the fray you'll find videos online of guys taking this and trying a taste of it and retching or gagging like they're gonna throw up or wanting to spit it out or throwing it in the trash and let me just say it's not nearly that bad it's an okay substitute for peanut butter but it's nowhere close to a big spoonful of Skippy peanut butter so make no mistakes it's um I know it's similar to having diet coke instead of regular coke it tastes okay it's a good substitute it gets you past it but it doesn't taste as good as the real thing the it's gonna be kind of tough to see in this video but the thickness I would say is similar to peanut butter it's maybe a little bit more watery the color is similar it smells peanutty what folks have said online and what I do definitely agree with is that it is kind of an inconsistent product you'll have bytes where it tastes a little bit overly salty and bytes where it tastes a little overly sweet and if you get a good mix of it it does in my opinion tastes very similar to regular so you can really put as much or as little of this up as you want it is a no calorie product I just put that much and then clean off the knife on the other side the second ingredient is our grape jelly or grape fruit spread this is also really interesting product I think it's a good product you can kind of see what it looks like there it's the the color of grape jelly it has an interesting smell and taste and it is sweet it's about the right sweetness but what I will say is as others have said it's more the consistency of jell-o like that you would make regular jello rather than what I consider traditional jelly so it comes out on a knife okay it's kind of slippery it spreads just fine onto bread the taste is like great but it's interesting it's like grape candy so if you can think of a purple hard candy or like a sucker that you might have had or a lollipop that type of grape flavor that's like it's almost like the fake grape juice it tastes more like that than like real 3d grape jelly that you would think of so if you know that taste and if you can't think of what I'm saying but you open up a jar of this and smell it you'll know instantly what I'm saying it's almost like a nostalgia type thing where it really tastes like that grape candy flavor so I put a little bit on each side of my bread you could put as much or as little as you want I put just a little bit like that and then I just really just scored the bread in the middle because I just like to fold my sandwich over like that and so here you go this is you know it's small to half a sandwich but it's only 40 calories and it will certainly get you past that jonesing for a PB&J sandwich so I'm gonna look more many more of these Walden Farms products I've used a few of them already I'll just mention I might talk about this in another video but I'll just mention that the the chocolate syrup is excellent it's a really really good product and these are some of the other products that I just bought recently so just going through them really quick you can see they have a ranch dressing a bacon ranch dressing ketchup barbecue sauce pancake syrup or maple syrup chocolate syrup I haven't tried that yet but folks have said it's great chocolate dip I've already gone through one jar of this it's excellent to me it tastes like chocolate donut frosting if you can think of that flavor marshmallow dip raspberry jelly probably similar to the grape jelly that I have they have regular Mayo which I've used in dips I use it on sandwiches I use it to make tuna salad or make mix-up tuna for tuna sandwich and you can see I did get one of the spaghetti sauces they have they also make an alfredo and I think a few others so I'll go into more of those later hopefully this is a helpful video take it easy", "szIfo0BJMs0": "[Music] there's a color-changing pineapple behind me see know what that means it means it's time for weeks the marijuana edible review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary and on today's episode I'm gonna help you make sense of one thing I have never understood at any of the dispensaries I've been to because I have seen this product at practically every dispensary that I have been to and I have never ever picked it up because it always seems like such a bad deal to me and that is cheeba choose as I said I have seen these at practically every dispensary of it around but I have never actually picked them up because they just seem like a tremendously bad value so this is their extra strength hybrid and chew at a hundred milligrams of THC see if we can actually get that oriented properly for you probably not oh there it goes um so yeah you can see hundred milligrams of THC 520 milligram doses but let's look at the back and you can see that price tag they sell this for 15 bucks I got a discount for 13 to 13 dollars for this tiny tiny tiny little thing now I do like small edibles I do actually have always have an affinity for potent things in small packages that's what she said but this just does not seem like it could do the job hundred milligrams isn't that much especially for 15 bucks and it just doesn't seem like it could pack that much of a punch in something this small I mean I've had like the punch bars before which are quite small or I've had the bang the bite and each of those actually had nearly twice as much THC in them as there's this thing did and they were considerably bigger even still so I do not know what to expect I'm hoping because they are everywhere they're sort of ubiquitous that means that there's some reason they're so popular and they're as potent as they are but we're about to find out together all I know is if this ends up being a disappointment I'm gonna have some harsh words for Chiba Choo so I'm gonna shut up now open this up pop it in my mouth poll tell you how it tastes and then I will be back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling although for you it'll be just a couple of seconds okay so I'm unraveling it here comes in it is definitely a caramel I don't know how you would split this in five doses otherwise it's pretty pretty mushy it smells good it smells like a caramel I'm just gonna plunk this whole thing right my mouth I'm gonna do it in two bites just do it in one here we go well maybe actually cut some music in my new tune there we go down the hatch so it taste is good you've got to give him credit for that wow that was a really good taste in caramel perfect sort of consistency very little cannabis taste I was happy with that but what I'm unsure about is how this bad boy is actually going to hit me for that guy's you're gonna have to wait a couple seconds me on the other hand I'm have to wait a couple hours to see what its gonna do to me I will let you know I'll see you guys in just a bit peace it's been two hours guys since I had the Chiba juice and it's just as I feared Chiba I'm afraid I do not choose you it's it's about as bad as I had hoped um yeah I can't say I feel nothing I would say I'm at maybe a three two and a half somewhere in there um so you know not high at all you know I feel something maybe there's sort of the effects after you had smoked a joint an hour later or something just like the echo of a high so it's you know it tasted good I like the taste of the chima choose it's just too expensive for what it is and does not provide enough of a high I have tried other 100 milligram edibles that I've hit harder than this and that 15 bucks for this thing it's just it's it's too much I cannot recommend the Chiba choose at this point I don't think I would be reviewing any more Chiba choose just because you know one and done with this one maybe unless you guys really have some wrong feelings about other ones or if there's something you really want me to review from cheap at you let me know but otherwise this one is enough of a bummer on its own then I don't feel like I have to run down there their entire catalogue I think they have more projects than this I think anyways that's gonna do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching as always and I will see you on our next review peace pretty good",

Step 1. Make your dog sit. Never call a dog to you in order to give her\nmedicine. You don't want her to associate being called\nwith being dosed! Always seek her out yourself. Step 2. Use one hand to pry your dog's mouth open. With your other hand, pop the pill way back\ninto her mouth. Make sure the pill goes behind the back of\nher tongue. A second person to help may come in handy\nif your dog is especially large or wriggly. Step 3. With one hand, hold the dog's mouth closed,\nsnout pointing up, while gently rubbing her throat with your other hand. Step 4. Once the dog swallows and licks her lips,\nyou can be sure that the pill is safely down. Stay nearby until you know the pill's been\nswallowed. Plenty of dogs are adept at concealing their\nmeds and spitting them out later. Step 5. If you're having difficulty, check with your\nvet to see if it's safe to give your dog a pill concealed in food and, if so, try hiding\nthe medicine in something soft like cheese, cream cheese, or peanut butter. Let the dog lick your fingers after you feed\nher the pill\u2014that will ensure she swallows. Be sure to tell your vet what food you might\ntry\u2014some foods interact badly with certain medications. Step 6. If your dog doesn't fall for the pill-in-the-food\ntrick, crush the pill, mix it with a little sugar water, and use a baby syringe to squirt\nthe liquid into the dog's mouth. Step 7. Still not working? Try a pill gun (available from your vet or\nlocal pet store) to propel the pill down the dog's throat. Step 8. When the pill is all gone, praise your dog,\npat her, and give her a nice treat to take away the taste!

think this is one worth knowing since milligrams of THC is quickly becoming the new dominant unit of measurement when it comes to trying to discuss dosages just like it's the dominant unit of measurement with prescription medication and a lot of other substances also in legal jurisdictions it's becoming increasingly the standard way to label the dosage up on marijuana edibles and drinkables when we talk about weed traditionally it was always done by weight grams ounces pounds and so on which was very broad and also very standard and in the last 15 years we also started using percent THC to be more precise which describes the THC content of a particular strain per gram and thus its potency per gram but that figure was always expressed as a percentage for example this strain is 12% THC but now we've gone one step further to the milligrams that milligram figure is not as confusing as it seems if you have one gram of weed also known as 1000 milligrams and it's a strain that's 12% THC that means there's 120 milligrams of THC in that single gram why do we need to take things to milligrams because one standard dosage especially when it comes to edibles has been defined as 10 milligrams 10 milligrams of THC is the amount of THC that a relative novice consumer would need to consume in order to feel mild of cannabis effects a mild high so if you buy a marijuana chocolate bar and it states that the whole chocolate bar contains a hundred and sixty milligrams that means that's that chocolate bar has 16 of those standard doses and they're most likely divided into the little chocolate squares in that bar now that doesn't mean that to the average marijuana consumer they'll be able to get decently stoned off of ten milligrams as I said in my episode on tolerance just like with alcohol marijuana tolerance Rises 10 milligrams is really just a measurement for novices for myself I need at least 25 to 30 milligrams and my tolerance is above average but it's nothing special I know super heavy marijuana users who don't feel much of anything until they get to about 50 milligrams but if you're just starting out with edibles 10 milligrams should be your first trial run obviously to control dosage on such like with such precision you have to live in a legal weed jurisdiction because that's the only way you're gonna see the percent THC or the milligram THC vigor expressed in a reliable way on the package so there you go now you know what milligrams THC is and how it might apply to you hope you enjoyed the show if you found it useful be sure to

instagram snapchat and youtube so um by the way she does macro coaching i do macro coaching we both do macro coaching but i never talk about it so i wanted to talk about it um we just do macro coaching so if you're interested in losing weight and you got some fitness goals hit us up my email her email it'll be in the description all right let's get to the review oh [ __ ] it's backwards there we go there we go there we go yeah yeah so this shit's called muscle chef with two fs muscle chef and this is hazelnut protein spread white chocolate and regular hazelnut chocolate and cocoa what was it no no it's coco oh coco or coco coco anyways anyways um this stuff's on amazon so i was on my amazon next thing you know i'm like protein spreads and i'm like what the [ __ ] and i seen that this was um i seen that this was on amazon but i've never seen it before so i was like all right what is it so the price point on this bad boy is um i think it's twelve dollars for two pack so it's six dollars a piece not expense not expensive at all but guess what it doesn't have amazon prime so you have to pay for shipping which kind of sucks because if you had amazon prime you can get this for twelve dollars at six dollars a piece after shipping that's pretty fair but the delivery was like 5.99 so this end up being like 18 or 19 for a two pack which is about the same price point as like the bomar butters and everything else like ten dollars better get some stuff while you're shopping pretty much like you got to make it worth it unfortunately so and we'll let you know if it's worth it yeah so um yeah so that is the price point so the macros is the same 180 calories you have 13 fat you got eight carbs three fiber six sugar and seven grams protein and you're probably asking yourself where is this where's this stuff made it says country origin of turkey so this was made in turkey this isn't the european european lady you could tell it's got a european label it's got um yeah it's got a european label it's definitely interesting yeah it's different languages where's the ingredients at oh it's right there uh whey protein is the protein source and what sugar sweetener they use actually it's super basic sugar beet you use some sugar beet action that's it it's actually pretty basic what's yours pretty basic pretty basic whey protein hazelnut hazelnut vegetable white chocolate cocoa skim milk sugar beet lots of thinner vanilla flavoring so it's pretty basic so all made without lard all right yeah so we're gonna bust it open okay texture is on the point definitely like a i like it i don't know what it what would you call this texture oh it's like uh is it almost like the real deal it looks like to be like wow it's uh everyone saw the spoon enough uh yeah but it's pretty interesting like i like it look at that boom there you go do the haze on that first side apparently hazelnut first you're a big fan of um nutella right i do the real stuff boom definitely can't tell that there's any protein in there you can't tell no way no no way no way got jokes up in this place it almost tastes like chocolate pudding oh yes is that what it tastes like to you except a little bit more more denser more dense obviously with the texture but i would say it's got like a chocolate pudding feel as far as it tastes i mean it's got cocoa so that's where we're getting the chocolate but i love this yeah better than bulmar no better than walmart the texture is better than bulmar but the taste is better boomer that's what i'm saying the taste it depends because bulmar has like a marshmallow type of taste yeah it does and this is more like the real deal i would say as far as the texture this is the white one very similar very similar i think this might be a little bit more denser than the actually yeah it is it's like it won't give it all it's like you scoop it and it's there it's not going anywhere anytime soon like so anyways there's the white chocolate one that's a big spoon just do a little lick a little lick white chocolate hazelnut i didn't know that was a thing by the way that's just straight up pure white chocolate sugar not mad not mad yeah it tastes like white chocolate just straight up white chocolate that's games as you can tell she likes it it tastes like white chocolate it's really good with protein i think they're doing some [ __ ] over there at turkey i think they're doing some turkey actually now they're both contaminated they don't matter so what are you thinking i'm okay giving them the same mom ratings yeah same rings hmm it's really just like a white chocolate spread like let me look up nutella's actual flavor michaels because i don't know nutella's macros well for one it does have a decent amount of fat well it's nuts what did you expect yeah it's only got seven protein so it's not crazy bummer has like ten but for what it is it's not bad i really like him i forgot i don't have service down here so let's hope yeah you ain't got no service down here nutella 200 uh calories it's got 12 grams of fat same fat it's got 21 grams of sugar holy [ __ ] and then 2 grams of protein so there's less carbs way less carbs than this and more way less carbs same three three of the carbs are fiber here yeah so i think for what it is it's like super solid super solid yeah the cocoa it's a very big contender to the nutella like bulmar is its own thing it doesn't line up with nutella this one actually does i agree but i do like the bowmer one i do like it it's super soft it's like a thought it's so good so is this one it's good it is it's something the texture difference is totally different i think for the price point they're actually on point right yeah i suggest that i suggest them um ratings you got something yeah i think you're that looks like 10. i could see it in her eyes i think ready three two one nine yeah i'm giving it a nine it's pretty solid it's beautiful she likes it i like it she doesn't like things a lot so i would take this one as a good suggestion beautiful cultural check it out check it out on amazon guys check it out beautiful white chocolate straight or white chocolate can't even tell there's protein that's ganging that's coming that's good coming from her because she's always like it's got a protein taste or something hey in this day and age things you know 20 21 now it's 20 21 it should be mashed up by now yeah i don't want to taste no protein we're not back in the 80s yeah all right shit's growing i'm bringing that portion back shit's been growing since then so 100 hope you guys enjoyed this video if you guys tried these out let me know what the [ __ ] you think in the comment section below other than that subscribe share like comment below everything you

we'll do it [Music] lazy", "3rrc_cgSkwQ": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's episode we are not going to be reviewing a product instead we're going to be talking about news news and very sad news at that and that is that the edible Bonanza the edible crazy wonderful Wild West market in California is coming to an end as we know it January 1st I believe of 2018 the new regulations go into effect for both medicinal and recreational weed in the state of California and one of those major major changes coming to to the marijuana industry at large is headed headed straight for the edible industry in a really really really devastating way so what is changing one one thing makes sense and that's no more edibles that are shaped like kids candy that makes sense to me nothing you know no gummy shaped things no cartoon shaped things nothing with a cartoon mascot that'll make sense that all that all makes perfect sense to me and I'm totally ok with that but the far more devastating in the far more far-reaching consequences are gonna come in from the limits of THC henceforth each package each product can only be a hundred milligrams in total and can only have 10 milligrams of THC per serving so let me let's let's let's put that in perspective that means that you could only have a brownie can't even be a hundred milligrams it has to be cut up into ten squares of ten milligrams each and the whole thing can only be a hundred milligrams how they're gonna price these things I have no idea if they're going to be commensurate with the prices we see for 100 milligram edibles now or if they're just going to be more expensive what this does to the folks who really need those high you know folks with high high tolerances you know focuses with cancer diabetes terminal illnesses that rely on these high potency edibles for their pain and killing needs I don't know what they're gonna do it's again it's a it's a crippling blow to patients and it's equipping Bluett I assume to the industry they're gonna have to completely change the way that they operate here in California no company that I know of operates in that mode right now everybody has much more higher potency edibles and they're not divided into ten milligram parts in any way shape or form I'm just trying to think of the production and logistics work that's gonna have to go into these companies to change up their products and their formulas something like a kiva like how are they gonna break down their 180 milligrams chocalate bar and I take it back I have seen one company that's already seems to be on their way to figuring that out and that is kirova if you go to their website you can see where they now have many cookies and 100 milligram packages I assume they are coming out with this products just in preparation for the regulations but what everybody else is going to do that don't have the resources of say a you know a Korova to to shift like that to to completely change their production line the way they do everything III got to assume that's going to put them in a you know in dire financial straits so it's gonna be a big big change come January 1st and I still actually have lots and lots of questions about this so I don't know if first off everything I've read and I will provide links below I'll provide links in the description to everything I've read including the actual if I can find it the actual statute itself but right now I've seen on High Times and on Leafly and a couple other places summaries of the new regulations that are going to affect and these are definitely happening but I cannot find clear evidence on whether or not this is also going to affect medical market whether or not this is only going to affect for the recreational market or whether this is pan market and it's going to both recreational and and medicinal so I don't know I don't know if it takes what happens to all the old stock come January first if everything has to be tossed out or if there's a grace period i I have I have tons of questions left and if you are say a dispensary owner who is in the know if you're somebody who has any kind of knowledge of the cannabis law in California please hit me up I would love to talk to you on the show so we can clarify some of these laws you can email me at you can it mean weeks a tweets reviews.com or weeks reviews at gmail.com you can hit me up on twitter or facebook please get in touch with me again if you have any additional knowledge on this I would love to get in contact with you I feel terribly terribly for all of the patients that are gonna have to completely change their sort of regimen for for edibles I know a lot of patients already have their favorite edible that they you know dose themselves have everything perfectly set up to help them get you know escape their pain huh I'm I'm I'm bummed out myself um I'm not sure what what we're gonna do here a tweets we'll figure it out we'll still be reviewing edibles for sure and I'm sorry I've been away a lot recently been very busy but rest assured new reviews will be coming but as to what we're going to do January 1st we'll continue to review edibles but it's gonna have to be a change for us as well here at wheats so again guys just to reiterate come the beginning of the year the edible market that we know and love in California is going to a revocable II and in my opinion a revocable change for the worse come January 1st it's it's it's it's not going to be the this sort of great place that it was before I mean I of course it had problems the edible market like all markets had problems but I think these these new regulations are are an atrocity frankly and I hope I hope this state will we'll see the error of their ways rather quickly and and things can get back to normal but just wanted to give you guys a heads up and again if you know anybody or if you yourself know any of these laws anymore please hit me up I would love to talk to you and we can get this further clarified so guys that's going to do it for this episode here on wheats sorry for the bummer of the news hopefully things will change but for now that looks like it's the way it's going to be thank you so much for watching waits and we will see you on a future video peace"}
