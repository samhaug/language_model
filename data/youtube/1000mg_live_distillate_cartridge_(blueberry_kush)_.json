{"OHTBbns6PMQ": "so today we're going to be going over the og kush gram distance by kraft um you're going to see me mention later that it's like also branded oil as well but it's spike craft so let's get into it all right this is a full gram or a thousand milligram uh og kush cartridge this is by craft oil cartridge by craft um and i want to say i picked these up for about like 15 bucks or so and um i will say it didn't work initially on my yokan styx battery and then i tried it on a ooze battery uh and it didn't work so i had to resort to my magneto and it works on my magneto so i don't know the hardware is kind of weird for these i guess that's always been like an issue that i remember having with these because i've had some of these before in the past but other than that uh they're really good cartridges and they're really great they taste this one in particular doesn't really like have like a flavor it's not like a flavored cartridge per se this is like o.j kush you know more like a weed strain so it's got really no terpenes for like you know to taste any kind of way that you would think it would make it taste fruity or good but other than that these don't taste like terpene-wise like or without the terpenes i should say don't taste too bad so these are pretty fire all right so we were talking about the thousand milligram or gram craft oil cartridge i got this at the golden meds federal location and uh i want to say i paid if i didn't i already mentioned it like what uh 12 or like 15 bucks and at that location that's the location where i had the incident like i said where i bought the uh veritas or the veritas and it came empty that's also where i got the uh consumables the keef drinks and soda or whatever but they're going to come these cartridges when you open them like i said i'm going to insert a photo or picture of the containers and tubes what it looks like the packaging and they're going to come with these uh orange tips here and i like these because these are nice i'll keep these on there after i'm like using it still after i've already opened it because what it'll do is it'll help keep like lint and stuff out of the tip and whatnot you'll get some like gunk and [ __ ] in the tips and sometimes you hit them and then they're clogged or whatever you just get some crap in there and then it goes back down into your cartridge and it can kind of mess it up so you don't want to do that but other than that the taste on these like i said they're going to be very earthy they're going to have like a normal like not really any kind of terpene taste that like any terpenes added to it to make it taste like flavorful or like fruity or like any of those flavored ones because this one like i said is uh oji kush so very very good earthy taste i recommend like if you're out there in colorado at all ever anywhere in the dispensaries you can get a hold of the oil the craft cartridges go ahead and make sure you do really great good quality distillate but that's going to wrap it up it's going to be a short one and just a quick review of that cartridge i was only able to get one of them and uh yeah so like i said stay tuned for

is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven light goal boy and we will do another review yeah man that's all i got to say about it this joint is pissing me off much love y'all seven likes do it do it all right go to twitch.tv link will be in the description uh go to my twitter man i'm trying to get my twitter up as well like i want y'all to be able to follow me and know what i'm doing you know know when i'm going to make a video knowing i'm going live you know i always want feedback as well you know i want to talk to you guys too that's always awesome so much love you guys let me know what you guys thought about the video i will see you in the next video be safe peace out [Music] you", "cu6oG6e_OTU": "[Music] some guys that breathing for cleaning we're back with a new video we have blueberry crush and dank Bates leave that oil at dank veyts official all organic no problem glycol like I said before disease you just take him down from the bottom open the bottom part and just slide it right up it has a seal at the bottom like always if it doesn't have a seal it has already been used either the tip always has to be a plastic plastic tip the good thing is that these are made out of glass so they don't break easily I dropped them a couple times on the floor I just figure right back up in this fight it also says Cecil and it has a code at the bottom with a cave if you mind probably doesn't zoom in as well but if you don't see that at the bottom it's fake and if it's Dave Bates official or Dave Bates official account both of them are real so you ain't got nothing to worry about a little bit left of Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] but I want to try out the blue breakers so let's see I totally forgot it is 90 point 54 percent THC and has a story at the bottom that I'll leave down in the description real it seems I like to primum before I hit it it already tastes like like a blueberry flavor it's spot-on let's see the taste is there funky it's pretty good it's not as strong as the Alaskan Thunder [ __ ] and the Alaskan tundra [ __ ] is the same THC potent potency and I barely kind of feel it let's see if the second year is better the flavor all right give me the flavor there's like a nine out of ten almost a ten out of ten the high I probably say like a seven out of ten it's it's alright it's not some nothing good but you know if you're into indicas and you want to be like slump on the couch are you Chinese you're trying to get something and just lay you down I would go for this one it's a blueberry Kush everybody wants this just stay tuned guys cuz I got more [Music]", "lZ-vfMIuGco": "[Music] welcome to truebuds tv it's your buddy jack talking distillate vapes versus live resin vapes what's going on here what's the difference i've had tons of requests so i'm happy to be fulfilling those requests let's see what we got in the uh little handy dandy true buds pack let's open it up well that's for another video i'm going to be opening up this top shelf pre-roll see what we got inside keep an eye out for that video i have the uh live resin from jetty here the unrefined let's go ahead and open this up we got the little satchel in here tastes so good so live resin upon harvest is instantly frozen this is the way that they're going to get the most terpenes in there the full flower flavor that everybody loves live resin is usually extracted with butane and purged in a vacuum oven i'm not going to go too far into the process let me know if you want to see more videos on the actual process now live resin usually on the scale shows it's a little less potent and a lot of people go shopping i want the highest potency i want this and that that's why distillate cartridges are so popular and that's why i'm making this video to kind of educate people because distillate is the bottom of the barrel if you will it's the leftovers the trim the shake because everything is going to be burnt off essentially it's like making booze it's like making a moonshine or ever clear you're going to put all this [ __ ] in and then you're going to be left with the most potent stuff possible basically tasteless odorless colorless and then this is when the companies add in the terpenes if you're lucky sometimes they're delicious sometimes they're not but a lot of times you can taste the artificialness and that's why i think especially after having this live resin i got a live resin from my uh packs the other day from jetty too i think this is the go to from now on i'm tired of these distillate carts when i hit them they taste fake i'm [ __ ] like sneezing that's another video i've been with people when they're smoking vapes i sneeze all the time after hitting this distillate cart like what kind of terpenes have you put in there is it some [ __ ] random flower that i happen to be allergic to like that is the beauty of the live resin is you are getting the live flower if you will the closest resemblance in a nice form that's right there price point price point this graham cartridge is pretty damn expensive i'm not gonna lie i was a little hesitant it was like 62. i got it from ease i'll put a comment down below if you want to order through there for your first time get 20 off but that's expensive sometimes i have people commenting like dude that's some serious dough you're dropping on some carts and [ __ ] but it's convenient it's legal gives me peace of mind i really don't mind actually you know shoveling that money forward people buy the stuff through ease it all kind of comes back but what i'm saying here is i think this has helped transform me i've had other live resin vapes and i've thought the same thing but i'll still buy distillate ones but i'm sitting there i feel like sometimes these like even the circles one like i'll take [ __ ] like 10 15 [ __ ] poles off it and it feels like just now i had like what four of these like this is better so i guess you got to decide where you want to put your money quantity over quality i'll just compare it to like schwag versus fire ass nog you know what i'm saying i would say this is that good nug and the distillery cartridges are the swag so yeah like that we got the unrefined live resin and then we have a distillate like this was like 15 bucks and you can tell so that's my two cents i wanted to break down the difference for you between the live resin and the distillate vapes like i said the tons of people were asking like yo bro like what's the difference man and i'm like i'm gonna make a video so here it is thank you for hanging out i'm gonna go enjoy this and if you're liking this pack or you want to grab any of the other true buzz merch you know i'll be truly grateful and i got some really cool stuff just dropped the free smoke edition the stone bald eagle i got a whole video coming about that because it represents a lot to me i put a lot of thought

I'm here anyways so I'm going to be doing a quick little review on the King pen cartridges the strain one is trainwreck and let me just firstly say how disappointed I am I tried their cartridges before I didn't have that big of a problem with it I thought that the concentrate thought was in there was kind of thick that was kind of I guess a little indicator that there was something up with it but this the current time that I needed another one alright this is only one I could find so this is what I was dealing with and it was a lot worse than last time so mmm let me just show you I guess what this looks like as you can see instantly this looks just absolutely disgusting this is something that you clearly don't want to smoke let me focus game clothes do you see what is in there can you guys tell me what you think that is I mean this is clearly some type of like DIY cartridge or something that someone have [ __ ] me over on like Ivan like look at this color separation right here in this like air bubble that's neither floating up to the top may I tell you like this has been in the year for about nine hours and it has not moved let me flip it upside down nothing you can see it is slowly hardly moving at all but it is just so so alarming this is clearly my fault that I purchased this I got it for about $50 I don't know I'm just very upset about it I don't really know what is in there like I said if you guys know if you guys ever seen thing like this please tell me what you think this could possibly bleep like be cuz I'm actually scared too I smoked it a couple times clearly not that much because it's uh I didn't notice it until it got down to this bubble like how bad it was so yeah guys please be careful with the stuff you buy you never know what's really in it and that's the truth so yeah if you guys can just comment down below and let me know what you think what is in there cuz like I said clearly it's some some [ __ ] and I'm trying to figure it out yeah yeah", "NM60zEAYLFo": "hello friends welcome elites the marijuana review ship formerly the marijuana edible review show now we're covering everything we're everywhere we're doing at all welcome to weeds guys we are here to help you make sense of your dispensary we are here to help you understand what products to spend your hard-earned money on mostly edibles but we do a little bit of everything and today we are proving that because we are doing our third cartridge review third yeah one two three third cartridge review here on wheats we have reviewed rove and we have reviewed crafted and now today we are going to be reviewing the cartridges from the fine may be fine folks i'm not sure if they're fine folks or not we'll find out i know that i did not enjoy their edible candy so far but without too much more preamble we're talking flavor x today flavor x blueberry cush indica 500 milligram cartridge i picked this up for my dispensary here in a Long Beach for a $35 so not super cheap but not crazy expensive either sort of a little bit higher than average for the cost of a cartridge so in the back we see the ingredients are ultrafine cannabis oil and terpenes and that is it but I don't see any other necessary lab results I see what's distributed by and in compliance with but I don't see their lab results they said they're voted best tasting and highest potency but they don't tell us who gave them the honor of being the best-tasting and most potent cartridge which is always to me a sign of trouble when somebody says we're award-winning but we're not gonna tell you what award we won okay enough of that let's not prejudge here let's let's judge on the merits and not by past experience or by crazy packaging so let's talk about the packaging first and foremost this is without a doubt the cheapest packaging I have seen for a cartridge I mean it's just designed to sit on a shelf it's not fancy at all let's compare it to a rogue box which I have right next to me here I mean look at the packaging for this road cartridge in comparison it's it's amazing it's so fancy it's so nice so incredible this is pretty bare-bones stuff but it's not so much about the packaging it's really about what's inside that packaging that counts so let's see what's going on here this again is blueberry cush not flavored in any other way all terpenes so it's all natural or so they say in terms of flavor so here we go we've got it inside here pretty standard issue cartridge looking let's open her up it tasted terrible okay so here's the cartridge they say this is a half gram of oil in there it doesn't really look like a half gram of oil to be honest but otherwise a pretty bare-bones cartridge looks about the same as any other cartridge except there's is that plastic or glass I think it's plastic there instead of glass which is a cheaper material does not look as fancy as some of the other cartridges certainly not as classy as say the crafted cartridge but let's open it up and who cares if it looks doesn't look fancy as long as it tastes and hits great so this is just your standard 510 battery thread got it plugged into my fancy vape pen here let's give it a hit so first things first not the easiest draw in the world you have to really pull out that drop to get it to come out but once you get to come out it's nice and clean the taste the taste isn't doing much for me to be honest it's not terrible but I have certainly had better tasting cartridges it's not gonna make you gag or anything it's just a very neutral very very cannabis e tasting one it definitely don't taste the blueberry cush it just tastes like your standard-issue babe cartridge certainly nothing I would vote best tasting it's also a little hot it's a little hotter than some of the others I'm going to turn down my voltage on my vape pen mine as an adjustable voltage here I've got it about a third of the way up so I don't think it would be that coming out that hot but it does come out a little bit warmer than some of the others and with taste again is okay well and after a good solid five puffs there I'm feeling pretty high I'm probably at a 3-4 somewhere in there so not an outrageous bout in line with other cartridges this one is an indica and right now I guess I'm not excuse me I'm not feeling particularly in the couch at this moment it's not hitting me as hard as I would like to be to be entirely honest it's not hitting me as hard as I would have hoped and it's certainly not hitting me like indica normally does it's not making me sleepy it's not making me tired it's just there's a sort of vague head hi there on initial inspection um in terms of taste and postin see this is this is not in the running for the best of the best I don't believe I am would not I would not discount it just yet I want to count it out but for the price the taste in the the potency this is not among the best I've ever had if I'm being entirely honest but but we will get the complete review I am going to finish this cartridge off and I will come back to you once it's over with to give you my wrap-up thoughts because you can't really tell after just five hits if this is going to be worth it so guys I'm going to a puff on this for the next couple of days let you know how long it took me to get through with how much usage and if my thoughts have evolved or changed over the next couple of days but right now I would tell you probably stick with so far I would say Rove is the best cartridge I have tried and it is also the cheapest and the best tasting so I would stick with Rove if you see it but I will let you know if my thoughts change so guys through the magic of editing I will see you in just a couple of seconds but for me it'll be a couple of days thanks for watching see in just a bit peace [Music] hi guys welcome back to wheats this is our follow-up for the flavor ex blueberry cush in the cartridge here and my thoughts have really not evolved a whole lot since my initial impressions this is not my favorite cartridge this is not the best cartridge I've ever had not by a long shot it's not a complete disaster but man I I think there are quite a few ones that I would suggest over flavor X I'm trying to get the camera to focus in there so you can see here all done all done for both so in every kind of metric it was just kind of middling to me and that's you know it wasn't that great in terms of taste it wasn't that great in terms of potency it lasted about two days of pretty heavy usage so it wasn't too disappointed in terms of capacity but the cartridge design was not that great the packaging was pretty bland all in all I gotta say flavor X is not what I would be reaching for and the my first choice for cartridges in the future and I'm trying to remember how much it costs I believe it was $35 and I think I might have said that in the first half of the video as well so it's you know it's it's a little bit on the expensive two side to for a half gram cartridge especially now that they charge taxes and things here in California so I'm gonna go with a pass on the flavor X cartridge you know if that's all they have at your dispensary I don't think you're gonna you know be out too much if you pick it up but but I think there are better choices for your money still so far from me I would go with Rove as my as my choice du jour of things that we have reviewed so far I think I might try to give another flavor X maybe one of their sativas a review in the future to see if it changes my mind at all but right now it's just not my favorite cartridge if I had to score between 1 to 10 which I've never done before I'd put it firmly at the well you know it's I don't like scoring things out of 10 especially something as subjective as a as a weed cartridge so scratch that sorry for even bringing that up but just on the whole just to reiterate one more time I've had better tasting cartridges I've had more potent cartridges I've had cartridges with fancier packaging not that's a big issue so it's it's gonna be a pass for me flavor X and especially this blueberry cush cartridge here I think you can do better for your money out there guys and that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats I appreciate you guys watching as always thank you so much guys out there and we will see you on our next review peace", "l7PHGUHdhNc": "story this evening an empire of illegal drugs that's the description of a massive THC vape cartridge operation busted in Kenosha County investigators say they saved about a half a million and a half dollars of illegal drugs our Hanna Jewell is live with what's been found so far and how this all started with somebody's worried parents yes is this one of the largest drug operations you've had in Kenosha I don't think it was but of this type it's the largest we've ever had and as far as I know it's probably one of the largest in the country Kenosha County Sheriff David beth says the THC vape cartridge operation was being run out of a house and paddock Lake and a condo in Bristol Beth says they seized THC products with a street value of 1.5 million dollars focus was on making money sheriff Beth says two brothers 20 year old Tyler Huff Heinz and 23 year old Jacob hoppings are both facing multiple charges for illegal drug violations that's just the tip of the iceberg in this operation search warrant served at the residences last week led investigators to find more than 31,000 illegal THC vape cartridges almost 100 thousand unfilled cartridges and dozens of mason jars filled with THC oil imported from California they would take a syringe and they inject it into the cartridges the sheriff says they also found guns marijuana buds cocaine pills and $60,000 cash investigators say they may never have uncovered the covert business if it weren't for a couple of parents in Waukesha who tipped them off to a THC cartridge they found with their son I asked all parents out there this is a perfect opportunity and a friendly reminder to have that conversation with your kids six deaths have been blamed on vaping nationwide many more injuries federal investigators are stepping in here now to see if any of those cases are linked to this case here reporting live in Kenosha Hanna Jewell Fox 6 News", "G7GklIFSSAU": "Delta time THC there's now a huge thread regarding that and don't live when we had a fun little for it for take a little for a layman's background so so depending it specifically yeah everybody's different and I'll all have their own special ways of a festival but depending on where or how the different pieces of the molecule are laid out you you know the difference between THC delta 9 and T and C a is th EA has a carbolic acid molecule in its tail and no boxer group carboxyl group and in another thing there's Delta 88 C which has gotten really popular with the water clear trend and people would you know they would throw a bunch of carbon and some acids and stuff into their boiling flask and then they'd start distilling it and it's coming out beautiful water clear they sent test results or they'd sent testing labs and then it's yeah like very low percentage of Delta 9 THC eventually we started they got standards for Delta 88 C then started quantifying that there's more THC in us that there is but then there's still a little missing piece that like you'd see you know 60 to 70 80 percent cannabinoids and this water clear stuff that you know it's all cannabinoids and there's plenty of isomers and stereo isomers of THC and these are things that happen through different reaction their reactions that happen through heating and the presence of acids and bases and given the different environmental things or what was sprayed on those so that that can actually be a big indicator what's happening into the reactions as well so so good all that distillation method we're like you put stuff in a pot it boils at different temperatures and all that well throw catalyst in that pot that you don't know is there like you know people spray put sulfur on their plants or people you know certain things get sprayed on plants and when you concentrate that thing in a hot flask under vacuum where fires and fire attack there's a whole bunch of ways you could do that but to go back to Delta 10 Delta 10 is simply an unknown type of THC that until recently was it is yes in different income in different ways they affect all three of those can affect a single person completely different no they've been discovered but they're only being mass-produced yeah they yeah macula vanilla and knows about him and he has and we are just now mass producing them because we have the freedom of the market to start and start playing and then we also have the competition in the market to try to make the clearest most beautiful looking oil which you know well it used to be Delta 8 th DW I mean I we can I know use I'm saying historically historically when they first started getting this perfectly clear bottle of oil it was Delta eight and they would do this refluxing carbon acids and but but but yeah and that was it then they would use a catalyst in the flask that they were boiling in one we're talking about people who appreciate the clarity that clear net the secret is that the consumer is that an expert consumers okay and what's your opinion on consumers have been led to believe that the clear the oil is well and and and that clear could come from a lot of different things it can be cut with another clear oil that it makes you know just diffuses what color is in there there's a lot of things that can clarity is definitely an indicator of purity though it was an indicator but the a slight yellow amber tint the these are little little atomic level refractions that are happening with chromophores that hold into the the tail end of the molecule these these are what a chromophore is uncle mela these they're they're basically like atomically small things that will refract light at a different color so you have so by breaking that bond you you like that's when people distill with certain things on the flask you can break that at that chromophore bond and it you can also break that bond by through chromatography as well which people eventually developed a method for Delta 9 THC does anyone clear water clear yeah and it that was just a method of taking a single pass distillate and then passing it through a series of usually magnesium silicate or floor so actually and then but different color remediating adsorbents that were also being used to remediate past asides and they still are used to remediate pesticides and it just happened that you make water clear delta 9 after remediating pesticides properly as sometimes depending on the oil and what kind of colors and that the condition THC 8 and 10 have been known for and their-their prevalent in the same way that THC is in Canada like there is it kind of like a is it a totally different cannabinoid that is in very low percentages in well zombie health of ours not so much on the cultivar it's a reaction through processing so you're not gonna have those you're not gonna have a bunch of Delta eight or delta10 any in your flowers you're gonna have it in a kind of a crazy their isomers correct and it was the one thing everything we're talking about is like the ability to narrow the bands of what you're capturing well if you cuz you're right it's it's these little slices but the only way that's possible is that we've now created these massive machine that will process a lot so we get bigger trends you know we we see information come out of plant material from farms all over California grown differently going different ways different yields different strengths different compounds or the makeup of the cannabinoids in that specific strain like it's really interesting we get to see a lot of those so at the same time as we're narrowing the focus and really like getting to chop down into you know now we're we just picked up a machine that will separate out individual cannabinoids so you can collect them individually it's a centrifugal partitioning chromatography this company called rodeo cron they catch it you guys okay yeah sorry THC eight and ten are kind of like mine or like other cannabinoids that we've known about it but haven't been able to isolate so on the market are we gonna eventually see like THC eight tinctures and THC ten tinctures in the same way that we see other kind of my hair cannabinoid totally and we've been seeing mostly we've been seeing a lot of THC eight cart hay in cartridges and there is subsequently a decent amount of Delta ten THC that's in there well no they're just calling it if you're buying a card off the traditional market you they're saying it's one thing but who knows what really is in that cartridge right so but because you can take garbage oil and by attorney by doing this process to convert it to Delta eight clean it up to make it look clear a lot of guys do that ii buy a really cheap oil get a little bit of a fraction of that off and this really nice-looking oil and then it's just cheaper the way that that's produced then I like water clear Delta nine it takes extremely expensive absorbance and a process to do it with the Delta eight you throw some activated carbon in their flask and if you distill right here you can get water clear I mean there's a few other a few other parameters to change but you just dump a bunch of garbage in your flask and then just mix it with your oil and your oil is coming out nicely that was what a bunch of people were doing to fix their dark oil especially in the early day when people really weren't distilling very well", "NxEAgqkpn1k": "if you could buy the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign",

them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually I've been smoking on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made my opponent it's just like alright you won't turn it so I have to do it like this I got to hold it that's gonna be the video guys I hope you all enjoyed make sure to check out all the links in the description make sure to share the social media do all that [ __ ] like the video comment a subscribe do all that [ __ ] I'll see you in the next video we're just gonna be on I'll see you in the next video which is gonna be on Wednesday maybe even sooner [Music]", "SBiNwQibNzQ": "we're outside of

you say it's worth from like zero to 100 like in terms of dollars that's the currency okay if i were to sell it i could sell it for 69. what do you think about the taste crisp clear crisp and clear it's piney you know what like yeah if you got a taste for it you know exactly what you want if you don't smoke tsc very much excuse me i mean taste and flavor-wise yeah that's worth the money that's why it's worth any dollar amount you assigned to right up to i'd say 60 70 bucks i could pick me worth it it would be low it would be well worth it batman flavor is high quality i like that i like that i do i like it what do you know about delta a thc nothing nothing nothing okay let's try it and see how you like it yeah alright yeah cool [Applause] so i know it's a big battery don't be too

good actually this easy to taste easy flavor and yeah it gives you relaxedness it tastes like a legitimate car like a legitimate card yeah like an actual cart the terms of stuff that makes it smell yes yes terps give it the smell and taste okay i know that tastes really good okay tastes good smooth for sure smooth yeah so it hit smooth i mean i didn't didn't tickle my throat at all how much is it smacking you right right now i'd say at least 99 percent nine i feel like chill just very like relaxed okay ready to take on the day ready to take on the day well what would you say on a scale like of one to ten how what do you think about the cart taste nine smoothies that's pretty good nice i don't know pretty i mean they're up there if you were to buy that at let's say that dispensary right there how much you think they charge you for it they charge like 80 bucks for stuff like this yeah so if you go to the dispensary there for a point five card it's like a hundred dollars after tax yeah definitely so they're you're definitely getting taxed so with this stuff because it's hemp there's no like marijuana attacks on it so it's a lot cheaper definitely it's nice i would buy it cool right

a pretty new company I've never heard of but this smell free cannabis company and they were kind enough to give me a voucher to purchase one of these for $2 and they actually let me try some of their stuff to they have live resin cartridges and they also have cured resin cartridges and her cured live resin cartridges mind you man from what I remember when they let me sample both of them I definitely remember that the cured lie breath and tasted so so good I believe this one's going to be there their live resin one another thing that they mentioned to me which was surprising was that that they're live resin cartridges also has distillate in here so I'm not too sure I mean I'm pretty sure they said that about that but I could be wrong so correct me if I'm wrong the free canvas company but we're gonna be using the pocket you guys already know I will have the link and the one description below if you guys are going to check that out this is a pretty expensive batteries so please check your other alternatives or other options before you finally decide on this because what I like does not mean you like it you know I'm saying I like it because it's a very I it's just a smooth sleek design and build it has a nice feel to it but it is pretty pricey so like I said please just uh know what you're getting into know what you're buying I'm checking all other alternatives because this channel is cool about cannabis content and all and stuff but it's also you know save you a few bucks let you know about the products and always trying to save you some money guys always at the end of the day money is how you gave [ __ ] so I'm trying to hit you I'm trying to help you guys get the best [ __ ] that you can possibly get but not to talking this is going to be strawberry [ __ ] guys very very good stuff [Music] yes I do in a car cut and yes this is the new bandana I'm actually washing the other one so like I got sick of the skull the skull is actually better than polka-dots only have this one because it's black and a black bandana is less is non-threatening at least the gang members you know if I wear a red bandana I could get a shot blue shot black maybe not so much you know so I'm going to open this by the percentage of THC is 86 percent guys you can see right here I'm going too fast and I am sorry right off the back they use the same as select you can see very similar to the select plastic kit from iceless leg and right that kind of smell strawberries so this could definitely be mixed distillate [Music] good yeah [Music] before I get into the review or talk about that hit you might be noticing a faint man noises because I got a fan outside the window so it mentally it's better my room has been getting hot lately it's just because there's probably a lot of electronics there's a lot of people in my room constantly so a fan that attaches to the window is pretty good and it's actually going outward so it's sucking all the hot air out and uh yeah getting into the cart it taste like strawberries not too much I can say about the flavor other than if it tastes like strawberries not too overly powerful you know I do it does fade away quickly just like this lid does you know you but this Li exhales you get that full flavor boat it goes away pretty quick I'm not sure if it's just this lip [Music] so free cannabis fun so like I said earlier there live present and then have cured live resin and their live resin is mixed look a little bit of distillate is what I remember them saying and let's be real like come on this is the way and it tastes like strawberry I mean like live resident tastes like strawberry there's got to be some sort of like terpenes or strawberry terpenes in there that they put in there you know that's definitely not from the plant that I feel like you know some people like the discreteness of oh this guy's just smoking strawberry vape or whatever you know but yes it is good but yes guys this is a legit company okay I actually went to come all the flowers and picked it up I will post their information right here also in the description below and I'd like to mention you know guys just be careful with the cartridges that you were smoking I've been smoking cartridges for a while and nothing has ever happened yeah I always buy cartridges from the dispensary never have I I mean I've tried a few but I don't really buy them like I've tried my homies he usually goes to the sessions and I'm not gonna like I've tried you didn't really like it but I've tried you know yes free cannabis company guys I really really am enjoying this cartridge I'm not gonna lie but you guys already know me I like that I like the cartridges that taste like so but like I said they're cured light resin has that taste so if you do see this company try their cured live recipe try both it does matter try them next to each other and you can actually tell the difference because that's what I did at the booth and yes hopefully you guys enjoyed this video this brand is not bad I don't know the pricing of this I actually have not seen this at my local dispensaries or on weed maps and malls are selling it pretty cheap at the Hall of flowers by a walrus it won't reflect what you're going to be seeing at the dispensary so I can tell you the price $20 for a program $15 $15 I believe it was $15 for the regular live resin cartridges this year and then $20 or the cured live resin but like I said these prices won't reflect what you will see at the dispensary but I am liking this definitely like the cured resin better but I'm not gonna clean about this one if you guys like strawberry taste water looting stuff I really really would recommend this we'll take one more and then [Music] [Music] and there's cloud Stephanie cloud but yeah other than that I'll see you guys [Music]", "oBR39LvBf6s": "hi guys welcome back to cosmas today I am going to be reviewing my battery and I am at the park once again safety first I did wipe down my seat and I put my sweater over it because I'm wearing shorts and it's gonna be cold but yeah this is champagne Kush it's a hybrid I've tried to bloom before but this was years back when I first started buying at illegal dispensaries so ever since that I never tried it from a legal dispensary this is my very first time once again and it is a champagne cache like I said very excited it's a half gram alright I'm gonna go ahead and unbox these down alright so it has this little I'm string that I guess you pull don't forget to take off the sticker that's on it because then you will be stripping all right so it has a string don't forget the sig sticker off because and then it will come out like this exactly how it looks well my first phone battery and this I don't really necessarily know how you I also have the sticker around it that you just rip through it but wifey already helped me open it because she knows that I struggle with this is 87 percent THC and if you if you guys hear the wind obviously window is windy and I am outside like I said this is how it looks today was a good day I love that positive guys that's no chord tells you your little instruction basically and it's really easy you just basically this little container just push I'm bad at extractions turn push wait I'm a turn all right I'm going to be taking bar blinkers out of this so I hope we're raising it up with me behind those cameras and in order before 20 this month you first blinker here we go all right a little close-up moment first blinker like I said very smooth great it tastes good some pinkish I don't even know how it tastes like I'm not explaining not too much on the weed side but not too Freddie I know how to I think I need another finger that mean I feel high already it hits very smooth it's like a I don't even know what flavor it is it's but it tastes good in the hot explain not like champagne not too much like cush but just like good Lincoln I don't know if I blink I blinked the second one I wasn't sure but I just my lips really those blinkers are getting to me they're so smooth that was so smooth I feel like ever since the first day that I tried moon they have changed the game but bloom isn't I know bloom isn't all the way to the top but they're a very good friend still I really like I really like them um especially if you're beginner I feel like these are really good for you this is actually one of the few first products that I actually started purchasing before I got into like the bigger brands that I would say like King Inkpen Stacey heavy hitters tree base you know those I started to get into after but it's crazy like he's like an OG to me and back then I didn't even know I think it was different the cartridge was definitely different I don't remember it like this and I didn't have the bloom battery I just had a regular battery that I had purchased not with it it's like a chill and also if you guys already haven't go ahead and coop mr. THC also known as Louie vlogs go ahead and subscribe to both channels both channels and to his girl Jen you know show a couple love you know I feel like whenever somebody's in the relationship I just

shorts alright guys we're up to our last link our fourth blinking you know 4:20 any video ideas because I will be posting every single day for customers and I hope you guys are saying hi to me and

guys are wondering is that thing real or is it fake because select had a lot of fake cards going on back in the day but that's back when that's back before they had live resin guys back in those days they only had distillate but now guys man they faking they faking the live resin now guys so today your boy is about to put them on blast because um i recently got a select from flower co and um my friend he recently got a select off the streets and he came up to me with it and it was pretty much the same box but totally different and you could just tell it was fake and i felt so bad for him so he let me borrow the he let me borrow it i got the cards and i'm going to show you guys the difference between the real and the fake you probably could kind of tell already from the box which one's real and which one's fake but um before we get into this guys hopefully you guys can hear me it's kind of windy today actually but um let's take a freaking bong ring boys all right guys so to start off off the back we're going to do a little close-up you feel me so you won't see my face for a little bit we're going to do a little close-up talking right quick so check it out all right off the back this is the real one and this is the fake one and let me tell you guys why this is real and this is fake off the bat you can tell it's fake by the colors all hybrids are in the orange box and it's a dark orange it's not this light orange you see the lettering the lettering it's in light orange um the name of the strain the thc content and the amount in there is a lighter orange as you can see also let me get a little closer this color scheme thing right here the yellow orange red pink purple the color scheme is lighter than the one on the rail box those are off jump ways that i knew as well as you could tell by the print they're using different fonts as you can see it's more bold up here is more popping on the real one more plain it's more pop it gives it more of a pop like it's coming out at you you'll see the difference okay and then another way you could tell guys is the real one off jump a real one's gonna have a bar code there you go barcode fake no barcode no nothing sealed up nicely it almost looks almost looks real another way you can figure out that this is fake guys is when you push it out to open see at the bottom you could see that it just pushes straight out when you push this button in on the side guys that i have my finger on right here that i'm tapping you can just push it down and then push the cart straight out you can see from the bottom the box comes straight out on a fake cart it's just a flat bottom you just pop that off this is a flat bottom this has no use maybe after you pop it off you can slide it but it has pretty much no use as you can see the difference the actual box pops out from the bottom when you rip this tape off another way i could tell guys is also from the bottom it's a hybrid and it says indica on the bottom it could obviously be an indica hybrid but it just says hybrid on there and if it doesn't end like a hybrid it will say indica hybrid like this one says sativa hybrid it's a dominant sativa because most you know strains you get these days they're hybrids so um usually they're either sativa dominant or indica dominant this one's a sativa dominant as you can see but this one it just says indica on the bottom and just lemon hash diesel so that kind of threw me off that new that that's what made me know that it was fake basically a lot of things did but also you could tell by the font the font is different as you can see it's a light orange color just the real one's dark orange feel me and the font is way different guys this is a fake just look at the font you know give it a couple seconds make sure it's hd now look at this font you could see that it's much different font but it's very similar they did a good job on it but some of the font stuff is different like the warning sign should be yellow there's no yellow and you can see that the font is different boom boom all right guys those are the ways you can see just by looking at the box this is the real one the tropicana and this is the fake one it's too light like you can tell it's fake guys come on now um another way you could tell is um by the actual oil you see the lemon hash diesel it's a little too light you feel me you can see how light it is i'll take it out the package later but your oil is going to want to be dark like this like the tropicana cookies you see that dark consistency you don't want that you don't or no you want that sorry guys you want that dark consistent you don't want the light consistency you see that it's too light you want that dark because live resin is usually darker but yeah let's pop this open but yeah guys you know there's a lot of you know fake carts out there that are easy for you to you know realize that they're fake because they're mario karts they they got fruity pebbles on it they're named after some kind of cereal brand you know different brands that are trying to entice younger people to buy it basically but you know select it's a little harder to um just drop the box it's a little harder to tell because you know they try to make it look as legit as possible and select is actually a real brand mario karts and those luigi's and all those other carts that are out there the skittles and stuff like that those aren't real brands nintendo is not gonna let you put theirs name on a car guys let's be real so we're gonna open up these boxes real quick there we go so it pops right out guys the real ones you can actually use the button and it pops right out there's no cardboard on top it's just like a plastic thing you have to cut off and then boom you got a cart the fake one as you can see you have to actually peel back a box you feel me you have to peel that back and actually open up the box [Music] then you can slide it out after you already open the box [Applause] the real one it's already out you can already push it out the fake one you have to rip open the actual box bam so like i said guys look at the oil the real one is going to be much darker than the fake one as you can see the fake ones are super light it looks like fake wax usually fake wax looks like this looks like this or clear this is real it's a live resin this looks like a distillate this looks like this joy with this live resin baby so make sure you know what you're getting guys the last test honestly the last test to know if your cart is real or fake is to taste it but i know for a fact that this one's fake as hell so i'm not gonna be hitting it let's inspect the cart see the fake one the fake one sorry guys i'm not even done yet the fake one as you can see has no stickers or nothing a real one is going to have a ca sticker on it my guys as you can see let's see what kind of cartridges they use the c cells look a little different too hopefully i can zoom it in good enough the c cells look different [Music] way different but they're both cell i guess but the writing on this c cell looks more bolder as you can see the writing on the real season looks way smaller but either way we know we know that yellow stuff is fake in that dark stuff this is the real this is the real deal guys fake real you can just look at it and see the difference ca dark color no ca light color looks like a disc joy all right so thank you guys for watching the video though guys more content to come i had to get you guys another fake card review and i felt like select one of the biggest like companies out there other than raw gardeners dizzy so i had to do one of them and my friend came through with a fake one so i had to make sure he ain't smoking that fake [ __ ] but um guys i found my battery with my cart on it so let's hit this card quick little blinker hit for you guys and then let's put this real one on just a real live resin i was gonna do a review on this maybe i'll still do a review guys if you guys want to see a review on this cart comment down below but right now i'm just gonna hit it smoke it i'm not gonna talk much about it and i'm gonna end the vlog

you're gonna be doing another cartridge review today for you guys and then a Saturday morning today it's time to wake and bake so I really hope you guys are really having a good day hopefully you guys staying blessed the world's kind of [ __ ] up right now but it'll it'll be over soon guys so everything will be back to normal so I really hope you guys are doing good and yeah guys last week got posted like two videos I usually post like on a Friday or Saturday so you know my bad had kind of been a little busy you know with all this [ __ ] going on but today actually last week I have picked up this moxie these are actually new you know I've never seen them before I had gotten one before it was super super fire you know they taste like an Ursa cartridge like actual actual like resident and I had a like a question you know if you guys ever know like don't you guys think like why is raw Gardens live resin so lighter than other live resins like like this one right here for example this was like a dark amber color compared to this one like I'll show you guys right now like live resin for the raw gardens are really really like you know which there's a lot there's some people I'm a comment section that say like regarding this fake like fake life resin so I don't know I just want to get your guy's opinion on that and that's a couple people already telling me you know but we're going to take a hit others before we get in the cartridge just waking big guys Cheers but I want to appreciate my new subscribers and those who are new here you guys are awesome for watching my videos you know I really appreciate you guys but let's get into this Moxie cartridge these are called MX brand but I had gone in there um on their Instagram page and it says they have to do something with Moxie so I'm guessing it is Moxie cuz it's like the same letterings everything this one's a yellow og this one's of life as full spectrum life resin so THC on this is 80% so it's a pretty good cartridge for some live resin there's some licenses that don't really get that high THC you know but this one's around 80 so it's pretty good cartridge I paid like maybe like 40 bucks for this so it wasn't too bad you know so we're just gonna go ahead and pop it open guys I had had one before it was like the it was like watermelon OG it was really really good you know it had tasted like an actual dab you know it tasted like really weed and it is like no discipline and intake and I like a really really different flavor than like what a raw garden would have like that clean like rock gardens to me that kind of tastes all the same you know they have all that fresh clean taste to it which is I don't know it's pretty good I'm getting wrong but they all kind of do taste the same here you have a cartridge it's a seesaw I really love these seesaw cartridges right here you know they're like the dank dank vapes how the tips are I really really love these tips now this is what I mean you know raw Gardens this one's life resin and this is my resident as well so and this one's a Moxie and this was a raw garden as you guys can see this one's way lighter than this one this one's the darker amber color so a lot of people been saying raw Gardens fake live resin so let me know what you guys think about that and that's just coming from couple people not just one you know so let me know what you guys think about that oh I thought about it as well like it is kind of lighter than what this one is and on this is real dead live resin so guys let me know on that so this one's it's really really thick yellow oh jesus was the indica hybrid I'm guessing so I'm good and dry hedges let me see what it tastes like you know flavors off it so the best way to try to just to [ __ ] hit it so we're not going to take this off I didn't do a cartridge you'd be on this raw garden I was just too lazy and I got a like on a Wednesday or something Wednesday night so I just started puffing the [ __ ] out of it so we're gonna gonna screw this on the cartridge battery hopefully I was smoking well wouldn't you guys plot you guys vape pens whatever you guys got to get [ __ ] high mass waking day just around 7:00 in the morning before I hit this let me get up Oh Red Bull sponsors we may get sugar-free Red Bull but besides that guys oh hopefully got a smoke along with me work on ahead and try this [ __ ] this one's the yellow og moxie I guess MX brand whatever you want to call it so cheers guys oh wow right off the bat if you guys ever had a if you guys ever had a Ursa cartridge these cartridges taste exactly exactly like them they taste exactly like weed you don't get like that raw garden like taste to it you know it tastes actually like dad and that's one of the things that I was wondering like why does this taste more like dab you know and like the raw gardens taste like a little chemically you know I don't get me wrong they're pretty good but I don't know that's kind of weird to me but these cartons are pretty far guys are like 40 bucks for some actual life resin I said these taste like an oyster cartridge the taste on it it's like a strong dad taste you know really really good you definitely get that OG taste like a strong cushy taste at the end but it's mostly like a clean fresh oh gee tation well it tastes really really good like when I tried these cartridges like last week it was a watermelon og cross was something and I was really amazed by the turf shamash it was crazy I little smoked the coke cartridge like in two three days you go back-to-back that's how good it was but this one it tastes kind of the same but it's just had like a more strong cush taste to it now I'm feeling like a little good high right now I know like a really good buzz you know there's my waking bag I'm gonna take a bigger hit to see if you know I [ __ ] get a big cloud for you guys I hope you guys are smoking along with me and I'm also having a vaporizer I'm going to give away I don't know if you guys had seen my review I had done on these belief goes if you guys want to go ahead and check out my video I did on these but I would appreciate it and I'm also gonna do a giveaway because they gave me two of them so I'm not gonna use the other one so I'm gonna give it away I will personally share to you guys his doorstep I'm sending out to UPS wherever you guys are at so you guys let me know and guys she got something loaded already I'm glad and hit it again she'd like to take a blinker man [ __ ] it never tried to blink on these [ __ ] arm pen cards which is only like on Stevie or like a plug-and-play but we're going to try it blink on this [ __ ] I'm already loaded this card you just smacked guys if you guys ever see these MX brands Moxie cartridges like presents they're pretty fired they have a lot of flavors as well you know just as you guys can see they say Moxie on there so they say MX like I don't know it's it's weird but yeah that's just like a MX for like a little short you know we're for maxi but really appreciate you guys watching my videos you guys stay tuned for more I'm gonna be posting maybe smoking a whole cow gram cartridge and one sitting

I bought this just yesterday its indica Skywalker the eureka cart these ones are really high in potency and this is coming in that THC level eighty-seven point fifty-two percent THC mg at 875 points to mg CBD point twenty six and more CBD mg coming in at a whopping two point six feet before this vapor cartridge now we're gonna be unboxing it so it is but put some close-ups on the screen for you guys I love the box here because it actually is a really nice box I don't think you just will end up to the camera really does it justice so exactly a sense of what you hope you guys enjoy this for other people we just had you orgasm you I really do you don't really digging this packaging Buddhist oh my god its packaging you don't really get that you must get them in a vial or something this is how they normally are open so foggy we are going to a he's faking his reviews these things come like this artisan so this is the cartridge here it is a clear oil as you guys can see it clearly obviously explained the title of the video yeah it's real cart we're gonna try to get on this booze penny at really trying it at three point three votes if you guys can see that they're hittin this bad boy alright alright its baby boy hopefully you guys were big along with me and it's can to hit in this car [Music] [Music] first impression all right first impressions of this really good this is a really nice strong pool I like it it's a it's a really nice pool body's pretty thick I like that adds a really pungent and same taste to it this guy Walker by the way but now already mentioned that already but um yeah okay well after those two shitty ghosts um I like said this oil is pretty freakin dank it is pretty freakin fired I have really big dread medicated the Abbas's uriga high potency this thing is really hitting me right now and it's it's more of like um it's like it's like when you're smoking your Jordan or something it's not like an instant high like how you get with these fake cards out here that just have other stuff in it unknown stuff by the way I would just like to mention that just makes the effect of the hike um so much quicker than when it's actually supposed to you know but this one feels like I'm smoking like a blunt and it just comes steady and steady and steady and then it just hits me in the face when I'm just too baked and I'm really baked right now so hopefully you guys did enjoy this video leave a like comment and tell me how you guys are doing on this quarantine and yeah it's been your boy visa", "BOUWQvtjvTs": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to weights the marijuana review show where we help you find folks make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at a cartridge here on wheats a good old-fashioned 510 cartridge i've got my trusty battery here nice and plain and then the product we're actually reviewing which is napalm we are reviewing uh our first cartridge anything from the folks at napalm uh and this happens to be their napalm o g um strain so both the company is napalm and the strain is napalm og that we are taking a look at uh so i picked this up at a dispensary in long beach it is 43 dollars for a gram uh which is um about average maybe a little bit cheaper than average uh at this dispensary that i um pick up from um so uh you know keep that in mind with the review 43 bucks uh for a lot of people i know is very cheap for a one gram cartridge but not so much here in long beach um as i said standard 510 so this is no special pod nothing different or weird your normal twisty battery is going to work here uh so i don't know a lot about napalm i know this dispensaries had them for a while i couldn't really find a whole lot of online presence for them outside of listings didn't see a lot but let's go ahead and get this open um and on the back before we really get started here let's go ahead and take a look at the lab testing results if it'll focus up there um there we go uh looks like it's coming in at about 75 thc or so uh which is about average for a cartridge maybe on the slightly lower end but um which is you know maybe commiserate with the price so uh now we know our laptop results we got about our 75 thc let's figure out how we open this somewhat elaborate looking packaging here there are a lot of flaps on it that's glued pretty tight oh we've got a little um authentic holographic sticker here i'm not really sure what they think that putting a sticker that just says authentic on it is going to try to solve but you know i assume anybody can buy that sticker but maybe some psychological assurance uh let's rip that effing sticker off there we go pull it out voila here we are here is our one gram napalm cartridge ooh that is a very different design uh this is not uh this is totally unique never seen anything quite like this i'm not even sure what material this is maybe aluminum some kind of metal here on the tip the oil actually looks pretty good there gold rich um yeah it looks way better than i thought and i'm curious about this cartridge design it's just got the one big intake hole there better than that pretty standard looking heating element all that stuff so let's go ahead and plug it into our 510 thread here and give our napalm og from napalm a try here we go oh wow okay um that is a very different tasting uh strain than i am used to uh it is very extremely piney piney a little slightly bitter earthy um not bad just um a lot more uh aromatic than i guess i was expecting it's quite tasteful uh there's there's a lot going on there um and even pretty robust like bittery aftertaste i'm not usually a huge fan of bitter uh it's not terrible here it's that very earthy kind of bitter taste not sure i love the cartridge design kind of hard to get your like mouth around it it's very short little mouthpiece here uh you know most cartridges have a much longer sorry for the juvenile humor or uh images uh you know much larger place to put your lips and all that uh this is very small it's it's can make it tough to draw from it is unique wow yeah that is just extremely um terpeney there is just a lot of piney earthy bittery taste to it uh i usually like a lot of flavor this one uh i'm not gonna necessarily say it's bad i don't i actually don't think that it is it's just not the kind of strains that i normally go for um and this one is just heavy on the terpenes wow um the cartridge design again a little weird uh the draws are fine i'm getting draws okay but it's hard to sort of get a good seal but in terms of potency no problem saying this is 75 i've taken quite a few draws here feeling the effects quite strong um in terms of the that being the most important aspect is it really going to get you high uh that seems to definitely be true i think this is pretty good oil it's just um you're gonna if you're gonna go for this napalm og you better like the piney earthy tastes of the strains um because this one has it in spades yeah i'm just uh uh so far i would say i have mixed feelings about my napalm og experience let's get another one in here nice hit smooth um you saw i drew for a while excelled for a while and i'm not hacking a lung up which is a good sign um but again that taste is very strong wow uh so uh right now i'm kind of um up in the air about our napalm og experience uh i would say if you really like the napalm as a strain maybe give this a consideration me i'm gonna uh finish off this gram i'm uh looking forward to it actually it's it's a bit of a different strain for me but a bit of a different experience can lead to some fun new uh experiences let's hope maybe who knows um it is different napalm og um let's give it a little bit of a wait and see i'm gonna finish off this gram and then like all our wheat's reviews i'll come back to you guys in the i don't know five days or so it'll take to get through this and i'll let you know exactly what i think of this whole experience i am a little worried about this cartridge design it seems like it might get clogged really easily with this very shallow hole um and there's not like a lot of plastic or anything sort of protecting stuff going in so uh i could imagine this novel cart design having some issues but we shall see it'll take me a couple days to get through it i'll be right back here to let you guys know exactly what i think when we finish this napalm og in just a few days until then stay high stay healthy see you right back here bye guys [Music] welcome back to wheats guys it has been about four days a little over four days since we started our journey with napalm and their strain napalm og uh just a little bit left there so i could have one or two more hits to share with you guys like this one here and well i gotta tell you my thoughts experiences really haven't changed much in four days um i didn't hate it there's nothing fundamentally wrong with it it's just not my favorite cartridge not what i'm gonna go back to um primarily what i found distasteful was the taste um that sort of acrid vaguely burnty piney earthy taste of the napalm uh it just wore on me i never sort of grew accustomed to it as a matter of fact the more i did it the more i kind of didn't want to do it um kind of even had to make myself get to this point to finish this one off i would have moved on to something else um it's not that the oil is bad it feels like the 75 percent as listed it's just not the highest quality the cart design is also so top-heavy i mean most cards are top-heavy by design but this one with this like heavy aluminum tip it's just so hard to keep it balanced um and also if you keep it in your pocket it's guaranteed it's going to turn upside down on itself and it's got that shallow intake hole which got clogged on me more than once had to clean it out it's just not the best experience it's certainly not the worst experience uh you know it's somewhere in that middle of the road and at 43 dollars it's cheap but it isn't the cheapest um and i have had even cheaper cartridges that i have had that i've enjoyed more so i can't give this one a big thumbs up i'm not even sure i can give this one a tepid recommendation uh i do think that there is better stuff out there for you um i may in the future try to review one of napalm's other strains they're not napalm og itself and see if maybe i have better luck uh but that's only if you guys are really curious otherwise there's plenty out there to review we'll take a look at those and we'll take a look at those on our next review whenever that is sometime in our near future i hope you guys will join us for that one until then stay high stay healthy and we'll see you then docs", "21yp9A9wxr4": "[Music] p2pt what's good y'all p2 peeps here and today we're going to be taking a look at the buddies distillate with cannabis rep terpenes sorry i almost forgot what we were doing but yeah uh the other day i opened this on stream um and i was you know i was really hoping to save the opening of this for a video but you know couldn't help everyone's saying try it out on stream and um honestly zero regrets i've been looking for buddies for so long and i'm just i'm just super super satisfied with the way this this hit this this turned out like like i'll tell you guys right now i've been looking for buddies a buddy's car for like four months now i saw it first on a simplistic youtube channel and i was like whoa this looks crazy like i'm not big on distillates uh some of you guys know that some of you guys don't i kind of quit cartridges for the first time or the first time i started trying cartridges i quit because i didn't really like distillates and i had no idea what live resin or cured resin was at the time and so now that i know what live resin and cute resin is i've gotten more into cartridges and since i've gone back into cartridges got back into this lids so without further ado let's take our hit of this and i'll discuss you know what we normally discuss the flavors and you know what i'm feeling about it so everyone out there at home please pack yourself a bowl pack yourself a dab get your pen ready open your bag of chips whatever it is get your your water i don't know we're all just gonna you know cheers together and yeah so cheers boys for a distillate the flavor and that is impeccable like i'm really impressed with this buddies card stuff like before i tried this right you guys were able to see on the channel i was able to try another canon striped terpenes type cart it was a stizzy pot the i tried the grape sorbet and the super glue silver lines dizzy pods and the one thing i'll say about them in comparison to this buddies is that they don't have like they don't hold a candle they don't hold a candle of this i've only had one this is my very first buddies i'm not even done not even done with it and already i can tell you guys that this is much better than the stizzy derived cannabis terpene or stizzy cannabis derived terpenes line um and this is my honest opinion guys like i was expecting so much more when i um got the cannabis to drive terpenes pods from stizzy i was expecting so much more i spent like 70 bucks per gram 70 75 bucks per gram for them and um it just was it just didn't didn't hit as hard as i thought it would you know i wasn't expecting it to knock me out like a [ __ ] truck or anything like that right but i was expecting the flavor to be very very very very nice like there were a lot of people who were telling me like it's comparable to live resin carts which i thought was a stretch i think that's a stretch in in any in most regards like even even this distillate with cannabis derivatives this doesn't this doesn't really hold a candle to the flavor that you can get from eyebrows and cartridges right but this is still very very good yeah i get a lot of sweetness tones or sweet tones from this you know tiny little bit of tartness and there a little bit of sour um and pininess yeah so another good thing about buddies cards is that on the back of their packaging they've got the terpene profile right there for you so you know maybe not ex exactly you kind of know exactly what flavors you'll get with just looking at the back of this so the back of this right we've got ter profile 2.61 limonene 1.25 percent limonene is a terpene that is responsible for that lemony citrusy flavor um a mirror scene i think if i'm if i'm remembering this correctly i will correct myself later but mirror scene is the sweet stuff that's the generalized okay just i'm generalizing and pining the piney stuff so all that pine soul whatever piney taste that i've been talking about that's that's actual stuff yeah so that's that's what the most i can say about this you know buddies card so far i like it it's got great flavor it's better so far in terms of flavor and effect than the cannabis drive terpene pods from sizzy so yeah let's take another hit of this and um see if i can find anything different in terms of its flavor for you guys so yeah cheers everybody that pininess really sticks out in the uh the initial taste i didn't really comment too much about that but yeah i think it starts again nice piney lemony citrusy kind of flavor and then it finishes off with some very nice sweet tartness which is kind of like a candy really really nice so yeah i highly recommend you guys try a buddy's distilled cannabis oil with cannabis derived or distilled cannabis oil with cannabis derived terpenes cartridge this this stuff is really good sorry i'm kind of big like i can't even speak properly it's it's already affecting me yeah i've been it's i'm just really happy with being able to find something and not being disappointed with it um i was a little disappointed with the silver lines dizzy pods but i'm gonna give them another chance for sure because you know i just might not lie to i might not have liked the strain but yeah legend og watermelon skittles card this one's definitely a must try i mean i've had watermelon skittles a lot of times but in its live resin caviar form so having it in this uh this little can this little oil form is pretty nice yeah that should about wrap it up for this really quick cart review you know nothing too in-depth just just letting you guys know how i feel about it we'll definitely get more in depth when we get to a cart comps with this uh be on the lookout for that we'll be doing a cart comps between this buddy's cart and uh the very next cart you guys see in our individual cart reviews that that's going to be the one that will stack up so they're going to be some pretty hard hitters yeah thanks everyone for watching and we'll take one more hit for the road for you guys cheers oh yeah

intuition creativity compassion vitality relationships and grounding this is like chakra status guys this is chakra the promoting chakra status so let's open the vape pen it slides out i'm so excited to try this uh it's stuck here we go oh it's just a charger with a sleek pen all right see it looks like this all right and then this is the charger that goes with it a usb charger if you had any of this before you just screw that in i guess do i have to charge it now is there any instructions oh here we go has a little bit of instructions they gave me silver i don't know if i chose silver specifically but on off settings push button five times change heat settings push button three times preheating set settings push button two times charging up to four hours or when light turns green okay so i don't know if it's charged yet doesn't say and this is my oil it looks like this they had this one that was called fruit fruity loops i was gonna try but i didn't know if this fit inside the thing i wanted to use but look it looks like this and the top is rounded and the oil is in there i don't know if you've seen that but um the oil's in there in the reservoir it's pretty cool all right let's stop this cheddar chatter and try it hopefully it's charged i really hope so i'm gonna go ahead and screw this in 0.5 ml that's how much okay okay i don't know how tight i'm supposed to why is it crooked is it crooked this is weird all right okay so what is it how do you do this charging press button two times i hope it's on oh on off one two three four five oh look it was red now one two it's preheating now it's preheating pictures of products are not to scale cartridge not included how come this tip is different from the other tips the other tips look like they're like more not not as rounded is it done now what do you do i don't know how to do this you have to hold the pen you have to hold the button i mean so bubble gum tastes like a weird light version of medicine let me try again it's like i don't know what it's supposed to do at the moment this is just interesting it's like i feel like it's something supposed to happen like right away it's light i taste a little tint of bubble gum but it's very subtle very subtle i don't see no nothing as of now but it's pretty cool i don't know let's try one more that's cool though maybe i'll feel an effect later i feel like i feel like i don't know if it's the placebo effect but i feel like a calmness settling or i could just be bugging out i don't know but this is cool i guess i'll do an update on another video to see my thoughts on it like some vlog type stuff so that's it that's all i have for you today i'm gonna do some more videos so check those out i'll see you next time bye you", "v8mZGu2YaQg": "quick stop get

giveaway is coming up again we're almost at 3100 we went up 100 people in three days well we're almost 200 but you guys rock man let's keep it rolling", "uWELXO1__xI": "what's good guys um good to see you again sorry to take a little break i was going pretty hard need a week to just chill but anyways i got a special review today we're going to be going over a 10 cartridge versus a 50 cartridge i know a lot of people they just want to they just want to get high they just want to get high really quick discreetly um and for cheap which is understandable that's why these 10 cards used to be really popular back in the day i was even hooked on these 10 cards for a while just because it's it's it's cheap it's cheap cheap to get high but that has changed now i don't cheaply intoxicate myself i smoke the very [ __ ] best best that i can find so first off let's give it a look it has this um kind of like iron type titanium look to it some ridges um looks cool distal it's flat not moving let's get a little puffer nothing to really complain about i mean ooh this is something to complain about cannabis extracted with butane so i don't know how many uh ppms is in here i don't know how many parts per million uh is left over of butane in this in this cartridge but that would turn me away and that's probably one of the reasons i don't buy these i didn't actually know it was extracted with butane but now i do but yeah now we got uh some dab logic um that tasted okay there wasn't really too many complaints about it it's not like i full on tasted butane dab logic nice little uh laser laser print around this um it looks like it's natives or aztecs or something has dab logic written across the bottom take this off and snap this on now right off the bat i can it can automatically taste a more it's a more natural taste uh you're not gonna be really be able to tell maybe if you're like you know not used to knowing what quality tastes like if i were just a noob coming in here these would both taste very very similar it's not like you can taste heavy butane in that or anything it's just me knowing that this was processed with butane what turns me away but that's you know it's ten dollars worth of butane now what makes these so different why is this ten dollars why is this fifty dollars a big part of this is gonna be extraction these guys oil they're in the market for wholesale they make most of their money off distributing large quantities to dispensaries they're targeting the market that you know is wanting to and toxic intoxicate themselves for a lot cheaper now these guys these guys are marketing more towards the connoisseurs uh this extraction this was not extracted with butane uh there's a process i'm not too sure how it goes down or how they get it into cartridges but i know there's lots of ways to uh extract and get solventless you can do a fresh chop wash that in a bucket of ice water extract those tricoms in a ice hash then press that and then here comes your rosin i don't know how they liquefy it or what consistency and uh temperatures they do to get it to this consistency in this cartridge but they do and it works so what you're mainly paying for right here and why this is so so much more expensive is that is that when people are washing this and uh when they're extracting uh from this method you yield also a lot less from just blasting a can of butane through a whole bunch of weed this process you actually your yield is a lot smaller um but you have a higher quality so that's where the 50 dollar price mark come from but you know a lot of people really don't care but a lot of people do care and this is this is the main differences sorry you can't see the table the camera's up a little too high uh but yeah anyways uh i hope you like this video i hope i covered everything um and there's like a lot more there's like a lot more there's a lot more labeled on this solvent-less solvent-less vape and for those of you that don't know solventless i had a friend ask me i've explained rosin to them but sometimes people don't remember solventless is processed without solvents like butane co2 what else do they use um that's all i can think of out of my head those are the main ways that people use to extract those are solvents this is solvent less solvent less is the way to go your lungs are going to be a lot happier your high is going to be a lot better and you might say well [ __ ] i don't want to spend 50 on a cart i'm going to stick to 10 that's ok but also you have to keep in mind this is going to pack a harder punch because it's way more purity in this than that other cartridge i didn't mean to be a dick i shouldn't do that i'll [ __ ] it uh but anyways i don't even know where it went it wasn't too far anyways it doesn't matter but yeah those are the main differences a 50 card versus a 10 card i know a lot of people see it in dispensaries and they're like why the [ __ ] is that cart fifty dollars well now you know uh glad i got to do this video a lot about to see you guys uh subscribe uh i'm gonna be doing some merch drop soon so you know stay tuned turn on those notifications uh and i'll see you guys soon uh probably my next video i'm gonna be comparing some of the weed i grew and some of the weed my friend grew and we're gonna put it up against some dispensary weed and show you why potentially home growing could be better than commercial growing that's not always the case but for 99 of industry it is um peace out guys take care let me know in the comments what other videos you want i love uh i love getting suggested new ideas because sometimes i don't know what are good ideas and i just go off top but thanks guys for watching peace out", "akyKHTB0qH4": "[Music] let's go youtube ministry boy man fellow signing him back with another video today I'm at Windy City cannabis it is a dispenser that sent home word you got to pick up a couple parts get wedding cake and I'm also about to grab our train Hayes or something like that but I'm gonna go grab two carts and then on my door review like usual although swaggy this way Corin C&I are some people like super cautious steel stick another wine but it's not as bad as when we go ahead last night he is why it shouldn't be much of a late a wait they got it like a little thing going on right now when you just you order online and then you get a time where you come pick it up at so I'm here at my time right now to pick it up I got the cards this is Ronald like I said wedding cake I'll just do some b-roll but another one ghost train hey that's what I got ghost train Hades I know something but I think welcome got like 81 percent to eighty seven percent I got both of them it was overall pleasant experience with the city Canada so give it like two thumbs up pretty simple I know this really fight doesn't matter to other people in other states it should like that because they're dispensaries aren't like that they don't operate like it's a banking [ __ ] but out here in [ __ ] Illinois act like the Spencer is our bank and you know there's like a security door behind a security door behind another security door what is good YouTube and we're back like I said I just got back from Windy City cannabis right now I got so this is what I miss using to smoke this is not a really cheap doesn't cost much at all pay my five bucks for it like I said ended up getting two carts I got like I said got wedding cake and the guy goes try and I used about 500 milligram how finally just short of what I usually do but this joint called and they don't costing me 65 on top of that I ended up paying my 75 attacks in other words so and I know what in other words robbery bro this is it right here waiting cake do some b-roll [Music] [Music] again this is Verano now use this sticks hit this [ __ ] that's that join us is it right here or on tone beep anyway this little thing screwed a [ __ ] in here reason why I got this one in particular could this convene I could just stick this in my pocket I'll take it with me looks to go it's smaller but yeah hey slow bro it's a smooth pen I just probably last me a month I use mine tickling too however they have much for you as far as like a player for flavor program which I taste this [ __ ] one more time I can't really taste much out of this I'm not really getting like a cake taste oh no matter like look up and let you guys know like whether that actually works I don't really taste nothing cake wise as far as like wedding cake but uh I do feel something is usually pretty instinct with cars it's just like this literally just like smoking flour which has been my experience still early just like smoking flour so yeah I just be starting to feel some already that first day I took what was pretty was pretty damn massive but yeah and that man I'm gonna let you guys know I like I said hey buddy taste it tastes just a bit sweet but I outside of that any taste nothing I'm for real but eighty percent THC it is a hybrid I saw an indica and sativa and yeah other than that miniature boy man I appreciate you guys supporting the content two channels still steadily growing steadily growing and I'm just nothing but appreciated appreciate it to you guys and I've been in my experience that Windy City cannabis I give it two thumbs up as far as like I had like a bad experience I went to security guard but outside of everybody was cool most people was cool just like one little bit it didn't really blow it I still recommend though they're cheaper than the ones are that's gonna say that cuz they have yeah overall great experience I give this to thumbs up with them filling it for sure outside that man should I pick although I'm out under that this pan yo and I feel like my face is melting off right now", "C2ko0fFeXaY": "what is good y'all good morning it is zoody patoot you already know back for another cannabis review on the baked boys you already know what it is if you don't definitely look into these guys definitely look these up these are the best thing on the cannabis market right now for vapes carts whatever you're looking into just for portable dabs this is freaking it uh freaking rechargeable tastes amazing better than any cart that i've i've come across personally uh it's just like taking a dab it even you know tastes like freaking mango this is what the whole box looks like and then you pop them out of the box and then another another baked bar packaging just so if you guys are getting these make sure like they are double packed and if they're not they're probably not real but these are a brand new brand new uh company uh straight from cali and uh they are just getting started so if you want to go ahead and look them up on instagram they're on instagram i don't think they have built their website yet but you know i've been talking back and forth with uh the person on there so uh definitely a good brand definitely quality quality product right here and that's what people are looking for especially in the cart game right now some people are scared of additives being being put in there it already says right here you know max strength lab tested and solvent-free to stood so uh it's got all the little markings don't throw it away you know recycle it properly it's a disposable so you know don't don't just be tossing it in the wrong or california they got big recycling laws and all that stuff so that's up to your discretion um 21 and older what is this right here probably not for pregnant women i mean just just basic stuff that goes on on cannabis products out in california but uh just guys go try one go try one because these are probably my new favorite thing in the world right now like you know i love my dabs but just having a portable portable little it's just like a freaking it's about the same size of a jewel or a uh a puff bar you know it's the same thing as a puff bar but it's just it's distillate so and they hit so freaking hard like you're just sitting here pulling it and then like when you exhale you don't even realize like you're blowing out a cloud because you barely feel it inhaling and to me that's that's how i tell if it's good distillate or not you uh it's not rough on the inhale but it's rough on the exhale and that's just a rule of thumb for all carts if you're experimenting with carts right now but you know thanks for watching y'all go get you one the baked bars bake the bar official on instagram go get into the hype you already know zooteep appreciate", "n2C9VLf6QjM": "what up everybody get back here with another video gonna do a little bit of unboxing these are the sesh carts I crashed my eye or craft what is it yeah craft concentrates got a few different ones here today got some banana Kush some green crack one of my personal favorites lifesaver what was the other one banana I was super Lemon Haze another green crack got a few those another Saturdays I've got a few of those anyway squeeze these rotate it open that's pretty cool not very many cards for that fancy this guy it's cool but it's also like a lot of waste this is heavy duty plastic and there's cardboard on this paper and there's tips on both ends like it's a really nice package but it's also just a lot of waste anyway anyway here we go come on baby there we go alright let's get this [ __ ] open when I hit it oh yeah and I forgot these are the half gram cards they're not they don't come if they do come on full green cards they didn't have them so we got these to try you know proper open this this I've never seen I mean I guess a few of me I think can they come with these but it's nice so they can just cover back up no lint get in there nothing clearly states THC like a lot of new ones do which kind of sucks you can't drive with them and stuff with anywhere I mean you still can't obviously let's get people very good pretty good flavor pretty good got a good flavor ice a good pretty good punch man on my period my pen does a pretty good job anyway I would suggest these I got um hell of a deal it was [ __ ] there were $10 each so I was actually 2 for 20 and then I was out the door was to for 26 a gram cart for 26 bucks which is pretty good nowadays since grams are going up and buds gonna her flowers going down cuz carts are just so [ __ ] convenient everybody's hitting them everywhere anyway Bubba want some food wait and wait [Music] there's a mob of oh they will eat out of your hands and [ __ ] such a fatty I just put 20 feeder fish in here not even a week ago and you already ate them all there are decent size goldfish not little tiny Guppies anything anyway booze", "_RFm6eyY4hQ": "under responses we want to know what what do you use cannabis for and the predominant one end to our insomnia and anxiety which is pain what three okay but number one and two or insomnia and anxiety which is crazy because if you actually go to the states where they put the diseases or that these symptoms are the problems that people have and what they're going to allow physicians to prescribe cannabis for and anxiety insomnia aren't even on the list are you serious know you can use it for glaucoma you can use it for all of the you know for some of these classic that most of them don't even have it for depression or for opioid withdrawal or any of these things or opioid replacement so the ones that what I'm seeing my patients using it for are not on the list of these very very stringent states people are so excited that in in Rhode Island that you can get cannabis and they were very very excited they voted for this there's seven to see seven or ten diseases that you can be prescribed cannabis for I don't know who's got them none of which are the top three reasons people actually use it I don't know I don't know who has these diseases I mean I I'm not seeing this I may have seen maybe one patient with Lou Gehrig's disease the a my trophy clatter otosclerosis maybe one that's all there's not a very common disease well it's not very common disease people don't last for a long it's a very it's just there's no there's no there's no fixing it I mean really at this point it's we're not even sure how it's helping but in a lot of cities in a lot of states rather this is an accepted disease here's Kansas work well it's like there's no basis in reality the the politicians who have decided again and again and again to set up the rules as to who can use cannabis and who can or not listening to the people they're not listening to why people are using this we don't refer to doctors to get your may recommend we have politicians doctors I mean we live in a society where you know Nixon comes out but says listen underneath this judge do you think this should be a Schedule one drug because I absolutely not screw it in there make it anyway right ask I don't get it I don't understand how this is the policy because the policy doesn't make any sense to me craziness I know okay well let's move on we're gonna bring our guests on we have today Eddie phungster and his wife G they've been breeding and growing cannabis now since 1999 doc these guys run the original prop 215 they've got over 20 years of research they're Trailblazers they are working with it from Portland hey you guys are Portland no no no that's the basketball team right there but these guys like basketball I know but I like they're vegan strip clubs do you they're fun we'll come back to that listen to me let me get this out because this is support these guys are spent turn this around because you're a vegan are you okay did you go with him to the strip club food I was driving everywhere Club amen let's go in there Petey Tripler I am digging this I thought this was going to be really rich in and regiment yeah that's what he said I wanted well I'm seeing you know it's gonna be tough for me okay kindred spirits man random why I love it at least let the audience know a little bit about these guys they've got 20 years of research in the cannabinoids healing and breeding of different cannabis strains Eddie here is the founder of the Native healing oils and the NHL yep yes they've been working with AIDS patients cancer patients serious medical diseases and they've been using cannabis to treat that the other big problem is smoking and edibles are deemed insufficient for proper dosing and some of these sealing things so well they've those come up with sublingual tinctures suppositories which taupe we know is a big fan ups not here well if you were it's not here man we know he's a man Dave's not here man they always lie low dose counter cups and oils so Dave won't you tell us a little already why don't you tell us about Dave and Dave those are suppositories worked pretty quick huh he's already feeling it and we've had guests come to the studio who are cooks it'll bring food don't break for it we've had we've a guest come on who eat dirt this is the first time we've had a guest bring his pasta Tori is there a I have a vaginal suppository right here that's why I give to you thank you got some rest if you like that one too she said safe that's the air yeah leave an insidious option to the vaginal sorry the rectal suppositories entered four jealous we are in the CBD kits so we offered a true medicinal product and a cannabis competition you know which hasn't I've been working with a couple of cannabis cups the high times and you know with emerald cup and stuff I have never seen this product it entered not that I was trying to be entered we've never seen this one entered no not only enter but also man enters yeah exactly nobody's ever slipped on in the back door it's not here man okay all-night garage back to her buddies now listen I know he asked you a question that you didn't answer because it's okay because I'm not arresting that I am interested in what your you're doing your part of the chalice Cup okay right one is one of the premier events is jumping into that we is that he started you started so I mean this the child Cup is a premier event yes and I've only known about it for three or four years how many years has been going on good to you've known it for three or four years because this is our fourth year yes I'm very glad a first one I mean I I hadn't heard of before I always thought it's because I just wasn't aware go Street team doing a good job alright it was it's been three or four years since I started doing this and people are all excited about going to the chalice Cup and I'm gonna fight it was always done around seven ten because that's oil upside-down correct is that the whole that was the the why why we started a Doug my partner my good friend Doug he's the one that started the whole thing about six years ago he started was called a seven ten cup and he ran that in Denver so he did that for two years and then we shifted gears and ran things here in Southern California we did it at the orange show and that was for now she's four years ago today literally we did the first one and that was a very four months we had to put that together we threw it together we just knew that we just felt like the fest all the shows were missing a little something you know the experience part of it people are there to get weed and to get high and to pick up products and edibles and stuff put there's kind of lacking a lot of personal experience with the shows like okay yeah I had fun I got high I forgot what happened but we wanted to put an experience on it so it sounds like week every day for dope oh yeah exactly so I wish you were here now it means Dave's not here man yeah okay so so is the focus of chalice the oils or the alternative means of the experience of having cannabis enter your body through other means because most of the early cups were about smoking flower and then they've evolved over times to have other products so you saying this is the first time the suppository is gonna be entered into chalice is this about the airflow or - I mean is it a big flower vent - yes no no definitely as this is there's just CBD category that's what I'm entered that into so that was just for you know because I believe my products more medicinal but there's flowers there's there was over 77 competition 77 entries that cleared you know testing results so we had se labs test for residual solvents molds mildew pesticides PG ours you know plant growth regulators all these crazy things that we believe caused a problem for you know really good medicine or good quality cannabis the Monsanto ization exactly all the blame you so we kind of like skyrocket because last year we we disqualified anybody that that disqualified and we didn't enter them into the kits and so there's other competitions you go to and you get they're more proud about giving you 300 samples to try in two weeks than they are about here's a hundred or seven although they older horses we've talked about this the 300 samples there's a lot 300 samples yeah in two weeks how does that how does that happen how can you accurately judge how could you test more than seven well this is the way I mean mine is one not spill over to the next one well I'm gonna tell you right now is that honestly like I'm a judge right now I'm a private judge for chalice right you know got a lot of inside love on that one but yes so we have over 56 dab entries to try right now point three of a dab so me and her sharing a kit and we're smoking it so the deal is it's for us as we go through it we smell the ones that we like first it was the smell test the look test there's a couple of tests that break it down I'm not sure example do you not I'm not I'm not into I know they're all clean so I have my friends come over and they can try others ones that I'm not into but you give the friends you want you don't want do not really want do you want your friends knowing the unity of your friends the ones you don't want oh yeah the getting my friends know the guinea pigs my friends like what's ones ain't you smoking because they know the good ones are gone all right there you that make some sense the good ones are really gone and we're already really judged stopping you that what's what's what's it's the my whole deal is the look at one of the deal you're doing look so if I'm looking at it and it's like this looks like something I made two three years ago maybe that gets on the back burner I want to see somebody that's more in the innovative cut right now like who's who's pushing the envelope so I open all these things some of them are envelopes some more jars I'm going through them I'm gonna find out who's who's pushing it right now who's doing this I've been helping people make hash around the world you know for years yeah so it's more of like it's like a wine contest like a you know a wine taster there's dudes I make a couple million dollars just to go in and test wines and they just take a sip don't even swallow it they're just wishing around their mouth like I don't get that either you read the final five best wines in the world you take a sip you're swishing around you're spitting in through spittoon yeah it crazy I don't think so that's not you think for everyone else they would change that right at least at the end let's see here's my problem as as someone who does not use gammas mm-hmm this the math that you guys are using and testing in a short period of time to me is overwhelming at and not for the point that I can understand how if you're just a small amount you know you'll get through it in an hour to just try the next one I don't understand how you don't you don't get any like bleeding into then what you do you do but you're also not trying to go for the effects cuz that's one of the main things that you're not trust me is if some of these ones you smoke and they cut right through it you're taking a hit and you're like whoa that just woke me up or that put me down or that's having an impact pretty fast yeah some of them are pretty pretty the on say it's pretty quick so I would so that they're not all and they give you such a small amount that even when my friends come over and take them they're mostly doing the taste test so it's realistically the taste is if it tastes amazing you're gonna me I'm a little bit of a different type of judge I consume my oils so I don't usually smoke a lot so I want something that's gonna be very tasty because I want to taste it I'm not trying to get the effects to relief I'm not trying to get rid of my back spasms or mother problems I'm not trying to smoke for that so I mostly like that part's covered in me so it needs to be a delicate essence it needs to be something that's pretty much dabbing for us is like a connoisseur because we have other products that take our pain away and and we can help ourselves so if if I was if I were him in my simple way of thinking about things if I were making a milkshake and I make it I make a chocolate milkshake and I drink the chocolate milkshake and I then I start making a vanilla milkshake and they put the finale into olson there's a little bit of chocolate still in it I mean I just I can't see how you can just completely separate one experience from the next I mean I would tend to think that if I were the product that wanted to be tested I'd wanna be the first one as opposed to like the 16th one because it's this is the pure product or maybe you want to be the 16th one because then they've got all that already but then you're not getting the run right now like the real what you might have judged it to that yeah I know but that's not what you want I mean you if you don't want to promote this as this is the product but this is what we do though right so in the kit we offer eight-week it's a kit that comes with all the accessories so you get a glass pipe from hitmen glass and which is easily $1,000 rigged and you know he's showing up right now last year's kit and it's amazed that was one of the kids from last year and you know you get a pipe you get a vape it looks visually yeah it's beautiful it's a stimulated beautiful colors makes you want to smoke stuff this year speaker yeah yeah yes it was we had time to exercise you get all the tools so now we have you have a good pipe we give you q-tips for you to clean up your rig in your nails so you keep it clean and then you can always get a good clean hit off of it we also offer vape pens so people that can try some stuff in vape pens right this year we were given a 1 by Miss by dr. Deborah that was like a new electronic type of vaporizer so we gave a couple of different apparatuses for you to consume the product with so it gave you if you're a flower judge you got either a bong or pipe and you had a pipe so you had not and you're able to use a couple of different tools so you can kinda the bleed over isn't so much of constantly on it because we gave you a couple of tools to kind of use the tools separate definitely so we give you that option which no there's zero comedy over now this is a different time because theoretically if you added the same pipe might bleed over there oh I see but I'm talking about in your body right in in your body you're gonna it's the only have a week to judge these things I mean realistically I do believe people do get bleed over I get bleed over you know I'm tasting stuff that you know like oh wow let me smoke that again cuz I was great then you taste it later like wow that wasn't as great as when I smoked that ass tonight you know but that's what you have a week and so that's why the guinea pigs because when they show up my friend takes a hit and he's like oh my gosh that's great then I'll take another I'll taste it they take another look at it the guinea pigs the counter that's a good idea then we're in and then of course it looks like everybody's winning here I didn't see any losers and no way Howdy's so how do you pick the judges we okay so the last three because I mean the reason I'm bringing something because I was right before the show I was telling you that we got a bunch of people who have been calling for recommendation letters the past couple days get ready for challenge two can't wait for channels okay one judge called me I says I need my rec I'm judging this way I can't get my kit until I get my rec letter how's that how did they pick this guy how did he become the judge we have starting we have our libras a lottery no no you get to go on there and pay for the kid so we have a public judging so public judges you can go on there and the kids start out to believe like four to six hundred dollars at the end of the show it's like nine to twelve hundred dollars for a kid so you get the accessory kit and then you pick which category you want to judge if you want to tell our hold us so yes you're saying that chalice is next net next July this is coming up next July yes sometime early June late May I want to buy a kit you need to get on it in February when we send out the early bird special okay February 13th I get on that and all of a sudden I'm not a judge but I can get the kit that will be judged yes so you get the public pledge all right so when I think we now have the experiment for next yes David topo was here you know he's guy I would put him such I would give him four months to test everything in there but that's the thing so you check it out so you get that you get the kit either you buy it early bird you don't you get the regular kit because we only do your later special for like a weekly it's really quick we offer the kids really fast get in fast pick which kids you want flour solvent non-solvent CBD and then every one of those kids you get edibles you get topicals you get all those just thrown in so you get something you get the accessory kit so what you're buying is the accessory kit this sounds like the deal of the century this is what it is and we do 1,000 you know for a thousand dollars you're able to get be able to get you know there's 77 samples right now I don't know what the what the flower judges were given but I know that me right now as a private solvent judge I got point three grams of 56 samples how do you not jump on this he's talking about I know what is the easy stuff yeah I mean this is amazing yeah you get all this stuff as well as everything that somebody's gonna judge in the rig and the whole thing every three day you get a three day VIP pass that gets you like you know access to all the good stuff at the show you limit the number of these things you yes though they sell out for details yeah do we definitely yeah this I mean this year I believe that was around 400 so I mean I'm not there as much as I was last year so I don't know exact numbers but I seen around 300 400 boxes roughly and so we we have the public judges we offer so many of each category that they can purchase and then we we offer private judges so for private judges they get a little bit more and those are people that are you know authors and people that are doing heavy things in the community and the doing really good stuff and in the world we bring you know Mila she's she's Miss Mina Jensen Oh major she's a major Hesh as she's helped a lot of hash innovation in Brighton and Amsterdam uh-huh for many many years or decades so we were able to bring her over here and you know give her an award for lifetime achievement award and and then we have the glassblowing so the whole thing one of those awards yeah and a challenge we're gonna stir when top comes back we're gonna have to listen to right I know the dope was here hit by it he would jump alibi form yeah and then we'll tape him will videotape him trying the entire box over four-month period of time starting with the suppositories but you get to get the box yeah you get the box a week before the show yeah so we have to turn in our entries to be part of the competition we have to submit our entries like a from May 5th to the 26th so my suppositories and all my other products had to be entered by then but the point of my spots board yeah cuz again they got to be tested and cleared before we put them into the judges kits so samples of the judges in exactly so we got to make sure that it's clean for that you know you know you know we don't want to cause there the sample you know so you need to keep it so this conversation has gotten very right Eddie let's let's move on very sad very sad illogical Ron let me ask you very seriously then Eddie since this is this started off as medicine for AIDS patients and cancer ages why would somebody use a vaginal suppository or an anal suppository I'll talk about the anal one and she'll talk about the vaginal okay please deliver that makes some sense it does that makes him sense to me let's start there so that we offered option to the the option to suppositories for the rectum was offered because my good friend his name is fumo he was a big activist in Washington the Pacific Northwest and he was he had he got diagnosed with liver cancer and tremendously went down pretty bad and so he couldn't consume the edibles he couldn't smoke a lot of stuff his liver wasn't couldn't handle it he we were gonna make him sick by giving him some of these brownies and stuff and so uh I was making him at the time was our so you know I'd call it NHO now cuz you know reasons I'm not Rick Simpson so we made this product and he showed me how he had to break it down more and turn it into a suppository he didn't he explained these processes to me because he explained that he couldn't consume this orally that made uh to me it was kind of shaking kind of groundbreaking because like we kind of used tinctures to help people in hospice and hospitals ICU critical care units my friends that have feeding tubes we've been using glycerin and vegetable glycerin and and feeding tubes and sublingual tinctures to help them for years but I never really even thought about you know everybody has the joke you know but bullets and Boo thing and also their stuff but he was very serious he wanted to live he has children a degree he wanted to survive and he thought he can beat the cancer liver cancer was kind of we we thought we had to control over it and so he was showing me how the suppositories would need to be made and he was explaining how the process how it lasted for him how much it made sense in his daily routine he can he liked to smoke because he liked to smoke it like passing a joint was like hitting a bong but realistically his relief had to come from something deeper and so he used to take the RSO before he got really sick or he couldn't consume where his liver was just done and so his renal started to fail and so the he would take a suppository and get eight twelve hours of relief and we're able to control the dosages with him and it made so much sense to us on how we can deliver this to people and that was you know two years ago and since then we just kind of felt like we should keep making this Prop we're making it for our personal friends that will reach out to us and then we realize like maybe this is something we should offer we know people are gonna replicate it please replicate it like respectively you know not not cheaply not this is something that's gonna go into a human that is almost their last option that's why we call them option two because we thought it'd give them some respect walk into a clique a collective instead of saying yeah so it's like it's like patients that have like organ failure or can't take things orally that cancer of the colon yes prostate cancer welcome right you use syu suppositories listen the bottom line is and I know you're gonna say this but you might as well tell us why would you use the vaginal suppositories well for women that have cancers tumors five rows for menstrual periods you know just to take the pain away even for menopause I for myself I had to have a hysterectomy real early and I was pretty much bleeding to death and once they did that then I started thinking well if I made suppositories for for that why can I make a spas Ettore for women they you know they they need another option they needed help and there's a lot of I knew a lot of personal women that were really sick and we're starting the first transitions of what I started going through and I made this and actually I had a friend of mine that try it and she's having problems with the same thing they want to go in there and they want to do surgery and they want to take things out and she wanted to try it start trying it and she feels great she doesn't have no more pain she's feeling less bloating it helps her with her moods she does not so irritable not she feels wonderful and it made a lot of sense to me because the woman is you know the glue of the home you know they're the ones that hold the household together I couldn't be out there growing we'd make you know my wife's name is Elmer she's awesome yes we figured your direct saturation of cannabinoids and people edibles the smoke vape ends take bong rips and oak dabs and that's not doing anything for the vaginal area or the rectal area and that there's a lot of support that's needed there hip surgery lumbar spine surgery you've autumn eyes the most efficient way to get cannabis into the bloodstream quickly is through the lungs the second most is through mucosal membranes the the anus the rectum the the lips the under the tongue so would it be the same with roots why would you have to do was if you could if you could take it orally you should because well because there is gonna be some local penetration you're still gonna get local penetrate okay I just had a friend recently has ALS and he couldn't swallow and his neck was down al expressed and blessed he just passed away last week and he we were you helping in with a feeding tube and he couldn't swallow in heat so one of his big problems was that his his parents and all them said no tinctures nothing in his mouth we don't want him to choke he can't swallow he can't yell for help he's just we don't want him to choke to death and so when I pulled up the suppository he was he could still type and he can still see he was like hell no but his hospice was like this is probably gonna be the most safest way we can deliver this to him hell yeah and I was given I was already feeding him into a feeding tube but you know the one thing that kills me about all this is that he said one thing is that I have hope I'm gonna get up I'm gonna get back to my life and so in that these people don't feel like they need that option he was right he was barely gonna be 30 years old yeah listen you know so these kinds of they're real life situations and we wanted to give people dignity you know and come with respect look anyway you can get the candidates into the system so it works I'm for it you know the people rub it on their skin and why is this gonna be it's gonna be okay it's gonna take forever you have to work has got to seep through the scans got to be absorbed in the bloodstream that we circulated but after the lungs the mucosal membranes whether it's the anus or the mouth is though there's the most reliable ways of getting it do they use this for other medications too right of course see like anybody who's had colon surgery if you have noise you have to call they give you suppositories anti-nausea Spa stores don't ever say that again never say cannabis as medicine oh you don't think so not on this show what are you in the deal we're here we're just here for giggles run none of this makes any sense it's total recreational people be using this on the corners in the restrooms and schools got to be careful with the story on this is this is this yes so the way I believe it's an it's a it's a human thing it's not a anytime thing it's all thing so I make the NHO which is the full cannabis extract we do it with ethanol so we take a full cannabis plant we cook it all the way down and we get this tari paste out of it and we use some pretty nice scientific equipment to make sure we get everything out of it and so from that it's really strong 500 milligrams to this no THC th can you imagine yeah yeah that's in co genic I mean you'll walk with your ancestors and we're gonna open up the door to the limbic system right we're gonna we're gonna go away we're gonna go into the old portions of the brain with that whole thing you're gonna wake up something I know you were talkin are you Dino Ron's a big donated to the human fund are you part of the human fun operation Ron you are right because I'm into the human fundament all the plans I like the human fund I do know I'm gonna be using the phrase walk with your ancestors a lot so I figured you know when you get patients that have never used cannabis and they get diagnosed with cancer or something too tremendously terrible and they've and they hear that they need to get into cannabis you don't want to give them an edible you don't want to give them a blunt you don't to give them a joint our Deb it just blows their mind away and you scare them and you push them back into pharmaceuticals which I believe kills them faster so we had to come with something more respectful more you know conscious respectful so we had to come with some that you can work and have your normal day with spend time with your kids and tell your son hey I love you you know my money's buried ten steps the left and to to the right right to dig the hole when I'm dead I'll tell you the rest of it you know and so you can't you can't do that when you're on morphine and you have a feeding tube down your throat but so but before you get to that stage and you need the NHO syringe we came up with the can of caps which was a micro dose I believe it's a low dose and if you think we go from 5 milligrams up to about you know 250 milligrams and we're able to but these caps these were all CBD right there we has the other ones right here that different ones that we offer in coconut oil grape seed oil avocado oil because 5 CBD and 50 THC a two to one ratio yes like so it's all for different needs you've got it all cut all different types because some people don't like certain things they don't like kind of coconut some don't like avocado some don't yeah but you have the different doses I mean somebody who's really hardcore right or really sex yeah or not even that I've even had that how people that are just like wow this just makes me feel great once they ate when you go to the doctors and they give you morphine Vicodin Oxycontin they tell you cut it a pill in half get used to it so why don't you take this and get used to it you get used to the pharmaceutical medications you get used to what the doctor tells you in the DA and I people when do I take this every four to six hours I don't know your body that's why I started helping my wife because your body's in Wonderland but deservedly the doctors start dictating my wife every four to six hours and she was a zombie and my kids didn't have a mother and so I was like well how do we how do we stay functioning in life and battle our disorders because that's one thing that they just don't teach us in anything the the pharmaceutical and the the healthcare system doesn't teach us how to live in our life because back in the day your job doctor you would have yes this guy you guys yes yeah you would be you'd be like you're probably still you'd have a house on the beach cuz it's nice there's yeah this is your doctor smart you know the good things nice things keep you healthy do so that's what I've read I would send my kid from the desert where I live he get to get on a horse this isn't like Stu 1805 right my kid is really happening I wish more people oh he was on a desert horse with no name stop it now stop it now close your Marty's in Wonderland run I'm a backdoor man that's a door to higher my gosh I know you said you were not going here I was high that was recreational it wasn't for medicinal purposes so I would send my son to you so if I got sick you know let's say gout or something right right I couldn't get to you I would send my son to you take him a day or two and he would leave a note with your receptionist like hey Doc you know phungster family out and [ __ ] TWP need some help so you would get when you get back from whoever helped you get out there you get to my property on your horse you'd get to my property you'd see my weeds not tender you'd see my garden not taken care of you'd see no cattle or no of livestock on my property you'd walk in and you'd see my fat ass sitting on the couch and you'd say what are you doing in here get out there and take care of your garden where's your where's your crops you wasted my time you made yourself sick you got yourselves now what happens today I can't argue with this but today today what do we do today we go we get into our car right drive into your nice office that's vacuumed every night and cleaned up every day okay and then you go to the back and it's a nice clean sheet and you go from door to door to door you offer the same medications that are offered because people now tell you what they want because on TV they get to see the commercials they know what they want your job is ten times easier now what have you heard you know from watching they got a real car back and so but you know normal doctors now this is the routine of our health care normal doc well it's the normal candidate patient going into the doctors going for many different reasons for different things in different issues that I had they always tried to push all kinds of narcotics and like crazy meds on me and it was insane they wanted to put me on Prozac because I just had a hysterectomy I'm going to be a little crazy right now and I don't want to take the hormones that you're giving me because it's gonna cause cancer so butter isn't long you know get her good Bono's control you wanted they want to put me on pros you know I'm scared of that stuff I don't want to be in the middle of the night there's here that's got a knife in my hand wanting to kill my family I'm scared of that stuff because they think a guy in a white lab coat gave that to me Ricky Simpson Rick Simpson told me this we've been brainwashed by the white coat so we have been because we the doctors tell us every four to six hours it's yyk stress to people like well what do I need to take this when you feel like you need it when you start feeling crappiness coming back on you you take this immediately and then you figure out hey I took that and every three and a half or four and a half hours my crappiness started coming on again maybe I should take that dose every three hours so the crappiness don't come on because the doctors tell you every four to six hours because it's a chemical it's a one molecule I understand these things I work with biochemists that makes pharmaceuticals and so that was where I kind of took into the analogy of coming up with medicine that was respectful and coming up with understanding of delivering that respectfully and coming through with the right corrective information to say hey this product can is used in this manner I've helped a lot of people get out of death beds AIDS patients you know it all started with helping the Catholic Church in San Bernardino that helps people to get out of out of prison out of jail and their low income they have no income they have stage three to stage four AIDS and and these nurses and these tiny these nuns carry them over to their death and so one of them got up and said hey I'm gonna go to Oaksterdam University and I'ma learn how to grow weed for myself because I heard that weed will help me and so they found out how to make teachers he came back to me and said Mike and so he's my good friend I mean we've been doing this for many years he was on television doing the Cannabis planet at the beginning of this whole movement as it drove itself into where it is today and so he's been a very heavy pinnacle of this industry he's been writing about me in high time since 2010 and so we go back ways and it was about us he loved the girlfriend yeah yeah oh yeah laughter she was she was the amazing we had the big dance floor she's doing cartwheels everybody just sitting down watching her gymnastics cross the floor oh yeah she was fine she keeps him alone and so we were making these products for people we had to figure out how to make them and the tinctures were really helping and people were getting pulled out of the death beds and then it got to the point where the nuns started saying hey we need to get this in the Riverside we need to start getting this into these other little small churches and let's start helping these people that are sick because you're whatever you guys are giving them is pulling them out of the death beds and they're having a life again and that's what was more important to me because you know my uncle died when I was 12 and 1989 of AIDS and there was not a lot of information about AIDS at that time it was just shut up about it and he didn't have it in hush hush and so you know as I grew older when prop 215 came up it was the AIDS epidemic that [ __ ] that push this initiative it was just kind of like you know my spirit of being here I always had a joke that I was born in the wrong generation because I should have been a flower child in the sixties but no you also were not even just walking wrong a generation or millennial yeah that was the five Meo DMT that did that some people say that from my family I'm only second direct generation standing up oh Jesus how great is it that the nuns are the ones that want to get the cannabis to help these they will that they don't eyes in grammar school but we talk about it when they witnessed it they knew something they knew that God wasn't wrong and that man's tongue was the Almighty destruction of all the years your honor money their G that's the bottom lines when these people see it firsthand then all of a sudden on board with cannabis until they are they aren't witness the strength okay guys this is the second or the show where we move on to the news that's going on locally if you guys want to jump in and help us out with what's going on or not if you just wanted we can if you just want to make faces of Doug whatever you want to do well doc we've been talking for weeks how the Vegas thing July 1st was supposed to launch it was going to launch than it wasn't creational than it wasn't well it did they had recreational sales for the first time this weekend in Las Vegas six hundred dollar fine if you smoking on the strip that's right and shockingly it was over expectations they had lines that were up to an hour long at different dispensaries who thought they had 50 people waiting in line Monday morning so some of these especially said over a thousand people for recreational dispensaries open 44 open to sell recreational cannabis 44,000 at least allegedly well I don't know if they all had a thousand a couple of them had a thong I'll go with allegedly allegedly so there's forty four dispensaries thirty nine of them more in Las Vegas so there's nobody on the freeways at this time there's a great time to get around that's right but you're on the money there it's it's true although they did sell recreational cannabis as you know you can only use it in your private home you cannot use it in strip hotels or casinos $600 fine bunk yeah great story rich well at least they made it legal state can get help and get you know well that's really not the full story though is it no because that's not really what happened Ron what really happened out there was that when they originally voted for this stuff originally they said that will he be recreational but the the people the wholesale liquor distributors get first shot so the judge comes in does an injunction stops it then right before the first is okay this is the compromise we will let you go recreational but as soon as you empty your product you're done so they emptied their product and now this dispensary they started not to go recreational can continue to do medicinal but the ones that went recreational now can't restock their shelves well but if they have they can restock medicinal right but they can't can't sell it as recreation exactly so there is a loophole there well it's not really a loophole it was for four days for three days they sold recreationally and the crazy thing was I had a patient who called me from there and said look I need my my rec card right now well you know I just bought now I just bought $60 worth the can and they charged me $181 recreation outside got the wreck went back inside spent $60.00 that's it that's it yep so this whole recreational if you think that you're gonna beat the wholesale liquor distributors of Vegas is I talking to the Teamsters so so a little chat with you if you want to lay the concrete you think these guys are gonna lose they don't lose no this is Vegas and alcohol this was a city was built on this not the problem is though the problem is I can tell you a couple problems well give me your patel me what you think the problem is the main problem it's the one where it all starts from the inflation of the media every time they used to bust our grows ten years ago as a million dollar growing of to lighter and now there's people are putting in thirty lights in there and they're like well two million dollars should be off these two lights and I just put thirty I'm in this warehouse who should be roof filthy-rich money should be falling out of the sky look I've been asked by bill the bill o'reilly show they've asked me like hey you know I can't stand that best ways he goes he goes how many millionaires do you know in the cannabis industry I said I could give you a list of all the ones million dollars in debt because I don't know any one of them that are blazing millions now unless things are hardworking cannabis drivers and yeah you come on this show when you have a dealers from the beginning because you had a personal experience that compelled you to get into it trucks roll the uncle dies of AIDS of trying to push something forward you're part of the original prop 215 you pushing for The Compassionate Care Act the people who are getting in today the reason why the government's alive for this is because they're getting money like oh this is all it is that the reason that you did it is completely different from the reason that we're doing at NASA so is the reason why I've already walked away from two licenses unfortunately because the last license I just walked away from about a week ago recently was because the whole deal was about bottom dollar bottom dollar profits and at the end I told them I'm trying to figure out a product if we can come up with a solid product the money falls from the sky but if you don't make a proper product then you don't have anything to stand there's no value you just you're just like everybody else out there trying to take people's money and where I'm from in this industry I cannot be a person taking people's money I have nitrox product when I see people I mean I'm in Virginia I said well are you gonna come out to California's no no I just wanted so I'm not thinking money you can't use this thing what are you gonna do with it I mean and then this is Wow there's a company California that says you can mail the cannabis do you understand that they're putting you at enormous risk they don't care if they got they're gonna take their money from you yeah and you're gonna go to jail the [ __ ] are you this that what's wrong went down for some bugs across state lines if I hadn't done that it'd have been fine I mean there are people out there convincing the the people who are sick and disabled to hope in the hopeful in in places that doesn't have cannabis li they're convincing them like the the Reverend on Sunday morning sent or your money to me give me $400 we'll send you a bunch of camps cross-line don't worry if you get arrested we'll be right there behind you don't worry really yeah you know many people send me messages all day I get all the terror stories it's just terrible and it just sucks that more that the local governments that these stories are right there and they're supposed to be constituents of our constituents speaking for our voice and the voices that I hear those politicians are not screaming them because I have these mothers and these fathers that are reaching out from you know New Hampshire and and you know all these creations with Virginia North Carolina West Virginia lost opioid epidemic in West Virginia these people are screaming for help screaming for help please let give me a recommendation or somebody's gonna mail me the cannabis so what are we doing that were trading an opioid epidemic for just people going to jail you can't do that and that's speaking of this very thing the opioid epidemic doc a new study came out of course this is on people who are cannabis patients though in fairness they are medicinal cannabis patients however 93 percent of them prefer using cannabis to opioids for managing pain I just got a 87 year old lady off of 16 and a half years of a morphine drip that's been like stuck to her stomachs like taped her and for 16 years 16 years she had it almost 17 years and she goes she was have they what the doctors took it off of her and they put it back on her they kept trying to take it away from her and her anxiety would go skyrocketing should freaked out so bad it took three grams of this oil of Rick Simpson soil native healing oils Phoenix tears whatever you know just Hampel just cannabis oil right cook down good cannabis cook down are you using the same basic formula as are so because if you go online you can they teach you how to make your own rough pretty rough you use it like that we use a really clean safe environment we grow our own genetics I've been breeding for years I mean it Rosenthal's grow books from big book of buds fly right hop them you know do a bunch of research for it years ago for you know organic growing and stuff so I've been known for making my own genetics and breeding plants because I do believe that the genetics the diversity of the genetics of cannabis is how we beat cancers and did you know the billeting disorders and mutated cells because if we can keep mutating the genetics we can stay two steps ahead of the mutated diseases that are that are living off of us instead of hope so and that's what they don't do with you know they stopped all of the research with with antibiotics so besides the fact that it's something the clean what what is the difference between how you make your NHO versus RSO what is the what is the difference if our audience cuz everybody knows or the guys on youtube will blow themselves up so yeah i mostly put it rick simpson doesn't call it rick simpson he calls it Phoenix tears and so the people that call it Rick Simpson oil are living on hope because if you have your own following and you're able to have your own route and structure of what you do alright or if you have truth behind what you're making then you can call it whatever you want and TRO the proof I grow my plants organically outdoors and greenhouses will show these processes there's videos of us doing this you know there's articles written about it and so I speak very highly of this I have many patients that are alive and some that aren't then their families will speak for them how they how they passed over very respectfully and that's where companies right now let's show up and they have a bottle of our so and you don't know what's in it it's it's black oil and you're used to seeing this black oil and people are using isopropyl alcohol that causes your liver to bleed causes your renal to fail and these kind of you're not really helping people and so they're using naphtha and they're not cleaning it all out let's NAFTA is a great solvent to use but if it's thumb residual solvents are left in there it can start just eradicating to the ulcers in the stomach and in the intestine lines and these are problems that we don't we're not trying to get we're trying to help people when you say natthew in ethylene right nap none after vp PMP that's the action so get the set they were used for for the mothballs and naphthalene that that I don't know naturally I think that's what that's with another isomer that makes it naphthalene but NAFTA is part of that and that's it's a great solvent it's it'll knock you don't I don't know where you go with the stock but geez geez yawning the guy behind you shining there's yeah I'm sorry nobody else feels that way I don't know why your stories are on camera here no so one of the things is that we did offer this is I've helped methadone clinics I've helped people get off of opiates I got my friends 19 year old son off of slamming heroin with this I have gotten myself off of a four-year addiction of vicodin so I broke my back and the doctors put me on vicodin and Soma 'z and I wanted to take anything else but those two because I have prescriptions for them and I felt like as long as I was in those prescriptions I wasn't you know doing too many bad things but taking 10 or 15 750 extra strands vicodin was not healthy for my liver wasn't good for my body wasn't good for my family my mood swings and myself I was over 250 pounds I was very exploded and swole up I was really sick and I had mood swings again sleep well and so once you start taking this all in I threw away the pills I realized how much the pills keep you through the [ __ ] of pharmaceuticals doctors every two weeks he proceeded yeah they just they just manipulate you and they blind you and they take you away from what the real part of our life on this planet is and that's the compassion of one another and love of life and enjoying your perspectives of what you saw in your life and experiences yours and mine and together we should be able to expand if you're missing something maybe I have the key to fix that and if I make somebody maybe you have the key to fix that and it's not the burden of each other it's a life of expansion and creativity of what we're born from instead of we've been ridiculed with you know religion of you're born from sin and you know pray every day the thankful for your blessings and yes we are thankful for our blessings but in reality we come from creation we're born from a spark of life and were put on a planet that was brought from a spark of life so every day we should wake up with a spark of life and create and build new things and we can't do that if we're stuck in pharmaceuticals and we're stuck in doctors offices and we're stuck in the system and we're eating preservatives and we're eating shitty food and we're eating farmed animals that are getting more antibiotics than we need to take when we get his little illness that's why we're not getting sick that's why we're not getting healed that's why we're staying sick and so all these factors may a lot of sense bearing over 217 people helping people watching people get out of death beds having my wife you know survive her instances and watching my children cry this is a real thing that's real is what health care really is not not business care and so I want to just bring that route back of like this is my company's native healing oils it's an it's the true of the native life let's get to the love and compassion then you can see transformation you're here you know once you you take the time to invest in yourself and you know you you know everybody's quick to invest in a lot of different things yeah but not quick to invest in yourself so people need to stop investing in materialistic things and invest in ourselves and see what their body needs and what health issues they have and try to heal themselves and they can heal themselves a lot of things can be healed just alone on food and cannabis you know if they really research and do research you can heal a lot of elements and buy food that's the key man everybody's got to research this stuff we're learning every week on this in fact now it's time to ask the doc some questions so we can learn some more for audience doc I got a question for you yes somebody wants to know which diseases is there a difference between CBD and THC for different diseases do you always need to have both or could you have one for one disease one for another disease well the only reason why you really only need THC because THC crosses the blood-brain barrier so you can't CBD is not gonna fix anything inside the brain but ultimately how you respond to any to any disease whether you CBD or THC is gonna be individual there's no way to predict what's gonna work for one person the next guy keep trying if we get studies for this though maybe we would be able to figure they're still one be able to do it because everybody's different we're all snowflakes so there's the answer then you'll never know this you have to justify myself everything's trial and error so it's just like a user you would try different levels of C be like they have the 50 CBD 225 THC you would try that then you try a different level right yeah my dad just had a stroke on Thursday and he's I gave him a 25 milligram CBD cuz he's a little nervous about taking anything THC he's a truck driver you know commercial drivers he's like I can't take THC and so I gave a 25 milligram one pill of coconut oil and he slept so good for six hours like I'm sleeping so much it feels so good like what are you talking about dad like I take that pill and I go and I do everything and I give this little ladies and they they play their bridge game their arthritis is gone and they don't go to sleep what do you think that 25 milligrams of CBD was what my dad needed to get the rest that he needed to start building himself everybody's different but there's no way that's why but way all these people trying to like the kids or what doses you should give somebody a dosage plan oh yes it's doctor same thing with the medicine - how do how do I know I need 25 milligrams of frickin whatever they like to give me vicodin how do I know why why are you giving me 25 because they say it's 25 that's the low dose of they want to give it to me it's the same thing is that the same way doctors well I mean it's to a degree because you can predict you can predict what seven point five milligrams of biking is going to do what you cannot predict is the strain that has maybe two to one THC the CB they have no idea what the terpene profile is you have no idea how the whole plant as a unit is gonna work on your body have no way of knowing that so the the problem with trying to do dosages it dosing it as a physician for a patient is that you really don't know what you're dealing with number one because you got to see his whole plant you don't know if there's any consistency if they've done the genetics to make sure that's always the exact same strain that there's no changes and you don't know how they're gonna respond it's just it's like throwing darts against the wall but if you find something what I tell my patients stick with it as long as you find it stick with it I can't tell you what it's gonna be it may take you 15 20 tries to find something but that's why I tell them the complete opposite is because it's more easier to find THC than in CBD so I tell people get used to just THC because because CBD it's yeah I know it works really well and the reason why I offered that to my father was because CBD was no THC and he was option to take the pill and now the next pill he's gonna take has THC in it but because the CBD didn't scare him he's more comfortable now taking a THC pill but it was a low dose to be able to build their tolerance up because when you over exhaust them you really put them through a scary sometimes they freak out and they push and that's where THC and yeah I get headaches from it but it's a CBD I've heard it replicates dehydration in the renal and he can get headaches so you have to have you have to heavily hydrate have you really there's nothing wrong and I don't feel in pain and I just take a pill that has both I will get a headache atencion atencion headache and my body doesn't need the th how much sleep it is or cd25 so or even even a small dab if I were to dab it just a little bit I mean I or even a small dose of it like if my if I'm not in pain I I don't really need it but when I'm in pain and I take it my pains gone I feel good I don't have a headache my body's except does it except I'm wondering whether you're both of getting headed from CBD is because you dealt with tolerance from over a long time of using cannabis and I'm a firm believer in a lot of different situations when you take a large amount of medicine over time your body develops or increases the number of receptors for you so you've increased the number of receptors right so that's how you start to tell them that the tolerance I'm just wondering whether by increasing the receptors you've now by adding CBD to it just like accentuates the way it works it like triples up because we know that it violates maybe in some way it's Veysel dilating your head and giving you a you make your brain swell feel like it's swelling or something like that maybe I I listen you can sit and postulate on these things all day long that's the great thing about medicine you just try to figure out way things work and try to like sort of fit this round hole in the square peg I'm hanging it together but that's why I came up with this little lower dose so that we can you know you have a smaller square going into that round hole so we can get in there first you know before you start hammering that square into that round hole we can see we can get in there first and let him know that a little small dose is not so scary you can start it when you go to sleep and you sleep through the freakout you get good rest you know and then your body builds up you started your tolerance and then after about a week of taking it when you go to rest take one during the day and see how much stuff you get done during the day and you don't notice how much pain you're in and I get people rheumatory arthritis and and fibromyalgia and multiple sclerosis and people that are in tons of pain and they actively have a day now and they're like wow I take one of these pills it makes a lot of sense or have friends at work they're like man I still run to my car hit my fate pin my boss figured out about vape pens I can't go out there get high anymore and I wasn't really getting high but just one puff was like a micro dose right and I was like that's the same thing take take this pill it'll cover you four to six hours now all of the anxieties with its what THC two to one and so it's you know 50 milligrams THC and 25 milligram CBD and so what it does is the CBD gets rid of all their pain now they're now they're allegedly healed their ailments are lifted and now when you get rid of somebody's pain doesn't make them happy so you give them the THC and the wind feels good on their skin and they get a little giggly and then that's filled that's the medicine the one I love the night life okay so let's say you got a bunch it gets over here and we're almost done you had a bunch of tickets over there what are you bringing the one is are those tickets the challenge yeah are you going somewhere that's going to

cookies it's a 1 gram oh and here's the testing on it it's one of the highest th fees so far 79 2% CBD a little over one at a CBN which doesn't leave much else I mean you know you add those up and then one of her terpenes are there I've got to be a lot high on the terpenes because I can't F I can really taste this stuff so Girl Scout cookies if you haven't had that one that's an OG got that fuelie taste to it and also almost like a fresh cut fresh-cut grass kind of like fresh herb tastes going on on this one it's like got a background of that few leaf layer and almost like a firework kind of slow furry taste not taste but like I don't know just brings that to mind it smells really good I definitely think these are a new favorite one because that just the strength of them and also these holes on the bottom they're much lower in the cartridge and my results in last boy East you're able to get most of it out of there I mean by the time it doesn't pop you can hardly see anything down there on the bottom yeah this is definitely one company to check out now it's agreeing that this one is a hybrid might be a little more towards of the sativa in remember Girl Scout cookies from Alpine vapor no live resin really has that that fresh taste coming through a little bit of the piney flavored yeah I just wanted to share that with you I think I'm gonna I'm gonna stick with these for the time being yeah I'm digging these there uh no they did a good job on these so uh yeah if you're ever checking these out I would give them a try I've tried three so far and then they are all top-notch they're very strained specific I mean it totally comes through and we can taste the strain that you got so yeah just want to show that to you guys thanks for watching hope you liked it see you next time", "RheR15yw8GQ": "[Music] what is going on youtube it's your boy turpy turn welcome back to my awesome medical cannabis review and this one little scenery change i'm on bear at the father-in-law's figure come out here with the wife get a little bit of fresh air uh we stopped at the dispensary marine health around the center if you guys follow me on instagram you would see one of the deals that they got going on here over there right so one of the deals that they got going on there you buy yourself a strain pax pod you will get a pax error battery for free and yes it's not like the pax era pro battery that links up the bluetooth and keeps track of all your your uh pods and and stuff like that you know what i mean but uh it does it does have no mass complete control unlimited sessions uh includes okay pax error device and micro usb limit one time warranty um i do not know where my batteries are well i got this one but that's not the tax thing anyway i don't know where my other battery is i can't compare it which i want to so i'm going to pause this and i will be right back all right and just like that i am back with the pax era pro i'm going to compare to two different batteries but before we get into this i'm going to show you what else i got from the dispensary i got an eighth of flower that i already opened up it's in the carts uh purple punch that's really really fire uh indica strained and then i got this uh grapeline ricky cresco liquid live resin cartridge which i'm gonna be super excited about that because that last grapevine ricky ahead by uh mpx [ __ ] fire right and then a subscriber was telling me about the cush mints now he was saying that for me to pick up a distillate cart by grassroots called cushman's the the um the strain but they did not have cushman so i got the next best thing which is concentrating and really to be honest i would prefer concentrate over a desolate cart 100 every day okay but this is cush mint sugar by grassroots it is indica so keep your eye out for this one and this one all right so let's get back to the packs pro in the packs era so the strain i'm going to be reviewing in this one is called uh snow shark it is indica strain i have not had this one before so i do not know um like the taste of it or anything like that there's numbers obviously right all right before i open this up i am going to compare the batteries right so you open it up nice little box you put this guy open boom and there you have it now the first thing i noticed is the charging port so you got the normal c cell to the to the regular older android um the one that takes out your controller your older cell phone control or chargers you know i mean [ __ ] like that so um and then the next thing i noticed that that the actual logo right there it's like not like this one where there's glass there you can kind of like see in it you know what i mean to wear this one yeah but they're pretty much exact same size the air hole is a little bit different as you guys can see that there right the air holes um but other than that it's not a smart battery like this one i don't think it keeps track of of uh all the different pods and stuff uh it's basically you just put it in there and you vape on it you know what i mean so with that said let's go ahead and give it a try right here we go snow shark you guys push in and pull and here she comes just like that now remember without that red band right there don't smoke it so called they're not real all right like i said always it always says it on the actual cartridge itself the strained name and uh the company of the cart so i do not know if this thing even has a charge i don't know what that little that is right there um maybe it's a light i have no idea but i'm going to it just feels like it got had a little access oil on it right there you can see that yeah yeah you guys definitely see that but uh yeah these things do last a long time that i did i do notice like i said i don't even know if this thing is charged or not i guess uh about to find out no okay so i'm taking it that this thing is completely dead so i'm glad that i got this and she is completely charged um with me using this one at least with this battery at least now i can keep track i can see the [ __ ] uh the test results i can see all the terpenes i can see everything in here once i plug it into my my uh this battery packs pro uh and get all the information linked right to my phone which in the beginning you guys will see all that information like i did on the last last uh pax pro pax error pro cart review here we go all right gotta hurry up five percent cheers boys different it really doesn't have much of a taste maybe that's just because the wicks aren't like full or whatnot but uh yeah so if you can go check out brown health wellness center go pick up this deal real quick i'm going to go ahead in the video with that because my phone's obviously about to die so y'all smash that like share subscribe all that good stuff stay turpy mama i love you go holla at inmate mhwc and go pick yourself up this free battery with the purchase of a strain cart pod", "tEwwdT7DrRE": "what

like to introduce craft premium trip tanks this one is wild cherry cola and Ellie and huckleberry stay tuned as we dive deep a review on this New Year's special edition cheaper the wild cherry cola is a cherry lime haze crossed with the cherry hash plant it's really good for those like all day kind of stoner things I seem to really like it the flavor on is pretty good it definitely tastes more like we not like Cola which is a little disappointing but I'm glad they did pack a full that synthetic flavor a [ __ ] it tastes good and it tastes healthy and it tastes like it's supposed to taste there's honestly not too many bad things I could say about it other than it is only a half grand for your $60 which is kind of expensive I mean when you think about concentrates you get a full gram for the same amount of money and I don't know a full price I've never been at the biggest fan of carbs you know like most donors I think they prefer flour or they prefer actual concentrates to cards because cards will get you stoned but they'll never get you where you want to be where you want to get like flat-out stupid if you ever want to get that stone however for a good mid-range and for those people who are kind of bigger you know bigger lightweights than everyday stoners I think this is a perfect ultimatum for him and I like it I like chilling on it [Music] [Music] [Music] almost like wax papers and all of these serve tanks are half ground cards so they're pretty small prime it well it's my first time trying Elian huckleberry it does have some very after tones which I do appreciate that they have the berry name right it's pretty delicious honestly however for me to put my finger on and maybe like a raspberry or but what potentially a huckleberry is I was it's not a real thing I don't know but pretty fire I love it all right let's talk facts Dehlia huckleberry is cbc 1.3 1% THC 80% is CBD point 2 6 % a total of 82 percent cannabinoids pretty good I don't usually give vape carts in fact these are the first who on my channel I'm not sure if I'm gonna do too many of these but I will when they're go on sale or there's good good buzz around a couple of them and then I'll have to pick them up for you guys but I had them that I'm very happy with my purchase and New Age care hooked it up at buy one get one free these were basically 25 apiece and at that value you're not gonna get anything stronger than this [ __ ] like it's really really good and even if you bought one for 50 to 60 dollars I think most people won't be disappointed all right we're just gonna rip this [Music] so you guys want to know something cool about January first in Illinois January first we need to call them some fish really legalized and unfortunately most of the dispensaries in my area are only medical I mean I guess for me it doesn't really make a difference but for most people they get to you they have to kind of drive at least like an hour out of their way to grab some stuff which kind of blows and it's always kind of high-priced you know now everyone gets to realize how expensive it's been for the rest of us another case I'm really really happy good for Illinois for putting that in law another cool thing if you have your medical card you get to grow up to five plants in your own house which is [ __ ] great um there's something that I'll look into in the future not something I'll probably be doing anytime soon but just really cool for the people who can't really afford these high prices they can probably grow and potentially you know get really close to the same quality of flower from the house if they do it right and it really helps the people who have cancer and other type of deadly diseases you know and ultimately people who need to eat and just sleep and everybody else like the rest of us yo so let's talk about Ellie and huckleberry my rate once every time is gonna be a solid eight point five on this thing it's a really good rip really solid hard the construction and the quality on these carts is great um the taste of the actual strain is great it has Barry after tones and like a very piney Foresti taste so far there's no paranoia there's no kind of honestly I'm more giggly than anything these two strains combined is a great great great high and this one is especially brought my giggly Ness and it kind of my bi overall happiness up man I would really recommend this for breakfast daytime lunch any any time of the day where you gotta be social the active and talking people this will get you up this will get Ramudu elevated this will get you in your zone I promise you that anyways happy new years everybody thank you for watching this award you folks and I'll see you next year stay lifted [Music]", "oEJLLcITRQE": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at a product uh that we've reviewed way in the past back in the good old um gray market days of edibles uh but we are now taking a look in their newly legal version and that is a syrup excuse me not a syrup a tincture a tincture company that i liked quite a lot years ago and that is cannabis that's right cannabis we've reviewed i think several of their syrups in the past excuse me tinctures uh and now we're back with their 600 milligram formulation uh and traditionally before i go into a little spiel we do about a hundred milligrams for all of our uh tincture reviews on wheats today we are actually going to do a little bit more just it's a bit of a celebration here at wheat's hq so we're going to break out of the traditional 100 milligram mold uh and we're going to go somewhere between the two and three uh hundred range and i will of course take that into account in our reviews and thankfully this cannabis syrup has a nice little chart here on the back um a little flow diagram that's gonna give us our exact dosage exact so this cannabis 600 milligram tincture uh cost 34.00 at my dispensary in long beach which is a pretty good deal for 600 milligrams of thc anyway you slice it tincture syrup or no you cannot beat that price uh so i am really excited to give this extra strength stuff a try uh so one thing i want to bring up real quick tincture syrup i know i did a review not too long ago a five star extracts uh that uh definitely labeled their product as tincture even gave you a little bit of an eye dropper as if to suggest it is tincture um i think one of their uh employees hit me up on youtube saying you guys need to take this you should actually take this with a drink which is weird because it does actually say on their instructions to do it sublingually cannabis uh spits right in that eye which i am actually quite okay with uh if you're going to um uh point out how stupid something is be bold about it and uh cannabis is quite bold about their uh tincture labeling they label it uh tincture in quotations uh just as i would you may see right there on that little label if i can get it to focus there it is yes it says tincture in quotation which i love it because this isn't tincture it's syrup it's candy flavored strawberry goop with weed in it um there's nothing medicinal about it i mean other than the thc uh but there's no uh yeah this they're not trying to hide the fact which i give them some points for oh boy uh this little cap is on here uh more stringently than i thought let me try to get that off oh no might have to be a time for a knife break let's see if i can manifest telepathically very quickly a knife in midair that nobody will see that will come to me like mjolnir like thor i'm going to do it right now yes it works 100 of the time um sorry to anybody who had to listen to that uh so let's get this cut open here and then we will dig into this scissor give it a good shake here is our 600 milligram 34 milligram 600 milligram 34 cannabis strawberry tincture let's give it a smell smells like scissor i've got some water here to help choke this down uh ultimately we're going to do about i said between two and three hundred milligrams which is you know anywhere between a third and a half so we'll do a little bit here uh and just to let you guys know like all our wheats reviews i'm gonna do this product um over the next not all between two thirds and half of this over the next uh on video but i will do it uh over the next probably hour so i'm actually getting ready to walk out the door i'm gonna have a little bit more later uh and then two hours after i have that last drop i will come right back to you guys and let you know our most important thoughts which is is this cannabis syrup as good as it used to be so without further ado let's get it down the hatch i don't know the best way to do this other than well i could mix it in something but i'm i'm a fool so straight down the hatch that's too much man whoa uh thankfully i'm trying to screw the long wrong lid onto my water there uh well you know what guys i actually um stand corrected i might not have to do a whole lot more i did way more than i thought i did about oh pretty close to 200 milligrams there uh in one gulp so now i'm just gonna wait and see a little bit how it affects me and decide how much more we want to do but i will need to take into account when i come back for a week's review am i that much higher than if it had been 100 milligrams not that it's a linear relationship i shouldn't expect to be three times as high as i would for 100 milligrams syrup but i shouldn't expect to be higher for sure um and i will know in just a bit and you guys will as well excuse me oh that syrup oh i feel it's sliding down anyways thank you so much for watching this far guys i will see you right back here or somewhere just like this in just a bit to give you those wrap-up thoughts we'll see you then [Music] welcome back tweets guys it has been many many hours since i had the cannabis uh about a hundred well actually right about 200 milligrams of cannabis syrup in total start over welcome back tweets guys it has been many many many hours since i had nearly 200 milligrams of this cannabis syrup um didn't do that much more than i originally had if any uh reason being it got me higher than i uh expected uh quite a bit higher even with just the about 200 milligrams i did uh and did the good old-fashioned classic pass out on the couch for a couple of hours that's why i look a little sleepy because i woke up still a little high for sure uh not outrageously but i fell asleep for a couple hours woke up still a little high uh and that's just 200 milligrams of cannabis strawberry syrup uh this stuff is pretty good um i will admit it did give me a bit of a stomach ache uh doing all of that at one go right at the beginning uh but that is on me don't do the way don't do this the way i did it um mix it with some stuff do it um in a less concentrated all at one shot otherwise it sits in your stomach a little rough for a bit but after about a half hour of um some mild discomfort from drinking that much syrup but once felt fine felt great felt really high still feel quite high many hours later and have no no no problems recommending cannabis as syrup yet again uh their 600 milligram excuse me 600 milligram strength tincture is another real winner for uh cannabis and cannabis line of tincture syrups so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheats really happy to have tried this cannabis again um it's a strange world syrup tincture but uh i'm glad it's a product that exists and uh one that i think i will probably try again in the future this is really good stuff from cannabis syrup tincture and that guys then is gonna do it for this review here on wheats i appreciate you watching here to the very end thank you so much until we see you guys on our next review live stream whatever stay high but more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then goodbye", "okC5iBIupHg": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive kind of think of it every day is a good day to be like alright guys back here for another video your boy so back in for

day ago my recent video got restricted you can still see the video but it's a dope restricted only certain people can see it and sometimes I guess now they only pops up on you know certain people's channels or whatnot alright guys what pretty nice piece I couldn't even finish that dad it was too [ __ ] big bro but since that's happening I want you guys to follow me Instagram snapchat cuz I have a snapchat guys and then I want you guys to also follow me on my second YouTube cuz then we can post anything on that one I can do stuff that's not marijuana related I can do stuff that is marijuana

the difference between the sauce and their regular ones their distillate rp1 these bits of gold tape right here in the sauce on it the other ones do not have that I mistakenly bought one that wasn't a sauce when I wanted the sauce one maybe I'll do a review on that one too but I was like damn I did not want to do that so I got the sauce one like the next day and I was like [ __ ] it but yeah there's also a difference between sauce and live resin which I am unsure what that is I'm have to do some research or you guys can tell me in the comments cuz you guys you guys are smart guys all you guys out there you always comment and you know you school meal and stuff and you give me the right information that I need but let's try this cheers guys also this has better air flow you see the

no life boy that [ __ ] tastes skunky like it's super tank has a skunky a skunky earth earthy type flavor like with a hand of light I don't know I guess it's more earthy I was gonna say like more of a tangent an torini type flavor but it's more earthy than that but you get a kind of a sweet taste at the end on the exhale actually pretty [ __ ] good but it's expensive guys it's like 50-something a half after [Music] but yeah guys I'm just kicking it back today it's just about to be a low-key shouldn't be going out to begin with and I'm just hella tired from work and [ __ ] so I decided to just

they got their own [ __ ] and then don't buy from know because nug is actually selling half grams of their stuff that's not sauce for pretty much sauce price and I got screwed that's how I got screwed earlier I should have just went straight to eat it I wish I would have went straight to eating it would have been way cheaper but it's a fire cart like I don't know it's a contender for sure because I just want to do a bunch of different cards like try a bunch of new cars that you guys haven't seen and that I even haven't seen because like I have never seen anyone try these if someone tried these

Oh Mac Roberts I'm so wonderful and happy to be here to educate talk about reviews and different products that we have here and so those of you who are here thank you all so much for supporting us and just being a force of change being a positive feedback for us because without you we wouldn't be who we are so then you are also my god before we get started can you give people a little bit more of your background because I know a lot people owe me more yeah let me do that I still gotta get used to looking straight at the camera and all this being on film stuff so it's a little all right I'll stare into the camera so my name is Mike my background is I've worked for about 10 years in the health and supplement industry I've also was a sales trainer for a national automotive manufacturer I worked as a federal agent was on the US Attorney's Healthcare task force out here where I'm located you know now I'm into the helping people the natural healing I've seen a lot of vets a lot of first responders a lot of people seniors just every condition you can imagine needing help and just tired of using traditional pharmaceuticals and a couple years back I got into more the cannabinoid part of the industry researching that learning about that that's kind of where we stand right now I'll go into more details later about some more specifics but that's just a general overview so what do you take what do you take CBD for me I take it for neuropathy carpal tunnel back issues not so much like anxiety and stuff like that more physical physical ailments things that have inflammation so and just overall general health like to boost my inda cannabinoid system like how we kind of take stuff for our immune system to keep that strong we need to keep our tender cannabinoid system strong and so I take it daily for that usually between fifty and a hundred milligrams for me just because I have a lot of inflammation and like physical permanent injuries so I take a little bit more than the average person but you know it works in all dosages so yes and for me my first time taking in CBD was for pain in my wrist I have tore ligaments and now I have arthritis on my right hand from military injuries I have a cyst on my left hand I have no nerve damage of my fingers so I was in pain here and I have two arguments in my left hand and when I first started taking it he helped so much with the pain but the biggest benefits that I wasn't expected is he helped me with my anxiety and my depression and a lot of it had to do with not just the fact that I never say fixes my anxiety depression but it allowed me to really go after my dreams which is just to be a educator and help people and through the process of adding on things like eating better and meditation I was able to live a better life which I'm currently doing now so those of you who are watching we always want to tell you that don't think of CBS a cure but as a tool to use to help you become better because take a CD alone is just like taking a pill and not taking care your body isn't gonna help you rawrr become healthier so you want a couple it will even right you know after your mental state is watch watching TV and the people who you are around so this is just a little bit about us and learn more by going to CBD down how WWDC be how for all things education base so today I'm excited to be talking about a few products I know I have a vape from Cindy line which is a distillate it's 500 milligrams of CBD and I also have a symptom bomb from Green health um naturals and so they started experimenting with the full spectrum line and I'm grateful that I was able to try it out on the website they have a thousand milligrams so I get started on this and there might be just go back and forth is that cool with you okay absolutely alright so let's start with the bomb so I'm gonna paint a lot my joint so like I said I have austerity which is just chronic pain I have no cartilage in my wrist so it's just bone on bone grinding and that's what us your itis is and then on my left hand I have like I said I have a cyst and I have torn ligaments and then I have nerve damage in my fingers which I also had it on my right hand but I had three charges on here and so I don't really feel the nerve damage as bad I know that there's damage there but they cut the nerve so I use a lot of bombs and when it comes to review products one of the things I tell people is I don't want any samples because for me this light here will work wonderful I feel like a day or two from traveling but if I want to review a product and really test it properly I want something that could last for me a good couple weeks the same thing goes with dentures so this is why I always make sure that this stuff is empty you see it's gonna be using for over a month now in came handy when I traveled to New York and Maryland last last month so the thing I like about it compared to the current part which actually this is full-spectrum and it has a ton of benefits in here so I'm gonna give the ingredient real quick is beeswax coconut oil castor oil turmeric lavender wintergreen count for a peppermint yin-yang I'm up I'm center-right helichrysum blue tan G blue camomile better care fill in and just a bunch of other benefits in here so on the website the 1000 milligram for the foot comes in two lungs is $75 or $74.99 uses winterized full-spectrum CBD oil and it's just a bunch of turbines out here they have a really good CoA which has I'll give you a so CVG I see one point four four percent CBD is ninety four point seven six percentage for overall and the container CBN has point four ten there is one point nine percent of distribution of THC which is point zero seven I'm still under point three percent CBC is point zero six which is one point six seven percent distribution and so it's uh it's wonderful to see that this is actually a full-spectrum product now as far as mean when it comes to trying products that I like to rub it in aggressively especially when I'm in pain and for those of you who are in the cold weather climate knows that it's your pain affects more especially when you rain so it lasts normally for me anyway between two to four hours and it depends what I'm doing if I say Bevans stop doing anything then I could get it for about four five hours if I'm not doing anything at all but if I'm actually doing work anonymously anyway from about two hours an average and I might have to keep I planned it one thing I could do is add it on my ankles when I'm doing yoga in the morning and then before and after lists to help calm the inflammation and yeah this is where I'm now I don't have any problems with it you know it's a really good price per thousand milligrams compared to some of the others I see and I love the fact that I'm not a company I've been talking them for three years so I've been part of the process of helping them grow whenever they have a question Bevan um what do you recommend I always keep my feedback and this goes to anybody so any companies that ask me for my feedback I'm waddling open not just the Brenna said we trust but if you are new brand said hey Bevin them he please helped me do you have any idea and resources to help us I will gladly do it within reason but so I just just want to make sure that food transparency is here and this is one of the brands that I know I like to follow the journey because one of the things comes to killing with the owner he loves to go out in the community and mingle with veterans he's always just dropping by and if you see a veteran he will give him a bomb or in the sample of his CBD of tincture so Brian is really good and the brand is called green thumb Naturals and WWE green thumb Naturals calm and go onto the website to check it out any thoughts on this Oh Mike no I like your the formulation of it it didn't seem like camphor was the first ingredient or menthol or something that's gonna you know get on your fingers and and rubbing your eyes and later on a bunch of essential oils and herbs and stuff and it's a consistency more like a it's like a ball kind of like a thicker what's that it's more the greasy side so like when I rub it in my hand it's CBBC here he sees a little more greasy uh-huh which is fine yeah just fine it's compared to some of the others is fine I've tried some that had tumeric in them and they stain my clothes they stain my pillow on oh no we call it our couch so this one doesn't did it so I really like it even though it's a Monica Lee she said he works wonderful I like it I haven't any issues with it one thing I was gonna say too with the essential oils and creams essential oils tend to oxidize a lot that real essential oils oxidize when exposed to air and opening containers back and forth so a lot of times in your cream products or your bombs or your your stuff like that if they start to turn color brown to pink over time it's because of the oxidation of the essential oils it doesn't mean the products necessarily going bad so that sounds like a good product it seems a lot more natural not so synthetic Elia Rollag you might forget or Walmart or something that's nice oh I agree I agree so which one you which product you have to start with well I have three of the same category so today I'm gonna focus on like gummies or soft true type stuff so okay I'll just show you all three and then I'll talk about one at a time but what I'm gonna compare is one is I got to work on this lighting situation but it's called curly fro leave yep pro leave CBD and fuse gummies then we have a green green Rhodes CBD froggies kind of shaped like a frog and we have a wash Bach alchemy squid full spectrum have extract like a natural gummy type thing so I think first well what did I show you guys first the pro leave I'll start with this first um I'm sorry like so bad anyway I'm just gonna take a sample of each one to give you guys a feel for like taste this is just all my opinion everybody has different feelings on case but with the pro leave the main ingredients are organic glucose syrup and they do put parentheses or weak so people dunno if you have a celiac disorders almonds listed organic cane sugar pectin citric acid ascorbic acid natural flavours natural colours organic concentrate Apple organic carrot pumpkin and blackcurrant and industrial hemp so I mean there's a little bit of cane sugar and stuff but overall it's it seems to be a little bit healthier choice than a lot of them on the market I think this one is a 50 milligram so I just randomly picked they're kind of shaped just like a orange slice or like a loner stop so I'm just gonna sample course opinion asking the month of sugar per serving on this one sugars 2 grams nice not too high really you know this one you can definitely taste like the cane sugar put in a way if you're somebody who craves sugar this might not be a bad bad option no it has a good taste to it that has oh I was gonna mention it has the QR code when you scan it I believe on this one I test for heavy metals microbials mild toxins the whole gamut of stuff and it did test out you know I know exactly but it's very close to 50 so it was within compliance reasons for that it's a good case I would say it's a good compromise in between but he wants something sugary but a little bit more on the healthier side this would be this would be a good product to UM try I can't tell you necessarily on the effect because I haven't tried it for 30 days so I don't want to make you know tell you all this works great and blah blah blah but based on the lab tests and if your body responds you know for all the CBD I think it's gonna work good for you so it's just another alternative it's in between the market of high fructose corn syrup candies and completely vegan it's one it's on the healthier side but it's you know it's right in the middle I would say so and I think the price is roughly I could look it up but there's 50 milligrams per gummy I think it's around $60 for a 30-day supply or somewhere around there you can get more information I think it pro leave p ro le ve pro leave calm if you want to look at this stuff on that so so one quick aid came in is it full spectrum I said a broad spectrum this one is right here it will tell me I just want to make sure they completely right no THC it says on here and let's look at the ingredients one more time industrial hemp so we'd have to pull the lab tests right now oh they don't cannabidiol doesn't say this or that I'm not sure I was going more for the taste and like the ingredients today on these because there's three of them but that's one you could look up it does have the warning and does not contain more than 0.3% Delta 9 THC on it so that would give me the feeling that there might be a minor amount then on this side it says no THC so that may be one thing you want address on your labeling if you're if if you're working for that company if one thing says contains less does not contain more than 0.3% delta-9 and then your other picture says I gotta get a sled if there's no THC so yes probably be more labeled what it contains MIT's broad-spectrum full-spectrum or just cannabidiol by itself it doesn't say so I'm just gonna look at it from a standpoint if you pick that up in the store you wouldn't have the lab test right in front of you you may be a little confused so maybe fix the labeling a little bit on that that would help out the consumer so yeah it just says haven't arrived CVD or doesn't say anything I'm assuming it's gonna be severe isolate on there this is one of the things promised me I work with brands you're not specific enough when it comes to us on the product for me it's caused us a lot of misinformation and you wrote to trust the community we need not be more open to the ingredients right and I just kind of want to focus like we're just today and some of the reviews we've done before and then the future will do you know more in-depth I kind of wanted to look at these two days like I pulled it off the shelf and here's ingredients and you know this is what the consumer would see off the top of their head so knowing yeah it was a big score or a deeper item I must have right now no we are we have a website a platform for reviews where we region the actual brand itself and there's gonna be on but we still testing it now has a rating system if you want to go right now look at it simply that how slash reviews we were launching that over the next couple weeks so that will we have where you can leave your comments on the company and the plan is to have so for example right now we have Dutch natural and tonic so Dutch natural is a company and then on the day we will be add an individual products as time goes on but like I said again this is something that's to take time because our team is very small a lot of these things we do is just opening it freely and so we have to manage our time appropriately when it comes to pushing out the content and so as we slowly develop the team and able to create the systems in place we'll be able to that populate is as fast as possible now if some of you who are interested in reviewing or have me reviewing products and you'd like to contribute to to us towards the reviews will be gladly open to that and build some SAP type of system where you can be part of this and help us educate the community properly so just you know this is this lab is the first of many for us we still try to make sure that all the kinks out here and so we thank you so much for the support that you've given us and just being asking the questions and so thank you so much okay so I think as we're just getting started on this and just getting the new platforms and trying out the technologies and stuff if you guys have suggestions on how you want the products rated for the future like a 1 through 10 scale or certain criteria or stuff like that we'd love to hear that because we're here to help you sure we can make our own and this and that but what do you guys want to see how do you want it rated if you want to comment on the Instagram accounts that CBD dot how or at great CBD reviews or send a message over we'll take all that into consideration because we're here for you you know as the consumer so whatever you would like to see if there's enough people want it rate it that way then you know we'll take that into consideration all right so let's do stick to them the other I'm gonna go so let's try to perform what do you think of it from you got me I don't know but I have two flavors so here's what they here's one CBD froggy 50 milligrams green roads this one is I'm guessing like a lemon it doesn't really say oh no it just it's yellow this one is purple so I'm assuming that's great it doesn't say just as omnigul these are again self-serve you know one time use pack so like again I can't give you a 30-day evaluation how the product works when you only have single serving packs you I'm not gonna tell you as effective or not because I can't make that decision so um the the gummy so if you guys comment Bevan if you can tell me which one they want me to eat or if you want you to eat one or the other I don't care but let me give you the ingredient which one the great one to try to grip on to me think about it okay let me read you the ingredients first before I try it I don't know this just on the packaging - they have a QR code I scanned that one this morning it had all the all the proper testing done on and it met within criterion for the 50 milligrams like the ingredients are this one's a little sweeter corn syrup sugar gelatin citric acid natural and artificial flavors FD&C red number forty yellow number six yellow number five blue number one then 50 milligrams of phyto cannabinoid rich oil parenthesis PCR it may cause drowsiness and not recommended if pregnant or breastfeeding so it's also made in the USA by green ropes so let me have break this bad boy open it says MD THC so that would mean like not detectable or none detected THC um a lot of people won't even know what that nd means so again on your labeling these companies need to be a little more specific about exactly what they're using I get what they're trying to do not mention certain things but if you call your product CBD froggy you might just want to list the kind of CBD New Jersey so here we go he tried that Colet you know that is isolate product and I could tell you compared to some of the others that I would never personally wouldn't pick this one over others out the first one is so much better for us when it comes to the quality of it and the sugar here is 9 grams of sugar okay it is it is a lot bigger than the other it's like 2 to 3 times as big as the other piece so it's a bigger piece that's probably why but let me put this frog in my mouth kind of a big frog in my throat soon so mom magazine that so he has zero cholesterol is no sodium here 11 grams of carbs 1 gram of protein it's actually picked to calorie fat in the calories so one of the problems I have with the frog is is that he has artificial ingredients it's FD&C red 40 yellow 6 yellow 5 blue one and like when it comes to gummies love you know having something is more organic at least as close to possible so much better I like your natural stuff is just just stuff added that doesn't really help your body you know is it a still a broad spectrum because the Webster says when you look at the lab reports that blonde puts on a show CBI slip I'm just CBL is not a Miami noise in there so what is isolate more spectrum all I can say good baseball the lab reports is only showing CB Iceland oh yeah that makes sense where it says uh hold on non detected THC so there we go um taste-wise it's not as sweet as the pro league one I thought to be a little bit sweeter with those ingredients like corn syrup and stuff but it's um actually is more of a ahem flavor to it kind of weird I agree with you on the ingredients i i'm the human guinea pig here today so i don't like putting all these um colorings into me I don't know why we I guess when you use the color spectrum wheel that made purple yellow five yellow six red forty blue one mix them together and you got a art project here looks like a frog but it uh I don't know ingredients you're right I I personally probably wouldn't choose this I would say at this point the prob'ly taste a little bit sweeter and is a healthier alternative but you know if you're on the go and you're you love frogs or if you have a friend who loves frogs or even I don't know I don't know what the point of the Frog is honestly maybe it was their favorite pet as a kid I but anyway that's the CBD froggy I think they make other CBD creatures and things they make a ton of products but uh it's full of too many synthetics for my liking so I would say at this point pro leave is in the lead as far as taste and ingredients so what do you what are your thoughts on that question Kim you know so we thought so no screaming so I've actually tried these and they're pretty good which flavor do you have so this one here is a Crisp Apple oh I have crisp apples so why don't we are you gonna eat yours today I'm gonna get it right okay let me grab one more flavor over here and you can tell me about that one I'll grab them so I've tried these in different flavors and compared to some of the other one allows you like these they have organic toffee tapioca syrup organic sugar water pectin apple flavor full spectrum hemp extract so this is a full spectrum citric acid coconut oil red cabbage color sort of using the cabbage for the coloring this one has tumeric in here and contains coconut one thing I like about it they have batch numbers on the back of it the little batch of ID so he got was calling verified information and then it has a 10 character no calories there's no sodium here 2 grams of carbs 0 fiber 2 grams of sugar and each of these have 20 milligrams in dosage not better it's pretty good you know just feeling it this one from the inside it feels a lot more on the other shoe were a little bit more of a solid feel like if you're familiar with like those orange slice candies or things like that is a little thing this feels a little more on jelly like probably because of you know the pectin and the another stuff so let me just I'm looking at it here same thing mine's just colored with red radish color but it has cap yoga organic organic tapioca organic sugar water pectin cherry flavor natural full-spectrum hemp extract so that's one thing they list listed full spectrum so you know what you're getting off the top of the package without having to scan the QR citric acid coconut oil and red radish color and they put the thing contains coconut the one thing I think is pretty and has the QR code on the back I'm sorry about the lighting guys we're gonna get that fixed by next time but has a QR code on the back and the one thing I do like that I recommend to companies is the labeling on here it's a label they stick on afterwards the pageant's printed with the main you know logo what the product is this and that but on the back the ingredients and that kind of stuff in the batch they're two separate stickers so if anything ever changes or laws change you can real able you can change you're not stuck with a million packaging that's pre-printed when you need to switch something up or if you change your formula you know you're still it's still gonna call it a squib but it may have another ingredients night you just pop on these new labels on the back of the package so that was a smart decision for that vegan now I don't see anything here that's not vegan right and they don't come and say but based on what I see for those of you want a big an option I think this is a good it's a good way to go and like I say this because so many greenness is close to counter prized around gummies and those are vegan so one of the thing that I can tell you I love about this is that I can taste the full spectrum like like I'm so used to yep it's pretty cool right so cute I'm so used to taking CBD now like so many products I've tried I'm taste out that taste of they have in there so compared to the isolate I could tell you this actually has full spectrum based on the taste and that's just my experience over the past four years of trying so many different products I'm kind of like used to knowing like you taste it there so if you want a product that doesn't have that taste in there this is not for it but it's not a over women as some of the others that we've tried so I really like the squibs and these are coming a ten to get it you get a ten ten each and it's a eight eighteen dollars for a pack of one that has a ten inside of there which is not bad which is not bad no III just case but you can definitely case the the hemp but in a way I personally like that because you know you're getting something in it you know you know you're tasting the ham so you know what's in them um it's not as sweet as the others but it has a much easier to chew consistency I believe because of the pectin in there the way it's formulated I believe it is a vegan product I know it doesn't say it on there but it yeah I'm I'm pretty sure you could classify this as vegan based off of the ingredients good taste again I'm not I'm not gonna comment on how well it worked because this is only 20 milligrams which I know is not enough to probably do anything with tomatoes taking CBD on a daily basis I'm not to not do anything but to feel like a spike or a big effect you know and again we only have like a single dose size so I can't tell you how well the it works in the long run but it tastes good and as I think the healthiest ingredients of everything we've done was this so my kind of comparison of them is that cool if I go over just the three yeah okay so I would say hmm health-wise best for your health in my opinion is a squib the consistency is good I like that you're getting 20 milligrams and you gave the pricing you know everybody can make their own determination is it worth a little bit higher price to have all natural ingredients in too many people it is a lot of people pay more for organic foods and things too so there's that so it's it no it's a good product um second in line I would go with this pro leave it's not as healthy the ingredients for the squid but it's a lot better than most of the companies out there with high fructose corn syrups and stuff like that and you think I'm talking to myself am I can you guys hear me let me look in chat this way write a comment if you can here hello there you are disappearance Arvelo all right so back to this the UH the probe we've you know it's a good compromise in between the two I'd still say it's super it's pretty healthy looking at the ingredients I am so happy they actually took the time to label and um I haven't seen this in lolly glucose syrup they put wheat a lot of people just put glucose fructose sucrose they don't put wheat like it's weird it's derived from so if you have celiac or weed disorders that's that's good to know you know so I would say next in line is the pro leaf it is 50 milligrams it's a better price per milligram for the CBD then these other two products you get almost twice as much CBD for the same a little bit more on the price some of them you're getting double the CBD so Pearlie visit I would recommend that product with this one as far as case ingredients and lab tests that reached out I think I'm the squib lab test I'm not sure can you pull that up quick by chance or did you have a chance to look at that I just want to make compare the lab test for the three because I can't pull it up at the same time I closes a lady trying not bland that case I'm just getting in my phone yeah just do like if you're a consumer whatever pops up because I know it's gonna go to their landing page hey I did do that I didn't Redux I didn't wanna I just wanted to remain out of the lab tests come sir the scripts and the websites like slow I'm having problems open to be labs from the thing okay got it what's his full spectrum so I just wanna you know it says on their labeling which I'm glad it says that it's not like just fight overage cannabinoid or this or that nice what are we looking for we're looking for square 20 milligram I think I have another warning okay what does it say as far as its positional full-spectrum and does it show like pesticides microbials my toxins all that renders so milligram per gram point four zero four percent of total THC six point two three eight milligrams of CBD there is some Doulton line here they know Delta eight there is a CBC so it's point two eight two percent CBC so all this CBC here CBD and Delta 9 THC all right so we got four factor of okay which is great to see that something lines up with what the label and says that's because sometimes we've seen that it tells them to yeah and there's no test foreign like McNamara talks to reduce almonds the corn to lab reports it doesn't have that just shows you the counterbored content which is the poor to see so and so I know maybe they did maybe they didn't list it but if I was alchemy or the squib line I would definitely with the price point that it's at I would include all those lab tests because you're you know a lot of people when they start paying more than twenty thirty bucks for a product they want to see all that all that stuff that you did and it shows your customer that you you care you tested everything my Oh toxins microbials like a full panel and you know it's not that expensive to do a full panel when you're producing stuff in bulk it's not gonna add much to your cost but it's labeled correctly that's awesome it has a good consistency I like it okay now here's the last one rush rush nella a pocket real quick Shimon to link to the lab so another one because the one from the label goes to a different one than the one that was sent to me here so that one has a test for pesticides in your that wasn't this that's better so there's a CB d here c BD v CB n CB g CB c delta-9 so it has more so this one must be full pull the full range of the one has all more than one just Swift and not individual size so we'll have to look at this for you go ahead got him Dion degree Rhodes oh yeah I should say that Swift has the batch ID Anna so I'm sure each batch is made up you know the different distillate from a different crop whatever so they'll be a little different but at least a list that batch ID which is nice I'm the Frog I thought with all the sugars and everything else it would taste a little more sweet almost like a candy you know but it really didn't I guess there's not a huge amount of sugar but when you look at the corn syrup and sugar is the two main ingredients you would think it tastes sweet so it doesn't taste that sweet it's it's a little large you know it's almost the size of like a baby frog you'd catch you know your hand is a kid and play with it it's there's a little too big I think you could cut the size down on it um for somebody the little mouth it might be a lot to chew might take him a little while you know health-wise the ingredients yes they're on the bottom of the list it's pretty much all synthetic artificial different colors this and that but if you hey if you're into frogs or something novelty or you like frog legs give it a try I mean go after the lab tests did turn out on that one there they're like a full panel - I think I'm this one um so they do do their laptop game but again it's different strokes for different folks if he had really loves to eat stuff you know I don't think any of them are gonna satisfy your sweet tooth on these three but I don't know do the watering when it comes to gummies I just like to remind people that gummies are kind of like candy so it tastes good you unit thinking you you in I've seen people eat a lot of these in one day think think in that case it's really good to taste like candy you know it's like some sweet that we grew up with so to be mindful these are CBD in there so you take Emily's once or twice a day at the most because once you take too much you $1 check she sugar to you but she causes inflammation and the fact that when you take too much CBD the body only used so much so whatever that young mother body needs it's gonna flush out your system so the last one we have right is this a single line got a disposable Bay Pam and so when I have it it's not available the website it's a new string so I've been trying it out when I went to Florida and also to Maryland it's really great it's a Maui wowie and it's 500 milligrams of a of CBD in a point 5 ml it's so Marwari comes from salon raised strains from Hawaii it some use reported effects for creativity energetic focus you get more earthy flowery tobacco flavors and it's a lot of a better care feeling in this dish strain here compared to some of the others and I really like it it tastes really good I wanna sleep an apple but I'm more like a sweet flavor to it and one thing I like about it there's no there's a peach in there there's no VG in there there's no MCT and that's we've seen a lot of other big companies have that unnecessary ingredients I just determined and distillate which is wonderful and on the cost of this right here here's $40 there are many different strains so there's blueberry forbidden fruit", "GypJH37l6jA": "what's going on guys it's your boy Sam from Sammy cvd TV coming at you with another review man I made a review already something was wrong with the

so that's what you got to do you guys you got to go in there and kind of just stack it in the sides like that and that's pretty much out really I mean it's just pretty self-explanatory if you mess this up then you just really weren't meant to let the even try it [Music] so oh yeah so it's pretty clear now you guys can see in it and like I said five clicks turns it on okay and now we got five clicks boom so on you just kind of push this down just like that well actually you don't even really need to it just kind of kind of just kind of kind of get it to go down like that see nice and closed up now watch the dab okay I'm gonna do it [Music] this tastes amazing this is it got me feeling really mellow to this completely will take your anxiety away that's a fact you got any anxiety guys like or say that you smoked a strain that you're not really digging because you're getting anxiety or it's making you to oppy you add this in there with it don't cancel it right out this is this was a really good choice to get this bad I like it this is a really good start up pen and you know what eventually when I save my money I'm gonna get a new one this will be one of the giveaways is this pen here all you gotta do is buy the replacement coil for it got the charger so anyways 20 bucks really good deal and it was a really good deal for this 20 bucks and luck it even comes with the with the wax tool so [Music] [Music] so yeah it's a nine hundred milli amp battery which is actually pretty decent size battery comes up the cool little spoon with the groove in it to put put this stuff in and then it comes with this phyto dabs is a really cool company guys gonna check them out as phyto Dobbs calm I believe I heard I purchased this on the hip hop though when I bought those blue dream set out to a man that's smoking on that right now that I recommended to he loves it is a good strain good genetics I believe it's actually lifter what they called a blue dream but um yeah it's it's good and it's an indoor quality thing bear grow so so yeah anyway guys let's going for another dab so let's thing got a definitely a lot of flavor production [Music] I mean it's really hard to see with this with this all this wax that's in there I mean it's like so much God [Music] all right so I mean like I said this is definitely work that it was 20 bucks guys 20 bucks and the company that makes this big kind of you guys want to go and check it out is Sigma e cig comm okay its Sigma that's called the Evod it's a high quality best priced wax electronic cigarette kit 20 bucks 20 bucks comes with this cool pen you know the battery alone is is it's kind of worth probably like 10 bucks you know basically you're just paying for the plastic and the coil you know make sure you get more than one coil now in case you dab often because you might need it I don't know yet how long these coils are or how good they are how many uses you can get out of something like this the coil is a tad bit dark looking a little bit burnt I don't know well but I think you try use it for multiple uses if anything it actually would be really easy to make a coil for this you could easily make a coil for something like this honestly I think I could make my own it all depends yeah this thing's pretty badass this thing is pretty badass and another DAP I mean this thing is a streaking cool I love it I'm a DAB all day now I gotta order some more dad's mm-hmm I'm gonna chill for a little while though and bind stuff I just bought another like two three ounces you know I'm talking about 70 70 $80 ounces you know what I mean so I'm just gonna relax I be spending too much on this [ __ ] but you know like I said I mean someone said to me earlier I was on the phone with him he said oh my god you buy all that I'm like yeah dude they're gonna give it to me I can show you my visa statement they don't need companies don't give it to me I mean I had some give me some stuff to review but like nah not like that trust me I'd buy paper most [ __ ] out my own pocket you mean it's just something I enjoy doing I like doing it for you guys I like I like interacting with people and trying to find something here and you know I just like doing it it's just fun it's fun to do it do the YouTube videos and stuff like that I just I like having subscribers and people to talk to and people that can relate with me with the CBD and stuff like that and how much they can really people can benefit from using this products whether it be for anxiety would it be for stress you know I don't know if I need new subscribers know my story but I actually am I'm a recovering heroin addict and November 27th I'll be sober for years the only thing I use the CBD everything else drugs and alcohol that's it nothing and now it'll be four years you know by the grace of God go I and it's all about taking the road less traveled you know because everyone can walk down the wide road but it's going down that narrow road our road or it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel but if you stick with it you can get through it and and I did and it was not easy and it's still not to this day to do the right thing but once you follow you stay on the right path you're good you know I was in rehab with 40 men and out of all 40 men maybe two people are sober one says they are and I don't know if I trust them but I'd be the other one that's sober and the other 20 men died and the other 17 men relapse so you know half the population died you know heroin is really killing everybody out there and you know I started using drugs when I was 12 and I stopped almost four years ago so majority of my my childhood and teenage years were under the influence of drugs narcotics like hard drugs not you know like I'm talking about like storing a ball of cocaine at night you know I had a bad habit as a kid selling drugs buying drugs I mostly sold most of the drug that I was able to support my habit and by the grace of God I just you know my mom passed away and I lost the house I lost the dog and I lost all that stuff and that's kind of what opened my eyes is her death brought me light so that's why I am sticking to the right path and doing the things I need to do and finding CBD was a blessing because it's it is absolutely great it makes you feel great the exciting depression helps about much so that stuff so much you know it's just helps with that stuff so much and being able to use it in all stuff is just like a that's a godson this this is a sour space can you guys you would never think it by looking at it this is our space candy this is our space and it's got a sour fruit hazy smell just like it says here hmm funky funky no you smell good Dutch that in your car you better hope that you have some some air freshener stuff and you get rid of it because you don't want the cops find a [ __ ] maybe smell actually even though it's legal [ __ ] this they'll give you a so this

people tripped away from the family I don't know if you guys can relate but whose family only gets together when there's a funeral how many guys can some of you guys can really understand what I'm

guys", "Zo5jiigf_JM": "So I've come to public-housing\nneighborhood in London, and I'm about to meet\na guy named Hidrow. He's an underground\nweed-concentrates maker who treated his own cancer\nwith medical marijuana, and now supplies\nJohn's neediest clients with serious,\nhigh-potency cannabis oil. \u266a\u266a Always have one of these. Andavolu: Okay, good.\n[ Chuckles ] So, Hidrow,\ncan you take me through the cannabis medicines\nthat you make, and, like,\nhow you make them? Yeah, I'll give you\na first run out, and this is trim and leaf and a little bit\nof bud and stuff. Where do you get this trim from?\nWho gives it to you? Everybody's got a friend\nwho grows a little something, and, you know,\nthey throw it away, so I say \"Bring it to me. That, what you're throwing away,\nto me, is a lifesaver, and to other people can be\na lifesaver, you know?\" And when you say \"they,\"\nyou mean, like, people who are basically\nselling weed illegally. Yeah. Some of them are\nreally nice people. Some of them are\nvery horrible people. Some of them are --\nI would like to see them out of the business\ncompletely, because -- What do you mean,\nthey're \"horrible people\"? Well, they're not nice. They're criminals.\n[ Laughs ] You know,\nthey actually are criminals. [ Twisting cap ] After this,\nwe would take this and we literally have the most\ndangerous part of the process, which is where we have\nto actually decarboxinate it. You're putting a flammable\nsubstance next to heat source. Yeah -- never smart. You know, I --\nI mean, like, honestly -- Like, I'm pretty nervous\ndoing this inside. Um, stick your mask on,\nplease. -Because...\n-Um... What -- What can go wrong\nif this goes -- Um, you could burn down\na whole building. You could kill yourself.\nIt's extremely dangerous. All right, I'm actually\nvery nervous about this. [ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a I'll just take off my mask. Yeah, that's done.\nThat's just, uh, oil. Ooh, you can really\nsmell it, though. We don't charge. It's not about charging,\nyou know? How much\ndo you give away? Every week, about 20,000. 20,000 pounds? -Yeah.\n-Wow. But for someone, that could be, like,\n5 to 10 days of relief. And this is why we're -- we're\nactually fighting our government for the right\nfor medical access, because it shouldn't be\npeople like me, sitting in a dank,\nlittle house, risking my life\nand my -- my freedom. to produce\nhigh-potency cannabis oil, I wanted to know who was using\nthis back-alley medicine. So I'm joining John\nas he consults with a new patient,\nPaul Webster Hughes -- a single father of two\nand stroke survivor. Hello.\nGood evening, John. I'm Paul.\nIt's a pleasure to meet you. Hello, Paul.\nVery nice to meet you. Can you step aboard?\nI'm -- I'm good. Thank you. \u266a\u266a I've just given cannabis\nin the privacy of my own home. Thank you very much. And, uh,\nthat's a 1:1 strain, which is 15% CBD\nand 15% THC. There's no\nrecommended dosage, because there isn't\nany medical data on how we're to do this.\nOkay. But, really,\nwhat I'd say of anyone is try a very, very, very\nsmall amount. Just take -- even just, like,\na pinhead to start with until you just\nget used to it. No need to worry about money,\n'cause that's what we do. We give out\nfree cannabis oil.\nWell, thank you very much. Because Paul lacks\nregular, safe access to medical marijuana, he uses a combination of medical oil and street weed to treat the symptoms\nof his stroke at his home in North Yorkshire. [ Birds chirping ] Andavolu: So, Paul, if you could\nsort of take me through -- What happened to you? 2005 --\nI'm living in Thailand, and I went out\nto my wife's village. Went swimming\nin the morning, and later that morning,\nI just fell, and I've got videos --\nbizarre, coincidental. Paul: Now, while you're\nplaying around on there... [ Woman gasps ] -It's okay.\n-There's no blood. [ Child crying ]\nOkay... And I was paralyzed\non the left side of my body. [ Slurring ]\nDo you need any... [ Woman speaking indistinctly,\nchild crying ] Woman: Hey. [ Crying continues ] Paul:\nAnd for the next six months,\nI was carried to the toilet. I had about 10% of my left body,\nat that point. I've had a headache\nfor 11 years.\nWow. Can you imagine having\na headache for 4,100 days? -Straight?\n-Straight -- absolutely. I never get a break. Imagine big, rolling\nboulders or marbles crashing\noff each other. It's like a tightening\nof a skull cap on my head. Did doctors sort of\nprescribe you anything to sort of help?\nOh, sure. Yeah, I-I've been on\npretty much all the medications that they're allowed\nto give me. I was on 14 pills a day\nat one point. So, on these pills, physically,\nit closed me down, and a couple of them depress you\nenough to kill you. This last Christmas,\nI decided no -- no more. And, uh, that's when\nI started, uh, smoking, because it dulled\nthe pain. \u266a\u266a It allows me to do the things\nthat I must do. It gives me potential. The pain's still there,\nbut it's in a bubble. But it's like\nthere's an extra layer between me and my pain. My kids\ndon't see me smoke. I only smoke\nin my room. I don't smoke anywhere else\nin the house. I'm a single dad.\nMy kids come first. Hello, you. -What'd you doin'?\n-Hi. There's word\nfor your brother you'll learn\nwhen you're older -- seven girlfriends,\nI mean... He's a player! Okay, that's one way\nof putting it. Yeah, sure. All right,\nhere's the view -- pizza. Can you bang it on?\nYou can do that, can't you, huh?\nMm-hmm. All right, homework --\nWhat about French?\nI got my history. What was your history like? 64%. 64%. -Yeah.\n-Well done, you. -Pizza's ready!\n-Okay. Thank you, sir. Please.\nYou're very welcome. Oh, thank you very much. Meat Feast or pepperoni? I think it's Meat Feast,\none of your favorites. -Meat Feast.\n-Looks like it's Meat Feast. Do you guys sort of,\nlike, realize that, like, the marijuana\nthat your dad's smoking is still, like,\ntechnically illegal? Yeah, we do. How does that make you feel?\nLike, what... Uh... Kind of scared that\nhe's gonna get caught. Paul: If I thought there\nwould be a situation where our life\nwould be threatened, I wouldn't smoke.\nMm-hmm. That's just\nblack and white. They're more important to me\nthan, uh -- than anything. [ Speaks indistinctly ] Ooh.\nHey, you okay? Yes, yes. Is it sort of scary\nto think that he has to do something that's illegal to,\nlike, feel better? If it's helping him,\nI allow it. But if he's doing it\nfor no reason, really, I would feel\nkind of upset. Right. But it doesn't seem like\nhe's doing it for no reason. It seems like\nit helps him a lot, right?\nMm-hmm. Well, she hates smoking --\nI think that's the main thing. And she's got a pretty good\nsense of values. And to her, whatever\nshe sees in the world, says pot's bad. And she thinks\nin black and white. And now we give her\nthis conundrum that daddy needs it. It kind of throws a bit\nof a wobbly at her, you know? Mm-hmm. So she's trying very hard\nto reconcile that. We had a bit of a cry together\nand a cuddle upstairs, and, uh, she'll be okay. I mean, it's hard, right?\nAnd it's -- It's lousy. I have to live a lie,\nand no parent, especially when you've got\nabsolute love for your kids, wants to do that. \u266a\u266a I've come\nto Limehouse Marina in London to see John on the final leg\nof his journey. Today he's gonna take\nhis tiny, little canal boat into the mighty River Thames\nto let his cannabis banner fly and to drum up support\nfor marijuana reform right in front of Parliament. What we've got here are\nsome CBD-rich cannabis seeds. They're very low in THCs. I'm gonna pop them\nin the balloon. Okay. [ Helium hissing ] We are gonna tie some notes\nto them from patients -- medicinal-cannabis patients\nacross the UK, and we're gonna send those\nup into the sky and hope they reach\ncommunities across Albion. Amazing. [ Hissing continues ] So, what do you reckon the day's\ngonna be like for you? Uh, I am...\nI mean,\nyou're taking a small boat into big old body of water. It's gonna be a big old\nbody of water out there, be nice and choppy. How is it different from the small canals\nthat you go in? Uh, it's tidal,\nso it's pretty dangerous. Do you think the boat's\ngonna handle it? The boat is gonna handle it,\nmy friend. We do not like pessimism...\nOkay. Right on. ...anywhere near my boat.\n[ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a [ Boat motor humming ] All right, John!\nSee you, man! Goodbye, Krishna.\nGood luck. Namaste. Whoo-whoo!\nWhoo-whoo! [ Laughs ] That's the little barge\nthat could. \u266a\u266a [ Crowd cheering ] It's to legalize\ncannabis in London. [ Cheering continues ] -Hey, how's it going?\n-Nice to meet you, man. Good to meet you.\nHey, man. I'm Krishna. You guys excited? \u266a\u266a [ Siren wailing ] Hey, Paul. -Krishna, how are you?\n-How's it going, man? Aw, it's good to see you. -What a great event.\n-I know. How are you feeling --\nYou excited? I'm very enthused\nand excited about it. It's not just talk. These are real people\ncoming out and demonstrating\nthe reality they believe in. And that's got to make a\ndifference, Krishna, in the end. And what's it like being sort of\nbeing amongst this group of, like,\nother like-minded people? -Brothers. Family.\n-You think so? -Yeah.\n-Amazing. They're just be so open\nand honest about it. I asked them, did they feel\nat all self-conscious? Hell no.\n[ Laughs ] You know, this is what\nthey believe and what they do. Yeah, people are just, like,\nsmoking weed next to the Thames, next to Parliament. The English are\nvery law-abiding. But I think now that we're starting to see\na movement that's gonna\ngive us a change. And this is the mother\nof Parliaments. If it can't start here... -This is where it starts.\n-This is where it starts. \u266a\u266a Andavolu:\nAll right, it looks like he's just about to go\nunder Westminster Bridge, and he's just gonna pop out right in front of the Houses\nof Parliament and Big Ben. I saw him for just this little\nbit right on the other side, and he looked really tiny. Like, the boat was small. And -- Oh, look! You can\njust see him right there. He's coming in. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] He's releasing the balloons. [ Laughs ] Amazing. Man: Go on, John!\nKeep going! Get those seeds!\nYou tell Cameron! [ Cheering continues ] Hey, John!\nHey, John! He gave the wave!\n[ Laughs ] He waved at us. And he looks so small\ncompared to that building. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] \u266a\u266a As an American,\ncoming to the UK and seeing how medical-marijuana\npatients are faring -- In one way, it's a little\ndispiriting to see that they have to improvise and sort of do\nthis underground stuff to get what they think is\nmedicine that's gonna help them. But another way -- I'm seeing\nsomething sort of special. The people I met here\nare kind of filling in the gaps. Guys like John,\nlike Paul, like Hidrow, who are making real sacrifices\nin order to help people -- Robin Hoods of sorts -- they're forming these kind of\nad hoc underground communities, taking weed\nfrom the black market, making it into oil\nand medicine, and then giving it\nto the needy. That's kind of\na beautiful thing. That sort of, like,\nmodel of compassion is something I think\nthat the world can learn from. What I've seen in the U.S. is that legal weed\ncan equal money. But here in the UK, it seems like illegal weed\nequals compassion. And what's cool\nis that compassion is free. \u266a\u266a", "agukEpErewM": "hey what's going on everyone my name is josh also is wade funnies in today's video we're going to go ahead and review and

the phone like i said this is a move pure cartridge this is the black mamba strain we're smoking on today got some nice golden black oil in there golden uh yellow oil in there nice uh translucent this particular strain is a half gram cartridge over there from move florida like i've said 50 for the half gram black mamba is a indica the lineage of this parent of this strain the parents are unknown but thought to be uh gdp or granddaddy purple crossed with black domina or black domina and i think both those strains uh accurately represent this at least the uh granite purple of course it's very similar to that granddaddy perp uh with effects as well as uh taste particular thc in this batch is 430 milligrams per half gram cartridge or 86 percent and uh 1.8 cbd in this particular batch i'm glad move actually put the uh stuff there on the package i know it's backwards but black mamba they're up top 430 milligrams 0.9 and that's it's half grams 1.8 but yeah you got your vape pure there this particular batch was harvested and packaged uh this was june 8th 2020. now that we got that out of the way guys let's go ahead and get another rip in before we get some more information and uh go ahead get that out of the way we got your blunts your bongs your joints your vape pens whatever you do to get it nice and right get nice and medicated with me let's go ahead and get this cheers everyone the particular blood structure of this strain is said to be very dark green hard dense buds with purple and dark green leaves uh sugar leaves on those i definitely agree with that i've never seen the buds of this particular strain but from what i i can taste in the pictures i've seen online i definitely agree with that according to leafly it helps patients with stress insomnia and pain definitely agree with the insomnia uh the couple times i have medicated on this i've only done it a couple so far but um very sleepy definitely had it definitely holds true to those uh og uh what's it called og uh what am i saying og gdp genetics there they say this strain had me feeling clear-headed mellow i would definitely say it's a nice indica to have a conversation on or uh listen to some great music you definitely enjoy it we're gonna go ahead and get another room here guys cheers make sure you check me out over there on instagram on that platform the weed funnies all one word uh

cerebral but that's mostly uh most pens but it's also the body high i'm definitely feeling here in my chest as well as melt it into this chair definitely it'll give me a nice nap or perhaps watch some uh some tv clutch up on some tv i don't know yet for fifty dollars can't beat it i like this a little better than that blueberry one i previously reviewed if you haven't checked out that blueberry cartridge review definitely go check that one out like just like this pure i believe i did that last week and for fifty dollars for the half gram here on that medical market that's not very not very bad competitive wise i should say for the price i mean i think the cheapest distance cartridge we have right now is either the 30 ones over there from one plant which i don't like or the 35 dollar ones pop azure cartridges over there from liberty health sciences i believe i believe those are the two cheapest but um yeah i think it's worth more to pay for those better terps as well as i think it's a little better quality distillate as well go ahead and get one more rip here cheers everyone i don't know if i said the smell and the taste on the strain um i would say it's sweet fruity and peppery in my opinion and that would be for the smell and the taste uh the taste the fruit in there i can't decide if it's citrus or grape in my opinion maybe a little bit of both but it reminds me of that granddaddy purple in uh no contest i would say i would whoever guessed that on the genetics i would say is pretty damn close i want to say this is named after that basketball basketball player kobe bryant that passed away i'm not sure though because they did call him black mamba don't quote me on that though this is a little bit stronger of a cartridge over there distance-wise 86 percent i'm liking that as well i think that last one i reviewed was i want to say 75 i'm not mistaken really good i've been enjoying this uh truly battery as well i've been only had to charge it a couple times i think i've charged it i wanna say twice now in the three weeks i've had it maybe four weeks the only thing i do hate about it is that magnet there on the bottom that metal piece is very strong with the mechanism there inside i think you can see that you gotta pull pretty hard i can't get a grip on it with my fingers i mean look how big that is i can't i can't get a grip on that i gotta use my shirt or some kind of cloth but besides that i like it all the same especially the little window here you can see how much product you have left it works out a lot you got just over just over half there all right in conclusion definitely enjoy this uh pure black mamba cartridge over there from move florida and uh definitely recommend it to indica lovers as well as people that enjoy i guess granddaddy purple you know or moved products moves dislike in general it definitely holds up to uh products and the consistency of uh what moves putting out over there go ahead and get one more rip here everyone and get out of your hair this is weed funny signing off spoke with me so good for your mama have a great rest of your day everyone cheers have a great day everyone sweet 27 now peace",

look kind of crazy it's because boys i literally just woke up i feel so tired right now i feel so bland i feel just so out of place right now that i need something to lift me up and what better to lift me up than a brand spanking new 1 000 milligram cartridge today we're actually going to be unboxing and also reviewing this cart if you guys do enjoy this video anyway anyhow please smack a like on it will be greatly appreciated if you guys are new please drop us up it's free it says that over like 40 of you guys aren't actually subbed so if you guys want a sub do that alright guys so initially looking at the box here um it's actually really nice i messed with it i like how it's kind of like a slide-off thing too it's kind of like the eureka car way back when my first freaking video if you guys actually want to see that video um i'll put a link to it in the description down below go check it out it's a pretty good video but there was kind of emotion when i did this and i kind of just you know just and now everyone who again had an orgasm you're welcome you guys probably won't even understand the reference but all right boys but this is how it comes in this how it looks this is what it comes in here comes in an entire box just you guys can see how legit it is then the flavor lineup on these cards goes as is wedding cake blueberry lemon haze forbidden fruit which is the one i have apple gelato that actually sounds freaking delicious peach kush jackfruit strawberry cough which is amazing if no one's ever had that watermelon bubblegum crush and dime oh gee but if you guys didn't hear me we're going to be trying some for a bit of fruit those were just some flavors that were listed on the back oh i like the way that came out pause you guys see that i really messed up the packaging they they really did go all out with this packaging i'm not even gonna catch all right boys so this is a thousand milligrams let's get into this all right boys so without further ado we're gonna be going back to the ooze pen i know quite a few people actually missed the ooze pen all right all right we're bringing them back okay we're bringing them back first head of the day that was freaking amazing pull of it was insane it was really pungent i tasted more of like a mangoey taste more than anything i tasted some apple watermelon i tasted the whole freaking fruit rainbow but mango was really a flavor that kind of stood up all right guys so compared to last car in last video this one is actually crushing me already like ever since i got this oil i haven't hit it more than four times at a time that's how freaking baked i've been getting off this dude that's like that's like the title that's like the title and thumbnail of this video literally if if the title isn't like something like a thousand milligram tank forbidden fruit review or something like that shoot me that has to be the title of this video but yeah boys this card tastes freaking amazing the cartridge itself it's um pulling really well there is no clogging there's no leakage um for as long as i've had it sitting here and it's pretty room temperature in here nothing's leaked it's been perfectly fine um it is an indigo if i didn't already say that um it's indigo dominant and if you guys want to go check them out i can't leave links to any of this but it's www.dime industries if you guys want to go check that out for everyone who actually watched last video i don't know if you guys haven't but if you guys haven't as over 147 views as i'm recording this video that is the fastest growing video i've had on this channel in like the longest time i think my most viewed video is at around 170 like if 30 people more just watch that video they're going to be surpassing that video in a week span compared to a video that was out for like an entire month and some change [Music] alright so for all the people who smoke um there's a big community of y'all who just really don't mess with carts and people who you know look at cards they look at that as like the cigarettes of marijuana they literally look at that as like the cigarette version of wheat like it

yeah see you guys on the next video peace yo [Music]", "ZTgKBViXyx0": "youtube what is up cushy here and we have the most expensive cartridges uh in pa medical right here uh hundred dollars apiece for these cartridges uh they're one gram um but we're gonna uh open them up and try them on see if they're worth a hundred dollars make sure you guys hit that like subscribe and hit that bell and make sure you uh if you want to legalize medical marijuana make sure you hit that subscribe button you guys rock here we go so this one here i already did open uh i've been smoking on it i love it it's a great great great great sativa rhythm is a great company uh there you go picture of the cartridge from rhythm nice liquid don't move at all straight uh nice thick thick stuff throw it on the battery here like so like i said i've been using this one a little bit so i mean it does have uh some out of it but then we have this one here this is the gelato from alera this one is also a hundred dollars but they even bling this one out for you it has a golden blinged out uh cartridge and i did take a couple hits it was full so i mean it was fuller than that but i just figured i'd do uh the most expensive cartridges uh video but oil looks good it's a little lighter than the other stuff and to be honest with you i always thought the lighter stuff was better but i'm starting to think the darker is better i don't know but yep let's give this guy a try we'll flip his camera around and uh try these babies out now this one here is what i don't like you need a big battery for uh you need either a push button battery with a big high voltage or something like this a yo can to make this thing hit to its uh proper proper capacity because it has these air holes in the cartridge that are kind of a pain in the butt but like i said if you get a big battery uh it's not even a problem all right screw this on all right we got both cards hooked up and ready to go all right we'll start with the rhythm here this is lost coast travel diesel 1 gram 86 it's like almost 87 thc boom rhythm great company great cartridges they're half grams or a little a lot of head space in them this one here was pretty full i was really happy with it uh this has been three days now four days i had this and it's still a good bit left so i mean i'm liking how long they last it's really good oh whoa has a great uh citrusy flavor instantly three seconds in you feel it very good cartridge is it worth a hundred dollars no but very good cartridge love the taste of that lost coast travel diesel okay round two a second hundred dollar cartridge this is a gelato from alera gelato and then we'll give you the boom again like i said you need a good push battery for one of these so we've got the yo cam plus here make sure she's on she's on and here we go gelato is my favorite strain another 100 cartridge right here uh here we go that thing rips oh that gelato man i like it i really like that gelato i bought the 0.5 for like 45 or whatever it was 50 bucks uh this one here i got it for fifty dollars it was on sale i got it on a discount so i wouldn't pay a hundred dollars for these cartridges at all they're i mean they're worth it they're one grams but sell them for 85. come on give us a deal uh we should be 60 but then we go here this is the hundred dollar one here and uh like i said this one here i paid 86 for after the deals so i really didn't pay the hundred dollars for them but i did pay for them uh i don't know if they're on sale at a good price i would buy another one but i can't spend 100 on a cartridge you guys rock like subscribe hit that bell love you hey them [ __ ] got me dumb litter", "HrDbe_WPuHc": "how's going YouTube this is outs coming at you for TV TV in the studio with a very special video for you today I'm super excited about this one we have the best oil pens and 510 threaded batteries of 2020 a lot of your experience will come down to your battery cartridge and oil all working together in harmony but the battery is the thing you have the most control over so choosing one or even multiple batteries that match your needs is the most important thing obviously the better the battery the better your experience will be with your cartridge and oil also because these batteries are relatively inexpensive and you might find yourself with multiple carts it's perfectly OK to own up more than one of them I personally have three that I cycle through if at any point you like this video throw us a thumbs up would you if you're gonna go scrubbing your way through it at least leave us a like before you bounce and if you'd like to pick up any of the batteries I talked about today links will be in the description below without further ado let's get into it sitting in our number one spot this year is the tronie inline of 510 batteries trone ian landed in the market with a splash releasing a handful of batteries all at once the line consists of three batteries the neutron hITRON and tau tron and an oil cartridge called the tron pod they also have a disposable battery which I'll touch on later what I like about Rhoni and batteries is that they've nailed the space between budget-friendly and performance with a device for every consumer their units are versatile and calibrated to work more effectively with a wide range of 510 cartridges and oils the patron is one of the cheapest and smallest offerings of the Tyrolean line along with a distinct pen shape it also has draw activation which works with any draw activated cart so make sure you check the instructions on your cartridge before choosing a battery the Piton battery is built sturdily and can handle any size 510 threaded car it has 350 ml amp hours of power which is impressive for a unit of this size and price point and I absolutely love that there is a USB charger on the bottom of the device it couldn't possibly be any easier to use just screw your cartridge on and inhale the neutron is another incredibly budget-friendly battery and just like the patron comes in at under $15 offering a very similar pen shape the neutron has a one button three voltage settings and a preheat function the on-board voltages are two point six three point three and 4.0 volts giving you a large range to work with that preheat function I touched on before does a great job of warming thicker oils and concentrates it is universally compatible and should be able to power most carts you throw at it five tabs will turn it on two will change between temperatures and three will activate that preheat function it is no larger than a literal pen and can be completely hidden by most hands for some stealth vaping at the top of their lineup is the Tao Tron the Tao John features a magnetic adapter for your carts that you can easily screw on to the base of your 510 threaded cartridge that will allow the cartridge to slip completely inside the housing protecting your car from damage the couch on has been designed to automatically detect the resistance of your cartridge and is calibrated to accept almost any viscosity of oil when fully charged it has a max voltage of 4.2 volts when you draw from the tower on there's a light that illuminates at the bottom of the device to show that power is being supplied to your cartridge the design is just super clean and I love the fact that they have cutouts to show your oil levels which is certainly a feature I prefer for my batteries there's nothing worse than taking a dry head it is draw activated and features a 380 million power battery that charges via USB and even for the top of their line the tower on is extremely budget-friendly I like everything about this device from the size to the power I love how small the tower on is it's shorter than other pens it's smaller than other mods it just works and that's why it's my number one choice I know a lot of your experience is gonna be down to buying prefilled cartridges but for those who like to fill their own cartridge Choa nyan has also released the Tron pod the Tron pods are perfectly calibrated from the tronie in line to offer maximum efficiency they also offer better wicking than most cartridges on the market meaning less time waiting and filling and less dry hits I've also been told some oil producers will be working with Tony and to get these Tron pods filled so keep an eye out for that lastly TRO nyan does offer their disposable vape pen the alphatron the alphatron is the solution for anyone looking for a disposable pen that also has a childproof lock it is designed for one-time use and is geared towards those who prefer to fill up their own cartridges the battery comes pre charged with enough juice to finish the attached Tron pod considering you get an empty cartridge and a battery for the price it's not bad at all the literal only issue I have with it is the spelling alpha with an F come on people as a Greek boy I cannot stand by and watch this travesty happen alpha is spelt with a pH okay droning sitting in our number-two spot this year we have the vessel battery if you are a classy as [ __ ] oh no sir with a need for the top of the top rugged devices look no further than the vessel it is a seriously gorgeous device that comes in a plethora of colors to suit your tastes there are three voltage settings on the vessel 2.8 3.2 and 3.6 bolts there is a notable difference between the voltage settings as well and the vessel can handle any cartridge with aplomb I've been using mine for a while now and I've never put a cartridge in that it could handle if you have a wider diameter cart you will have to forego the shield but it's super easy to take off the vessel is a 240 million power battery that you can get about a hundred rips on before it needs to be recharged it is slightly larger than your average oil pen but it's nothing to write home about as it still fits in any pocket or bag and the included cartridge protector can stave off most dents and scratches and keep your cartridge safe I really like the performance and look of this device it makes me feel super classy as I'm taking ribs in an alleyway on my way to the grocery store the price point is a bit high but if you want a top-of-the-line high performance device the vessel is the battery for you in the number three spot we have the tried and tested and true pocket one plus a great device with a lot of versatility the pocket oneplus has a wide cartridge area and can accept almost any cart you throw at it don't throw your carts at it and then blame me and please just don't do it don't it also works with top and bottom airflow cartridges which is pretty cool the pocket oneplus is another solid device that protects your carts from breaking it also has that magnetic adapter just like the tower on the and it has three temperature settings which is just the icing on the cake it runs up three point seven four point three and five point one volts if anyone cares I use the preheat function quite a bit yes it does have a pretty heat function another thing to love about the pocket oneplus the pocket oneplus has a 660 million hour battery that should last you a number of days even if you're a heavy user ok this is not a challenge don't come back to me and say I hit it 483 times in 30 minutes and the battery died that battery tops up in about 45 minutes which is also pretty great the oneplus is a great size and the button placement is spectacular I'm laughing because I might be the only person that cares about button placement but seriously it's great 5 clicks will turn it on to will change temperature 3 will activate that preheat function it's just simple to use just like the vessel the price point is a touch high but if you're willing to shell out a couple extra bucks you will certainly not be disappointed coming in at number four the C cell battery lineup has two great devices for use with your favorite oil the palm is a great budget-friendly device that is built really well it protects your cartridge and features a 500 million power battery simply screw the magnetic adapter onto your cartridge and slot it into the base the palm fits easily inside your hand great chest and is a great buddy for a night out the silo is the palms slightly bigger brother it keeps most of the same features we loved about the palm like that 500 milliamp hour battery and the fact that it protects your cart the silo fits into any pocket and you won't be worried about any damage to your cart because of that card protection I touched on earlier it also has the little newer slot so you can monitor the level of your oil in the cartridge there is no voltage control to speak up on either C cell device but for the price point I don't see that as a big drawback at all I personally find the silo to have a slightly better form factor and I just like the way it fits in my hand either way C cell batteries are built really well and a solid pick for any user the only thing I would note the narrower cartridge opening means they are not universally compatible but again a minor issue sitting in our number 5 spot the Lynx herm\u00e8s 3 is a solid pen this ultra slim slick device does a good job of pumping out clouds but where it really shines is flavor the ceramic atomizer does a good job of pulling the terpenes out of your oil it has three voltage settings to customize the flavor and the density of your clouds the atomizer doesn't leak and wicks really well this is a solid choice for anyone who sources their own oil and wants a refillable device complete with a tank as the atomizer is really good quality and can handle being refilled multiple times the kit itself comes with the pen the USB charger and the handy carrying case which is really typical of links and just gives you everything you need also typical is their consistency with build quality as the hermes 3 is a well-built device that features a 290 million power battery it's super easy to use five taps will turn it on three will change voltage settings and as long as your buddy Jon knows how to press a button and inhale at the same time you should be okay to pass this around at parties without having to explain to anything I'll leave the choice on whether or not to do so up to you and that's it for this one guys thank you so much for watching this video I hope I helped you even a little bit to choose the battery that will work best with your favorite oil if you enjoyed this video if you learned something please tap to have that like button if you really enjoyed it hit subscribe in that little Bell to stay up to date on all of our latest if you think I've missed anything if you have a differing opinion than me please throw it down in the comments below until next time my name is Alex for TV TV and for all you connoisseurs out there keep baby", "fSNDZ9HQnQk": "[Music] all right guys what's up simplistic here back with another video i'd like to mention that randy is filming this whole entire video on his camera so the video quality is going to be a lot better but if you didn't see from the b-roll all that good stuff i do have three buddies i mean you've already seen it but uh basically i bought a distillate one and a live resin one but the distillate has live resin terps and uh it is a form of live resin to me so for those of you who say it's not realized to me it is all right but uh one of these are actually ben's and we're gonna give him right here thank you but he's also gonna be in the video shout out to be legit also subscribe to rj eats and i'm saying the link will be in the bottom description below all that good stuff but for this video we have two batteries we have a stick battery from the chill and we have your typical box battery uh from the brand das vape so we're definitely gonna try both of these these are both sativas as well one's clementine one is train wreck and uh for those of you who want to see the differences this one the green one is actual live resin this one's distilled with live resin terps and as you can see this one has ten percent more terps or ten percent terps while this one only has uh four but what this lacks inter uh percentage they actually have a lot more not a lot more but more thc see as you can see right here total cannabinoids like 80 something this one's like 70. that's the difference between distillate and live resin live resins generally 70s maybe 80s if you're lucky with distillate being 80 to 90. so um i'm going to open these and uh i'm just going to take some hits i don't know i'm going to title this video maybe buddies live resin and distill it live resin terps i don't know what i would call it but something along those lines and uh just let me know in the comments how you liking this video quality you know what i'm saying i appreciate mandy for uh filming this whole episode with this stuff i don't say but right off the bat opening this smells very lemony i believe the prominent oh wait i thought it was there right so put that in you can see the color of this the color of this distillate with the live resin terps is generally going to be a lighter more green or yellowish color i mean it even says in the box right look at the colors compared to them the live resin right here is uh generally going to be darker but distill it with live resin terps gonna be a a yellowish greenish color yeah got it got it so yeah did you take the first hit well this is an action i don't know autofocus is pretty [ __ ] fire okay yeah standing still is a little harder but moving around like it's i'm wondering that's how it's gonna work with the app too because the aperture you can lower the aperture a lot further down on that on the 22 millimeter that i have yeah so this one's the captain kush this was what ben chose as you can see let's just mix them up and [ __ ] damn that's fine let me see oh [ __ ] yeah very good that one's a live resin on the right no these are both the distally with the live resin terms [Applause] but you'll see the difference sorry about that broke this box this is the [ __ ] that [ __ ] all right right here get that see you can see the colors oh yeah yeah the one in the middle yeah this one has 10 turfs these ones have four percent but these have a higher percentage in thc or cannabinoids so uh this one's yours before i forget and we're gonna just take it take a hit off all three i'm saying who's calling me cheers [Music] hello no gotta give one to the camera man um yeah i got it um it's auto focus yeah i'll do it for you oh [ __ ] that's dope go no wonder you're far back yeah i was like what the heck that bigger crop it's it's uh uh just randy oh my god it looks dope uh yeah damn you can feel this glance working when the it's shaking so we have to switch the spot real quick guys because the kitchen is being occupied but randy just took a hit off the train wreck cartridge how'd you like it it definitely hit right definitely hit yeah honestly you're paying 28 for a gram of this right yeah that's why i bought two more i mean uh this is like my third one that i bought of the white one because some i don't know why i i seem to like the distillate live resin turps better than the live resin one and i don't know if it's just me it's a lot cheaper too maybe that's uh it tastes good to me i don't know but ben hasn't taken a hit off this this is the clementine i mean trainer okay what's up alexis oh i still got a pretty good angle of it because i got in there in time i was still uh like last time i thought it would turn out i was like so no we got the live resin one of the clementine so if you're not awake all right so i'm gonna take a hit of this off this battery you guys know this battery hits okay oh this is a good shot holy [ __ ] this one's a lot smoother the the library is a lot smoother this one uh i feel like it hits a lot harder maybe that's what adds on to the harshness to it you get a fatter hit off the distillate one because maybe distillate is a thinner oil even though it's still thick it's a lot thinner i gotta get out the shot that was kind of weird there you go i love the cart whose was this one this is the the clementine with 10 turks one was wet last one was i need to try it again this one's good though i don't know i like the this this one tastes good though yeah it tastes more like natural yeah okay and then we're going to try tastes like actual dab now so since this is his he's going to try it first and it's going to be a winker cbs can you bring his calling no yeah [Laughter] this is actually ben's so when we went to authentic today i i came with the idea of buying a liquid live resin or a live resin one and a distance live resin turf one and then ben also came along and purchased one as well because he tries he tried my buddy's car before and he liked it you know and it's 28 you really can't beat that but yeah i'm gonna try this now um the total for all three of these was only 86.50 that's pretty good that's hella good usually that's like almost grabbing a half maybe that ground and 20 quarters i mean a quarter that 20 that 20 quarters [Music] and you can see his pores and [ __ ] oh [ __ ] dog though all right so [Music] so oh this one's a lip do you change the brightness yeah did you die it still look nice change it oh go hold on we got to fix that though no it's cool it's cool looks good it's not too bright no it's better now but the other one wasn't wasn't that bad it was still bright but you guys hear that joe rogan in the background you feed me that's the biggest [Music] all right so um uh all three you guys like the live rest one better uh probably the what was the first one that was the train wreck i like that one better yeah but the close that the second one is going to be the live resin one that's my birthday um but to end off the video guys i am going to take a hit off both at the same time and uh i don't know i'm going to title this video maybe somewhere along the lines blinking both buddies parts i don't know something like that um but yeah look at both legs clicking both buttons so cheers [Laughter] [Music] that's for you guys we're gonna end it off with uh randy taking a hit i'd like to thank you guys for uh watching the video and also randy for being a part of it and using his camera always also be legit for taking those blinkers even though he didn't want to and uh you know what i'm saying i can obviously i can really tell the difference between my camera and uh randy's camera with the the landsat oh [ __ ] you don't have to hold it in bro [Music] all right guys so as you can see it's about done so cameraman has been switched but we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video just another buddies cartridge video i've been buying them a lot lately because i really [ __ ] with that they're really affordable and high quality at the same time you know i'm saying i don't care for these 80 gram cartridges or fifty dollar half gram cartridges and i could care less for that but yeah other than that hopefully you enjoyed the video like it subscribe all that good stuff and see you guys [Music] you", "3ZgJBoZwj-A": "hey guys is dabbe connection and we are taking a look at the eureka vapor syringe and doing a review and i've been hitting on this for a little while this is actually the second one of these got two of these and about one and a half way through and let's take a look at the oil actually first so nice clear oil this is from colorado you can see a little eureka logo on there this is the ATF coming a 96 percent THC very strong very high I'm out actually tried some of this on the Hermes 3 and I tried it on seeso because I was actually I like to whenever doing a hardware review we like to do a comparison of kind of what the baseline is and a cartridge we're familiar with so see so we know it's kind of like the standard and let me compare to that so this oil very good if the 96% really mean anything not really because there's oils that have been in 80s that have been just as strong in fact I would say the AMA oils from Nevada are just as strong as this there's actually been a couple am am I've been been a little bit stronger but this is still awesome oil this is great it's really Rica and here's what it looks like all I'm saying is it seems like when stuff gets to the 80s and above I don't think that the THC helps that much more I mean I've I've had stuff that was 80% that has been better stuff that was 92% so that that's happened quite a bit actually but still whatever the percentages on this 96 it is strong it is good it tastes good and another thing I like about Eureka is it doesn't have that co2 II taste like some of the co2 cards might have like I think the the rhythm cartridge kinda had like a co2 much taste this they've gotten rid of the co2 is taste and it reminds me of w Bates because w of apes also has co2 oil but it doesn't have that co2 II kind of odd taste to it it tastes more like a distillate kind of thing so let's take a hit of it so you can see what it looks like I've been hitting on this battery it hits nice and yeah the oil stays consistent seems to vape pretty slow absolutely nothing to complain about it was 60 for a full gram which you know compared to Nevada prices that's a very good deal compared to Colorado prices it's probably about normal and compared to California prices may be a little bit expensive but overall Eureka ATF definitely we get it again I think it's a quality product and I can't wait to try more Eureka stuff definitely we'll probably just keep getting eureka stuff when I'm in Colorado so there's nab connection two thumbs up for eureka vapor atf syringe thanks for watching and have a great week", "ZQImEJ1zG9w": "[Music] yo yo what's up guys it's your boy savage back yet again with another review for you guys if you guys didn't know every Friday we try to come out with the banger card tree bu dropping is what is the hottest on the market right now what am i using you know what's poppin what's not and usually we try out some of the best stuff and sometimes we get really really unlucky and end up with some crappy cartridges but for today's video men this video has been a long awaited video I've had a lot of viewers telling me go try this you need to try them they're the best in the market and you know your boy after long time in the works we finally got it coming to you guys so tell you boys without further ado we are gonna be reviewing friendly farms true full spectrum live resin cartridges true full spectrum boys you guys heard that right so for those of you that don't know or have ever heard of friendly farms they're a company based out of them it's where is it somewhere somewhere in San Francisco I believe and they started off just I think they started off from what I believe when I first started following him they were making these sauces and they were popping off man you know that was big and then they switched over to UM cartridges they have dabba related applicators you know all that good stuff and they're just killing it man they're just killing it so after you know having my viewers tell me you guys a guy that I needed to try this I obviously went out hit him up and they were super super nice and generous meant to be like yes for sure ma'am you work together we kind of want you to try it out because they even themselves believe that this is some of the best stuff on the market so I was like kind of happy you know it's good working with the company that that is so friendly you know it's just in their name so what they did though this isn't just a normal you know here's our product give us a good review this guy was like here's our product men give give the gift that make the video and give the people a real review don't sugarcoat it know that stuffin you already know your boy ain't sugarcoating [ __ ] so we're gonna get into this man way to be reviewing some of the best stuff so before we get into this video though they dropped the one new product it's it's not new Prada just a different style and it is hold on hold on one of the worried is that we're gonna lose in truck so it is this one right here so this right here is their cured resin cartridges so basically going to offer their Instagram this is what this is what their cured car cured resident cartridges right so our fresh cured liquid is just like our liquid live except this oil is made from cured cannabis plants rather than freshly frozen as with all friendly forms product zero additives zero dis list so you guys know for sure you you're not you don't have to worry about vitamin E may you don't have to worry about all this fake BS stuff that can possibly get you harm and when when you guys are smoking distillate I just hope you guys know that that you you don't know what's going on because distillate they're adding they're adding additives or added preservatives all this stuff to try to make that oil you know vapor Bowl dude and these guys what they're doing is just straight-up squishing the plant just adding it to a cartridge and shipping it out to you guys and of course your lab testing and all that good stuff so you guys know that you guys are getting some of the top-notch quality like in the game right now that's for sure so without further ado man all that rambling I think it's time we get into the cartridge tasting right so busting out a new battery full unboxing for you guys man so these are their batteries right here the this battery right here has three different heat settings it has a low heat as a medium heat and as a high heat all right so taking it out boo you get your charger in there all that good stuff but I think this is my favorite part right so hopefully this is focused in for you guys and give it a little second but when you turn it on a little rainbow colors so badass right so like I said the three different color settings I'm not really going to get in it's every every battery has has variable wattage at this point but this specific battery is you know prioritized for their own cartridges they give you the best temps and it actually it's actually pretty amazing dude because instead of just having one temperature like most [ __ ] cartridge batteries they switch it up with three and every single eight all three of them is a super different here I'm not even joking you could get a very very subtle hit with the lowest one and then with the high hit you get like a massive dab so that's something that you know how is very very happy with and actually you know what this is the cured resin we're gonna hop I have not tried the cure guys and I have not tried the cured resident all and I have tried the liquid life but I think I'm gonna try a new flavor so this one right here is dude these guys are killing also with the collabs man they've been doing collabs with connecting cannabis and they'd have been doing cold eyes with alien lab so if you guys are fans of those companies already you guys should definitely try out these man because it's literally just the the connected and alien labs cannabis just squished up and put into these cartridges man like friendly farms is doing their thing bro killing the cartridge game so look at this look at this packing around me show you guys the packaging because I feel like not a lot of you know what it looks like so hopefully that's focused in and yeah dude so in the fact that got the lab test results all that good stuff on the on the top they got the manufacturing date all that goody-goody and let's go ahead pull this sucker and then all this way to grow I need to smoke so white to all that good stuff and boom the black tip cartridge so before I get into the actual cartridge I'm gonna show you guys what comes in the box so in the Box you get this little paper right here it pretty much tells you how to use it how to get started with using your cartridge all the good stuff of how it's made why does it my cartridge to look full because as you guys can see right here there's a little gap but it has a lot to do with these cartridges and you know the headspace that it gives you and so this is the most important thing this is the most important thing that's cotton atten before but I haven't really looked into it and I think I might tell you the truth man because this is something pretty amazing I haven't really seen a lot of companies do it it says for every gear for every grand purchase $1 goes to a homeless or youth program in your community and it says thank you thank you you know what man thank you for any farms for being so friendly miss you got to have more companies like them and people who care about the community other than just make it a quick buck and that's something that you know says a lot it says a lot from a company so enough with the BS talking does it get this get the chief and boys so this one right here is the animal style if you guys have ever had the animal style but from connected cannabis it actually looks pretty [ __ ] crazy slap it on there so it's on the green setting I didn't even use it on the green setting right so first look into the animal style friendly farms cartridge Braille collab so let's get it boys hopefully you guys are enjoying the content so far go ahead and leave a like comment subscribe all that good stuff man it helps you boy more than you think and if you guys haven't already man go check these go check this company out if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over you already know that the oh man some of the best of the best in the game cheers boys don't fail not sure why they didn't work all right I don't know what was wrong with the other battery but I think it was dead so we put it on a new battery he got it fully charged all the good stuff still on the green setting so let's go ahead and boys first in first try of this animal style so I'm actually pretty excited tell you guys to choose so let's get into oh my goodness oh my goodness well that was like a dad boys oh we did a good thing I need to take a big hit because not that was gonna kill me right immediately immediately off the bat boys the reviews coming in hot get ready so me off the first hit I haven't smoked at all I haven't done anything so I'm already getting a head change in my eyes are getting low I already feel it that's something that you instantly want from the cartridge you don't want to be having to puff and puff until you actually feel something so off of the initial rip your boy is gone no I'm not going but I don't want to say so that taste of that taste was like a really really really like medium to low temp dab just really really tasty in the oil and not even I'm not even talking about like do you know how when you taste distillate you can taste like the oil like this is this is like a good oil man this is like something you really want to tell you so see it's fire dude all right all right let's take another hit and get a full flavor profile see what the effects are going on then what is this I think this is a hybrid right all right this is a hybrid I'm hoping that it's a little bit more indica dominant than any you know animal style seems more like a sativa by the name mmm all right boys Cheers oh man that thing just opens up the pathways bill that literally the lung expansion is immediate and it's smooth it's so smooth like it's smooth but it makes you want to coughs just because you know your lungs are so full your lungs are so full with the greatness oh man in the excel it's just like a relief of stress but when you're exhaling it just like exhale you guys ever heard the term of inhale the good [ __ ] exhale the [ __ ] someone probably was chief in this and made up that quote because this is what it's doing and oh my gosh I'm just in awe dude this is amazing an amazing feeling it went from straight-up head to a full body in full head and I'm just in straight-up chill mode man after a long day of work man this is definitely something enjoyable something I look forward to chiefing on you know with most other cartridges I'm not gonna lie it's like it's there you know you have it you could just have bought it the other day but do you want to hit it probably not what this literally as soon as you can you you're gonna hit it row as soon as you get that a single opportunity to hit this bad boy you will I'm in complete love man there's these days we're gonna have to taste another one so this is a hybrid let's move on to the I think we're gonna move on to another hybrid well no wrong with the sativa so tan G tan G is one of the og strains in the game if you guys don't know the hand she's been around for a while I think oh you remember when I started in here nothing but I'll see what the city was there about usually cities are a lot more like pungent a lot more flavorful I've never tried a sativa in you know in live resin form or true full spectrum light resin form some let's see how that how that tastes us this one's a little bit more full to the oil bro the oil is so crazy looking you guys a little close-up of the oil real quick hopefully that's focused in ya know and I know a lot of people are gonna be like oh I'm turned off by the oil the oil why does it look so dark to like do just understand the concept of what um you know marijuana is a whole man when it comes to making these products like people think people have this you know this natural we're not even natural it's probably just been a rumor that's been going around that people are like oh that clear it is the better when in reality that's not the case at all you know there's rosin and stuff like that that are like white and clear but that's a whole different thing room this is this is literally full spectrum light resin in a cartridge bro and this is what you want this is what you want I'm telling you 100% coming from cybg himself this is what you want in a cartridge you don't want distally you don't want oil man all the other stuff that people are cheating right now is it has it's nothing close compared to this if you guys are able to get your hands on this 18 and over 21 and over whatever it isn't yearly will say if you can even get these just try it just try it so we're going in on the tangi sativa see if it's any any different than the hybrid I feel I'm already fated you I'm showing them but we're gonna do this for the tube cheers boys Oh oh my goodness that was unexpected that is good bro oh my gosh I've never tasted @anjghie that tasted this good like I've tasted tangi before but this is [ __ ] phenomenal whoa in full spectrum mode it's literally like a whole different experience man I'm not gonna tell you guys like you literally can't go out and try anything like this is for this friendly farms cartridge is like something I've never tasted before it doesn't taste like plug and play doesn't taste like city it doesn't taste like wrong guard and this thing is so distinct and so good and my lungs are just so happy because it's like so smooth too and just like it hits the hits in every single aspect bro like the smell the taste the smoothness the from the from the inhale to the exhale everything about this cartridge is phenomenal definitely great so I'm gonna turn it up there you see or think it's premium as a preheat function to on it so this is purple setting I'm not too sure if this is lower hot but what's going on the purple side oh yeah the big boy setting boys that's that put you to sleep sending holy moley yeah that's that punch you right in your face whoo that was a dad with I was phenomenal oh this thing is kidding I'm not even a fan of [ __ ] sativas but this is a hit tangey killed it all right so I guess we're gonna end out the video with where the hell is that I'm tripping all right the blue dream right here so this is the cured resin right this is going to be their newest addition and their newest them yeah their newest addition to the lineup so this is um the cured resin instead of the librarian yeah the liquid live I mean right so right off the bat this is their that then this is their new um cartridge within you well it's the same tip and everything but it's just actually I think it is an encourage holy yeah definitely upgraded well I think it's the same one looks like the same one just a new tip they added a little I mean yeah let me show you guys let me get a little closer yeah so it has a new there this is our logo up here up on the top and the bottom if you I don't know if you guys can repo not because they're reflection but it says friendly farms and the oil and in terms of quality of the oil it honestly comparing your right right away it looks very very similar to their liquid life except this one the liquid live looks does look a little bit more thicker in terms yeah definitely their liquid live looks a little bit more thicker a little bit more um definitely something you would see from a squish plan this one this would like a fresh frozen pie if you guys I've ever seen different types of planets getting squished are like if you guys are into that stuff I know it's kind of weird for me to say this but you guys should definitely go google that in terms of how different types of libraries and suffer made and you guys would really get a really Indian detailed look of how how things look of how things can taste of their their flavor profiles you know their aspects of what what they bring to the charts in terms of TC percentage to body lock you know all that good stuff so I mean get right into it I'm gone I'm faded so cured resin coming in hot boys this is the blue green by the way that blue dream a blue dream when I saw that name it was kind of like you brought me back to like I don't know why Blue Dream has just been one of those things that you know one of those strains that have been around for a while even like I feel like I heard about that straight in like junior high so I'm gonna lie though this new cartridge with the logo on top is it definitely some swag hopefully that's what you're saying alright so cheers boys cured resin let's see if it tastes any different Yushu show you guys a whole difference right I always think that can be able to tell too much about the high I might save this cartridge after hitting this and make you maybe make a full review we'll see about that but cheers boys was gonna do it hmmm I honestly can't even tell the difference in terms of taste it tastes pretty good obviously I can tell the the flavor the length of strain flavor but in terms of like you know when you get a cartridge like even if it's different flavors you still get the same that same little taste like because it's the brand taste you know it's what makes the brand the brand so finally formants did a good job so if you guys want to know like pretty much the Cure they made the cured resin lion just in terms to appeal to more of the consumer base because people I guess were saying that it wasn't too budget-friendly their liquid live and honestly like you know and what I personally have to say if you're going to be doing you know consuming all these cartridges all these all these things you're gonna have to spend the bulk and if you're willing if you want to get some of the best stuff this is a right here man this is it like you you should go out and definitely get this because this is designer weight men you know this is that good stuff this is that good [ __ ] and they made this when the cured resin - like I said appeal to them to people with the lower budget you know people who only want to spend like I'm guessing like thirty thirty-five bucks on a cartridges instead of spending for like 45 so whatever the case is and honestly it's amazing like friendly farms is definitely doing their thing they're killing the game man if you guys are interested their Instagram is gonna be linked down below and you guys can go check out their product they've won multiple awards man definitely I can see why now I'm glad I got to test this out if you guys want to see some of their dab stuff you know these are their DAB sauces and we also got the the applicator we can definitely do something like that if you guys want to see some crazy ass challenge videos man like hitting for friendly farms at once or something like some something crazy man let me know in the comments below what you guys have as an idea and we'll probably do it so yeah get in the video I hear if you guys enjoyed it like I said leave a like comment and they", "eDn3wTnbsE8": "how's everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we've got a much requested one for you today so do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it well this also applies if you happen to purchase one of these questionable cartridges and it fails how do you remove the mouthpiece to extract the oil I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail 1 mil or 1 gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges that being said let's take this to the deck ok well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sail brand that is a batch code on the bottom alright this is another one this one here does not state sea sell across the bottom but on the base it does say sea sell m07 9 this is also a Jupiter distributed cartridge so the first things first we're going to take a pair of vice grips common write scripts and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this collar right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged that one was a little bit difficult I'll apply it to this just to stand it up and they'll have a go at one of these other ones all right I will show you again on this one here I said this is a C cell you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it alright now I'm gonna apply this cartridge to this battery just for a stable base and I'm going to open up this gelato right here and warm it up to dispense it into this cartridge okay now here is the cartridge we are going to refill all right here is the mouthpiece for the cartridge perfectly fine a couple of scratches on but that shouldn't affect it in the least here's the distillate we will be applying to it I have warmed this up substantially just to ensure that it does flow rather well into the system you simply place the applicator tip on the syringe twisting it to ensure that it has a good seal you put the syringe tip down into the cartridge and then just begin to apply the fluid all right there you have it as you can see the original line of the older oil right there at the bottom of the new oil coming down to meet it okay take that off the bottom there and see it's sinking down there very nice we didn't get a protective silicon cap for these threads right here apply it to the threads take the mouthpiece that came off of the cartridge put it over the top and it will it will not go on all the way that's a good thing that means that the seal still works it will not go on at this point you want to take a precision device and apply pressure now as you do that you will see this seal disappears and there you have it let's take this back up top and see how she does all right and here we are back on top with the csail refill that we have here now as you can see the oil has got down to the coil has mixed with that heather oil bubbles are rising to the top let's take this protective cover off the bottom of this hook it up to a battery let's see what we got shall we well there you have it that's working like a champ looking that of oil through there I can get that a little bit of gelato flavor from that distillate that I put in there it's very nice well there you have it that is how you can remove and refill one of these cartridges to extract the oil from it what you're going to want is a slightly longer blunt syringe tip and I have a few of those a slightly longer blunt syringe tip such as this one right here as you can see how long that is that would definitely get all the way down to the base of that and you would be able to extract any additional oil that happens to be in a cartridge where this this cell has failed this one no it's not failing all it's working great well thank you so much for tuning in this has been John with TMZ connoisseurs you be sure to remember to subscribe and give this a thumbs up if you liked it and tune in to some of our other videos to see if you like those as well thank you so much this has been great you have a nice day peace", "qGjvbtb-XO0": "well Aloha brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel I'm so excited to have all you cannabis connoisseurs and enthusiasts with me today I have a classic strain in vape cartridge form for you today pineapple express baby coming at you from the good people a good supply this is a THC heavy vape cartridge coming in at seven hundred sixty four point one milligrams of THC less than five percent milligrams CBD today about seventy six percent THC in less than a percent CBD so as I said heavy-hitting hybrid THC cartridge coming at you from good supply I'm very excited to try this out pineapple Express is one of my favorite strains of all time probably one of yours too it's classic its legendary they make goddamn movie out of this thing one of my favorite movies probably one of your students hilarious I was very excited to see this in my own cannabis shop even more excited when I found out this thing's going for 40 bucks 40 bucks for a 0.5 gram 510 thread vape cartridge that's the best I've seen in the Canadian market personally so far so I snapped it up right away very excited to check you know he's gonna show you here on the side of the package I'll hold it up for the camera hopefully it doesn't bore but it does let me know what is let me let you know what it says it says our oil what's inside cannabis distillate plant-based terpenes no additives our product the cartridge premium ceramic or anti leaked technology direct airflow system you know I appreciate this kind of information being put on the package I like to know that it's plant-based terpenes not artificial I like to know that it's cannabis dislike to know what's in the cartoon you know more information is not a bad thing I would like to see some other companies follow suit on this good job good supply I like that so without further ado I'm gonna break the seal on this bad boy and figure out how to open it again you know it is some kind of heavy little feels thick cardboard packaging here feels a little wasteful but yeah it's a Canadian market let's open it looks like you pinch the sides and push yeah there we go so here comes the reveal for y'all and there we have it um it's nice-looking let's rescue it from this package yes some heavy thick heavy-duty cardboard packaging for a little item this has got to change um yeah this is a nice-looking cartridge let me hold it up for you all there oh it's got a nice metallic finish on it silver I see a THC logo there I know as it said pineapple Express on that green band and good supply I think at the bottom hopefully that's not blurry for you more importantly though I know it looks great check it out that oil is nice and clear it's a good color hopefully it's coming through clear for you because it looks clear and good that looks smokeable I'm excited that mouthpiece condom and rubber nub oh look we dropped it and yeah it's a nice looking cartridge let's get it on the old standard 510 battery here and the excitement grows as intensifies as we screw it on I'm really looking forward to this everybody I talk know it's tasty hmm yeah that's pretty good you know his little plug there but first John just came out of the package tastes really good kind of a citrusy sweet taste on the intake there and kind of held up on the way out mixed with a little bit of a herbalist herbally kind of taste there kind of herbal and citrusy sweet wouldn't necessarily say pineapple but let's check it out again yeah it's yummy man yep so sweet citrusy taste he definitely tastes that on when they first take a drink and then the exhale it definitely holds up and yeah it's kind of horrible I like it kind of tastes like smoking flower you know it's not too bad it's a good taste in the vape cartridge you know a little distracted here because I've noticed you know this is only 1/2 fault here it's kind of a big cartridge it's dawning on me here that this must be a 1 gram cartridge because it's a point 5 gram you know this lid in there they must be making one gram cartridges in the future that got me excited so yeah breaking news one gram cartridge is coming up looks like from a good supply but you know back to the flavor back to the taste this is pretty good to get a pretty good vapor I see it's not harsh pretty smooth yeah very good vapor production and yeah that's a good flavor I'm really good to enjoy vaping this over the next couple days and as always come back but you know what I think then all right so the final verdict on the old pineapple express some good supply here you know I've been vaping the hell out of this thing the last four days I've run a readout and tell you what I like he didn't like about it I liked a lot about it to be honest favorite thing about it was a taste flavor was great out of this world spine Apple Express baby from the first drag to the last flavor holds up never waned and never weak really good really strong you nailed a good supply you did a good job I can't always say that about all cartridges the flavor held up throughout the whole thing we really get and the flavor that was there really loved it I'm big fat it's pineapple Express it's great you're gonna love the taste the effects really nice effects you know it's a little milder than you might think at a 76 percent THC level so it's not a super heavy hitter you're not gonna get blitzed big stoned out of your mind but it's a good all day strain it's a great way can be extreme it's a sociable strain very conversational motivate you get through your day really happy up with the kind of feeling throughout your day that's a good strain you know what I mean I love it it's a good strain of having a pandemic you got to keep your chin up your spirits up there's a little tank of getting your spirits up that's for sure so you know I really enjoyed it's a little milder than some people might like but I thought it was great really good all day straight it's a hybrid strain I find it to be a lot more sativa meaning like I say it's all day long stream it's not going to let you know you're not gonna feel really tired it's not gonna burn you out really good strain three four hits on this thing lasts about an hour hour and a half before you kind of feel like you might want to have another pull fantastic good job good supply I really enjoyed it only downer to this thing oh you know another thing I really like is I like the look of this I mean look at that it's just nice right it's really shiny really metallic nice look I'm a sucker for a good look looks good but let's get into the only negative I have here well I got one small negative this little green band that you got down here kind of blocks how much oil you got left in the cartridge that's a bit of a bombing event it's alright it's not that big a deal the biggest deal that I have with this is it doesn't seem to last too long it's four days later in a mountain you know what I'm saying I mean like I noticed it moved around real easily in there it's kind of a thinner oil and a thinner oil is gonna vape alittle bit quicker so might want to take that into consideration with your value proposition with you know hey it's 40 bucks 4.5 grand cartridge but it doesn't seem to last that long I don't know personally I still recommend it it's alright I mean you know I was vaping it a lot you know not as much as I have other ones that have lasted longer but you know your mileage may vary out there as always but for what you get I recommend it I'd buy it again if I saw it in a store I'd buy it again I really liked it really impressed I enjoy the price enjoy the effects enjoy the taste I enjoy

see them so till next time I hope you're all taking staying safe taking care of each other and above all everyone keeps smoking", "F1Gj0gPR_Lk": "hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day today we're gonna be answering some questions that you sent to us through YouTube or Instagram and yeah everybody's gonna be anonymous for privacy purposes so here we go question number one new to vaping what factor does voltage play in to vaping amazing question first of all I would say in order to understand voltage you need to understand mas casa t so viscosity is just the thinness or the thickness of your oils so if you have a thick oil which basically you can tell by flipping over your cartridge upside down and if it doesn't move or takes forever in a day to move you have a thick oil if it takes like five seconds probably a medium and then if it's almost instantly you got a you got a thin oil so thinner oils would need a lower voltage and thicker oils would need a higher voltage if you vape thin oils on a higher voltage you run the risk of burning the oil itself and if you vape thicker oils at low temperatures it might not heat up all of the oil in and you might not get the draw that you're looking for also cartridges play a factor into this sometimes because of the air hole but that's a whole nother video I'll link I'll put a link to it like right around here somewhere so you want to make sure that you get the full inhalation of your draw and you also want to make sure that you're not burning your oils either alright question number two can I refill my cartridge with new oils absolutely I would say don't do it more than twice otherwise you run the risk of clogging old oils might get stuck in there and so don't burn your new oils correctly you might lose flavor taste vapor production it could leak you know because it's just over time I mean you know you want to change the oil in your car and with this it's just like this is you're actually inhaling it and this is going in your body so you want the best quality of you know oil that you can find plus if you're like a flavor chaser and you know somebody who likes to try and taste different strains you know it's best if you change your oils you know once maybe twice and then dispose of them because they're they're not meant to last forever next question says do these work with normal vape liquids no no they don't uh vape liquid is too thin it'll drip out it'll leak out into the battery you know that you'll have connectivity problems if you do that I wouldn't put a juice in it odds these aren't meant for a juice how do I put a juice into my ex5 cartridge so again not free juice but all the cartridges that we sell they're all top fill so you unscrew the top cap or if it's plastic and it has a plug you just fill down the plug if it's a ceramic mouthpiece just take the mouthpiece off fill it around the heating tube because the heating tube is gonna or the heating post is gonna be directly down the center there's gonna be a hole down there where you can look straight down through it that's where the air flow comes from do not put anything in there what you want to do is have the oil drip around that post touching the glass and and being on the inside of the glass you want to be able to see the oil rise up you don't want if you put it through that post you're not gonna be able to see anything it's just gonna leak straight down into your battery and the ex5 cartridge is as a top fill you just remove it I believe the heating post is actually connected to the mouthpiece so you just squeeze it on in there it's it it's it's a dope it's a dope cartridge you can control the air flow through it - it's pretty hardcore um next question how long do I inhale while holding the button so the button will usually just hold for a good 10 to 15 seconds and you uh you can't you can't hold it for for more than that but usually as soon as you put the cartridge you know to inhale you're gonna hold the button down and then let go when you're done and just you know it won't last more than 15 seconds and then the really the rest is just up to you how long do I have to charge the battery for it does the pen light have to flash or the battery and the charger have to stay green so I know it's full it really depends on the unit you have and for the most part for the most part pins that have adapted connectors or you plug you plug them into the 510 threading you plug that into a computer it's gonna light red and hold red and then it will transition into green and hold green if it's something like this sometimes they'll flash 20 times I know the snap flash is 20 20 times and this one it flashes eight times and then it goes blank um you know just read the instructions I would say so to answer your first question how long do you charge the battery I would say no more than two hours you know some even less than an hour depending you got to watch them and get to know it you know it's something that you're gonna be carrying around in your pocket with you all day every day you know so it's good to know like what what you have on your body but usually what I would do is when I first get it use it up let it die twice charge it for two hours and then never past one hour again alright and can you use it while charging he was talking about the wolf duo no you cannot you cannot use it while it's charging it's not it doesn't have a bypass on it but this one does this is the wolf uni you can charge it or yeah you can't vape it while you're charging it next question hey I just got a new cartridge and whenever I put it in my uni just flashes but when I put in another cartridge it works fine what should I do the best method is basically what you did you know you tried another cartridge inside of the battery and it works so you ruled out that the battery was fine it was just the cartridge that I was having an issue the cool thing about all vaporizers is that they'll try to talk to you they'll try to okay with you if it's something internal with the cartridge it'll probably read as a misfire which will flash three times if it's something as simple as like the cartridge is fine the battery is fine maybe there's a magnet involved it's just not getting a connective touch to it it just can't read the cartridge it'll flash five times just an error like that it could be something like with the magnets you know the magnet might not be screwed into the proper length so sometimes maybe you want to back off the magnet a little bit from the from the cartridge itself back it off put it back in and see if that works so right now it's telling me one two three four five that means I cannot it cannot read the cartridge there's nothing wrong with the cartridge nothing wrong with the vapin but five times tells me that it's just not connecting to the battery so when I screw it back on I put it back in I'm able to get some draws try different cartridges different batteries different batteries and different cartridges kind of rule them out rule out problems if they indicate if you don't understand what the indicator is trying to tell you other than that I would say you know give customer service a call I'm sure we can take care of it for you that'll do it for today guys hope that was helpful let us know if you want to see more of these send in your questions I want to know I want to answer them but yet peace", "3-YwEauc_nE": "- what we have swag Terps here today they give us a whole kit there's a blueberry and on flavor we're gonna go at the non-flavored and the

to you by New York vape shop you can find all the devices that were using in the demonstration today at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with the code rough 3 first we're going to take it look at the anatomy of a 5-10 cartridge first I want to talk about the tip and the tips are pretty much a up to you like however you decide which is your preference is they come in all types of metal they're come in ceramic and they come in wood so the tips are pretty much straightforward next we're going to talk about the tanks the tanks themselves are what holds the oil and they're usually half a milliliter to one milliliter and sometimes the really big ones like the two gram or 2.2 gram heavy hitter cartridges can be really long but referring to the tank is the actual part of the cartridge where the oil is inside of it the two part and then there's the oil inlet and sometimes they come in various whole sizes you can see the one at the top there has a little bit larger hole size than the cartridge there at the bottom and generally for the thicker THC oils you probably want more of a thicker hole then there's the airflow if you can see at the very very bottom this is a bottom airflow and you can see that the airflow hole is right there in the threads at the bottom of the device other devices sometimes have them at the top near the tip and so generally one is either a bottom airflow in most cases sometimes a top airflow and then there's also what they call a variable airflow and you say the case here the airflow is adjustable at the top there so that's the one one thing to consider as well as part of your cartridge and the last and perhaps the most crucial part that we're going to talk about there's here at the base and that is the atomizer and the atomizers are usually either wick or ceramic and the wick they're okay but preferably you probably want to use ceramic today's you get a lot better even distribution better flavor and you see the ceramic heats the oil as it passes through now let's talk about best practices one of the most important things when it comes to using your 510 cartridges with a pin is to use the right voltage setting and you can see generally if it's a variable voltage for these kinds of pins that will vary somewhere between three and five volts and that's the appropriate range for most 510 cartridges but if you're using something like a box mod like the steam cloud that you see here that goes up to sixty watts it's going to be way too much so you're going to want to bring that down to like five watts or to the lower settings and to make sure that you're using the proper voltage or wattage another thing that you want to make sure is that using the proper airflow type you can see this is a bottom airflow device but used on this box mod if you pull it all the way in there there's no air inlet and so for this is the type that you'll need a top airflow so there are types of devices that may not be compatible with certain types of cartridges so that is one thing you want to make sure that for instance of this case you'd want to use a top airflow device and a variable and would be even better and you can see here - this is a bottom airflow and on the bottom airflow there will be a little bitty notch where the air would be allowed to flow through at the bottom of the device so you just want to make sure that you're using the right kind with the right type of device another thing is that when it comes to your empty device you probably just want to throw it and not throw it away but you want to refill it and not just keep hitting it because you're going to burn it out so when you get done with it either go ahead and toss it it's done or stop hitting it until you're ready to refill it or you're going to burn it out another thing is when you're putting in your pocket you really want to be careful with the tips especially with the ones that have an exposed tip and rather than sitting down into a sleeve because if you leave it in your pocket you can do something like this a lot of times it'll bend the tip over one way or the other can expose the electronics and cause you some problems so if you're going to be putting it in your pocket you might want to go with a device such as this where the cartridge sits down inside of it like a sleeve and the last tip we're going to go with here is to make sure that you keep your battery charged or keep a backup battery so if you have a nice pin that you like to use you might want to keep a little cheap on the side that you can have always kind of have as a backup by your charge in the other and that pretty much brings me to the end of my tips and best practices on using your 510 cartridges with your vaporizer batteries if you'd like to learn

them to work and then when I came back from work I would always have leaky batteries leaky cartridges and that was really before I looked into proper maintenance of my oil cartridges so today I wanted to share a few tips I've learned along the way that I'll help you get the most out of your oil cartridge oil cartridges are great great for my producing they preserve your contents for a lot longer like most devices it's the small things that go a long way save you time save you money frustration but you don't want to take advantage of this by refilling new oils in the same oil cartridge do not fill your cartridge more than twice why is this bad to do well if you keep refilling the same cartridge over and over again it can cause leaking clogging lots of paper production thick oils will begin to harden on the wick and you won't be able to vape new oils properly stuck in an endless loop pulsing for good drawls and there's a special circular inhale for things like that especially you'll burn the cotton and the oils and once that happens even the best tasting oils they won't be able to mask it I like to think of it like oil in a car you wouldn't want to change your oil too often without changing your filter and the cotton inside of your atomizer is like the filter in your car you can go and get new oil but without changing the filter you never really have clean oil don't do what I did and leave your cartridges inside of your car or any hot place for that matter I know it might be convenient but for most you out there a good rule of thumb is heat bad cold good high temperatures can not only degrade the oil taste and potency but it can cause leaking the best places to store your oil vapes are cool dry dark places like a desk drawer or a refrigerator put the rubber plug back onto the bottom of the cartridge and start it ideally in a dark place around 70 degrees Fahrenheit or less but don't go too far to the extreme to the other side when stored in the freezer because that can create moisture inside of the cartridge so avoid heat and avoid freezers but now when you take your cartridge out of the fridge the oils gonna be thick and all thick oils need to be primed first priming your new oil cartridge is going to make the difference between the first hit being smooth and magical or dry and burn the nasty teetsi oil is thick so you need to give it some time to soak into the atomizer here's how to do it make sure your oils are at room temperature if they're fresh out of the fridge pull the cartridge in between your palms for about two to three minutes to warm it up if you're loading an empty cartridge only fill it with a small amount so if you run into problems you don't waste all your oil take about five polls on the cartridge without the battery being attached what you're doing is simulating vaping and pulling a little oil from the atomizer then attach the cartridge to the battery and give it a try I recommend pulsing the battery here it's the best way to ensure that you're not burning your oils if it's still too cold go back and warm it up and then try it again so there you have it guys those are the main ways to get the most out of your oil cartridge dont refill it more than twice always prime your new coils and always keep them in a cool dark place to prevent it from leaking on you keep in mind that not all cartridges have wigs some only come with ceramic or glass cores it's your responsibility to know what you're buying it's always smart to clean the bottom of the cartridge before storing it with cotton swabs or alcohol wipes that way when you take the rubber cap back off you can see if it's leaked hopefully these tips helped you guys where do you personally store your cartridges if you have any other questions leave them

show you I've never had one of these before it's a rosin cartridge what is going on you guys my name is Jeff also known as popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe I got a lot of lip videos on the way like today I'm gonna be showing you when I picked up from silver stem cannabis in my last video if you missed that video I got to tour their entire dispensary bring you guys with me show you what it's actually like inside of there it's [ __ ] sick make sure you check out that video a link to it will be in the description but right now I'm going to show you guys what I actually bought and what it looks like because there's some fire ass products there when you buy weed legally it comes with a receipt I spent two hundred and seventy seven dollars it would have been two twenty before tax but there's some hefty taxes in Colorado but it's worth it because hey I can [ __ ] buy the [ __ ] in the store I don't need to have a plug I don't need to fly with my own it's nice just being able to go into a store and pick out some [ __ ] and even with the tax it's so much cheaper than it is in Pennsylvania like you don't pay taxes when you buy weed in Pennsylvania but the growers and the processors and the stores are definitely paying a lot in taxes and that goes down to you so you might not pay a tax but you're being taxed alright let's start with these I picked up these little tablets just cuz I've never seen these before they're called pressies they have desired effects on them like sleep energy focus they only have like five or ten milligrams of THC in them so they're not very potent but they come with some other stuff that are supposed to actually help increase the desired effects that are labeled on the package I try out the focus ones just see what it's like it's literally like a little tablet and says a little THC mark on it's pretty cool I know if you're supposed to chew it or pop it I'm really glad I read that it says right on the bottom swallow don't you alright guys I'll see if that 10 miligrams does anything to me but I'm gonna be smoking a lot on top of it so I probably won't even really feel it you know I get high as [ __ ] all day and I get distracted so much stuff this could actually like help me focus real a little like that'd be kind of cool now let's get to the live rosin you guys picked up some olio I picked up the strain tropic sunset its a mix between slur Akane number 4 and papaya punch number 3 I didn't even smell it honestly like the name just sold me if you watched the video yesterday though you saw him open up a package of oleo they have such beautiful packaging man it's really [ __ ] cool they definitely take the extra step to make sure there's a great presentation with the product and the products really good so you really can't go wrong with them and just like the homie said it comes a little dab tool I didn't let it sit flat last night so you can see a little bit dripped onto the side but that's not the end of the world oh my god you guys this [ __ ] looks so good I was sure you're gonna close up for this if you guys can see that like it's just a beautiful yellow has a very nice consistency to it it's like a liquidy sugar and that's what's so cool about rosin man there's so many different consistencies that it ends up being just loaded up the puff coke peak I hope you guys are smoking with me let me know in the comments what you guys are smoking on every go you guys man I just like flew away and went to heaven that tastes so good [Music] my god you guys even when I look on this you guys truly [ __ ] beautiful job if you guys are ever in Colorado pick up some holy Arase Jim I really like this dispensary you guys they have some top-shelf concentrates there flowers amazing that's what I'm about to show you next but just like with over 300 dispensaries in Denver it's hard to find like all the good ones so as soon as you find one that has like great prices and great products like I just wanted to keep going to it damn I picked up two strains I picked up at indica and sativa flower this is the mimosa this is one of my favorite sativa strains I love smoking joints in mimosa if you've had mimosa before you already know but if you haven't you got to try it man it's some great [ __ ] weed and this is a shame that the budtender sold Deon he was very helpful this [ __ ] like I usually don't for whatever reason strains that have the word silver in it I don't like I don't even not like them I just like tend to just like not look at it because I'm like in my head I'm like gold is the best of silver my aunt but this is called silver OG and like I don't know if we get much better than this like it is a heavy indica it is like that deep green with like bright white trichome still so it looks like it has like snow on it this little it looks like the Tegrity farms Christmas snow weed and like if that was true that would be very concerning I don't know how good the shots do it for the weed but oh my god you guys it is a fire I honestly think I'm gonna go back to silver stuff before I go home and get some more flour because they had some great strains out there I just started with one indica and one sativa preheating the peak right now cheers you guys that was a nice reheat what I really like about the earrings is you can put a decent amount of wax in there and like if you take a big dab it's not all wasted like you can just reheat it and keep smoking it but this you guys is what I'm most excited to show you I've never had one of these before it's a rosin cartridge I paid too much money for this but I had to do it I said I wanted to try some cool cartridges while I was out here and I mean it happened this is from olio I don't want to skip over how great their packaging is they do such a good job on it that I feel like it deserves a little second I love you can kind of tell it has a little bit more of a foggy hue to it than a normal cartridge it's really cool how it says the strain on it too because sometimes you forget what strain you're smoking or if you have a lot of cartridges you can get them confused again using my cloud products rio+ different color but I just love these batteries they're one of my favorites cheers you guys wow that is one of the best AC cartridges I've ever had it's papaya punch that's gonna taste [ __ ] awesome but if being rosin versus actual distillate holy [ __ ] and like I can feel it like I'm getting really high off this like I can feel it on the face in the eyes this is not your normal cartridge this is crazy holy [ __ ] this is like one hit and you're high and it literally tastes like a rosin dab this isn't saying you guys the future man they can work on the price a little bit it would be way more feasible but what a great experience like I'm [ __ ] ripped I am so happy I got this this is the last thing we got through the liquid live resin cartridge I picked it off the name and the package honestly the [ __ ] is really cool and having a garlicy cartridge I've never had that before and it sounds pretty interesting chum the company Green Dot it's a [ __ ] [ __ ] to open here's the inside packaging cartridge is sitting on the side to push right through here to get the cartridge out then it gives you the stats on the back just peel here and don't use this if you're pregnant okay that this cartridge has a little adjustable air flow filter I don't really like these what it does is give you either more or less airflow I'd rather you just like tell me what's good and stick to it I'm gonna try minimal air flow and see how that goes Devlin gives you a hard hat doesn't Asus goes the rosin cart but still a good tasting cartridge well it's actually like kind of bad to the place garlicky it's not like sweet like that's why I prefer but it's like a very dank weed eat aced it's very heavy on the garlic I'll tell you that it's not even really a GMO taste it's definitely just more straight garlic it's a garlic explosion definitely prefer the rosin cart over this I'm going back to the rosin cart I need something with a better taste [Music] much better I think that's what we're gonna wrap the video you guys super pumped to try this for the first time way too expensive but definitely a cool experience that is so amazing this is probably the coolest thing I picked up in my opinion click like if you enjoyed the video let me know what you thought the coolest thing I got was subscribe for more videos I appreciate you watching my name is Jeff beaks", "uv2qrTaKd3o": "hi it's mattad Rafal studios and welcome to our review of the heavy hitters prefilled cannabis concentrate vaporizer pens [Music] we're going to be reviewing three different products from heavy hitters today we're gonna be reviewing the 2.2 gram cartridge the one gram cartridge and we're also going to be reviewing the actual vaporizer battery pen itself so let's go ahead and unbox these things and see what we have here first off is do we have the actual vaporizer pen and this is the pen that's actually provided by heavy hitters that you can purchase that's branded by heavy hitters it includes a little USB charger plug as well as the pen itself and that's a 5-10 thread pin okay and now we're gonna unbox the 1 gram cartridge this is an OG Kush cartridge which is a hybrid but it's in indica dominant and that's the one gram cartridge and now we're gonna unbox the 2.2 gram cartridge this is the ha static cartridge and this is a new flavor it's the blue dream ok so now let's take a closer look at these individual items first we're going to look at the battery itself now the heavy-hitters battery that is available through heavy hitters and which is recommended for the device is just the right wattage at 4 watts it also has no buttons or anything on it the only thing that you can see is the logo on the side for heavy hitters and then the 510 threaded end that actually plugs into the USB charger that's the simple kind of USB charger that plugs directly into USB and you could charge that with other kind of chargers as well ok now we're going to look at the 1 gram pen and this is the cartridge pin for the 1 gram that's the og cush I'm a big AG fan so I'm really looking forward to trying this out in a minute and it's really simple it's just a one piece I know there was a little rubber cap that goes over the 510 thread there on one end but you just could discard the little rubber cap and then you see it's just a simple cartridge that threads directly onto the pin and these are sort of low wattage it's a 3.7 watts recommend it there so you could try these on other pins but you wouldn't want to try these on a modern of high wattage device okay now we're going to take a closer look at the big 2.2 grand pen and these are monsters I really like this the concept here of just making a tank that's gonna last you for a couple of weeks and also a big fan of blue dreams so looking also for it to trying this out and you can see this pin is so big that it's actually the cartridge is a little bit longer than the pen itself but it's very similar to the other pen other than the length of it it has screws right on to the end of the battery and it's the same battery that you can use on both size cartridges look at that at this like a it's like a rifle or something they're just not rifle you can see the comparing the two you can also see that the two oils look different as these are strange specific and you can also see out of the quality of the oil is very good how thick it is that takes that bubbles so long to roll up but one thing to be cautioned with and this is a lot of vaporizer pens they will roll off the table and break so be careful you don't want to break your heavy head or you'll cry okay so it now comes the favorite part the part of that we've been waiting for here at Roth house studios and this is amazing a pen if you've tried any kind of these cartridges you just can't equal the taste I really like the little light-up end there when you you don't have to do anything when you draw through the pen it lights it up and also ignites the the vaporizer atomizers so you don't have to press any buttons or anything like that it's just air controlled and then I had a little fun here to try both flavors at once that OG Kush was delicious by the way very piney a little bit of lemon but very piney and delicious and the same goes for the Blue Dream it wasn't as pioneer but it was a much more lemony citrusy flavor and just awesome the flavor on these is incredible and heavy-hitters is the correct name you can get major puffs especially for the low wattage coils you can still get major big puffs and like I said we've tried these on multiple batteries and they work good with most of your low wattage batteries but you do need to be careful not to use too high of a wattage of a battery because you get burnt out the coil in the atomizer and it won't work another thing to be cautious with about using these heavy headers or any kind of the cartridges or a lot of these cartridges especially the high-end strong ones like this is that you can find yourself overmedicating very easily because it's such a pleasant experience it tastes so good and it doesn't make you cough and choke that after a few hits you may just find yourself staring out into the window aimlessly and forgetting what you're doing so be careful not to over Medicaid and don't drive or operate machinery obviously anytime but especially in the case with with these heavy headers because they are appropriately named-- you will definitely get very very high off of these all right very easily super high quality very premium premium oil right here [Music] so that comes to my review or my rating for the heavy hitters and I'm gonna give it five stars I really can't find any problems with it the only problem that I have is you're gonna be upset if you let it roll off the table and break it which is only a testament to the product itself just top-notch product so I would like to say thank you to heavy hitters who sent out these pens for us to review if you'd like to learn more about heavy hitters you can check them out online and you could also ask for them at your local dispensary I hope you

know it's just like anybody you sometimes you struggle with content that one of release really good content so it's just been a few minutes since I release and stuff today's video I get a lot of questions about is what are we going to do with your leftover carts and we get a lot of these you know questions about these cartridges there's so many of them there's a bunch of different ways they connect together and really but it's really quite simple you can definitely get inside the carts even if there's a lip just a little bit of oil less than that we want to make sure we're using all that yeah this is a very expensive program and using all your medicine efficiently is really what's going to make that make or break it one month to the next without further ado you're gonna need a few things so I got what I did is I put a hook up excuse me a couple different cartridges together just show you different brands who we got here we got standard forms brand cartridge we got GTI brand cartridge and then we have a Terrapin brand cartridge right these are simple they just screw off they're not hard I'll do one for you right now this particular one is GTI and you just squeeze here and rotate righty-tighty lefty-loosey real easy to way to remember don't you get that off that's your trash this is what you're going save now some of you might be wondering what in the hell are you gonna do with that that that's gonna be worth my medicine there's a got a lot of things you can do you could soak it alcohol you can soak it in warm dump MCT oil or like tonight what I'm going to do tonight is I'm gonna heat up a little bit of high fat milk on the stove and once it's up the temperature I'm gonna drop like no no like 10 of these and there mix it together you'll start to see the milk turn like you know an amber color if you use the llars or the co2 carts how about them light tint to it that's your indicator that nicely you know this is already smoked up you know and you just kind of stir it in there you know not overheat this is something we made out of so it does get warm so it's okay to begin something that is warm you know you don't want to go ahead and throw them in the milk turn the milk on high and boil the cart in the metal together I don't recommend that I always heat up my milk and one for my milk is that temperature which is just slightly similar in our a little bit of bubbles I'll go ahead and throw it in there I'll mix that together add a few little bit of a chocolate then I'll mix that together but that's in a different video we'll do that specifically for the other brand cartridges like let's see we got here like your moxie carts or your LLR carts yes Koecher tangi whoa love it best corn ever and then you got your where these that's your outage this is your another one of those Cresco carts as well all right so we got that banks are you know what to say in a christelle cart this is actually a grassroot cart so these three carts here have compression fittings and this is why you're going to need these two tools and the two tools I'm speaking about today it's just like pair of vise grips pair of needle-nosed that's all I'm going to show you how I'm going to take this apart let's move this camera down here to see these guys are able to see what's going on on the table alright so once I've worked with a lot are these crest coats like I said kosher tangi you know sorry everybody all character changing is my favorite cartridge in the whole program it's amazing if you haven't tried it I highly suggest you check it out we're gonna want to do this right where that strip is you're going to get that in your vice grips now if when you initially put that down there I can't squeeze that it's too tight you don't want to squeeze it too tight so then you're just gonna loosen this up which is gonna allow you to lock that end see that and without holding it it's gonna not fall out and we want it to not be able to be wiggled either because if this is you can wiggle this that means it's not tight enough even if there's a little bit of play in there we want to make sure you got as much tightness as possible you know without squishing it okay so that's how that's going to look and then you can try a couple different ways you can put it on here and just work your way back and forth slowly but surely you don't want to squeeze this metal piece here bat metal piece if you squeeze that a bunch of times you're gonna make it hard for yourself I come out here or what I do another good trick is to stick your needle nose inside there put a flap down on the table and just give it back and forth little Wiggles stabilize your base of your car just so if it becomes an issue you can get it out what I like to do is increase the tightness on the court remember you don't want to squeeze you don't want to squish it and then and as you can see I'm squishing the crap out of the top of that but sometimes that's what's needed if you just wiggle back and forth boom off cam your piece and as you can see the end is good and I squeezed out of there and now I can gain access to all my compression fitting carts with all my medicine in there and that's what that end piece looks like I know you ladies are gonna ask me where I where I got this sweet little robber thing for the car actually a buddy of mine and 3d printed it for me my man Eman you're the man dude thank you so much that's awesome all right so just dump gonna do one more a couple one more here with these twisties just so you can see it up close just kind of twist it that's it if that has a bunch of stuff on there you can even throw that in just don't throw any rubber in and buy rubber you'll see like that sometimes I had this little rubber piece or they come on the bottom you don't want to go thread up and there don't kind of get in your way I know another one of the carts that have a big problem is these Moxie carts I'll do one more of these just to show you squeeze it right there clamp it down stick your partner map there we go squeeze the crap out of that hmm actually the moxie was easy easier to get often the crest Gallic has like it's like a little rubber piece so it just kind of flexed off on me which is nice that's pretty cool now you just kind of repeat this process until you get a bunch of carts opened any stuff you can move away from the top you feel free to do so but all that hot liquid is gonna get inside these carts so you can just leave these open like that and believe it or not there's another thing you can do now I don't recommend anyone just doing this but you can definitely get one of those extractor kits with the hollow needles and just suck up as much oil as you can honestly this is I've did that before this is still the best way I've ever figured out how to use my empty carts it's very efficient people are gonna ask me what's your dosing size generally when I do this I'm doing this on a Saturday or day I know I'm gonna have off I'm gonna do about five to ten carts that have a little tiny bit of oil if you get one like especially the standard forms ones oh wow I caught that you see how much of that is up there that's a lot of will right so maybe on this batch if I have something that has that thick that much oil at the top caked on there I might drop it down one or two carts just cuz I know it's gonna be pretty strong that day you know and then you know like I said I'll be making more videos and I want to definitely make a video on how to actually put these in some form of edible or drink and I will definitely be doing a video that in the future so thank you every much everybody thank you for watching take care of yourself and each other and hang loose", "oHhzsm8OXVE": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy mixed up place you call your local dispensary today we are taking a look at a vape brand that is quite huge and one that has managed to escape our attention for some time here on wheats and that is the fine folks over at legion of bloom legion of bloom yes legion of bloon they make all kinds of different 5 10 um thread vape pot or carts as well as i think they partner with packs and make um different packs pods uh with their under their legion of balloon bloom line as well we are taking a look at their mendo breath indica 1 gram here today on the back we've got their lab testing results uh showing it coming in at if it'll focus uh 78 and thc uh and then as everybody's gonna want to know this comes in at 45 for a 1 gram but it'll never focus terrible at that 45 bucks for the one gram uh cartridge uh at a dispensary in long beach which puts it right smack dab in the average cost range for uh uh vapes at this dispensary mendo breath uh is a a strain that i'm not a huge strained guy but one that i do tend to like um and let's go ahead i'm a big fan of uh and by a big fan i mean i usually hate reading these sort of uh overly flowery uh pros that they these companies include on their packaging to sell you on them so let's let's lead you a little bit of the legion of bloom's story here legion of bloon is a coalition of eco-conscious cultivators with a deep reverence for the cannabis plant we carefully select terpene-rich genetics and capture their essence through solventless extraction methods combined with triple refined cannabis oil the result is a full spectrum experience unmatched in flavor and purity we invite you to join our legion nate let's join so let's go ahead and open this bad boy up uh let me go ahead and mention this packaging really beautiful packaging by the way uh it doesn't look that um crazy opulent either in terms of materials it's just very neat looking i really like the design it's sparkly and gold and i guess i kind of um uh you know um have the uh the sort of uh brain attention of a bird and like the shiny sparkly things gets my attention like this does uh i want to build a nest out of this legion of bloom cartridge packaging so we've pulled the little tab here let us slide open now is easy not too bad more uh marketing materials there and then in here we have got the thing itself wow okay a lot of materials nice thick plastic there and we're finally to the cartridge itself oh that is some nice looking oil guys yum that that oil actually looks incredible uh very thick looking uh incredibly pure oh i'm excited to give this a try this has got me really amped up uh it's got like the ceramic uh tip with that well it might be some kind of plastic it feels like ceramic um but it is a nice material i've seen a lot of uh the newer cartridges using this either higher quality plastic or some kind of ceramic uh it works a lot better than the cheaper acrylic tips so here we go let's finally give this mendo's breath a try hmm uh oh well my battery was showing that it was drying but i'm not getting anything let me try a different battery i have one here on standby let's give another shot well looks like i've got a bum battery sorry beloved um raw gardens battery you look like you're finally gonna have to join the collection in the sky uh but this battery works fine and this cartridge tastes great i forgot to mention they call this the monarch um with a hundred percent cannabis derived terpenes so this is uh triple refined cannabis oil and then all of the terpenes that are added back in are the terpenes from the mendo breath strain itself um it tastes like mendo breath that i don't know it's a very hard to describe taste almost spiced in a way i like it i like it a lot um and the oil itself is uh appears to taste as good as it looks uh quality wise so smooth um wow man that is quality stuff um yeah that just vaguely spiced taste that uh some mendoz mendo breath strain has this has in spades uh quite high already uh after those couple of hits you saw how smooth it was too i didn't really feel it at all going in um but rather big hits off not very hard draws as well um nice cartridge design seemingly as well from uh legion of bloom or they use a nice cartridge so far so good here oh wow guys i i i mean i barely feel it going in uh certainly feel it in the head as it's going out uh strong tasty um and just some really quality quality oil um this is a big old thumbs up so far for legion of bloom i can see why they have are a ten times award-winning company good for them uh great tasting not bad uh affordably priced right in the uh average price range at the dispenser i go to so so far this is a big thumbs up for a legion of bloom uh with their mendo's breath strain uh i am really really looking forward to finishing this one off uh as like all of our weeks reviews i'm gonna review the whole cartridge not just these first couple of hits because these things tend to leak they tend to clog they tend to break down all these things can pop up as you guys know so it'll probably take me about five days or so to finish this gram off uh really looking forward to doing that and as soon as i do i will come right back here let you guys know our wrap-up thoughts of this legion of bloom experience but first half so far so good anyways we'll see you guys right back here for part two in just a bit thanks for watching [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been about five and a half days since we started our journey with the monarch from legion of bloom their mendo breath strain this one gram 45 cartridge five days later my impressions are just as rapturous as they were before i really really really liked this one i like the quality of the oil like the taste of the strain that sort of spiced nutmeg cinnamony vague taste of uh the mendoz breath here was great um that oil as i said quality top to bottom never got that burnt taste never got that never started to burn that uh or get those big cloudy sort of vapor heavy hits nothing like that um just fantastic quality uh cartridge design worked incredibly well no clogs didn't have to get that like big first draw to get it going just a fantastic uh product really happy uh with the legion of bloom system not sure again why it's called the monarch it's got the mendo breath strain and the name the monarch but we'll forgive them we'll forgive legion of bloom we'll forgive the name the monarch because it's so good big old thumbs up here just as i had hoped and anytime we have a thumbs up this big we like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that you can enjoy that is not necessarily weed related and you don't necessarily need weed to enjoy although this recommendation might want a little weed beforehand because it's going to make that penis all the better that's right we're talking pen 15 on our cherry on top a show that just entered its second season on hulu a phenomenal show hi thank you a phenomenal show that just entered its second season on hbo and by hbo i do mean hulu uh it is a one joke premise it is about two uh 30 something year old women who pretend to be middle schoolers around the era of y2k and they act with a bunch of 12 13 year old kids and say a bunch of foul-mouthed inappropriate things it sounds like it should get boring very quickly but it's actually hysterical and if you are like me in your early to mid 30s you're going to be very very at home in that aesthetic so check out pen 15 or as i prefer to call it penis on hulu and check out legion of bloom the monarch at your local dispensary two things that i enjoy having in my mouth a whole lot well", "hdQt-Ej-2Ho": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with tokentim420 this is a florida medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 and medical marijuana patients all right like say hi to everybody out there if you haven't subscribed hit that subscribe button down there leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know how you're feeling tonight what you're smoking on token on what you're moved in um so today we got the token tim's mad scientist lab we are going to be making some rosin vape carts on our own save a lot of money um i will like give a shout out real quick um i got some of that girl scout cookie now this stuff was only coming in at 15 it was minnie's i couldn't see that online um and i'm not a fan of girl scouts but this stuff totally changed my mind this stuff's real good um nice flavor to it nice high to it not quite a sativity ah as sativa leaning as the last stuff i've had that was the girl scout cookie so like i said not bad at all all right so we're gonna make our own rosin vape carts now you guys know i've tried true leaves i just went and got another one we got the skunk ape blue river rosin we tried both of them for cure leaf i left the other box in there from the select um some people was asking if this was live resin or not to me it didn't really taste like that tastes more like the terpene like the cannabis infused terpene vape pens exactly like them so if you could find those vape pens cheaper i'd go with them but we're going to show you a way to do it real cheap and i tell you what they taste amazing all right so we squirted a little distillate in there i got i was trying some of them i got a little tore up had to take a break my water cooled off so it didn't work so this is take two on the video honestly um that's that papaya cake rosin from move or from true leave sorry um in there and then the distillate we're using because it's an indica uh the indica uh bubba kush coming at 78 percent so all i did was microwave some water and a shot glass put it in there you don't want to get it up past the stopper there you don't want to get back in there i want to get this part done before it cools off again so there was probably about three left in here on this syringe it's got a little bubble but it was about at three i put a little bit in there already so when it's warmed up it's just gonna go real easy in there yeah i guess we're gonna use all of it all right that's all of it are all that we're gonna mess with getting out at the moment now if you notice the pad i'm using is that five dollar baking sheet which is silicone so it's the same thing as a dab mat that i got on amazon it was like five bucks or two for five i can't remember videos if you go back as while back i just cut a piece off to fit the table so i didn't have to clean the whole table off so now all we're going to do is we're going to take this and we're going to mix it up now i have made a few of these before i did warm the rosin up on the one and then by time i got out here it was just kind of like a hardened back up more like a caramel just letting it sit out at room temperature seems to work better let me pull it off the view for a second and make sure i got it mixed evenly sometimes the distillate wants to stay on the side but as you know the rosin carts are about 60 bucks apiece and they're only half grams so this distillate i believe was 60 bucks from grow healthy which truly has them for 60 most everybody's around the 60 mark for a full gram so this right here will fill two vape carts um and then the rosin's uh 75 gram so you basically for 135 you're getting two grams um which you would only get one gram buying it by the vape cards like i said these are half gram vape carbs these aren't full grams only half grams if you also notice on true leaves the thc is always really low i'm using 80 distillate and 80 um rosin so these are still up in the 80 percent so we're gonna use our um we had some la confidential co2 cart which i got another one of these so we will be reviewing it later then all we're going to do is unscrew the top here now i will say that it helps to have a decent dab tool the dab tool i'm using is the one i got for five dollars uh from banger supply and if you use code token tim you'll save 10 at banger supply they got these for like 5.99 so try to keep it up here in the camera see what we can do so mainly what we're going to do is we're going to take the flatter end um or either end the flatter end kind of works better towards the end and we're just going to get a glob out there like that this stuff's stringy and looking in the camera is a pain in the butt all right we'll hold that there and then what i do is just press it around the stem and then put it down in there so let me go over here and do this where you guys can still see it but yeah you guys can see it there now i'm gonna go ahead and use the flat end just kind of scoop out a big scoop like that and then smooth on that thing and it's easier just to push it right down in there you guys can see that just kind of pushing it down now it doesn't go real good um so there is a trick we'll use here in a second once we get it pretty blobbed up all right trying to it's hard for me to focus i need new glasses so i keep pulling it off the frame to me to be able to see it now i'm just scraping all the gunk out of the jar real good i'm gonna do the same thing i'm gonna go over to a clear spot each time and just wipe it off on that and then take the tool focus there we go and slide it down that thing it's not wanting to focus if it does go on the outside just scoop it back up all right we've got about all of it now the first one i tried to wait for it to go down and it just didn't seem to go down quick enough so i'm gonna take a little torch and i'm gonna heat the glass down in here i'm not gonna heat the concentrate i'm just gonna do it like that without burning my fingers off hopefully so i'm just going to slightly warm the glass going around you can see it's starting to drip there where we warmed it up so just real quick that one bubbled on me and then it starts to it'll just start to run down in there then go ahead and take the tool and access there's a little bubble there we're going to pop that scrape all that off on there try not to get it inside there for sure we've already got it about half full it doesn't take a lot um a lot of concentrate that is you can see i only had about three in that syringe and i only put a couple dabs in there it really wasn't a lot so again we're going to take a little bit sometimes with this i can just scrape it right across the glass or like i said just roll it around that and whatever's left there the mouthpiece fits real tight over that silicone ring and it just pushes everything else down let's get a real good scrape on this jar real quick and then i'll show you the other ones i made and talk about them a little bit now i will say the flavor on this stuff is just amazing it tastes just like just like doing the dab let's scrape this off of there real quick all right now i could play around and get some more out there but i want with you guys i'll just dab that out with my dab straw later so we're going to stick that on see how it just squishes that on through there and we're going to screw that on now i found with some of them you'll have to go back again with your torch and this one's a little thicker you can see it's still thick so i'm just barely going to heat it if it starts to bubble you want to quit so i have to look at this real good and it'll take a second for the heat to transfer through to the glass still a little creamy there's still some up there at the top there we go this one must be a little thicker glass than the other one i had we're just going to hit it a few times now if you notice when we did that it kind of cleared up a little bit not a lot but so you can see the little holes down in there now where the wick is you'll see how that cleared it up some and i didn't bring the battery out i told you i got pretty medicated all right but we have made a few other ones um so i made one yeah this is it i used the move vape pen and this it worked great for about two days and the battery died and if you can see right here at the bottom it's got little um holes i thought i could take it off with a battery i grabbed it with some pliers and apparently i couldn't so i shattered it what i'm going to do is unscrew the lid i'm not going to do it now because i want the glass to fall off and then i'm going to heat the banger up and i'm going to put it in there upside down like that and just let all that wax come out now this was the um i used the skunk ape and the bubba kush um the skunk ache ape was from move or true leave again sorry i don't know i got move on the head now i did put some of the thca powder in that one also and it was really really really tasty tasted just like the skunk ape tastes a lot better than the skunk ape rosin car which we'll get we'll have a video on that later but like i said really really really tasty um and the thc is going to be up there and it's a cheaper cheaper thing so i'll show you the other one i did but first we got to do it sorry it's alive all right so i did make a live resin vape cart um this is with moves rainbow train wreck and you can see how it's cleared up a little bit more i hit it with a little bit more of the torch um but it tastes amazing there's a little clog there that's why heated this one up it was clogging a little bit but man it tastes amazing and the high on there i'm telling you the high is better than any of these vape pens i've had yet and i gotta write what i put on this one so i don't forget that's the rainbow train wreck which we know it's live rosin because that's all there is um but the skunk ape one i'm telling you you know vape card even these i hit these um you know 10 good hits off of them to catch a little buzz um i was only hitting that skunk ape three three little hits and i was blasted i the dying i made that i rolled up a joint um and after my three hits i had like this much left of the joint and i looked at that i'm like hey no way i'm lighting that thing back up so it tore me up pretty good so if you guys want to give it a try like it's not really messy you do have a little bit of residue left in these so you could either take a bud and roll it around in there and then roll in some keep and make your own moon rock or you could just take your dab straw and hit it you could also take a hair dryer and melt it down so it would get it in a corner better to get a little better dab out of it but if i mess around with it with like this one that has that little scoop on the end i can pretty much get everything out of that jar there won't be anything left and especially it's starting to cool off now because it's getting ready to rain here but especially when i'm working in a hot garage and it pretty much stays warm here anyways it makes it easier to work with it's not coming back up so it's easier like i said just to push push it all the way around to the corners i just take this one the longer straighter one and get the sides like that and what i'll do with this is dab it that's what i do with the other stuff that's why i mark the charge but i think it rub keeps rubbing off with my fingers so that one's uh we just made the papaya cake so that was this one we're just gonna put a pea on the jar so i remember but yeah that's what i'll just use when i come out tonight i'll scrape that again you can see like i said i just got that little bit i wiped off on the edge there just by taking it around a little bit and just keep scraping it back on the side and then when you get enough to take a dab you just take it all off of there and dab away and like i said with the other with the rounded one it works a little better getting everything out there real good this one's not bad but the other one's better so like i said it doesn't take long to get you a dab and then just drop the dab tool in the dab rig and you're good so that's my take on making my own vape cards um the live resin i did use the co2 true clear the sherbert so i figured it'd have a nice cleaner flavor but this stuff here wasn't bad um i haven't tried this one i just made yet of course i didn't bring the battery out um but i used it with a skunk 8 but that skunk cape's got such a strong skunky um smell to it it's hard to for anything else to come through so we'll see if anything comes through on this one but like i said the thca powder worked great in there too it didn't clog that one up that one worked you know it was almost all the way full and you can tell see there's not much left in there i smoked over half of it in a couple days it was so tasty and like i said the battery just quit on me so i don't recommend refilling those the reason i refilled this one and like i said we got it filled with just that little bit i didn't use a lot i'll show you how much i used on that um but this one's got the charging port on the bottom so hopefully we can recharge it when it does die now i only use this was a full gram i did lick a little bit and but pretty much i just used two i pushed it from where it was at the one to maybe just past the eight so maybe three milliliters of this stuff but closer to probably the two because it did fill that pin up and it's only 300 milligrams so like i said it didn't take much of this to fill that vape in and i did dab a little bit in my mouth dabbed a little bit in the banger just to try it the flavor wasn't bad the banger wasn't real clean so i couldn't get a good flavor on it so we'll save that for a review hopefully too well that's going to be it guys if you have any questions just leave them down there in the comments like i said this is an easy way you could also just put the distillate straight into the vape pen without the rosin and just make a bait pin that's what pretty much they're using is distillate but like i said with just a little bit of that rosin it makes it a real good flavor so you don't need a lot of that even you could probably just put maybe two little dabs in there mix it around put one in there see how you like it next time add more if you need to but like i said they tore me up good so i definitely recommend those of you who are feeling your own give this a shot let me know what you think of it that's going to be it guys we do got some more videos coming tomorrow we got a delivery coming and then we'll also do what's new in the florida mmj we got some new things coming yeah so make sure you tune in tomorrow for that one uh make sure you

the potential benefits of CBD by now what we don't hear too much about is the potential dangers of CBD oil or more specifically the potential dangers of a CBD oil vape pen CBD vape pens are often marketed as a healthier alternative to smoking and it's probably some truth to this whether you're talking about tobacco or marijuana most experts agree that vaping is less severe on the lungs than the smoke that's inhaled from combusted plant material the reason for this comes down to a simple temperature comparison standard joints and cigarettes can burn anywhere between 800 and 1600 degrees Fahrenheit but some high quality vaporizers operate at less than 400 degrees nowhere near hot enough to produce the tar and combustion that wreaks havoc on the lungs in fact there's really no reason to inhale at temperatures much hotter than 400 degrees Fahrenheit as most of the cannabinoids in marijuana are already fully decarboxylated by this point that being said the dangers of CBD oil vape pens come from the fact that improperly processed products may contain compounds that pose hazards to respiratory health the first thing to be wary of is something called cuticle wax cannabis flour is covered in a thin outer waxy layer which when smoked in a joint or Bowl is simply burned off under the extremely high temperatures of combustion in low-temperature vaporizers it may be possible for the wax layer to break off into tiny particles rather than burn away some have suggested that these particles may end up in the lungs as solidified granulomas to avoid this potential hazard look for CBD vape oil that has undergone winterization this is a chemical process that removes the cuticle wax from the plant material before it ever reaches a vaping device another concern to be wary of is thinning agents like polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol more commonly known as PE g and PG in its natural state cannabis oil is much too viscous to be compatible with vape pen heater coils for this reason thinning agents are often added to make the oil more fluid and also to produce the tasty thick vape clouds that so many people love the only problem is both PE g + PG are known to break down into carcinogenic formaldehyde when exposed to temperatures above 440 degrees Fahrenheit a range that even top shelf vaporizers commonly operate in while the dangers of formaldehyde are most evident in other kinds of products it is probably not a substance that you want to be inhaling on a regular basis lastly in terms of the potential dangers of CBD oil vape products be advised that when you're shopping around for a vape pen you're going to get what you pay for some low end vaporizers have been known to operate at temperatures of up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit this quite obviously defeats the purpose of vaping as you're still combusting the oil and plant material into a thick tari residue in other words try and invest as much money as you can into a good well reviewed unit also try and find a vape pen that has manually controllable temperature settings this allows you to adjust the operating temperature to around 340 degrees Fahrenheit which many suggest is the perfect vaping temperature for CBD and cannabis for maximum safety and to avoid the potential dangers of CBD oil vapes as much as possible try and also look for winterized VAE boils as well as oils and

first hit I do have it at a very low temporary pasty that's for sure that's facts very tasty very very tasty it has a very pleasant gelato flavor doesn't seems like candy I love that the fact that it

this is a hybrid gelato 33 doesn't taste like frickin candy straight taste like flour oh yeah for sure job can't see the cloud I like the fact that tastes like I'm Annie no [ __ ] bad so it's getting pretty hot I'm gonna get up out of here yo this is just embarrassing reading over here starting his [ __ ] sweat I just wanted to give you guys a quick little review on the Himalaya get yourself up there high in the mountains all right that's core beats to see spot thank you for watching peace", "U_Ka0JKesCY": "[Music] what up y'all said [ __ ] Academy ha yeah big man [ __ ] today we're just gonna answer a question the question is how long should a cartridge last you and how many hits should you get out of it but before we get into that sure the question I'm asked you [ __ ] a month I guess please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always Sega's always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that things you can get a notification anytime I post some [ __ ] also make sure you go over academy.com get yourself some terpenes shirts get about 10 11 13 [ __ ] I also cuz the contest is still going on you put in cold [ __ ] get 20% off in your whole [ __ ] order and again sirs you into the contest to be able to get yourself a terpene ball I send it out to you no charge you don't be paying shipping and handling under that [ __ ] I take care of everything and I send it out to you so [ __ ] man can't a mink on get your Terrapins o-obviously go over instagram academy kind of underscore me so all right the question of how long should it last and how many it should you get out there [ __ ] I give that [ __ ] all the time i'ma keep my honey with you if you talking about just a free-range like if you get a cartridge and put it on a free a free-range battery meaning that you kind of have up to seven seconds or 13 SEC's something like that's a hit the [ __ ] bait cartridge that's going to determine how much you're getting out of it so it's no way kind of that I can tell you how many hits you can get out of a [ __ ] cartridge so like when a person comes up and says how about a little 1 gram cartridge less I'll keep it 100 with you there's no such thing as a 1 gram cartridge it's a one milliliter cartridge because liquid is Mac [ __ ] measured in grams so it's a 1 milliliter cartridge with an X amount of grams InSAR milligrams inside of it so let's take for instance if you look at the back of a cartridge and it tells you that 3 milligrams is a serving right and then it also say below it the package has 450 milligrams of THC in it okay so that means that theoretically you would have 90 servings if that makes sense you would have 19 servings out of that that that half milliliter cartridge because that's probably what that will be if that if that's the number four right however how do you know you had three milligrams worth of eight and I'm not dissing it I'm just more so say how do you [ __ ] know this meaning it's kind of really hard to answer this question and then I don't know how often you smoke [ __ ] don't to [ __ ] you me how long does come in every two days getting the same [ __ ] I got my burgers coming in every three weeks every week like everybody got that you old [ __ ] habits and they [ __ ] that's like if I gave you a [ __ ] glass of water and on my a man how many sips is it gonna take to finish this that's just stupid right so at the end of the day you got to get the [ __ ] on your own and figure it out so companies try to give you a mindset of what it is but I got I got batteries that I could take a 13 second hit you know long 13 seconds is to be inhaling [ __ ] vape [ __ ] so come on spot it's it all depends on you man if you do like I think it's this matter like oh you didn't help for like two seconds or some little [ __ ] like that that's like a standard but just like I say it also depends on the force of how you inhale for that two seconds you can inhale like little B actually you can [ __ ] hit that [ __ ] up you know so it really just depends on how you [ __ ] hit you as well so those are the things that have to be taken into consideration when you expect someone to answer a [ __ ] question like that it really just depends on you see my life flashing man yeah peanut series it's yeah but it just really depends on what your habits are how you actually smoke at how long something is gonna last you I personally say have more than one method of consumption so don't just have one vape that you just constantly hitting on and then wonder why is going down that's like having one pair of shoes and heel shoes just get [ __ ] up you know versus like man like 27 pairs of kicks that's why my shoes usually all look new because I got so many so I can just switch them out you know so much it lasts longer so I say I've never met this at some edibles that's Mars so yeah I mean admit you [ __ ] I have some real weed my admission up and I think you'll see that the cartridges will last longer but if that's your only source that motherfucker's gonna be here it's gonna be how for like a month okay you have a graveyard of all these [ __ ] cartridges just laying there there's a little bit of [ __ ] oh you know there's no way of saying it now there is one I know some companies that they'll give you like don't dose it out to you it's actually a company called OC and then it's a okay you get 50 hits out of this pin so when you inhale it cuts off at what the proper dose is and you just inhale until it cuts off so think you know aren't exactly how much are the dose you're getting and you're knowing how many hits you get so I would say like if you can try a company like that just so you can kind of have our idea your mind just for shits and giggles I don't mean like all of that gotta make you be in the right place but just for shits and giggles like just think about it and see like man let me see how long this pin lets me hit and how much of a dose this says it is and that might help you out a little bit I don't know that's just theory of mine yeah me but at the end of the day that's what it is just read the back of the package and you'll see what the milligrams are inside look admit it should tell you what's suggested those are some companies do that so anyway that standard [ __ ] I'm out this [ __ ] y'all make sure y'all keep the log or I love each other keep the peace gon be peaceful to each other go over it kind of mean get yourself turn t-shirts I'm out this [ __ ] another one I want to hit the seat blow we in the jungle smoking we in a jungle smoking

"okay so I'm gonna show you how do you save my oil transfer this is just a small kit that can help you transfer your oil from one to another and it's kind of small so you could keep this anywhere you want this is what it looks like when you open it up what you want to do is on most of them you can unscrew these tops if not you have to figure out another way to actually get it off and now I just want to place this one down here sometime these are gonna be a little bit tight when you first get it because once used to last for a long time you'd see there and they'll stay in there so that's the one that I want to actually put in another one what I'm gonna do is take this cylinder filler and you could use a toothpick if you have one put that in there and now what I'm going to do is pull this out a little bit put this on so it keeps it straight connected and then put this right on here now we have it connected and what I'm gonna do is flip this over sometimes I like to put it on a little bit of an edge so that way it will stick to that glass and that is how that is set up right [Music]", "FGTP8FVp00c": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another buddy's cartridge video you know i'm saying but this one's special this one's a bit special because if you can see from the title it is the highest percentage of thc that i've seen on a buddies well uh that i've seen i don't know if it's the highest but it's 90 thc as you can see right here 90.42 and yes this is the distillate one so that's why it's high in thc but as far as like other buddies distillates or other live resins that i've had from them this is probably the the highest in range that i've had and uh the other two percent is some other stuff other than cbd but as you can see from the back right here it is 6.5 or 6.45 percent terpenes so pretty decent you know i've had some which were like 2 before so i'm happy that this one has ninety percent thc and six percent terpenes i can only imagine how it's going to taste um but i do have my tronian with me where's that and also the little adapter piece so let's just uh get to it and let's see i haven't had a buddies in a while actually i haven't had a cart in like a week or two because it's just they run out pretty fast for me but i've seen uh at authentic that they had buddies again like new strains so i was like okay [ __ ] it this 27 out the door the green box which is the live resin is 32 out the door so one of the best prices in town is going to be authentic for buddies so let's just open this i don't really care too much about the box and with this it's going to be a a very raw raw garden color yeah you see right here yeah very very nice let's just uh since uh since i do have my camera let me just take a picture real quick for the thumbnail you know that right off the bat it's very sweet very lemony is the most prominent yet lemony [Music] let's try this i'm excited i haven't had a buddy's car in a while so i can barely keep the excitement contain it you know what i'm saying so boys [Music] [Music] for some reason i taste the peanuts like the initial taste is the peanut and then it gets sweet pretty weird oh there's the lemonade there's the lemony taste okay it's a lemony slash orangey slash very [Music] so like i said the initial taste was like a peanut and then it gets sweet like a lemon sweetness maybe it's just the cart or something or maybe it's just 20 years a very different taste that i've had from previous buddies uh i wouldn't say i would compare it to a raw garden cannabis derived terpenes with this lid it's it's its own taste it kind of tastes like the cure company um tropicana cookies towards the end a very orangey very strong orangey taste but nonetheless very very enjoyable i didn't know gorilla glue terpenes tasted this lemony or this citrusy but not bad for 90 thc it's definitely gonna smack me but with gorilla glue it's a hybrid sativa or sativa dominant hybrid so it's definitely recommended to use you know during the day afternoon you know i'm saying but i would probably not use this as much towards the end of the night because for me at least when i smoke too much sativas at night it's very hard for me to sleep i don't know if it's for you guys as well but nonetheless a very very great part from buddies i like to address them some stuff people say about me always reviewing buddies or something but i spend my own money on buddies and that says something i i don't like when a person spends their money consistently on a product that means that that product is good just because you haven't seen buddies lately doesn't mean that i don't like them anymore i just bought all the strains that they had available to my dispensary when i drove monty and blake to the dispensary yesterday we went to authentic as well and i saw that they had cartridges at least new strains from buddies and uh you know i had to come back the next day and here we are making this video right now so like i said it's a very good cartridge very very different from what i'm used to tasting from buddies but nonetheless still enjoyable high percentage of thc and there's six percent terpene so you really can't go wrong with that i'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and we're probably just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed it you know what i'm saying um but yeah cheers three blinkers i barely move you do see a bubble in here though i don't know if that's peanut exactly but it's like if a peanut and orange mixed that's the taste no i like peanuts and i like oranges i just don't like them together but this is enjoyable i'm not saying it's battery it's just you know it's a weird taste but like i said uh if you get past the peanut taste it's a very enjoyable citrusy flavor towards the end but other than that hopefully you enjoyed the video peace out [Music] way back in the days", "gqGxit_NiQ4": "what's up guys be green 91 and today we're checking out one of the first legal vaporizer cartridges in the Canadian recreational cannabis market we got this from City cannabis Cove in Vancouver they're legal recreational dispensary this vapour cartridge cost about $80 $70 and about $10 and taxes but after January 1st taxes on vaporizer products are going up to 20% these are new products and they were just introduced but the price point on them right now is just not making any sense this is a point three gram cartridge it cost $80 I could get a full spectrum extract saw scar on the black market for 25 bucks these are brand new they were just released as a part of the next wave of legalization known as legalization 2.0 the introduction of extracts and edibles these are the first offerings they came out around Christmas box has a strained name on their says one 510 indica cartridge net weight point three zero gravel THC is seven hundred and thirty three point eight milligrams so seventy three point 38 percent THC point seven milligrams CVD got the government required warning label on there says frequent and prolonged use of cannabis containing THC can contribute to mental health problems over time daily or near daily use increases the risk of dependence and may bring on or worsen disorders related to anxiety and depression back it says cannabis extract intended for inhalation contact information do not freeze or in a dry place or stored to keep upright no expiry date has been determined key vote of reach of children contains the equivalent of 1.2 grams of dried cannabis and has a packaging date on your tenth month of 2019 on the 21st day as you can see four point three cartridge it comes in quite a big package childproof to open it you're gonna break the tax stamp on the side you're gonna open the top flap of the box you're gonna press the two buttons in on the side pull it oh and there's your cartridge right out of the box it's a small cartridge 0.3 car it's got stickers on it this isn't a custom car it looks like a cheap car nazi so no particular brand i can see these being mimicked on the black market nothing to indicate that this actually came from a licensed producer lastik mouthpiece cut a glass body which is good ceramic coils 510 threading so it will fit on most standard vaporizer batteries the oil looks pretty clear which is good kind of hard to [ __ ] up cannabis oil about the oil is nice and clear golden which is a good sign seen some darker oils on the website but a smooth vapor very bland taste there's a bit of flavor but it's very bland time to get the hint of Kush smooth on the throw pretty underwhelming but I buy these for my personal use no I absolutely prefer my full-spectrum extract cards from the black market over these and really no comparison $80 for 0.3 gram cartridge $25 for 0.5 full-spectrum soft card for these legal products and dispensaries were brought in to try to eliminate the black market prices like $80 per point 3 gram cartridge I don't think that's gonna work to eliminate the black market I don't know if the recreational market will ever be able to catch up to the black market with prices and products like these the products are 100% inferior to what's available on the black market prior to legalization a product like this would cost you about 35 the pros of this product its legal the oil tastes clean it's a co2 oil so there's no additives or dilute and it's not a ceramic coil blast body which is good oils nice and clear and golden pecans it's expensive I'll go through one of these bow every 2 or 3 days I would never be able to afford to use these it's a cheap generic car super easy to mimic they only have stickers on there nobody wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this and a cart from the black market it's a point three milligram very small I didn't see any one gram cartridges available yet only 1/2 milligrams of 0.3 milligram the only way I would be able to recommend this product to somebody is if they absolutely refuse to purchase off the black mark like an old granny or something like that if they were looking for a vaporizer pen die I could recommend this product to them it's not great but it's not horrible it's not dirty it's actually probably the best product I have tried on the legal market I've tried the pre-rolls I've tried some of the buds and they were horrible this product is actually tolerable I was to give it a rating out of 10 I would give it a 4.5 absolutely underwhelming it's not amazing by any means better than I expected me personally I'll be sticking to what I know but for you guys I'll be continuing to do some reviews on legal cannabis products so stay tuned like share subscribe my name's be green thanks for watching peace", "xv-7QYC1HhI": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to pop on 4/20 as always thank you for joining this channel won't we get started in this next video guys I'm gonna need you to do a few things as usual i'ma need you to like my video make sure you hit that notification bell and definitely make sure you watch the last deal which I did on candy this week guys I'm so excited because we're doing I'm super excited about this product guys I had a chance to be the representatives of this product at one of the dispensaries that our frequent and sunny day in Vegas Nevada we're gonna get into this product right away alright alright guys so here I have the air pro battery this is an advanced vaporizer system it comes with a graphite air pro vaporizer with a micro USB charger in it so let's get this open and as you can see battery is in here we won't get right into it guys this is you open it up you get a user user manual sorry it's early in the morning this is gonna be a battery it's the graphite I can get it onto the package and there's a USB cord attached to it for the purposes of this video you cannot see this charging but I so guys not enough got it all charged up and as always guys before I attach my cartridge to this I do want to make sure parents know that this is a canvas product we need to keep it out of the reach of children so make sure that you have these items laying around for your children anyone under 21 is not allowed to consume cannabis I'm gonna go ahead and plug in my charger I mean I'm sorry my cartridge guys see that this particular cartridge is a 0.5 grams and this one is called the black mamba and I picked it because it says black mamba but not only that guys and this particular one is the sativa so I want to just start showing you guys to Tevas because I usually use us that even during the day time just to get my day going it doesn't tie up my day and make me tired so I thought it would be great just don't get my work done and I will be able to use this as you guys know I got a bunch of product reviews to do and I need to keep my head straight sativas keep me right but this particular one is black mamba it has a pure distillate oil which only means that they have some clarity and purity to this oil I'm not sure from the research I did how they dissipated the oil there's different ways of getting me away with distillate form so you always want to do your research whenever we serve this particular product we go to air procom shut up at air pro we're gonna open this package up as you can see the package is a little tough to open I have no idea how I'm opening this but we're gonna figure it out okay guys obviously please change our location because it was a little noisy outside but the last you saw I was holding up the package that was childhood but it's also adult food so now we got the package shop guys I'm just gonna get closer got my 0.5 cartridge that's Black Mamba here is my battery is the graphite battery and I'm just gonna show you guys I've already charged it literally the charge only took maybe about 10-15 minutes so you didn't see that because of the purpose of editing the video but the charging takes really fast and it did turn colors when it discharged so I'm gonna go ahead and figure out how to put my cartridge on there we go so you just pop that mouthpiece off and then Oh Meg Nick magnetically it clicked idiot let's do it again wow I like that and I like that because guys it keeps it from leaking some of these cartridges you'll get they'll start to leak into your battery this one is magnetic and I like the way it just draw someone you don't have to like screw it on so you just sit this part to the side guys and we're gonna get ready to see if this thing more all right so remember it's supposed to find rate there's a manual a user's guide so I'm just gonna look quickly and see what it's supposed to do okay so it's supposed to vibrate lightly in your mouth yes I just said something's gonna 5r8 lightly in my mouth so let's see the vibrations oh my gosh that's amazing okay instantly guys this is amazing I can taste the blackberry as the top note with the hint of citrus but it's not a tangy centrist now let me let you guys know that I do know for a fact that this particular cartridge the Black Mamba cast terpenes in it the terpenes is what really brings out the benefits of the particular oil or the flour which is made out of flour so guys what I really love about this particular one with that citrus taste in it that's that limiting coming through and I love a terpene limit because for me is the antidepressant and anti stressor so it has that has pine all in it I think it has some lemon linen all in it as well so if you're looking to do Turks that's what you really want to be at to understand what the oil is doing and what is it bringing out of when you're inhaling it so for me um wow that feels really good in my chest this system is really great and this has been on high time magazine's top when our air pro and I love how sleek it is can you see that you can slip it in your pocket it's really adorable and right and it gives off a nice cloud the smell is great idea I'm like truly in love with this one and I feel like because it is a sativa guys I can go on with my day actually we might film doing some more stuff doing my day so you guys can see how a sativa will work doing your day so when you have a sativa this is gonna be great because you can still go to the gym you can still get your grocery shopping all those things that you need to do in your day sativas won't allow you to do so remember if you need it during the day so theses are going to be the way to go and air pro has some excellent sativa cartridges and these are dissident oils so they have already made pure fighted and clear it up so it's very clear on your chest the second pose you see I didn't even have a call back which is great and I still feel like I'm consumed inside kind of thing I know that sounds really weird cuz this is like my new friend like I can actually like in my little pocket and my yoga pants matter of fact let's just go to yoga and I'll just keep it in my yoga pants done nobody knows it's there let's don't get on my nerves boom vibrating in my mouth oh yeah I feel like dancing this right here alright guys I'll be right back and I'm going to show you how my day went on this air pro all right guys as you can see it's been about what about an hour or so and you know I met the guy named Jim on Stairmaster owning every Pro what I've let one that make you work tell you what I'm working up that's what it's this evil dude that he paid to this we're feeling great I just got a great workout in on the Stairmaster [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] it was amazing that gives the clarity and the purity of this I [Music] [Music] because I [Music]", "C6A2P3Zl-UY": "yo hey guys and welcome back to my channel it's your boy

video and your boys back here with another freaking cart review slash versus guys i haven't tried these too strange in so long so your boy had to try him um the homie he picked up and he's just been you know collecting a lot of cars so you boy had to you know hop on and he let me try the bezel so shout out to the homie you already know see get yourself a homie who got cards that you can review you feel me and try out you feel me so we got the nug and the nug is a big sur it's a live resin and then the bezel it's actually called bezel i think i said bezel earlier it's actually called bezel it's a sauce cart and this one is actually i think higher in terpenes and stuff than this other cart and it's actually it's also um made using butane actually i read it on the side in their ingredients but it also says it's high in terpenes so we're going to check that out see how good it is it's a a disc chill it with terpenes basically turns it into sauce i guess but the other one is more of a live resin so sauce versus live resin you kill me but um let me give you guys a close-up this is uh what the bezel comes in like a tube comes in a pretty big box but they only sell uh half grams so if you guys are in the full grams you're probably gonna end up having to buy two they haven't made a full gram cartridge of this yet but you know what it's all good let me take a hit before i even open up this other package hope everyone's smoking right now i'm smoking on um the rest of the absolute extracts the orange creamsicle freaking fire we're going to turn this temp up i know y'all like seeing them clouds because y'all like seeing a brother cough i let a lot of that get away but y'all saw me but um as you can see it's hard to get these shits open with one hand but it's all good the bigger one is the nug it has their little symbol on if you can see it you can barely see it but as you can see the sauce cart it's a little lighter and that's just because it has distillates and the terpenes you know it's not enough to make it super dark but it makes it dark the terpenes i'm pretty sure is what makes it darker but it looks good it's a nice little i don't know what kind of i don't know but you know it's pretty much the same as nug it's just another is a little bit darker but they're both kind of an amberish color this one's more yellow though you know what i'm saying but um we're gonna try out the nut first just because i am a nug fan over basil so we're gonna try snug first shout out to nug if y'all haven't seen um i made a video on their dispensary so go check that out um and also i did a review on one of their freaking fire ass products called thc a if you guys haven't seen that i'll try and put it in the top of the screen but don't be mad if it's not the top of the screen just go through my vlogs check me out watch it man you guys will catch a [ __ ] vibe all right cheers guys enough time let's see if i can take a blinker hit we'll see it's on a very high temp right now so i don't know if i can bam what street big sur i don't know what [Music] what freaking strains they use flower wise but it definitely has like a um let me taste it one more time guys hold on i give you exact what i think in my brain what it tastes like i don't know i feel like it has like a little taste but it's not necessarily sweet but it's definitely just like super dank because it's not guys it's live resin you guys already know that but it tastes super smooth like it's not harsh really at all you already know it's freaking it's amazing like nuggets probably one of my top live resins that i would get and one day i'm gonna do like at the end of the year when it's a new year guys i'm thinking about showing you guys all my product so tell me if you guys want that vlog showing you all the products that i did um that i smoked this year and telling you guys which ones i thought were the top best ones because i feel like in some of my vlogs i don't necessarily you know tell you guys oh this is better or this one's better because some people like different things and i want people to try things you know think for yourself you feel me because i'm not an influencer guys i i'm just gonna put that out there right now i don't want to be called an influencer if anything the thing the message that i want you guys to get is to think on your [ __ ] selves you know but um shout out to you guys let me take over here before i try this sauce yeah that shit's a hit man that's just to hit you turn the temp down and try oh yeah let me turn the temp down and like maybe i could taste it better that's facts i forgot see this is the honey stick that i used to have guys you've seen it in um vlogs before but mine broke or got stolen one of those i can't remember but hey it's almost 10. it's a little tip and we're high as [ __ ] but um let's see what it tastes like on low temp because low temp guys this is what people need to understand like yes it's cool to have big clouds get that fat head get loaded as [ __ ] hella quick whatever but it's also cool to just gradually get high and take low temp hits because you actually get the flavor of the strain that you won't you know that you're smoking like that's why it would be dope to you know vaporize but you know it's just a lot of vaporizers that i want like the volcano are super expensive because i would honestly bake the bud get high you know and then use the vape bud to make edibles or something but we're gonna try it on low temp [Music] i don't know it don't almost taste like uh like a cake like plain by itself you know what i mean i don't know if you got like just you know like pound cake or something i don't that's just me you traced in i don't know you i don't know maybe i'm wrong it has something in there like a certain taste to it that i feel like but it is dank as [ __ ] mainly it's just like a super dang dab taste but it has a taste to it i feel like what do you think [Music] dude i could taste this sauce it almost tastes like like lemon cake see i'm saying it's like a i feel you it's like lemony or something bro i'm puffing on this right now and like it tastes sweet as [ __ ] take a puff on that the sauce tastes sweet as hell when you puff on it right now like don't you think holy [ __ ] like i think this might have this might win no no we ain't gonna say that yet we're gonna say that yet hold on let's switch it up [Music] and i'm not the biggest fan of these tops because like you can end up seeing the oil there but these tops because they're circle they're good for taking bong hits you know if you don't have like the tool to smoke your boners so cheers guys we're gonna taste this on low temp because it tasted super fruity like it had like flavor to it guys so we're gonna see what it tastes like [Music] damn bro [Music] this [ __ ] is good guys holy [ __ ] i'm trying to match the flavor on this [ __ ] bro it's like um like a like i see like i don't know [Music] it's like a sherbert you guys can barely see the vapor probably because it's on low temp but it tastes like freaking sherbet or something taste it real quick tell me i'm telling you bro flavorful papaya papaya okay papaya what which one is this dude this is the the miss usa this is miss usa guys sorry i did not say in the vlog you guys probably can't see that but it says miss usa and it's an indica hybrid slash hybrid so it's a hybrid probably dominant indica or indica dominant you turned up 10 a little bit [Music] all right guys this this bezel is is giving nug a run for their money not not trying to dis nug but you have to see it like this guys the bezel is a distillate that's high in terpenes nug is a live resin so it's not a fair comparison because they don't add anything you're not you don't really add anything to librarian some brands do like um i'm trying to think like buddies they add terpenes to their live resins but um i don't think nug adds any terpenes to their live resin i'ma look at the ingredients [Music] they might have terps in it but it's like maybe low in it low in terps but um this freaking diesel actually tastes freaking fire you gotta try this strain exactly guys miss usa try this straight exactly i'm gonna take um a couple more hits for you guys and i'm gonna dip out and just chill you know gotta chill a little bit you know you know spend time with homie talk a little bit and you know maybe have some high moments some high thoughts guys tell me if you guys want to hear our high thoughts video comment below if you guys want to see a video about just my high thoughts or some [ __ ] we've been like me and the homie been thinking about it so maybe we'll just jot some things down that we said because we say some like crazy freaking [ __ ] that's just like what the hell high thoughts guys like i thought but let me take a rip real quick [Music] damn yeah this cart i'm buying this car soon i'm buying this car soon guys but um i hope everyone enjoyed this video new vlog coming soon probably in a couple of days literally after this vlog drops um finally 2 000 subs guys so i already told you guys i'm telling you guys in every video bong giveaway coming soon um honestly you should just go follow me on instagram shaka x420 because it's probably gonna be giving away on a live video but i'm also going to be dropping a dope video um to thank you guys for getting me to 2000 um you guys will see that video i think i talked about what i wanted to do in that video and you guys will see what really goes down so i'm gonna take this last hit and then i'm gonna get out of here guys [Music] peace [Music]", "-gdysmn5LEE": "well Aloha brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel it's your man Kimo back to do another review for all you cannabis enthusiasts and connoisseurs out there this time I've got a 5-10 thread of a cartridge coming to you from Palmetto cannabis that's sundial cannabis company it's agent orange it's a sativa hybrid stream it's coming in at 800 milligrams THC and one point two six milligrams of CBD so that's about 80% THC and less than a percent CBD so it's gonna be a high THC heavy-hitting cartridge really excited when I bought this I'm gonna admit I cheated a little bit I did buy it a few days ago and I was excited to try to open it up I've been faking it the last few days stuck it back in the cart in the container here to show you the package I'm gonna hate this packaging it's awful I'll show you on the front it shows to open the package you push it on the sides and you push open the top it's easier said than done like I was pushing pushing pushing I'm glad I didn't record the initial truck time I opened this package because it was real futile effort took me a while but after a while I just find out that usually if you play enough pressure on the sides and push in and pop you can open this packaging is horrible I can't stand the packaging and then when you do open it up you got your car to gene there it's nestled nice and safe away in this foam little cutout but it's straight through for me because you want the orientation of your cartridge to be upright and by having it designed in here you know this is probably gonna sit on the shelf like this or like this and your oils gonna be you know on the side it's gonna potentially clog or plummet your device not a cool design choice Palmetto I don't like that at all you know and strike three for me is this packaging big hard plastic and flung away what do you need all this packaging for this little device I don't like it you know it's it's horrible to me so packaging no good Paul metal so once you open it up though you do get this lovely little cartridge hopefully that's coming in nice and clear you see it says Agent Orange on the bottom and what I think is a really cool retro font I'd it the big bold letters you see the oil in there it is pretty dark doesn't move around a lot as you can see I've aped a lot of this the last few days it's a little dark almost kind of orange I'm wondering if the glass is actually tinted orange to go with the whole Agent Orange vibe I don't know let's get these rubber nubs off here with a mouthpiece condom get the battery put it on we're gonna vape a little bit here I've been vaping a lot of this I got some opinions on it but let's just take a rip right now as you can see is not a lot of vapor production it's not like a lot but it's enough gets the job done it is a little harsh so you can tell you're taking a drag that's one of the downsides to it after about four or five drags it gets a little harsh on the throat and I have coughed a little bit using this over the last few days but the taste you do get you're expecting orange oh you're expecting well Agent Orange gonna be citrusy orange II yeah not so much there's a little bit of a citrusy orange on the inhale and on the exhale it's a little tiny bit is there but it's mostly a kind of spicy peppery flavor cannabis flavor mixed in with the orange so it's a little bit sick you see with kind of spicy on the inhale on the exhale you lose a little of citrus and it's mostly just kind of a spicy peppery flavor it's not bad it's just not orange or really citrusy it's alright but like I said it's a little harsh so if you're going if you're really reefing on it you could COFF a little bit and you might feel a little irritation in your throat that's kind of the negatives the positives are the effects this this hits really good I find it to be a bit of a creeper strain don't really notice the effects for about 10-15 minutes and then all of a sudden you feel a Deadhead band effect come on and it comes down over and your smile comes up and I travels down your body and you feel energized and focused though like it's a really clear high you feel really focused and clear but you feel kind of happy and just like an overall general mood you're not really hi you got a bit of a headband effect but you're really focused and clear and just happy and conversational sociable it's a good get things done strains 50 times training good wakey bait string good any time stream however I will say that if you really refine it it kind of overdo it a bit start getting into you know quite a number of drags when the effects do kind of start to take over they're pretty intense at first and you know they wear off after a few minutes and they they develop into that sort of really focused clear high but you can make this pretty intense high it's kind of fun if you really want a refund get a little stone this is a great anytime babe because like I said it does dissipate into sort of a clear head in it you know certified so you're not all stony all day this this is great anytime Cape I would recommend it it's a good value it's forty five bucks I paid for it and you know it's point five grams it's gonna go about as far as any other 510 0.5 gram cartridge out there it depends on the use depends on your mileage mileage berries with you know how much you use it in your experience so thumbs up I recommend it I really like a good job Palmetto cannabis changing down packaging I can't stand your packaging I really like your cartridge I really like your oil I really like the Agent Orange pick it up if you see it it's a good deal that's the end of the review

"_GXrNZZnloI": "what is up YouTube family boy vaska's here gonna be doing another cartridge review today for you guys I really appreciate you guys watching my videos if you got someone watch the video I posted before this one go ahead and check it out we'd really appreciate that but other than that it's Sunday more Sunday morning actually you know I'm just chillin kicking back bout it hit my dispensary maybe a cup and eight this something you know it's it's about that time you know I really want to smoke it it's kind of different when you have a when you smoke out of a cartridge and you smoke a bloody nut I mean it's way different so but before I go ahead head out you know I want to get this out of the way so here we have this lemon haze from bloom farms you know I've never had a blue farm before actually I have but it was more uh it was one of these darts I'm know if you guys had seen these before these are pretty good so I don't know if they taste exactly like the card just because at the time I didn't see no cartridges I just seen these so I don't know whether they just like I said they just came out with cartridges or whatnot but you guys let me know on that this was like it was like 38 bucks you know I couldn't pass these up they had a lot they had all kinds of flavors you know what I mean so there's those people say there's a lot of fakes and there's real [ __ ] but you know this one's definitely real I got it from the dispensary but I don't know what would be the difference between a fake or real so I cannot tell you like you know on the packaging is [ __ ] so let me know in a comment section what are you guys smoking on I'm about to pop this [ __ ] open you know I have a smoked all day so it's about that time we get the wake-and-bake going so let's go ahead and pop this [ __ ] open so the THC on this is 83 no 88 actually total cannabinoids I got to see on the back and it's pretty cool pretty cool simple packaging so we're just gonna go and take this little alright guys so we finally got the sticker open and I kind of [ __ ] it up you know kind of [ __ ] the box up a little tab ripped out so here it goes hey they got the here you got the the packaging and it looks pretty dope you not never had a bloom cartridge before and here it says today was a good day it's pretty dope packaging I'm starting to really like this we're gonna get that and all you get is like this little I'm hotter burnin like what what not to do you know what your cartridge which I'm pretty sure are you cartridge smokers know what and what not to do what your cartridge is right keep it out of the keep out of the Sun you know what that should amount and [ __ ] so here you have it cool little cab a little oh [ __ ] alright guys so we finally you have to push this and you turn it at the same time so it's kind of where you know you you gotta know what the [ __ ] you're doing with these things because it's not gonna have a hard time trying to open this [ __ ] so BAM guys this looks pretty nice you know the oil looks really really clear nice yellow gold and first of all we're just gonna go ahead and do the bubble test on it this one's a super Lemon Haze I were really big the team fan and the super Lemon Haze is like a really old school strain so I really caught my attention so that's why I kind of wanted to get it the oil is really really thick guys she does not move at all so it's it's not life resin it says triple distillate so it must be some pretty you know clean clean distillate some people say dis list not to move now you know a lot of resins a new wave well it kind of is you know there's a lot of companies coming out with live resin so I don't know I mean this still is still good you know don't get me wrong it's still good just depends what kind of distillate you guys get from so we're gonna try hit this and we're gonna see what it tastes like all right off the bat you can taste those lemons man it is really good wow that's just fire I didn't just let me give you guys a little close-up again before I smoked a [ __ ] out of this cartridge it says bloom on there and this is the SL H for super Lemon Haze on the side and you got your California sticker there which is pretty dub so we headed up connected the little magnet right here for the yoke and battery you guys need to get one of these joke cows and other monsters had it for like almost two years already you know it's still hits like if I just pull it out the Box you know so we're just gonna throw it in there and cheers guys if you got smoke along with me go ahead and do so man we're about a good fake right now Wow I'm gonna be honest with you guys this cartridge does not taste like distillate it tastes more like a it tastes like really cleaned lemons no fresh like it's just fire its [ __ ] guys I didn't really expect it to be that good you know for some distillate bloom bloom Farms are pretty far man I'm going to hit her again I'm see if I can get a bigger bigger cloud oh yeah definitely you get lemons you know Wow so if you guys you guys let me know like what's the price on these bloom cartridges some people told me to have fakes you know so I don't know whether what to tell the difference like I said but you guys have these around where you guys from what's the price on these I got him prepared for like $38 with tax so it's not as bad so you guys don't pass this up man I'm at the [ __ ] again she's pretty good you know it tastes like actual lemons like it'll taste fake or nothing like that tastes like some actual terpene and definitely one of my favorite cartridges so far from bloom farm I haven't tried I haven't tried any other ones besides this one and the GDP one the GDP one was really good as well you know it tastes like actual granddaddy but but this was pretty far guys and if you guys ever see this super Lemon Haze you guys gotta try them out you know for the price $38 well it depends on where you guys from but here where I'm from it's pretty cheating but this is California but yeah guys I'm uh gonna head out good like I said I'm go to my dispensary and picked up some weed and tied to a hot box video or something let me know in the comment section what kind of cartridges and what kind of videos you guys like to see that I mean cuz I do what you guys want to see but you guys just gotta let me know in the comment section and really appreciate you guys watching my videos and don't forget to add the snapchat and just hit me up you know you guys have any questions and you guys have a really good day and you guys stay safe my peace", "4_Vmz7AF_Ss": "all right what's up what's up good afternoon good evening whatever time you're watching this what's up well i did pick up some weed today what's up toilet paper bandit what's up what's up all right yeah i got some blueberry kush people some blueberry kush don't know what this is going to be like but i really hope it's good i really hope it's good i have work soon but it's only five it's only five but it's only five hours oh okay that's not bad that's totally not bad five hours of work that's pretty good oh yeah my grinder is freaking stuck might as well bust up my weed how am i i'm doing good i am doing good for sure i'm always happy if i have weed if i don't have weed i'm really really stressed out so yeah i'm doing good i have weed i'm doing absolutely okay no complaints here no complaints whatsoever i hope this weed is good it smells good doesn't smell like blueberries it smells like something similar to blueberries but nothing close to it well similar all right oh that smells really really good that smells excellent you nice did you get it from the dispensary nope got it from a street dealer same dealer i always go see but she said this was different stuff so i'm like okay what is it she's like it's some blueberry kush i'm like okay i'll try it um it looks good it really does it looks amazing huh yes sir it looks good yeah you like dealers or dispensary well i like the dispensary because there's like hundreds of different kinds there's all different choices but with a street dealer i get it for five dollars a gram so if i go there with a hundred dollars i'll get 20 grams or i could just order online and get an ounce of really good stuff for 79 dollars that's a good deal for five dollars yes it is all right i gotta light a smoke up i'm sorry i'm sorry i would have to have a cigarette i don't know why but i am hey toilet paper band if you're still there have you told any of your friends about my youtube channel

doesn't really care but if you're doing it deliberately yeah they'll take it away uh youtube is too strict yes it is very strict you want to hear something really strict about youtube did you know people that like uh for an example um people that throw up on youtube like literally if they're doing like a challenge and if they end up throwing up on youtube like making a video and then they end up throwing up from doing a challenge or whatever back in the day back in the day it was okay to throw up now youtube classifies throwing up they put that in the category of sexual strange but it's true yeah they put it under the category of a sexual thing because a lot of people take puking as a fetish it's it's stupid but not only that you can actually find on youtube you can actually just type in how to put on the condom and it actually shows a guy yeah i'm not gonna say too much but it's a guy that actually puts a condom on and shows how to do it youtube is like this because it's a

oil cartridge purchase all Auto draw batteries need a cartridge with the airflow hole at the direct bottom of the tank if you're wondering why the new vaporizer you purchased won't vape your oil cartridge this is usually the reason cartridge tanks with solid connective bottoms will not work with buttons vapes this is the ex1 plastic wit cartridge with a flat head tip not really known for its big hits and good taste but it's a tried-and-true tank that's lightweight with the leak proof design and they easy to feel blue plug system be sure to preheat properly with this system as sticker oils can build up to a semi solid state on the wick so if you're looking for a cartridge that won't shadow around it though this is the cartridge for you the ex3 is a glass cartridge with a surco me of fiber heater similar to coils this cartridge gives a unique taste it feels heavy and very well made the big glass surrounding the heater allows for durability and will give you a truer quality of flavor this tank has been known not only to vape oils but ejuice to this tank features two dual Inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and because of the air hole at the bottom this can be baked with a south draw device the ex4 is a glass tank with ceramic heater it's great because of the rounded base the round base is great so that no oil or wastage get caught up there it has a wider mouthpiece than most cartridges so you'll be able to get more vapor production it features two inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and yes it's Auto draw friendly as well next is the only tank on the list we need a push to fire base and will not work on buttons as vaporizers or batteries the ex5 ii need each pilgrim or epub done for inlet holes for mediums against viscosity the egg v improves on the cartridge game by allowing you to control the amount of airflow you get great for heavy hits and with the mouthpiece being the largest of the bunch the vapor production is completely customizable to your liking but if you're not going to use the cartridge for a while it's best that you completely close the air vent even more amazing is the baseless center post assuring that you get the most out of your cartridge and that no oil is left behind and last but not least the e a fix-all cartridge this ESL style cartridge is the best fit for even the thickest of oils it features four large two millimeter inlet holes ceramic oven thick glass housing and ceramic mouthpiece and yes it is Auto drawl compatible this glass cartridge is a ceramic oven so you know what's going to give you a greater taste than any whipped cartridge out there all these cartridges are no wider than any CSL cartridge on the market and can fit into any vaporizer with the bore of ten point seven five millimeters or less please keep in mind that the thicker your oil the wider inlet hole that you'll need so that the right amount of oil can reach the heater to be vaporized without getting burned keep in mind that you shouldn't refill the cartridge is more than three times to assure you're getting the best vapor production consider subscribing for more videos like this drop us a like if you

dislip pen i'm really excited to try this out and see how it does y'all let's get into it we'll see on the other side when we're tapping off the little bit of info that's on here before we get into the full on urban scale see on the other side cheers welcome back you guys so as i said in the intro we are tapping into fido extracts pink kush 510 cartridge so this sucker came in with a thc total of 79.1 percent it's got zero cbd in it and it was packaged on the 15th of may 2020 i'm just gonna start pulling it apart while we're chatting through the information so we've got the lift and co website pulled up with this information you guys so we'll uh run all that off before we tap into this beautiful looking car so we've got pink kush 510 cartridge pink kush is an indica dominant hybrid that much like it's close relative og kush delivers a sweet aroma accompanied by a distinct herbal taste these point five gram distillate cartridges are made from food grade all natural terpenes with zero fillers and additives it contains 75 to 85 thc and no cbd we use top of the line c cell cartridges that features a ceramic heating element when filled this heating element absorbs up to 0.15 milliliter of the 0.5 mil of oil contained in the cartridge this can lead to the appearance of a head space at the top of the cartridge each of our cartridges are auto filled by weight to ensure that you receive exactly 0.5 of oil with 100 accuracy we need to get that thc sticker off there so we'll throw that on the torch while we uh rattle off the oh they don't have any more information you guys so uh i'm going to stick this on the torch while we uh do the urban scale intro and then we'll tap into this cartridge y'all cheers and i'll see on the other side of this intro [Music] welcome back you guys so we've got the pink kush cartridge right here we're gonna get rid of all those silicone dude ads screw this into the fireside battery and start a rocking with this sucker we're going to start out on the lowest temp come on there we go white light starting on the lowest temp we're going to take a rip through there we're going to go up to the medium and then the high try it all the way through there i'll give you a little bit of my thoughts and opinions on it after that and then we will go on into the g pen battery before we put our adapter on here and we start ripping it through a couple of glass pieces that we have here as well you guys i'm really looking forward to seeing how this pink kush hits taste i'm just excited to see how fido did their transition from the dark black gray market into this legal market so uh only way we're gonna find out you guys is by tapping in and finding out so uh let's do that cheers i like the elongated tip on this they're similar to what trailblazer had but it's a longer glass tip and i like that okay so it is kind of a sweet herbal flavor nothing overwhelming nothing really that screams excitement for me but it's definitely one of the better tasting pink kush products i've tried so now we're on that medium temp let's uh take a haul at this level and see what it tastes like here you guys cheers okay guys so got a good herbal push on that one got a little bit of a pepper flavor as well which wasn't disappointing it just wasn't expected i'm i'm liking it now it balances out with that kind of sweet herbal it's but it's not a really overpowering flavor it's strong when you have it in your mouth and when you exhale but it really dissipates quickly after that which is a little bit disappointing for me but still not bad so uh we've got it on the highest temp guys let's take a rip through here see how it does uh before we switch it on over to the g pen cheese yes we moved over to the g pen from that fireside battery i'm only going to give it a 7 out of 10. it had a nice flavor to it but it didn't hit hard enough to hold the flavor and it didn't have a really enjoyable enough flavor to make me want to just keep hauling on it so i have it in my mouth it's it's that good for one hit kind of a high and flavor not necessarily high but it's good for like a one hit it's not really that sugary treat that i'm finding my vape cartridges are really more what that's for they're kind of for that dessert of smoking right i'm i'm done having this harder [ __ ] i'm done smoking that i'm like bong rips and dabs and stuff like this i just want something light to sip on with a really sweet flavor and that's definitely where these come in handy but uh seven out of ten is the best i'm gonna give it for the fire side moving on into the g pen we've got it set on the lowest temperature let's see how it does and taste through here you guys before we move on and rock it through the glass i'm expecting a pretty good outcome from this let's see cheers okay guys we're on that medium level let's see how it does i got almost more of a sour cush kind of push with this it was nice it was really unique for uh the changes from that fireside battery and it's one of the biggest reasons why i like using different batteries you guys because you do get a totally different experience with these and i'm really really enjoying this pink kush so far but got on the medium temp let's tap in and try it out cheers so we've got it on the highest temp you guys okay let's get into this i am feeling this pink kush already which is not something i am used to i haven't had a pink cush strain hit hard and have a really good high for me like ever the flower just it's a strain that doesn't really do much so this this this pens got me excited you guys so we've got on the highest temp let's see how it does through here before we uh move on and give it a score on that medium level i still got that kind of sour kush taste which i enjoyed i'm i'm not upset with that kind of sour dank cushy flavor but uh let's see if the high temp does the same thing you guys cheers okay guys so i'm gonna give the g pen made out of a tent it had just a little bit more of that kind of sour cushy flavor that i do really enjoy and definitely look forward to when i'm smoking these kind of these kind of carts this pink kush is definitely uh something that's caught me off guard you guys and i'm really looking forward to seeing how it's gonna taste to the glass but uh we've got we are a mad bell here a little mad hatter bell we've got the fireside battery ready to go we are starting out at the lowest temp again working our way up to the high we do preheat on our high temp only because why not so uh yeah i think that's all the info we need y'all let's start doing this i'll see on the other side of these uh these three rips cheers last two let's preheat it y'all [Music] okay guys we're back on the g pen we've got a 420 rig we're gonna tap into this and uh see how this pen does you guys i'm uh definitely looking forward to um seeing the flavor on it but uh the only way we can find out how it does is by finding out how it is low tam first medium then we preheat on the high just like that last bit get to y'all cheers [Music] last rip y'all cheers preheat it sink okay guys so i'm gonna give it an eight out of a ten from the glass had definitely that sweeter flavor that i was looking for um it did end up being a little bit harsher than i was expecting through the rig so that's why it's not quite the nine like it had the potential for the nine for the intensity of the flavor that was there but there was a harshness to it that just i didn't quite enjoy um and i bumped it down the point for that but all in all very well put together card for the flavor on the glass through the just sucking it straight through the vape it was really really nice and i i'm quite impressed honestly overall with this pig kush because i've been nothing but disappointed by it now moving into the high i'm going to give it a 9 out of a 10. the reason the point is docked is easier to explain it doesn't have any body effects it is strictly mental which is what i'm finding the majority of these cards to be is a head high and that's a little bit disappointing for me just because i've heard some really nice and enjoyable body effects that go with this pink kush but i'm just not finding it right now you guys just doesn't quite have it and that's it's a bit of a disappointment for me but there's there's nothing much i can do about it i'm gonna enjoy what i do get out of it which is that really nice heavy head high and overall i i think they did a pretty good job for the high and the flavor you guys moving to the overall with a 32 out of 40 i think it did overall very well um very sweet flavor definitely strong on that side um especially when we got into the glass or through the g pen but that little bit of a peppery harshness to the end when you bump that the temperature up to the highest levels is a touch of a turn off for me and a big reason why it lost at least one point in most of the taste scales and then just the lack of the sweet to comprom to uh to balance it out is typically the other reason why i would uh dock some points but overall you guys this this this cartridge did pretty well and i uh i'm quite impressed uh if you guys have tried it let me know down below what you think if you've tried any of uh phyto extracts cartridges let me know what you think we've had the super lemon hazel one in stock too and i was intrigued to try that one but uh the pink kush was definitely the one i think i needed to try first just to get a basis of where fido wanted to run with it and they they took a hell of a good run in my opinion you guys but uh let's drop this sucker up when the end card slides in you guys are gonna hover over the logo in the corner click that subscribe

time being cheers and i will be back later with some more content you", "SXMTTO5fcQs": "hey there everyone welcome to my channel and if this is your first time here welcome my name is Courtney Crosby I currently live in Portland Oregon working in the cannabis industry and I want to share my love of the cannabis with you all but before we get started got a little Bowl packed here if you want to join alone that be awesome [Music] your best resource for smoking without the smell is going to be cartridges there are a few different types and styles of cartridges I mean with a prequel Tabar battery this is going to be my favorite battery that I have and it comes with the battery itself a charger a micro USB charger which I love about this battery two different bottom pieces for your cartridges that you had attached to the bottom of your cartridge to make it a magnet connection to the battery itself a few different cartridges to this battery and show you how well it works and everything screw this little bottom on the metal bottom piece on here making it a magnet connection to the battery and see so it doesn't fall out which is really nice look at the button five times to turn the battery on and off you can also double click the button here and it will do a pre heat setting which is really nice if you've ever had your battery laying on the side and all the oil has run to one side of the cartridge or it's just really cold and your cartridge and the oil inside is really cold you can put that pre heat setting on and it'll preheat the cartridge in together ready for use which is really awesome also has a temperature gauge up here at the top which is really important three cartridges to burn at different temperatures also when you set your cartridge down on the lowest temperature you're gonna go through your cartridge a lot slower it's also gonna taste a lot better so if you have your cartridge turn all the way up on high which is good for some cartridges to work or to lay other cartridges it'll just taste really burn you'll actually burn your cartridge and sometimes it can actually pop through the top of your cartridge and burn you which what you don't want on our cartridge oh just turn it down I can help with things like that so I'm gonna hit this bad boy and show you what it can do [Music] so taking this metal piece off and transferring it to you let's try out this buddy's cartridge these specific cartridges you can tell there's a little bit different we got two different mouthpieces here also the different types of oil on the inside which is really important just depending on what kind of cartridge you want I'll specifically really like the flat tips because you can hit it from any direction where is these tips you can only get it from the front or the back you have a specific battery with a button on it you have to hit a specific direction that can be difficult if your cartridge is in at a funny angle I just transferred the metal piece on to this cartridge here so it is now a magnet connection to this battery here so it doesn't fall out and you try it with this cartridge [Music] moving on to evolve I have their living resin cartridge and their battery to go open up this battery check it out another micro USB charger which is really great just plugs in down here on the bottom which is really awesome it says evolve across the battery with a nice button [Music] a button for your battery is also really important because some cartridges actually require a button it kind of just sends the signal to the cartridge saying okay it's time to warm up and activate the cartridge so some cartridges actually require a button on them some batteries are just a pull-through battery some cartridges work with those but not all cartridges do the last battery that we got here this is going to be a disposable battery so the battery comes with the cartridge you don't have to buy them separately just really great but once you're finished with that you would actually recycle the whole bad boy together so let this one it will be one of those pull through batteries it doesn't have a button on it or anything this is the Nano here there's also this type of a battery here that also has the button but also has a screw on USB charger on the top really great if you're looking for just an easy accessible battery on the go most of time these bad boys had lifetime warranties on them but unfortunately most the time if you lose this charger please piece in is irreplaceable that is why I like the micro USB chargers it a lot of these bad boys gone here [Music] please let me know down below what you thought in today's video I'm going to have any questions tips or things to add please let me know I love to hear about it thanks for watching and I hope you all have a great day", "SsC4jaIY8sQ": "[Music] welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I've got my trusty pour one out 510 vape battery that is finely [ __ ] the bet on me after 15 cartridge reviews or something it finally [ __ ] the bed and my trusty 510 battery has died so I'm pulling out the backup the cheaper chintzy er one here that's okay we'll get a new one we'll get a better one but I'm gonna miss my old friend there has died but outside of the funeral for our trusty 510 vape pen we are here for a joyous celebration and we are here to review the product that I have had to me suggested the most of anything I have ever reviewed or intended to review and that is brass knuckles we are finally reviewing brass knuckles I have had you guys a lot of you recommending me check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles and I've used brass knuckles in the past and but we won't talk about that but today we are going to be reviewing brass knuckles finally found some here in Long Beach and I'm very very excited to give it a review so this is the one gram Gorilla Glue cartridge and it comes in some a primo packaging that I have no doubt I'm gonna have difficulty opening here really nice packaging as you can see plastic on the outside it's got all the information you want on the inside lab tested contaminant and pesticide free that brings me up to the controversy I I know that there was a big controversy with brass knuckles for a while about pesticide usage but apparently that is no longer the case I hope that is no longer the case I I would a vet suggest you do your due diligence and research if you're really worried about those kind of things what you might probably should be maybe so do your own due diligence make sure you know this is something for you but from what I've heard they have all of their problems in terms of having pesticides or whatever fungicides or whatever I was that was in there it's no longer the case so Gorilla Glue is my favorite strain as I have said many a times I have seen it listed as both hybrid and indica this is a hybrid gorilla glue I like it both as hybrid and indica this cost me as you can see $52 at my dispensary which is a bit of a miss which is a bit misleading because really with the 35% taxes it can cost considerably more than that but $52 is the base price so you know pretty expensive but not outrageously more expensive than other cartridges this one just has the reputation sort of throughout Southern California as being the best of the best and I think I actually got it open without too much trouble there maybe here we go here's our cartridge in its little packaging there for medicinal use only not for redistribution and we can see their weed maps all that logos blah blah blah blah blah they have a snapchat how fun alright we have got our standard 510 pen here not our former best friend bottoms cap just like all the others with these little rubber stoppers whoever makes these little rubber stoppers must be doing pretty bonk owes business right now I would imagine let's screw this in ooh I like the color of this oil nice dark golden oil beautiful looking oil there a nice brass tip I guess that's where the name brass knuckles come from and a nice wide intake hole there so very excited to give this a drop let's give it a go oh wow that is a premium experience that is a smooth with smooth draw Wow ignore the cough that's my fault not theirs I'm a coffer this does not burn hot at all you can barely feel it entering along it's wonderful the taste is exquisite and Wow I'm already feeling pretty nicely medicated actually oh wow they use a bad word on their packaging here I'm gonna have to read that for you guys I don't see what their THC potency is listed at on here but I do know that they are among the highest in the state I think I've seen before that it's over 90% it certainly feels that way I'm already feeling quite high after just 3 3 little puffs there one negative thing and it might actually be this pen is I'm not getting this huge a draw as I would want for pulling I like the bigger clouds but it's sort of ameliorated by the fact that even the small draws are getting me quite high and it might actually just be this pen doesn't have the voltage to get the huge clouds I'll double check I'm gonna be getting a new pen before I finish this so I'll I'll be sure to let you guys know in the follow up if that still the case Wow but up into this point brass knuckles definitely definitely earns their reputation tastes great hits like a dream oh man really really really enjoying the brass on my brass knuckles experience here guys if only it were a little easier to draw from it would be perfect but again that maybe the pen and I'll be sure to let you know guys because I'm gonna review this entire cartridge I'm not just gonna take a couple of puffs and say it's good I'm gonna come back to you guys after I finish this whole Graham here to let you know exactly my thoughts let you know if anything's changed if the starting to leak if the oil got tacky whatever the case may be I'll be sure to let you know in the follow up so I'll come back to you guys probably in four or five days after I finished this bad boy off and let you know exactly what I'm thinking thank you so much for watching weeks to this point guys and I will see you in just a bit it has been actually I believe eight days since I last checked in with you talking the one gram brass knuckles Gorilla Glue cartridge so right off the bat I wasn't doing this really any less than any other cartridge I don't feel like but it lasted a long long time I really got your values worth with this one certainly a gram in there the other thing is it is still very potent this is a potent a blend that they've got in here this is certainly as strong as its sort of reputation lends it to believe but all that being said my initial I'm not as emphatically as in love as I was with my initial impressions or as I was when I gave my initial impressions there have been a couple of things that have walnut spoiled me on the experience have certainly damper the experience one is it became significantly more difficult to draw as time went on I did get a new battery to test it with and even with a new battery it was still kind of tough to draw from and it got harder and harder as time went on and which is something I really have a problem with with the VBA I much prefer the ones that have nice easy drawers that you can make nice big you know take nice big inhalations with as the kids call them make nice big clouds this wasn't really that and I'm not sure if it was this cartridge in particular as you can see there's actually some oil left there at the bottom I just had such a tough time drawing from it that I think I'm just gonna have to leave it there the other thing is it did start to get a bit of a burnt taste as I got closer to the bottom the closer I got the more burnt the taste was it for the most part tasted great I really enjoyed the taste but as we started to get near the end or trim it's the end of its life that burnt taste started to amplify so tough to draw from and increasingly tough to draw from and an increasingly unpleasant taste those aren't good things for sure those those weren't those theirs don't keep it and there's hold it back and getting in my highest remarks for sure but I feel like I'm definitely gonna get brass knuckles the second chance I've heard enough about them that I'm wondering if maybe I just got a bad card what the case may be so I'm gonna give him a second chance we're gonna review something else from them in the future but for now between the two because they're so often compared and they're so look alike I actually think I might prefer the heavy hitters to brass knuckles maybe yeah I think in my initial impressions I would go with the heavy hitter of the brass knuckle but let's get let's go ahead and do another brass knuckle review before we give it any the definitive conclusion and overall my impressions are still pretty positive this is a potent a long lasting cartridge that you're gonna get your money's worth from so you know I it's still really positive review it's just not as good as I initially had hoped but we will be examining them and given the future so fingers crossed and that guys is gonna do it for this review but before I bounce I want to share with you a little cherry on top just something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related but could be enjoyed with weed or with or without weed and so on this cherry on top what I wanted to share with you guys was something nice and simple something nice and easy an 11 minute web clip from the fine folks at where I guess fine folks the mostly male folks over at Adult Swim make Krueger's of creators of chosen Rick and Morty or at least the hosts of such shows as Rick and Morty but that's not we're here to talk about is Rick and Morty we are here to talk about their 11 minutes short too many cooks too many cooks too many cooks it is an 11 minute video and if you haven't seen it a lot of you I'm sure have that sort of tries to replicate many 90s opening credit songs but things go awry and that's about all I want to say because you should know as little about it as possible before going in because it is who it's gonna be one of the most surreal 11 minutes of your life Definitely Maybe recommend if you do have some cannabis on hand doing some before hand if you're not prone to paranoia if you are definitely pass on it but it's gonna be enjoyable I think for you guys again that is called too many cooks on Adult Swim I'm sure you can find it on YouTube just search too many cooks so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat sand that's gonna do it for this cherry on top as well thank you so much for sticking around to the very end here guys I appreciate it as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "eoUwOPltuzM": "yo what's going on

fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive all right guys back here for another freaking video you already know what it is and if you don't know my name my name is shakka zulu um thanks for freaking watching the video clicking on the video but um today is going to be another freaking review but today i'm going to review um a strain that the people from my freaking live stream wanted me to freaking try out and it is runs guys finally got me one of those rent carts because um a lot of people in my live stream said do the runs over the lemonade and then also like i bought this mainly because a lot of people um saw me do the geo pin and i showed that they had runs for geopin and they want me to do the runs for geopin but i don't want to use the geopin so i just got the 510 thread one so i got the oh obama runs guys let's go but before i get into it you know your boy has to take a rip smoking on the roach right now [Music] and if you haven't seen the video on this i made a video on this it's a disposable um cartridge it's called a roach if you want to check that out it's up there on the screen in the corner but um let's get into it guys so i decided to do runs and runs is actually powered by cookies guys there are um a couple brands that are powered by cookies maybe more but the three main brands are runs lemonade and mints if you guys are cookies fans you kind of know those are the main strains that are the main companies that are powered by cookies but um today we just got the runs and whoo and the runts is also let me sit down for a second let me let me walk over here and sit down so the runts is a lot it's a live sauce i'm pretty sure that's what you call it or it's just a sauce car period as you can see it's kind of golden it's not as dark as a live resin but it's pretty dark and that's because of the added terps if you guys don't know the difference between a disc jillet and a sauce cart it's not much of a difference but distillate when you make distillate usually all the original terpenes are taken out when you make that distillate so what they do to make a sauce cart is they add terpenes back into it to make it a sauce so it's distillate basically with terpenes in it let me get you guys a close-up real quick so you can see the golden goodness today i got the runts and i also have another lemonade but that'll be in another vlog i'll let you guys know when that drops soon before i go into that hit actually let me freaking tell you guys the content in it so it says thca 10 53 milligrams it says delta 9 thc 55 278 milligrams and then it says cbd two milligrams so we got delta tac and then taca they don't even have just you know usually they just have thc on it but they're actually telling you the type of thc that is in this pack so i'm gonna just take this first rib you know just to get the taste and everything and then i'll take a blinker head for you guys because you know i gotta take a blinker head every time i get a new car i gotta take a blinker head at least one on the new cart so let's go okay so off top this is definitely very terpe very sweet and if i didn't say so before it's obama runs it's actually not that bad guys [Music] [Music] so yeah guys man this [ __ ] is like definitely very terpy you can definitely taste the terps but it's also earthy at the same time so maybe it's actually freaking terps that are derived from the actual strain that they made the cart with but it's freaking fire guys oh my goodness this is way better than definitely way better than the last strain that i got i think it was called like metal in or something like that i'll put it on the screen the strain but fire shout out to runs i make some good ass [ __ ] powerball cookies but yeah guys it's just a chill day um today i'm just relaxing i just got off of work got back home you feel me i might live stream i don't know but if you guys want me to live stream like i said man i say this in every vlog comment live stream flood the freaking um comment section with live streams so i know you guys really want me to live stream shout out to the people

personal review first you know the stoners the cannabis community you know someone that's ain't it enough you know that wants to see a full review on this brand you know that's about it so it's just

first of all hold on oh look at that we got some clear it's that clear yo oh look at that and it's a brand new brand and look at this look at the structure of this - it's like black it's just nice it's just it's different you know and like always everybody we're using the regular select universal battery but yeah that's the logo right here we got some Eden Oh one thing about this - that I do like about this brand is that they have this brand hold on Cheers hmm tastes just like it bro tastes just like jacker and his/her area shout out man shout outs of eating bro this is my first time ever trying this brand whoa that cough came kind of late whoo my first hit Tom wants his brand-new Club this cannabis club and they have freaking like sauce diamond cards dude oh dude let me [ __ ] I want to search that [ __ ] up but I want to see a thing is instead of searching it up I'm gonna just have to reveal it but some guy was like the bud center I was like oh so out of all these brands are here man which shouldn't like do you recommend what should you like he's like this is a new one you know he's like a lot of people like that raw garden cart so I'll select cards sneezies they got the pax pax is a little bit different I think that's that's a little bit different they got some one will caught a battery or something they calm darts the darts or something like that something like that and he told me that this is like the necks of up-and-coming brand and I'm like okay you know what I gotta test this [ __ ] out you know first of all let's do that quick little test yup stuck no one oh [ __ ] so you know we're not smoking a hot dog water cuz we smoke that [ __ ] once the one like oh oh the state just like decorate honestly it really just tastes just exactly like the [ __ ] like distrain to be honest with you guys like so little piney some five sativa 81.4 six percent THC so we're getting to the low where the low 80s right here so it's just cool you know it's a nice little wake and bake I did actually smoke a little bit earlier this new dish with the foot I did actually wake them back using this and I got a man the high is not too strong you know it's not like crazy you're not crazy lit you're feeling it but you know you're definitely so it's cool you know especially like for like morning jobs and sure you don't want to get too baked but you want to kind of get baked just to kind of like you know go on with the morning you know does that make sense it doesn't matter because I don't I don't make sense you know but you know cuz like against like rock garden real raw garden is a cartridge that you're gonna get [ __ ] baked but like I'll take like two three roots of that [ __ ] and I'm at all cloud ten there's some [ __ ] cloud 22 have you guys ever known as I hit this is it like a blast I'll grab the shell be that she kind of packs a punch the taste tillow piney little bit you know little piney come out with like a lot of new cartridges and stuff like that and I to be honest with you guys and I'm gonna be real with you guys man I don't think cartridges are healthy for you whatsoever I mean if you think about it hers has you know some flour that shit's been around for a minute and wax and all that shit's been around for like would they see like 3040 years or some [ __ ] you know like 40 years I think so it's like with all this new [ __ ] coming out and all these like chemicals are sick of man I you know what this is 100% cannabis you know it's 100% but sometimes when you guys buy certain brands I mean these are cool these are cool these are all like you know I think they're they're they're FDA approved you know they're like they're legal you know 100% legal it's been tested all that [ __ ] so I can't do like no crazy arm obviously smoking wax can cause like can cause harm over time you know I can [ __ ] damage your lungs all that smoke no matter if it's bait cigarettes whatever smoke [ __ ] I suppose being your life mashup fuk so but as I was saying like I feel like a lot of there's probably a lot of companies [ __ ] [ __ ] there's a lot of companies out there a lot of wax cartridge companies right we're gonna sell you some fire [ __ ] you're gonna be smoking that [ __ ] but little do we know man that has some type of chemical that could cause cancer like 30 40 years down the line yo and that's what a lot of people are saying to like when you guys are smoking try not to like over smoke trying to get all crazy with them because again these cards bro we're smoking them these cards came out I was even [ __ ] high school Bravo's out of high school these [ __ ] came out I first came I first got my first card back in like 2016 honestly like in 2016 and I'm just like damn it's only been out for like five under like six who knows how many years let me know in the comments down below like what year was the first year you guys got your first cartridge but I was like oh it was 2016 I got my first brass knuckles you know I got it off a plug - so a little did I know spice smoking some fake-ass [ __ ] you know who [ __ ] knows I've never seen a cartridge none of mine but besides the one that I reviewed on this channel - super Lemon Haze that fake art besides that one other than that you know I've never had a cart that it was like watery inside all the carts I've ever had in my entire life always had you know it was always thing but again you never know so it's just like I think about it somebody that smokes cards I can tell you guys a story right now man the time I apply some fake cards I don't even know it one time I bought six cards right cuz it was like a deal was like a hundred and something for like six like six cards right so I'm like [ __ ] it right let's put my plug again this was like two or three years ago for my playground like lucky I bought six cards dude's albums [ __ ] it was the first time to where I was like walking in my house and [ __ ] and I was just puffing on the shamino was all my [ __ ] but you know and you know when when I had the family [ __ ] I'd be in my room just puffing on that [ __ ] you know gaming watching the movie getting [ __ ] baked in my room and I was like bruh it's just sick I don't stink I don't go I don't lose I don't gotta go out of my way shit's a row sum up you know and [ __ ] go song something stink you know era like [ __ ] this shagging I could just get kicked back slap charge my charge my battery put this [ __ ] on take it [ __ ] bag Jesus whoo anyways I suppose six cards and under like like a week and a half or likes imagine that six cards for us like a [ __ ] full last gram for like two days smoking but I would wake up in the middle of the night coughing I would cough cough all the time especially when I would I would wake up in the middle of the night in my throat would be so itchy I had to take off medicine and I would always cough all the time bro all the time and I was like look bud and I stopped smoking Carson are like you know that bro mm-hmm to be honest with each other I think I was smoking them fake cards all right but uh bless my health right bless my lungs and I was like [ __ ] dude but anyways like stuff like that right I'm thinking about that there's still [ __ ] little fake cards being sold out to like a bunch of like high schoolers and [ __ ] like that like people who shouldn't even be smoking in the first place it has like it's batch number and all the shit's like it's manufactured the company their license you know it's just snatched and it's just all natural you know it's like natural cannabis you know and it even talks about here so what's the company has a license and all that [ __ ] then you should be pretty [ __ ] good you know you got a as our license you know but a [ __ ] man has a lot of warnings out here man I would just say my advice is try not to smoke a [ __ ] load of cards you know limit your self to like two three quarts [ __ ] a month you know what I try to do is I try to limit myself to like I would say maybe like a half gram cart this is me halftime cart like every like 12 to 14 days so like a week we can have two like two weeks you know around there you know that's what I would say I'd give it maybe like two weeks sometimes if I if I another notice when I caught carts I caught maybe like three a month to be honest with you guys and they're not even four grams you know this month I would say let's see what did I review I've reviewed probably one 1/2 gram of select 1/2 gram of bra garden and then a full gram of all pounding this thoughts about like teen Rams and a half you know I'm not bad I guess [ __ ] I'm telling you guys man I know hello people that bro no [ __ ] kill a [ __ ] half Grammy today and I'm like although [ __ ] me eyes imagine you know so that I'll be here bro and I'm puffing a [ __ ] Sasuke I just can't take big hits bro my the way my body to my lungs whatever the [ __ ] the way something going on whatever is inside my body man like I don't know if you guys know this about I washes when you guys watch these videos I do not take the fattest drags ever like I take little tiny kick back drags um cuz if I'll take fat drags man I'm [ __ ] dying like I'll take a couple minutes for me to like recovery shake you know song like look you know but honestly how I you know how I see it is I do I'm taking just normal-sized hits bro my tolerance will not go super high cuz again I got other friends man and they take fat ribs and they're like bro my tolerance is so high they gotta take like [ __ ] point for size dad's and I'm like damn bro you you literally could [ __ ] kill the whole Grammy like four or five dads you know for them it's just like whatever and I'm like but anyways everybody again I hope you guys are enjoying these videos man these are all just reviews you know there's literally just educational videos like I'm not not convincing anybody to go smoke or anything like that this is just for people that already smoke cannabis users you know cannabis patients just for the knowledge you know just a relaxing perfect high you know I mean I hit this [ __ ] by like seven eight nine times already and I'm [ __ ] bait you know but one thing I do gotta give it to you guys man is I like your guys as a design man this even design is dope I like it like it doesn't even feel cheap it doesn't at all like the car is a little the carts pretty heavy now Cano I mean all carts are heavy but this car just feels like I just like the material of it you know and I feel like you could screw this off you could refill it you know I think you can do all that [ __ ] and eat and I think Eden's new to let's see if it has three that it's next to the company name no it doesn't show it apply online but I'm Way too [ __ ] lazy to get my phone you know so Eden so far you guys is regular cards okay I enjoy them especially this one and right now I feel like I feel creative you know I feel like I could go on my computer in shock I start getting down I start writing down ideas I start editing videos cuz again I do have a main channel go down to my description it's called I'm crunchy one we're at 120 one case ups or 120 cases around there you know um but the next step is gonna be your guys as you guys is diamonds cartridge second it's a soft diamond there's something like that but I saw up close and I was like oh [ __ ] this looks like some sauce divers it filled with diamonds little tiny diamonds and just like sauce no Mike I think this is some sauce to this is something I was just like [ __ ] here we have it everybody eatin fire I'll show you guys I'll for sure get the Diamonds cartridge because that's gonna be like the first honestly that's like the only cartridge I've ever seen that has diamonds inside I'm like oh [ __ ] are you gonna be able to smoke this but you do need to buy a eating battery that comes with it you can't be using I guess the ordinary you got to use the battery that they give you see that means you gotta buy that [ __ ] so I'm like okay I'm down I'm down you know depending on like this one and I like this one this one's far you know it doesn't get you like extremely [ __ ] like oh my god I can't function high but it gives you like the [ __ ] right high like it's just as cool as to this fire I like it looking everybody we do not condone the usage of these products I'm Marti warning you guys and shit's not healthy for you even though you know it is it is approved you know it is government approved and all that [ __ ] but I do not condone the usage and I'm not promoting any sales or I don't even sell anything on this channel it's literally just a personal review and a review that could be used just for an educational purpose you know this for someone else you know for like a cannabis patient a patient a new let's you can see like a new cannabis patient they don't really know much about cannabis and they don't really like smoking smoking but they do like baby you know there's like you know what it's [ __ ] crazy man it blows my mind how there's so many people there's another like a good there's another group of people that are older they're like you know London late thirties in [ __ ] and one time like it's like kind of I got a family party right family friends all that [ __ ] right and one time I was just like we're just drinking whatever again everybody this is all an educational you know we're [ __ ] we're inside we're in the backyard you know cousin's backyard I take out a pen and I'm puffing on actually I'm like and I started coughing like I'm like I had a heavy hitter I think yeah I was like a heavy hitter right and I was like dude I'm like oh I'm [ __ ] I'm like damn so lately my cousin hit it again he's older than me he was like at the time he was like 26 and I was like 21 or some [ __ ] yes I said he starts coughing and one of our uncles like he's hella cool whatever you know he's cause dude he comes through he's like smoking his cigarette and he's like he's like what is that and I'm like oh this is a he's like he's like is that babe and we're like nice it's teach it's pretty much teach THC vape 16 C babe what the [ __ ] Hey they have [ __ ] like that and he's old school you know so I'm just like am I like Dan you never had this sheen there he does you know that he's like yeah and that we're like ganna try this [ __ ] out and he takes some red Bull he takes a rip oh [ __ ] [ __ ] man but think about it this was a Stoke head this guy loves stones anyway he's like this will [ __ ] um he rips that [ __ ] right he [ __ ] starts coughing all that she's like - his spies I would you get that she's I just go to the club you know go to the campus club he's like oh she's like I just and they're like oh we just like looked out of mass and [ __ ] were telling the Machine run and what's the crazy part about it is that now when he has like little get-togethers or some [ __ ] you see this fool with the [ __ ] battery like he doesn't really suck cigarettes anymore I'm like oh my head I'm like down we could have potentially like saved his [ __ ] life that day literally for him like this would like see his [ __ ] body because he says that you could smoke these anywhere and you get like a head high and my head I'm like oh my and I had were like no that's you're literally just high you know he said well it feels like it feels like you know I've smoked a cigarette but it's like the beginning the beginning feeling of the cigarette which is the head high he's got but I feel like that for like two hours and in my head when I tell you know he's sick he's like fallings an animal you know we're like we're like down but technically shoes go from smoking cigarettes every day to smoking this [ __ ] and he doesn't in any sense doesn't really buy a lot he says he only smokes maybe like like three or four of the big ones at a month big ones so it's like a gram you know he smokes like three four grams I'm like you know what back there needs to smoke like two three cigarettes a day so I'm like you know what that's cool I mean [ __ ] it's still unhealthy as [ __ ] this [ __ ] but hey you know what better than smoking tobacco right it sounds like damn dude we could probably we just [ __ ] expanded his life his [ __ ] life right there dude like who could've who knows [ __ ] crazy man 20 30 years from now bro he could have had lungs all [ __ ] up brooch and but then again you know 20 40 years from now bro [ __ ] knows what kind of what what what the what the wax would do to us I say you know I'm just I'm just trying to speak the truth you know it's like who knows you know in reality like getting it go good or could go bad you know hopefully it goes good you know cuz this is all tested and all that [ __ ] but hey sometimes man some companies bro the labels you just can't but then again if you buy it at a club bro then it's you should be fine you know just don't abuse it that's it it's gonna be zit because I used two views that [ __ ] and I would wake up like three four in the morning cough my lungs out it was everybody I hope you guys enjoyed this review makes you

ladies and gents we are back with another review you already know it's been a couple days since my last review I just wanted to say real quick that that's because I've had a lot of stuff going on at school some really important tests and stuff I usually have really important tests all throughout the year but this this specific course in my school kicking my ass it's really difficult but we're good through it we just finished today so I'm treating myself I'm treating you guys we got a new video it's about to be smack right before we jump into this video let's go ahead and throw it out there this channel is a adult smoking cannabis channel only it's for 18 to 21 and up depending on your state and how legal medical or recreational marijuana is I'm here in Arizona I have my own medical card everything I do on this channel is legal yeah so now that that's out of the way I guess we can get right into this so I'm completely sober right now I smoked a little bit this morning awesome an old cart that I had actually was a venom acts I was supposed to do a video for that but I just like I said school was just training me I was stressed I just couldn't do it but I the two cars that I showed in the last the strange Saturday which we're still debating if we want to do Sunday or not but the let's train Saturday I said I had two carts those were venom X's I think they were tangi I don't remember pineapple tangi or something like that I got i don't remember the strain but i threw out the boxes but they were supposed to be two different ones now it's going to review them and have two two videos two completely separate videos but since they were the same it would have been useless and only one video and like I said I just was stressed as [ __ ] so I just skipped out of it and didn't do a video but we are we're here with another video and I got to cut two videos coming up here so this one and then another one the cards were reviewing on these two videos are gonna be pure earth no I don't remember exactly I could be wrong but the first pure earth cart I did actually was one of them I beated viewed videos I think in their first or second which is actually insane so if this video can be even like 1/4 or 1/2 of that that would be dopes mad appreciation so the cart we're gonna review today though is the pure earth DJ short right there I don't know if you can see that there you go um uncut VAP cartridge is a half gram I won't lie to you guys these are probably my favorite boxes I've seen out of any descent cart they're just so [ __ ] elegant I don't know it's just it's super dope um I don't know if y'all are into video games or anything like that but there's this game called destiny - there's this raid at the boss by Calvin our model remember that narrates called but this [ __ ] color scheme anyway flashbacks if you play that game but yeah this box is clean and and just like the other one they're the same box got a little pull tab there I'm pure earth it you know somehow some rep saying this or whatever [ __ ] yeah you guys killed this box gorgeous box so on the back here says in infused with authentic cannabis terpenes no PG propylene glycol propylene glycol PG I don't know what that is or MCT I don't know what that is a proprietary pure atropine and cannabinoid profiles so that's what that says right there on the back right there then there's their website and then all their other information blah blah says requires pure earth battery for use this product has been tested for potency wow that's cool so that says that on the back right there and then read above that it says right here this little like black dark black line so the extremely potent cartridge use small draws until comfortable with the effects so that's super dope I'm excited this isn't my first pure earth like I said I do not remember at all what that one was what the strain was how it hit anything like that so if you guys want to know before you see this video go ahead and check it out you know check out my channel you know life subscribe do all that [ __ ] if you haven't of course but well let's go ahead and open this [ __ ] up I think you just pull okay there's a sticker right here the best thing to use lightning cables for if you have an iPhone is for cutting a little like [ __ ] piece of corners like that [ __ ] yeah cool boom and then not a tape no that's done boom she just slides on out there and it oh no I thought it locked um so it didn't fall out but it doesn't uh box [ __ ] hollow box it's a very sturdy box so that she you know you could take this [ __ ] and eat it and not really have to worry too much about breaking the cart which is which is really nice that's uh that's a good feature to have on carts let's do a little hydration break here guys drinking another pees tea Georgia Peach you already know yall already know so here's the Box simple box right there on the front it even says it says the this is an indica dominant so I didn't even say that this isn't in a kendama net strain it's like 8020 ad indica xx sativa but you know basically indica just oh that's nice so this is a little really soft foam packaging so it's gonna be even harder to break your carts in here if you drop or throw them in your backpack or whatever you got to do that was loud I apologize for that um yeah so here's the cart so this is pure earth there on the front super dope and then here on the back yeah well cuz I'm a terrible youtuber and everything like that it says the strain which is oh I drew that [ __ ] it says the strain which is DG a short and then it says that it is an eighty indica 20 sativa so it shows you like the breakdown which is super cool it's going to pop this cap off alright there we go there's the bottom authentic see so [ __ ] you know you already know here we got the dr. zodiacs Moonrock battery here I really want to get another one of those cards just to have the battery to be honest but those cards did smack as well we just charged this one up you already know how I am when it comes to hits on the cards I think a fully charged battery is always gonna hit hella harder that just makes a [ __ ] ton of sense to if you'll think about it I mean you know but if you guys like to you know use your batteries all day that's fine I do - I did - I burned through them then I charged them for the [ __ ] video so cuz I want to show you guys the potency I had its finest so let's do one more quick hydration break here without out of what what did I just say and with that out of the way let's go ahead and take our first draw up this DJ short nice it was cheesy shortcake doesn't say it's on the bus it says DJ short but anyway guys Cheers hopefully you guys are smokin medicating along with me let me know if you are now in the comments I'm always interested to see what you guys are smoking on guys well tooth Wow Wow that tastes man i that tastes exactly like like a strawberry shortcake that's that's part guys that is that is delicious man awesome let me show you the wax here kind of got a little piece of paper here so you can kind of see a contrast there super dope so that was I just realized like that was me probably shelling off the goddamn lakhs for like 30 seconds and I'm gonna tell you why because I'm already feeling this [ __ ] hard I was facing now I just face that [ __ ] showing you guys what I actually hydrate afraid but oh I hope you guys can't hear that noise I was watching Bohemian Rhapsody outside a little bit of a Bond movie if you guys haven't seen that Mia shut the door boo boo that door shut look at that Pro youtubers - the yellow shouldn't have heard that but you got it anyway nice um back to the part I'm a big fan of this part already I'm a big fan of all my cars to be honest but this one's flavor wise right on there probably not eight out of ten nine out of ten easily potency just not one hit man that's a it's like a four I'm already gonna for pretty good so [ __ ] let me just kind of regain my breath here like nothing like hitting anything all day so I'm a little Oh what are you doing eating yeah but just gotta get a couple hydration

fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive yo what's up ladies and gents and if you're new to the channel my name is shaka and i'm back here for another video boys what's good how y'all doing i hope everyone's having a good ass week so far man uh i just got off of work you feel me had a change into the x shirt had to go pack a little bowl real quick but today today is not about weed guys today isn't about flour i mean it's not about wheat today is about weed but today it's not about flour guys today is about carts and i haven't tried a new cart in a long time guys something new and today i picked up a cart that i hope is good it's called legion of bloom i'm gonna take a bong rip before i get into it but your boy he has to find a good spot to chill at smoke at get a nice little view you feel me give y'all a view and show you guys if this legend or legion of bloom is actually pretty good so let me sit down for a second yo so we're here so like i said before guys [Music] you guys know i like taking bong ribs we back to that bong grip in the beginning of every video if you guys have been um long subscribers with me you guys know that i used to take a bong rip like before every freaking video so cheers guys [Music] whoo damn it's just some good i got some good outdoor with me right now my outdoor is actually not that harsh the taste isn't that bad i mean it does taste like that outdoor it's not that bad it's not that harsh on my lungs guys but um we're not here about flour guys we're here about balloon [Music] so off jump guys man it says the monarch premium vape cartridge it's a hundred percent derived terpenes it's a distillate cart guys but it's cannabis derived terpenes and these terpenes also are sullivan less terpenes so they're not made with butane or whatnot and then also on the back it says on the ingredients it says triple refined cannabis oil i'm not sure what that means if anyone knows what that means please comment down below i would love to know what that means i'm wondering if it's like alcohol when you distill alcohol over and over so it gets less you know less strong and less like more burn on your throat and like it's more distilled kind of you know more premium so the strain that i got i got one grammar it's mendo breath and i'm gonna be real guys they are good with their packaging i like their packaging it's a nice package you just slide it up and then it also comes with this little card let me give you guys a close-up real quick here we go all right guys so it comes with this card and it says that they won the emerald cups first place in 2019 for their distillate cartridge and then in 2019 they also won third place award for their dislike cartridge so i guess they won two awards during the emerald cup one with the first place and one was a third place so their stuffs are pretty pretty good you should be able to scan them and look it up online maybe i'll do that later i'm not sure but yeah guys the oil looks freaking magnificent it looks closer to like a um to a raw garden the heck yeah guys bro i ain't gonna lie so far this legion of bloom it looks fire as hell i can't even front it looks like it's gonna be a good cartridge for me [Music] comes in a little too and also guys these cartridges are good because they have ceramic coils so it's you're getting less of that metal when you're smoking and you're getting that metal near your lungs from all those other coils that are made out of metal and whatnot these are actually made out of ceramic um made with ceramic coils and um a good brand for ceramic um coils i'm pretty sure is an avd cart but i looked on the bottom of this uh the bottom of this already and i didn't see any brand name but they do say that it's a ceramic coil inside so boom [ __ ] looking nice and gold so let's put it on a cart let's see what it tastes like man let's see what it tastes like but let me look at that see this is the raw garden it's a little bit darker than the raw garden but it's down there similar let me take a hit of the raw gardens real quick nothing beats a raw garden man that beats rawguard we're gonna take the rock garden off we're gonna put the bloom on and they actually have a logo on on the cartridge it's actually pretty nice they put a lot of thought and effort into their cartridge so we're gonna see if they put the same thought and effort into the actual oil to see if it's actually good guys all right all right so usually guys i don't like distillate i don't like distillate cards the only distillate cards that i really like are like sauce carts and stizzy carts those are the only distillate type of carts that i do like and sauce carts they're a little bit different because they add different type of terpenes to it and what not to make it a sauce cart but off a jump this actually reminds me of raw garden this i don't know man this and raw garden are pretty dang similar guys let me hit this one more [Music] time yeah i can definitely taste it tastes like a raw garden earth like you know you got that raw garden that's sweet you know the fruity fruity raw garden but this this one tastes like that earthy that earthy raw garden it's actually pretty damn good i can see why they won the emerald cup now this is actually pretty damn good it's surprising that not a lot of people actually i don't not a lot of people made videos about this i've been looking up seeing if people made videos about it not a lot of people made um videos about legion of bloom shout out to legion of [Music] bloomberg [Music] but yeah guys man i definitely recommend this it's actually a pretty damn good cart i'm actually gonna keep this one on the battery for a little bit you know what i'm saying yo i hope everyone enjoyed this freaking video don't forget to like comment subscribe man it was just a little car review i just had to throw you guys a little car review because your boy picked up and whenever i pick up guys i just want to give you guys a car review show you guys the new things that i that i purchased because you know i like taking risks and i like trying new things you feel me and like um i don't know i'm usually a normally a live resin guy but today we're going to try we got the the distillate legend of bloom and i'm also thinking about trying the new stizzy they have a noose dizzy strain i have to try that um so we're probably gonna get a stizzy soon i'm not sure when but it's coming guys because i know a lot of you guys in the comments wanted me to um do us dizzy so we're gonna do a stizzy a lot of other cocktail cubby guys i'm still trying to do a late night sesh i gotta get another late night session i gotta get a a nature session but i'm also gonna try and make sure that at least once a week guys um i'm gonna give you guys at least a story time because i don't know that it gets back to that um i don't know back to that old school youtube vibe where you just like smoked and you told the story like i feel like that's what a lot of we tubers back then used to do and you know now it's a little bit different there's a lot more reviews and you know challenges and things like that but i love that you know that aspect of just sitting down and it's just like me and you together just sitting here smoking i'm telling stories like i'm talking to you guys you know what i'm saying and we're just chilling smoking and vibing like you're my actually my freaking homies you feel me so thanks for freaking watching the video guys i'm gonna take one more hit and i'm gonna get out i hope everyone has a good week remember to breathe guys and smoke [ __ ] weed man don't stress guys don't stress [Music] [Music] peace [Music] you don't like what you see so you rub up on my energy i just wanna be me smoking on that end of wheat so i just close my eyes because i know that one day everything everything's gonna be all right if i try i know i fly open your eyes and see past my flesh and see in my mind i open my heart you see all my scars you see all the love that i push in the dark i always felt alone so i hop in my car push button start i dream every day as i look to the stars spilling my heart while i'm spitting these bars so", "R_hTLbepKZ8": "[Music] look what we've got here this is a big beautiful bun of something called pancakes and it's from cookies which is a very famous California cultivator actually they're nationwide right now actually really worldwide there are a real powerhouse in flour and I have all the respect for that it's not easy to do that and congratulations to burner and all this success and we love trying his strange so this is a big giant butt and it's really nice when they give us a big jump but and we're gonna load this big giant butt right into the vapor cup so you can see I've got a little bit in the straw already but I'm gonna add in some more there we go and then we're gonna tamp boom boom boom and we're gonna stick this right down into the vapor Cup and what it does it releases the water vapor doesn't burn anything it just releases the water vapor so you get more of an incense experience but you can make a lot of clouds by turning up the heat I use it 330 degrees was just a low temperature because I love the taste it's incredible if you hear people talk about the terpenes that's where the terpene the taste profile is incredible out of a per cup so cookies comes in this packaging and this package yuuka-san some big pancakes on the front and this flour has 19 percent THC and it's not high THC but what makes it kind of unique too is it has 13% CBD which is a huge amount of CBD and so let's see how everything works together the Terps the CBD the THC let's see if it's pancakes is the best so we've got this cup set to 330 we're looking for super euphoric flowers so let's check out pancakes by cookies there's a very smooth flower very smooth just like a powdery weedy taste it's a soft weedy taste so I used the word powder because it's really light like powder this flan was a hybrid I got it at dr. green thumbs I love trying new cookie strains so what did we think of pancakes we're looking for the best cookie cents a whole huge line of strains well where does pancakes fall into place I would say I'm giving this flour an 8 to 5 it was this smooth day it was really enjoyable had big buds but it wasn't the most euphoric to me and actually I didn't even think it wasn't strong it's okay if you want to try pancakes go right ahead it's in the stores right now but for me there's other strains of cookies that I like better thanks for watching I'm the doctor I hope you liked the video if you want to see paper cup you can see it at vapor cup com if you want to see Ellie's best range there at wheat entertainment com if you like the videos please subscribe and join us on the doctor thanks for joining in party on my friends [Music] you [Music]", "UrJJjwEnSeI": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today I'm bringing you guys a video that is based on special requests from a lot of our viewers that want to know exactly how to pick out the best oil tank now this is normally not a video I would do because out of all this assortment of oil tanks that I have put together is basically comprising of about everything on the market on our website we probably sell about five or six of them now I have these in our testing lab because I'm always testing them we do have a lot of extractors that we private label for that we might be making this these cartridges for that might not be available but one of the common questions that a lot of our users are having that really wanted to see this video up is I have a honey stick battery when I go to dispensary and I have an option of picking out prefilled cartridges how do I know which one's gonna be good or how it's gonna work you know so this video here is gonna go through from you being able to eyeball an oil 5-10 disposable cartridge and being able to tell bass have a good reasonable estimate of how it is gonna be able to perform what it will kind of features it's gonna have so that you can pick out the best oil vape tank for your battery now what is a disposable 510 thread cartridge so there's a lot of people out there who purchase these 510 thread oil cartridges to fill themselves and they say but if it's disposable can I only fill it one time so the short answer is no most of these tanks you can take if you're buying them empty you can fill them up four to five times without a problem however some of them you can only fill once and we'll go over that other times when you go to dispensary most of them already have oil in them so just because you have an amazing cartridge if you're buying a bad extract not even the best cartridge can make a bad oil taste good so however you can have good oil where the whole vaping experience gets dulled down or made bad or taste burnt from a bad cartridge so what this video is gonna help you do is it's gonna help you make some educated decisions when it comes to purchasing and selecting either the cartridge you're gonna fill at home or the cartridges that you're gonna pick up prefilled to know how they're gonna perform so let's start off by starting from the very top of the cartridges of how you're gonna be able to start making some identification so let's do a close up here and start off with when you look at the mouthpiece to see what the hole size is gonna be let's start at the tip and work our way to the bottom okay guys so here we have a close-up view we're gonna start at the very top of the cartridge so we can go in and start making some determinations so you can see I put together what I thought was the best assortment of pre fillable disposable tanks so the tops let's go to the very top first things first generally the wider bore you have on mouthpiece which is the part that you inhale through the more vapor you're gonna get the smaller that hole is you are gonna get either less vapor or it's gonna have a smoother easier transition into your mouth so let's let's take a shot from the top here just to show the differences in the size of the bores so basically as you could see from this basic stylus plastic tip car it has a very small Inlet hole even these stainless steel ones here right they have relatively small and some of them are larger when we work our way down you have these wide bore mouthpieces which have very wide inlets if you're a person who really likes to vape like this one is probably the widest if you like to get a big cloud and a massive hits that you can really draw air through with minimal amount of resistance you probably want to get a cartridge that has a wider bore hole at the very top as opposed to having one of the smaller tips that are more focused on smoothness now some people have said that the wider bore the mouthpieces sometimes you get a little flavor loss because you're just going straight mouth to lung instead of kind of mouth to thrill to lung on your inhale it kind of focuses more on just going straight to lung however you probably get better activation and more of a hit now once you've figured out what size borer you want there's a whole multitude of mouthpiece materials as you can see you start off with the basic plastic mouthpiece which is very lightweight and then you have stainless steel and then you have ceramic which you can see here you even have wood and kind of an acrylic resin and then you have not stainless steel but more of a aluminum coated metal so I can tell you right off the bat if you are at or if you like tattoo on your cartridges like in high school I wouldn't want people to see what my pencil number two pencils look like but luckily I grew out of that but you know people sometimes chew on their cigarettes chew on their cartridges if you art or you know you have the plastic option that's not going to break your teeth but you don't want little plastic particles getting into your mouth so you're probably best off going with a natural wood cartridge so this is a natural wooden mouthpiece it's very soft wood it's not even sealed with an epoxy for coating however if you're gonna be refilling this a lot do get new tips because when you chew on them they are gonna get beat up and the moisture sitting on wood does not bode well you also have the acrylic and the metal ones if you chew I would stay far from the metal ones you're gonna end up breaking your teeth the ceramic what's a really unique offering with ceramic style mouthpieces is that they say that it's very clean very easy to get clean it also feels sturdy like the metal ones however doesn't feel heavy in your so it's it's very natural on to the lips and it offers again it's super easy to clean off it's much lighter than the stainless steel pieces and it just feels overall more natural to wear as a stainless steel one you know you are putting a little piece of metal into your mouth and what's unique let's say about the powder coated ones to where it's not like a shiny stainless steel and thick metal it's a much thinner metal and it's coated so it's never you know really gonna be cold to your lips if you pick them up if it's been in the AC or whatnot so when selecting your mouthpiece you have your the bore of the inlet hole and you also have the mouthpiece material now mouthpiece shape also makes a difference generally as you can see you're very wide bore ones are very cylindrical and that is to just allow maximum vapor to come up through them these flattened mouthpieces that look more like black and milds are gonna dull the vapor down condense it and make it a smoother transmission so again we're going back to wide bore more vapor flattened is gonna possibly be smoother if you're undecided and you want in between the two you have these kind of hookah style tips that have a relatively wide wide bore but they don't get flattened too much to restrict the vapor so mouthpiece shape and size definitely the first point of contact with the cartridge in kind of a first way that you can determine it now what we're gonna do is we're gonna take all these cartridges out and we're gonna talk about what the body of the tank brings to the game okay guys now before we move on to going over what the differences are between the body of the tanks one more notable thing about the mouthpiece is if you are buying your cartridges to refill whether you buy to a dispenser buy them from guys like us to refill the one thing that you have to know when you're dealing with tops is there is a new type of top which child safety is really big in the industry right now so there are compression tops that once the extractor or you fill them up and you basically crimp them down right you see there's no screw here once you crimp this down this cartridge is not coming back apart for you to refill so then once you go through your initial extract right on a childproof crimp lock here there's a pop top you're not gonna be able get back into this cartridge without breaking it and so you're not going to be all refilled so if you're looking for more than one use out of your cartridge don't buy the crimp tops this is also crimp top as you could see there's no threading and you can see this is one of the newer resin cartridge is actually very popular cartridge so once you push that down you're not getting back into it now let's talk about the body of these things now you have generally two types of outside bodies or reservoirs which house the oil that you're gonna be filling you generally have plastic and you have glass now things to look for is plastic cartridges generally they're not as popular anymore because people you know they want purity when you fill up a plastic cartridge it sits for a long time I don't know if it's true or not I'm not a scientist but they say they could alter the change the oil if it sits in there because the THC can react with the plastic and also the components in there so they say a glass is much better to store things in because it is going to be medically neutral to reacting and if you are going for a glass especially the Pyrex grade of glass is going to be perfect because it's also not sensitive the temperature changes so if you're going plastic tank where are the advantages well the advantages are is you're never gonna shatter your tank and they're super lightweight so they're gonna be much lighter so if you're taking it out hiking or sporty and you don't want to carry around the tank plastic tank weighs about half of what a glass tank does and plastic with a plastic mouthpiece it does not get much lighter and but if you're looking at already a plastic tank you have different grades of plastic and you can tell that from the clarity you see this is a little bit foggy this a lot of people would think is a glass tank but it is actually an upgrade plastic tank it just has a much higher quality clarity so this is an upgrade plastic tank that just has better clarity and among plastic tanks one of the most popular ones now is you have actually resin tanks which are like this generally they come in mouthpieces like this set up right here this is actually a resin tank you really can't tell the difference between the glass and the resin except the difference is is one will shatter if you hit it hard enough and one will not now if you are buying glass there are different grades of glass you know the company that does cartridges like this I'm sure you guys are familiar brassknuckles is a prime example of somebody who focus on cartridges like this this is a very thick grade of glass and you can tell that by touching it and honestly you can probably eyeball it to tell how thick the grade of glasses so you look at it it's gonna be thicker glass this glass this tank right here which is our cloud tank actually uses a very thick Pyrex certified glass so this is actually a very expensive good glass it's very hard you don't really have to worry about it breaking or shattering it's a very thick and sturdy and other tanks are thinner glass for example this one you can tell generally tell if the glass is very very shiny and it almost looks like plastic basically that is indication without touching it that it is a thinner glass so those are just some things out the body you want to be careful of now when also looking at the body center post that has become a big Arian debate within the market because generally plastic tanks don't have center post so we'll just move those over here if you look at a center post you can see some of them have wide bases some of them don't have a base some of them have rounded bases right they all have a different structure now what's the significance basically if you have a center post that has there's very thin it is more likely that the tank if you are refilling it that the center post will not be secure when you're securing the top piece down to the center post that it could wobble go out of place and possibly leak the downside so then people put in a wider base to make it more stable take up a little more space make sure that you can screw the tank down and you're not gonna have any areas of leakage the thing is with a bigger center post is sometimes oil gets caught on the transition areas or on the hills of the center post so then if you do have a wide center post base you want to make sure it's nicely rounded so you're not gonna get oil or any wastage caught up there that would make your tank less fuel efficient for example our ELF cartridge here in pink as you can see it's a wider center post but there are no slopes in there that the oil can get caught on so you're gonna use a much larger percentage of the oil that's not going to get caught in the center post transition however going right from center post talks down to the heater okay let's talk heaters most basically you have your wick cartridge as you can see it has a wick that stays up that is wrapped in a heating element wire usually those wicks are made of silica and what happens is it absorbs the oils and it burns them and these happen just fine however it's not going to do you justice and accentuating the taste of the oils and especially if you have thick oils that dry up around there you can actually taste the heater and burn the heater before you burn the oil so if you don't have a pre heat function you have a wick you could run into some issues with taste there so a lot of upgrades have moved to wick list cartridges this is a plastic those are beekeeper replacement tank it is same concept however it has no wick and it has a ceramic heating element a lot of cartridges that say they're ceramic and you can see they're ceramic generally with seeing a little white block through the inlet holes so you could see some of them have a little white block that means they are ceramic powered generally ceramic heaters mean that you're gonna get better taste better flavor notes better flavor accentuation now it's become really popular lately is this what a lot of people have coined as si cell style technology in heaters which means that you have a ceramic block inside of the actual heater itself let's find a nice example right there that is a perfect example of a cease tell it's a coated ceramic block they have good heat up times and right now they're probably considered a very nice performance tank on the market however your problems with these are is that once you've run through a filler to the taste can drop off with thicker oils if you do not have a preheat function they can fight they can heat differently so generally you want a more viscous oil with your C cells and if they don't have a wide enough Inlet hole which is the next area that we're gonna talk about you could run into some clog \u00e4j-- issues but these have a coated block it's not no rocket science abouts just a different take on a ceramic cartridge if you look this has a ceramic block however it is forced down so this is gonna use oils very efficiently this is actually an updated version of the cloud tank and half mil so that is a ceramic block heater you get good taste notes on these and then you have units that are wickless but they don't have a ceramic heater that have different sized Inlet holes now since we're talking about inlet holes what's the general rule of thumb on Inlet holes you go to dispensary and see different sizes and shapes of inlet holes as we showed the C cell had a very wide end lit hole and other tanks like a cloud tank has a relatively wide inlet hole but not overly wide so the general rule of thumb is is that the thicker your oil is that you are putting in there the wider of an inlet hole you're gonna need so that the oil can properly have access to the heater and vaporize if you have a thin inlet hoyle a hole a small Inlet hole and you have very thick oils it's going to be very hard for that oil to come in contact with the heater and actually burn so you are gonna want if you have thick oils to have a large Inlet hole so that that oil is always having contact with the heater however what if you have a large inlet hole and you have thin oils well your your possibility of leaking down through the post goes up exponentially so if you have very thin oils don't go crazy and get tanks with really large Inlet holes because then you could have leakage you could have wastage or the oil is gonna burn up very very quickly so I think that about covers what we would talk about with the inlet holes now air flow control air flow control is available on some tanks we have our cloud tank it has an air flow control here at the top this all ceramic tank right here has air flow controls at the bottom this tank has air controls atop certain tanks have this and what this is for is to allow you to control your hit when you open up the air hole it allows you to bring in air it allows you to bring an air from the outside to kind of dilute and aerate your hit if you have it closed then you can concentrate your hit to basically only draw the vapor out of the tank and out of the little air holes are located around the tank but if you open it you can draw more air so you can take a bigger volume hit but it some people like to concentrate their hit and not allow you to do that so what is the downfall of the air control the positive is you can control your hits and really tune in on what intensity of a hit you want the downfall is if you leave it open like it is partially open now then you put it on its side and it's tilted well that's an area where you can experience some serious top leakage out of the tank a lot of measures are there to prevent that but it could happen so if you're somebody who gets airflow control and you don't use it just make sure to always keep them closed now since we've basically covered all angles of how to evaluate a tank how to eyeball it let's go over one more piece that is about the bottom air holes so some tanks at a dispensary you're probably not having to see the bottom air hole so this is probably the least important part of our oil tank analysis here but an important fact for you to know is generally the larger the bottom air hole is okay a lot of these run on a ball bearing system so that when you draw or you vaporize a ball bearing moves out of place and allows the vapor to pass through and when it's not being used it goes down and creates a seal so no oil comes and down through the the tank however if you do not have an air hole it is not going to work with auto draw units and a lot of you guys have Auto draw batteries a lot of people have elves out there so if you are buying a tank for your auto draw battery make sure with your dispensary that you have an air hole at the bottom of the tank and that it is compatible with auto draw batteries we tell people this all the time it's one of the most common mistakes people buy a tank they have an auto draw battery or an elf they say my unit or my tank is a dud it's not it's just not compatible with the two so if you have auto draw make sure you have an air hole make sure that it's a decent air hole as you can see this unit does not have an air hole so it is not going to be compatible with Stylus batteries it's not going to be compatible with our elf you could see our elf replacement cartridge has a very nice pronounced air hole with even some side vents so you want to make sure that you're picking up the right cartridge now for the very last part of this because we now gave you all the tools that you're gonna need to keep in mind when you're out tank shopping now I'm just gonna run through these tanks and basically give you the rundown of what you can expect out of each one of these tanks so that if you see one of these tanks on the shelf you basically know what you're getting into so hang tight while we get back to this final shoot all right guys now we're gonna run through each one of these tanks and just give you a very brief description of what you can expect for usage and the pluses and minuses of them so that when you're out tank shopping and you see one of these things you have a good idea of what you're gonna get so starting off with really the basic plastic stylist tank with the flat head tip you're gonna get this cartridge and it has a wick so you're not gonna don't expect a big boy taste or big boy hits this is really meant to be a light on-the-go reliable non leak easy to fill tank these run on the blue plug fill system very easy to fill very easy to mass fill but if you have thick oils and they get coagulated around there you can get burnt silica taste if you're not preheating properly in here so this isn't really a flavor tank or a monster hit tank but what it is is really an Old Faithful tank that you'll fill super light is gonna take a beating so if you're into extreme sports this is probably your tank if you want to upgrade from that stay plastic but go with a wickless something that has a ceramic heater or beekeeper replacement cartridge with a metal mouthpiece same very reliable top blue plug fill not gonna get any leaking the ceramic heater is definitely to give you much better flavor notes and more smoothness over the traditional wick system and the stainless steel mouthpiece is a similar shape but it's a higher quality fit and finish and feel then we have basically the upgraded glass version this is a childproof tank it will lock in place after it is filled it has relatively smaller inlet holes meant for more viscous oils and it is ceramic so you're gonna get about the same taste but you're gonna have the purity of glass that your oils are interacting with over plastic basically same thing except it is refillable you can unscrew this top okay a lot of flavor rx cartridges come in come into this style it is not ceramic you have some decent sized Inlet holes however not too wide and you have good center post support so there's going to be a good reliable glass tank however the mouthpiece on these things is heavy and it is flattened so it is more focused on smoothness not hits you have our elf replacement cartridge full ceramic very lightweight ceramic mouthpiece that you have in different colors it's gonna feel good on the lips and it has the unique design center posts that is wide so it's still gonna give you good support however you're not gonna have any oil that gets caught up sitting on there you're gonna use a big chunk of oil really fuel-efficient nice power awesome flavor tank then you have basically a gold finished tank that is somewhat popular out there similar square tip design nothing really special ceramic heaters the one problem is is you have this really big flat top ledge a lot of oils can get caught up there that you might never be able to vape so this is kind of an old-school design but it does have good seals it feels good in the hand and its relatively light basically here's the updated version this one migrated actually to a CE cell style so you're gonna get a good heat up time it is light however still not a hundred percent feeling the center post because you are gonna get oils that get stuck up there now this is a more modern C cell with a bullet-shaped battery we sell these along with the ceramic mouthpiece style as our elf replacement cartridge you're gonna get some more performance out of these because they have wider heater holes they have that C cell Center and you're gonna be able to get good flavor hits off of them they have you have a nice air inlet hole so they'll run well with Auto draw batteries you're gonna get some good power out of this tank actually this tank right here is a brand new tank I haven't tested it yet it is a fully ceramic interior so it's good to put its advertising that it's extremely pure taste it also a ceramic heater I'm not a hundred percent sure on the bottom air flow generally to me bottom air flow could leak so I haven't tested this tank yet but my team does have samples these because some of our customers are requesting a full blown ceramic tank this is basically just a 1 mil version a different mouthpiece version of this tank that we were talking about so difference is you can have a ceramic mouthpiece it's gonna feel a little bit more natural and this one no air hole not going to work well with Auto draw batteries here and I can tell you from holding it it is a little heavier than I would like to see a tank this cartridge right here generally you'll see them filled in brassknuckles cartridges very good cartridge works with most auto draw batteries as well as battery-powered these have one mil fill size I like the bowling pin style tip it's not exactly a wide bore but still definitely wide begin nice hits and it is thin down for some elegance the gold finish that these guys have done is pretty cool so if you're looking for a good prefilled cartridge I mean these have generally been pretty reliable I haven't heard any problems of leaking they have good taste they don't really excel so much in taste they don't excel so much in vapor but it's one of those tanks to where it does do a lot of all those right it runs at about 90% ultra reliable I've heard here you have the resin and resin tipsy sell style batteries as you can see really improve the the groove there to burn up more of the oil and again our elf replacement cartridges are similar with the ceramic mouthpiece I like the see-through tops it's really cool when you're drawing vapor out of them and also they're easy to clean they're light in your mouth you don't feel like you're gonna break your tooth if you incidentally bite on them and it's a cool little reliable tank this one however it is a child seal once you push it down you're not getting it open so only buy these for the one-time fill unless you see it's got a screw top so ask him to specify same exact thing just a wood mouthpiece for those people who like the the natural wood this one is the same as the wooden except it has a different has a little air flow control here at the top it's kind of unique you just swivel the mouthpiece and that opens and closes the air flow if you want a little bit more control on your mouthpiece these three cartridges all come from the same factory it is I mean the same family it is basically the cloud tank here and they have adjustable air flow for these two the half mil and the 1 mil versions these are probably one of the tanks that I endorse the most i love the wide bore mouthpiece I like the ability to adjust especially for connoisseurs they have a nice ceramic heater with decent size inlet holes so you get nice big hits but you're not gonna lose out on that flavor I think the center post sloping on these were done right they're very stable I haven't heard any complaints of these things leaking this is the same thing half mil except it has a hookah style tip on it it's kind of like the top of a bowling pin it's like half flattened half widened tip and this is the glass version of the cartridge we showed you with a lock top not a thread you push it down and it has also has a resin reservoir this is not glass I have not tested this tank yet but it is very similar to the the other ones that we went over in that facet so it should be a good one so anyways guys thank you for tuning in I hope some of the pro tips and some of the analysis tools that we've given you are gonna help you make better decisions when you're out there looking for your prefilled cartridge to buy at a dispensary or looking to fill your own now one question I know is gonna be a follow-up is which one of your batteries basically fire everything so let me just come out and tell you our be master battery you buy one of

nothing for like a little that like a catalogue that had gaming at the dispensary so about these new cartridges just explaining about like you know the new flavors that they had and like what they were about and [ __ ] picked up with this I was gonna get like a rock garden or like maybe like a plug and play some but I just didn't want to have the same [ __ ] you know I like trying new things you know it's not bad to try anything so you know that way you guys can like see what's good and what's not you know but these cartridges really grabs my attention there's a church Church cartridges I had never had it before the thing that really caught my attention was they have like this adjustable airflow you know which is pretty pretty dope you know I've never seen adjustable airflow on these cartridges I only seen them on like got 2020 vapor now if you guys had seen those where you could like that just like on the bottom yeah you can they're pretty dope you know you can hit them hard in it would be really smooth it which is pretty cool you know and there were like 40 bucks no $40 a car which is you know they they're pretty neon the marquee I've never seen them before and on the bots on the back that says their Instagram and whatever so it says super premium cannabis distillate you know so it's um it must be some pretty hard dis Allah you know it's a sour it's [ __ ] a super premium distillate you know it's pretty far cartridge guys for the price you guys can't complain so let me know how you guys been let me know how my new subscribers been I've been pretty good as well let me know how life's been treating you guys I really appreciate you guys watching my youtube video you know my videos as [ __ ] you guys are [ __ ] awesome for that you know for taking the time out yesterday and watching my videos I really appreciate that and [ __ ] trying to fix the camera a little bit but you guys are awesome for that and you guys just keep it up you know like an income that on my vetoes and you guys are my snapshot you know you guys always cool you know really appreciate you guys adding my snapchat and [ __ ] but yeah guys let's get straight into this cartridge this cartridge like 40 like $40 you know so also about the barrier that goes along with it Hey look is this for the thumb now so it's Asif so here we have the battery so we're just gonna go in the shimmery drop in the cartridge and ship but but yeah guys it's Sunday afternoon tell him not he has been um it's gonna gotten a little tab on it so it has a little sticker on the bottom so the THC on this is 81% it's a strawberry cough so it's gonna be good guys that I mean we finally we so we finally got the [ __ ] cartridge open after a while struggling you know they gotta like I might work on the [ __ ] cases or something but here we have the church or I don't know if it's just me but I have trouble helping this [ __ ] ship but yeah guys so the thing that really caught my attention was a the design of the cartridge and it kind of looks like a heavy hitter but it's like a really really different different company so we're gonna open it it's a nice really faculty and also really caught my attention so as you guys can see it's also so the coil itself compare this the size of the cartridge this is really really big guys compared to like you know that it's really really a big cartridge and like no joke guys right when I pulled out the cartridge you can smell the the terpene something smells really really fruity and the really thing that's really cool about these cartridges that not a lot of cars you just have to have this adjustable airflow so you guys can take big big clouds or you know you guys can get it really really smooth hit so so there's the cartridge itself right do the bullet test and this thing does not have a bubble in it this thing is like literally filled to the [ __ ] top so it has a really really thick oil in it big coil I mean so this thing should have some good airflow in it and I have this battery along to there you know it's the same battery for the cartridge so I had a copy you know had to it's a adjustable 900 battery the ma battery so it's it gots to be a good Betty so we're gonna pop it open just like that this battery was like twenty dollars so and also you know it's a surge protected so I don't know what I think it sounds like if it blows up on you or some [ __ ] but the max on this is like a four point one voltage so we don't we don't need that much so we're just gonna use the lowest setting on this it's pretty dope these guys packaging is pretty DUP you know everything comes the nice hard plastic packaging so it's pretty dope so it's a battery I really needed a new battery I mean that yoke and it works pretty good but to be honest with you guys I don't know if you guys are the same way but do you guys get tired of using the same [ __ ] battery for this cartridges like this time we're like I'm like [ __ ] I want any battery but I mean even though I don't need one I still want one so I don't know if things just mean I like using these stuffs all the time but here's pretty ears battery and here's the charger simple plug and play for the thing you know it says search on the over and here's the battery it's a nice thick like a brass knuckles really really thick so this battery right here should [ __ ] last you guys for a while the quality on it feels really good it's nice and heavy it has this little rubber tips on there we're gonna take that out and has a California warning sticker logo whatever so you guys know you guys smoking a good cartridge so the the quality on this is really really amazing I had this Cadillac that explained everything about it the oil and it looks really really thick it doesn't move at all and I'm recording uh as yes can see it has this little adjustable air flow net where you guys twisted so that's really really dope you know I had a cartridge before they had that it's the 2020 vapes the feature is something like that and they were [ __ ] fire so imma go ahead and try hit this and I'm gonna go and let you guys know what it tastes like oh wow I'm not gonna [ __ ] what you got your nama straight up guy up on sugar Coast [ __ ] you know if something's bad I'm saying it's bad you know but the tip the terpene profile this is [ __ ] amazing you know the flavor on this it's a strawberry coffee and it tastes like really really fruity you know that's really crazy I don't really think there was gonna taste that good but it tastes so fruity so you know we got this nice big thick battery the same same church on it and like the logo as I said as a cartridge as well so we're not going to see if it's charged hopefully it's charged man I don't know pause the video and alright so turns on so it's on yellow and I'm see that's on the middle one alright so we're gonna put on the 3.2 volt which is the blue light it's already going to screw the cartridge on it sure looks [ __ ] dope guys I'm not gonna lie to you it's really the quality on the quality on the battery and all the cartridges it's amazing just the way it feels in your hand it feels like if you're holding like like a nice gadget you know what I mean so it's pretty dumb guys so we're gonna close up as you guys see these these are really neat to the cartridges so we're gonna quote go ahead and close this little this airway we have here see you ask him alright guys my bad so how to delete some footage up my phone and you know get the video start again because I ran out of footage of storage so we have the cartridge here we're going to just take the sticker off you know just to get that [ __ ] out the way so we're gonna go ahead and hit this and if you got a smoke let me go ahead and do so I'm gonna get back to real quick I'm gonna be heading to follow me on snapchat go ahead and follow me you know yeah that's where I keep up posting updates you know about my lifestyle [ __ ] cheers guys we got this church here so we're gonna go and see this is really good I had to close this airflow so I'm gonna compare it whether it's open and closed I'm gonna tell you guys the difference so Cheers Wow you get this nice really really fruity strawberry taste you know that's [ __ ] awesome it's like and you get some actual terpenes in there I don't really taste like distantly to be honest it tastes like some really top-notch distally really really fruity guys so I'm going um you didn't really get a big cloud as you guys see I don't really get a big cloud with a little airflow closer so I'm going to twist it I'm gonna go ahead and open it and I'm gonna see if I can get a bigger cloud with that as you guys see I took a blinker really really thick oil you know you don't really get big clouds so we're gonna ahead and bump the [ __ ] voltage level on this siren garden one two three ICS conceived so I got in close the thing again and we're gonna hit it cheers guys smoke along with me take a blinker now you really do get this little bigger cloud yeah that's what you needed to do is pull up the voltage on that so you really get the same flavor but it tastes a lot way way better you get this nice fruity Strawberry Cough taste it tastes amazing for the price the cartridge was like thirty six dollars guys now you guys can't beat that to be honest it kind of reminds me of a what's a call you know it's kind of hard to burn so we're gonna go ahead and I'm going to open this airflow let me see what's the difference with the higher voltage oh wow tastes pretty good but to be honest you get a big you get a bigger hit whenever the thing is closed I don't know that's just up to me and it tastes a lot better but I think it's just a preference just depends on anybody but we're gonna flip the thing go over it just to make sure you know there's no [ __ ] bubble in there it's really really really really thick guys all honest it's like amazing if you guys haven't had these Trish partridges I guess you really check them out I would really ricky'll recommend them to for the flavor you guys really get a great great profile terpene profile so I'm gonna hit this again to see if get it cut for you guys I don't know if the batter needs to be charged or some book oh yeah you definitely get bigger clouds whenever the dings closed so yeah guys I'm the hive I really feel great you know I'm really like ready to talk [ __ ] some other [ __ ] you know I mean I'm usually quiet I'm the quiet guy but I guess a now it makes you kind of feel like you know you want to talk a little bit more you know makes you talkative and she like that cuz I'm really like the quiet guy you know you don't really hear me around like I've run a group I'm like the one that Lena talks less but whenever I smokes the teal of products and [ __ ] sativa strains it like makes you want to like I don't know just conversate more you know it makes you want to be out there a little bit more and that's where the kind of mission field right now you don't mix me [ __ ] there didn't know god makes me want to you know hope conversations should but I'm gonna rip this again for you guys and hope you guys are smoking log with me I'm gonna turn the voltage up to the highest setting which is on the red so cheers guys took a blinker and the taste still the same you know this oil is really different than what other distillate is get the nice big cloud guys so if you guys ever see these Church cartridges get the battery as well cuz that [ __ ] oil stick as [ __ ] you know you guys need something good about it to burn them on the [ __ ] book I really appreciate you guys watching my videos and you guys stay tuned for more guys", "Sitq2um1_7s": "toriel on how to use a cannabis vaporizer alright so with these products it's really nice you don't put a lot of soot or anything like that into your lungs it's much lighter feeling than if you're smoking it all the time and a lot of people don't know how to use these they're very simple so when you go to the store you're looking to spend about you know thirty to fifty eighty dollars always what we call a base of your vaporizer unit they're going to come packaged like this alright so depending on what brand you buy they all look a little different but from the same function you get your base and a charger in the box you're going to screw your charger into the base just like that and these Chargers just slide into simple USB ports you could charge them on your computer you can charge them to where you would plug your you know your phone cable right in there and then this this adapter will just go right into the wall then your vapor ends charging or you plug this right into your computer and now the base is charging okay so very very simple and the charges will last you you know weeks or more so once you get a cartridge once you get a base you're also going to need a vape cartridge which is a extract of cannabis oil and you can again get these in sativa indica hybrid or all CBD oils for example this is all CBD and this is a sativa product so again very simple simply screw the vape cartridge right into your base alright just like that and you're literally ready to go alright so then to use this product you simply depress the button hold it there inhale on the device take one puff see how you feel about five or ten minutes later and then repeat until you are at the level of Medicaid you've reached the level of medication that you wanted to consume and are feeling comfortable just don't use it before you drive besides that that's really how the vaporizers work it couldn't be simpler again if you want to detach this you can detach it be careful to not let the oil leak out if you're going to just rely on this allow around I usually try and set it upright or put the kite of the cap back on and that's really truly it with the vaporizers we that they're incredibly efficient and convenient way to medicate", "VPNksumOtHI": "in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand new video before before this video starts I just wanna let you guys know that I slapped on some sunscreen so I'm not all greasy and [ __ ] so if you guys want to know you know why I'm hella shiny and [ __ ] it's not cuz I'm sweating I mean I am sweaty not gonna lie I got mud butt right now but definitely I'm not one for my face you know it's just if I'm this greasy I'd never be this greasy you know man I hate the [ __ ] shower well welcome back everybody to a brand new video today we're gonna be reviewing yet again another select cartridge this time accidentally you know throw in a row no a couple times where you know I had pretty much whole is gone where it's worth I think there's about like one-third of it left so it is a select once again it's the elite brand the select it's the pineapple express because he see its 85 85 percent THC so there's some good [ __ ] you know was good at the hybrid right here it's a hybrid right there so it kind of gets you a little bit of everything but here we have it everybody and like always check this out y'all check the song there you go you guys see that right there and you turn it around I see you notice that gauge that you know especially if it's clear you know I guess it's the more the clear the better especially man if you guys are smoking on some of that some of that dark [ __ ] man I see like I'm telling you guys one time I got I bought a fake brass knuckle cartridge right I smoked it up and you know after a couple days it was just turn in it was turning brown it was turning like the the oil was like really dark you know so like always everybody we're gonna turn this on we're gonna put him on the the lightest for the low temp he already knows good cheers everybody pineapple express select so if you guys watch the previous video I actually reviewed the ghost the ghost train haze cartridge with my boy Hoss you know so that [ __ ] was pretty good you know this year the Select I'm telling you guys it's the light cards man they get you freakin loaded man they get you they get you pretty lit and again I talked about in the previous if you guys want to go check that one out it's gonna be down a description it's some ghost ghost train Oh ghost train haze something like that yeah I think that's what it's called sativa so it's gonna wake you up but pretty much I was just talking about how like the flavor the flavor it doesn't have a really strong flavor whatsoever but then again it gets you super frequently like you taste it you know you know what you're smoking on you know you're smoking awesome THC you know [Music] as I was saying you know it's like the best part you can smoke this in public I mean like you know if you get the taste of it it does have like the distinct taste you know obviously if you're smoking THC so you're gonna know you know but the thing the thing that I really like about these is that the freakin smell is not strong whatsoever does not stick I'm telling you guys like right now I'm just saying this [ __ ] in my room you know it's not I'm gonna be able to open the door it might smell just a little bit but it's not gonna smell like super strong you know so that's one cool thing that I really like about these cartridges and select is some of the first cartridges is you guys if you guys know you guys were watching this channel select is a cartridge some of the first cartridges that I started smoking you know back when like you know wax pans and all this this and all this stuff was like new you know it's this [ __ ] this three alright we're gonna switch it up to blue to the middle temperature damn blue is just perfect because this again this doesn't really have like a big taste to it it hasn't it's crazy to me also like cartridges for me they all taste the same it really depends on the percentage because I know select has a couple I think it was select pretty sure I'm 100% I'm actually ninety-nine point nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine percent sure that select it used to have some of these or still does but I don't know what you could get them but select has these carts that are like what like a point three in a cartridge and it's like super strong it's like high maybe like in the mid 90s low 90s I think 90 to 95 percent maybe even 96 percent who knows but I do remember there was like they're really small and you would just rip it you take one good rip and damn man you'd get [ __ ] blasted I know a lot of you guys really like these cartridges reviewing videos it's crazy man it's like the new thing right personally me cartridges are I mean I guess you're cool you know especially when you go to like family parties and you're at the house you know you want to step outside and smoke you know smoking this is pretty far you know because you can just do it work you know you're taking a [ __ ] you sit down on the toilet you're taking this [ __ ] you give you a hint in this you know if it was waterproof you giving in into the shower but you know when you're laying down you're watching the movie huge puffing on this [ __ ] but to be completely honest with you guys I get lit but it's like it's just like a head heart you know it's nothing it's nothing too crazy you know like I don't get beg debate so I mean I I'm actually lying there has been a couple times where this is so spire that I guess you made it I guess faked I not believe I like this one you can barely tell it's like a little different taste these like cartridges especially these ones right here they all have like a similar taste but I'm lit man personally let me know the comments down below what you guys like better you know and you guys like either cartridges or flowers especially mean I like the flowers you know a lot of dabs and everything I like flowers I mean dabs are cool you know cuz again you can take them here in the crib you know you get super baked like dad or you just trying to get bang foot you know if it fits up if I'm starting my day with dads man all right be my date man I'm gonna just be slump I'm gonna just be hella tired so that's why I kind of wished it up you know I kind of I'm gonna start to take like then dad's you know at nighttime you know or man especially if you guys are gonna watch a movie you guys are gonna eat but it's like you know later in the day where you just don't really have nothing to do and yeah because sometimes if you died man your soul it I mean it it's honestly depending on you guys you know you're gonna go with the highest it's a bit depends on on your guys its body type like let me know what you guys get productive you guys get lazy cuz there's either one or the other bros tree and either THC all there's others only [ __ ] oh I can tell it was a weekday let's make some nice clothes but personally mean I don't like that height I'm you know I feel like it just burns through all this [ __ ] damn I thought I completely forgot what the [ __ ] I was talking about oh yeah okay so either either it makes you or it breaks you like personally me what it does to me is when I usually smoke or whatever and if it's like a sativa it's gonna pick me up it's gonna pick me up and it gets me really like creative I start thinking about you know different ideas and so for me personally me I feel like it relaxes me and I could definitely be way more creative I mean I'm already creative sober but it's like you know it's like sometimes for example like like earlier today you know have a little short [ __ ] die last night I didn't really have that much to sleep or whatever you know I don't take take a few puffs you know get a little lit and I'm just like damn bro I think about you know I started getting in my head and I started thinking and usually when I get on my head I'm just like dude I got to do this I got to do that like oh [ __ ] let's do it now you know and I take action so sometimes for me tree regardless I mean sober or this you know I'm gonna be [ __ ] creative productive but sometimes this [ __ ] is like there's days where I'm kind of like look I feel like I have like I feel like I can't think of [ __ ] or I'm just kind of like [ __ ] I'm just like chillin there you know and I'll get lady and I'm just like boom [ __ ] this pie it's just a sativa you know it really depends indica it gets me a little tired it'll also be the same but I'll be kind of like slung but there's other people who they're gonna just have a sash that I said and they're not productive at all you know they don't really get nothing done during the day they just throw the whole day around you know and I've had days like that that's why sometimes I'm just like [ __ ] man I gotta start doing that [ __ ] you know I gotta stop [ __ ] you know but again you know people do you know a lot of people look down on Chief and stuff like that but I'm telling you guys sometimes if this [ __ ] could give you literally like just a weird and blue sometimes that happens sometimes it doesn't you know sometimes I'm late I'm still doing [ __ ] but over time you kind of just get to learn how to like what your body likes like for me if I stay I like to smoke sativa all the time it doesn't matter if it's a day nighttime sativa cuz actually picks me up and I'm just [ __ ] like a machine bro you know just [ __ ] do it [ __ ] and I'm just lit out of my mind and I'm just like dude what the [ __ ] I just did all the [ __ ] you know and I'm just late I was really like it was just everything was naturally happening if that makes sense you know I don't know I'm I'm horrible at explaining [ __ ] everyone damn so liked everybody make sure you guys go check them out man if you guys the only thing that I would say I guess what kind of suck is that the flavors aren't really that strong you know it's like you you do get a flavor but when they say like for example like different stuff like this pineapple Express definitely I had like a different taste you know especially like other cartridges they throw in like a little extra flavor to make it think like Oh like a pineapple type you should hide Apple Express or some [ __ ] but you know you you just know you're getting the extract from this sharing or from some legit pineapple Express you know the book is lit man if you guys owe a good thing I would I would totally recommend this brand

"EQDaH2JMZqQ": "hi there welcome to another one of my videos thank you for taking time to watch it I also want to thank all the new YouTube subscribers and Twitter followers welcome to the family let's get to it in this video I'll show you Strawberry Cough baked card from vitac and this card says it's a sea sail cartridge with the Vatican logo on the glass this means the coil and the cartridge is ceramic which generally gives a smoother vape and better flavor from the streams and with vitac and old red or orange right at the bottom it means that it's a sativa cartridge I paid forty four dollars for this cartridge and it has 80 percent so 400 milligrams of THC in it think of the sweetest strawberry you've had it was horrible compared to the sweet strawberry flavor in this oil with a hint of every flavor the smell when you rape it out is a mix of strawberry and earthy as well up to the effects the first thing I noticed was a mega energy blast and I only call it that because I realized that when I noticed I was rocking back and forth in my share without even trying to hit her joy that gave me a bigger smile from ear to ear and turned that rocking into dancing when that inner joy demanded that I turned up the music volume even after 27 years this vape cart had me coughing on every inhalation no complaints about that though that is the reason why they call this strange strawberry calls because it feels like it expands and it makes you cough every time you take an inhalation out of it a strong happiness from within that lasted through the duration of the effects on the second half would be effects I felt a strong relaxation of body and mind this made any anxiety I had disappear and all stress became irrelevant through the duration and I must say this car just kicks just like smoke and flower and this has been my experience with all the white I can't cartoonists that I have tried can't I work on the strain over here and this is another one of those strange that I love to work on really good amount of energy makeup good mood inner joy with good pain relief and great flavor lovely I recommend this cartridge from wake-and-bake all the way through to the end of the afternoon hope this helps you medicate right have a great day", "txgwFplgZRY": "everybody welcome to another aegis review today I'm just gonna jump right into it today we just seem driptip yes and actually sees a little bit or no same driptip I have my special little battery with me though it's an ego battery but it's not made by ego I forget who's mean I bought all my e-cig stuff so long ago I can't remember who makes what I just got my little beauty color on there and take a look at this juice guys it is blue often you see a blue juice this is from a company in California called ganja juice and the prices are good but the shipping is terrible shipping is like $19 I got express shipping though regular shipping is like $15 it's ridiculous for shipping but they are a novelty smoked they're not meant to be smoked all the time but next time I get something from them I'll probably end up getting 100 milliliter bottle they get all the way up to 120 milliliters they only sell 50-50 mix it's fine even though I do like 70/30 but this this is pretty good this flavor is called blueberry cush and you know pushes then you know exactly what this should taste like and um I gotta admit I've smoked down a little bit re is very good flavor wise I would say it's like a candy blueberry like dum dum a little tart though just great it's it's sweet its tart and then the after taste is marijuana it's cushion it's amazing how much it actually tastes like a strain of cush it's a pretty good they have all kinds of different bud flavors out there on their website but let's check the body the body's actually better than the last one I did the body is I give that buddy an 8 out of 10 it's nice and it's thick it's nice um let's check the scent the scent is like blueberry and tobacco it's pretty nice actually overall rating the look of it I'm gonna start doing what it looks like now the look of it it's just awesome I love that it's like blue with green almost like seafoam green almost flavor taste aroma nine out of ten I really like this flavor by maybe that body and eat it that's pretty good I know it doesn't look like much on the camera but it is it's it's really good overall waiting I give an overall rating I don't know somewhere between eight point five at a time could be a little better um the flavor could be a little more um that's the only thing stopping me from giving it a 9 out of 10 this that I wish it was just a little bit more flavor but that is an amazing and I definitely suggest you check out ganja juice calm and thanks for watching another Bay preview and vape on and I'll see you in the next video", "iNcCGMXn2bA": "[Music] we're here with bloom farms and we have some trinkets that you can smoke we here my man my somebody we live in a time right now we're portable vaporizers are in everybody's pocket why not add some style add some fashion add some class to it for every product that we sell we donate a meal to one of seven food banks in California Nevada well we've donated about 1.2 million meals over the past few years really we just try to bring awareness to it so that you can make it positive impact and I'm think you guys are doing a great job you know you got some of this for the host of the show a couple of these to take with me couple of these and y'all are doing good this year I'll tell you the truth the first one right here this is our high THC version we call this highlighter Plus this is about a 80% or more THC right next to it is our rose gold highlighter that's pretty it's pretty right yeah it's beautiful it's a it's a one-to-one CBD to THC ratio and then on the right side here we've got our highlighter uncrate special edition we only made a few thousand of these things a nice matte soft touch finish it's also a one-to-one CBD THC ratio [Music] that's clean give me some pricing so these are right around $100 a piece well I guess the show is the most expensive it's right sighs I'll pull up here how many how many how many pumps in this thing uh well it depends on how big a puffy take yeah so this is the most expensive is tech break and this would actually be smart the great way to check", "tpRjCsSQ0Do": "by the title the video as you guys can see man I'm be telling you guys how to bring in either your pen how I got it in I'm gonna tell you guys what I went through why I brought it I'm pretty much like this is gonna be a little story time because I wanted to make a video and while I'm out here so when I get back I could just upload and you guys could see something while I'm out here so yeah today guys we're gonna be ripping on the West Coast curd I'll take up close a close-up after this yeah very very nice man I'm like I'm a little bit more than half no a little bit less than halfway he's done with it but I've been trying to use this so scarcely but we're gonna take a quick rip before we get into the storytelling stuff like that oh so cheers boys if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over you guys know the deal [Music] man it's nice to being able to smoke outside dude my tolerance has gone down a significant amount surprisingly cuz since I haven't really really been able to smoke all day how like I usually do or at least every couple of hours like literally the past week that I've been here has only been like maybe two times double so if you guys are coming in from any legal state flying out you know it's an illegal state I'm gonna show you guys what I'm not gonna show you guys I'm gonna tell you guys what to do cuz I'm already over here there's no way I can do to him so the way I did it first first and foremost let me show you guys the way I did it so if you guys are have a girlfriend a wife girl that you're going with on a trip this will just make things a hundred times easier so what you can do is just obviously attach your cartridge to your stick and then just all you do is it'll just pop drop it in her makeup bag and then that's it dude you're good to go you could probably do up to two or three cartridges I don't recommend doing a lot of them and I don't recommend compact inch if you're gonna take we do not compact it because I learned a few tricks over here my uncle he works for the airlines and he knows a bunch of tricks up his sleeve and stuff like that he was telling me like what they live for so I mean let me just boss you guys up in a little game right now so we're usually in airports what they're looking for is in drugs that's not what they're looking for like you guys making like oh they're looking for toys and looking for my wood and my weed you know things like that but that's not the case even though it's not gonna be hard for them to know who has it like just don't don't overdo it don't be stupid don't just go in there thinking like oh they're not looking for drugs so I can go in there and go ahead and walk in with an ounce that's definitely not the case so all right they're looking for obviously explosives guns anything that can pretty much cause any damage or danger to anyone inside the airport like if you guys don't know lax is one of the biggest or not well this isn't only lax but I'm referring to LAX abuse out to the airport that I flew out of so yeah and LX are looking for explosive guns et Cie things like that so drugs is it's not one of their top priorities so as long as you're not overdoing it man there should be no issue to be honest like he was telling me as long as like one thing that you have to do if you're like I'm not advising this I'm not telling you guys go do this and go like try it out but if he has you know I have medical issues if he has I have anxiety like me personally I have so much anxiety dude like that day that I was flying out I had so much anxiety that I literally [ __ ] was crying bro like once I landed it was horrible I mean I'm not ashamed to say that I cried cause it's just anxiety man it's where humans everyone feels it specifically you know and cheers to them here I remember take up a trip for you guys so yeah like I was saying oh yeah this car is so amazing by the way by West Coast cure if you guys can see it hopefully you guys can very very amazing and yeah let me just get back to my story so one thing he told me if you're gonna bring weed um weed in general cartridges don't really matter because it's a liquid usually everything scans through liquids you can tell very very hard to detect and yeah so I'm not saying this isn't me saying like oh you can take as many cartridges you want I'm the same be smart and take one or two three hemos you know you don't really need to have more than that unless you're a fiend bro so now on to the weed if you don't like cartridges and you guys are more about weed them he said he went from what I know he told me that all you have to do is just you can carry in there just make sure it doesn't smell and make sure you just like wrap it up stash it you know but don't compress it too much because usually what comes up on the RFID readers it comes when they're passing it through the little readers what they're looking for is compact compressed items so basically because if you guys don't know that's usually how bombs are made you you compact what it is whatever the material is and then that's what makes a bomb you can't have a bomb with a little super piece of [ __ ] you know material it has to be very very mass amount compact until like it doesn't have to be a ball but you guys know when I'm referencing to so that's a little trick and then honestly you guys there's another one that I've done it at like shows and stuff like this I've never tried this at an airport I mean I don't recommend this type if you guys really are trying to get through when you can do is just hide the cartridge on the bottom of your plastic piece of your shoe and when you're passing through the metal detector just slide your foot like walk put left foot over whichever isn't carrying the cartridge and then on your right just slide slide it down you know just fairly you can barely lift it I think it's like an inch from what I've done before so yeah no more than an inch so you should be good after that and yeah I'm just sorry if I keep you looking away there's just so much scenery around me and it's just catching my attention so we're gonna take another hit and just keep talking keep ranting seeing what what this day is about man so yeah I brought this on here I left on Monday it's currently already Thursday it's Friday tomorrow man I go back on Sunday so which means I have two more days out here and this pen has been coming in clutch because like I said my anxiety dude my anxiety was kicking my ass since the morning I had a good on the plane like it's not that I'm scared to fly or anything I've flown before I've flown to Mexico I've flown to other places but just the anxiety of being away from home it's just something that I've had you know there on my whole life so wait to whatever this is this is something that has helped me a lot throughout my last couple years I'm dealing with anxiety and stuff like that so and I'm gonna show you guys this one I know I already made a video on this with a West Coast cure cartridge I'll go ahead and post that in the link in the description below if you guys want to check out that video but I've made a video on this um battery before and it's called the X tube so basically what it is it looks ugly right it looks ugly like this and okay whatever you're not supposed to have a beautiful battery but that's just a [ __ ] thing in your head for if you if you're one of those people that likes things that are aesthetically pleasing I don't blame you man I'm some sometimes I'm like that too so but this battery isn't for you so this value what it does this little detachable piece right here so as you guys can see I have a little a little oil bubble right there right little air bubble I mean so what this does I'll screw it on there click it twice and then what it does it'll start preheating right you'll see it oh it's already dead because I've been using all week so I can't use a preheat function but what it does it'll heat up the outside of the cartridge and then it'll make the oil warm enough for it to move up and so how good that is is because most a car batteries that pre-heat your [ __ ] they preheat from the coil within so basically what that is it's burning the oil that's why when you take hits you can still puff like with this if I were if it was charged and I were to do that you wouldn't know smoke would be coming out at all like sometimes the only downside is the tip does get hot sometimes because it does get heated up a lot so if you guys are looking for a cartridge that I mean for a battery that does it all now this is my favorite one for sure the only bad thing about it is I don't think you could fit like a tank of apes and [ __ ] like that it's more of that just the regular - really really slim cartridges so yeah man I'm gonna take another hit hopefully this battery still yeah so we're just gonna oh no it's still it's still going you just can't preheat it because the preheat function does I think that's what takes up most of the battery life because it preheats it for like a good 20 to 30 seconds because it wants to get all the oil out obviously man this West Coast cure is amazing yeah I'm gone man I'm just gonna go ahead and end this video here enjoy the rest of my time here I hope you guys are enjoying the rest of your week you guys are gonna see this on Monday so enjoy your week from now on you know and for all the new people here thank you for conforting me and for the people who have been here for a while thank you for the continuous support you guys are gonna be seeing some big things coming within the next couple of weeks so look forward to that and yeah if you guys enjoyed today's video go leave a like comment

bucks for an aide 120 or more for a quarter and you know what's pissing me off about that it's recently the quality of the flour has been going straight to hell let me show you what I'm talking about and this is the reason why I never get makers grace to begin with but you know what I mean this is supposed to be good news stuff here guys good that's a lot of [ __ ] Brown there's a lot of brown and a bunch of seeds I'm looking at right now I can see a bunch of seeds that I missed on top of these seeds okay it's a plant I understand that seeds happen yes one or two here and there is fine but wouldn't you find it like this just a whole eight just just I mean inseminated with with a hundred seeds I mean it's just ridiculous okay the price we pay the not being able to see what we're buying it you know the news Matt against us putting in these [ __ ] fancy containers like this and you know like this and have it be complete garbage it tastes like [ __ ] it tastes like ditch wheat that somebody grew hide your pilot oh no they won't tell the difference you know what you do have some cannabis patients that don't know the difference and that's [ __ ] wrong do because that is garbage nature's grace and wellness you know what when I first started off I loved your flower I your room rocks but since then it has gone straight to [ __ ] straight to [ __ ] and I'm very sorry to upset you you work for them or whatever but if you do work for them tell them okay they're their flower sucks okay I used to think that's a little Egypt here in Illinois had though had the worst flower no

"yo yo yo what's up YouTube so today's video guys something totally completely different for me I have not tried this product at all not even once and so I went out to my boys over at greenlit farms over here in La Puente area and they were kind of kind enough to hook me up and they were like here this is this is not their brand but they're like here try this out it's some fire go ahead and shoot a review on it and you know blah blah blah so yeah this part is in Greenland Farms if you guys do enjoy this want to get this product later on in this video if you're really okay that kind of catches my interest yes you go check them out I'm gonna go have them in the first comment down in the comments below and I'll have their weed maps on place with a bit link down there so go ahead and check them out yeah like I said though for today's video we got something completely different I've never tried this product before it but they they vouched for they were like yeah it's pretty fired and so I was like alright go ahead let me try this out so the brand that we're trying out today is gonna be called hollow points alright our hollow tips alright hollow tips so this this brand I really haven't done too much research into it like tell you the complete honest truth but from what he told me he said its fiery he told me what they using it and things like that so how's that are for sure I'll go ahead and give it a try the cool thing about this is when you little actual cartridge itself it actually looks like a hollow tip so let me see if you guys can go ahead and check that out that's pretty freakin neat and go ahead and look at the oil baby boy look at that oil is super duper clean no movement at all it's literally this oil reminds me of tree base clear for those people that have been around this channel for a while you guys know what I have review tree base clear before and tree base has literally one of the best cartridges in the game right now disel 8y is at least because they're freaking their [ __ ] the spider dude so went and then also when buying this hollow hollow tubes freakin cartridge it also has a proprietary battery that you could be using and they also sell it there at green green lit farm so you guys can get the whole package and they give you it's it's actually pretty safe do now that I'm looking at it it's a gold-plated battery so go ahead and take this off it has a little thing right there on the bottom too but I don't think that connects I'm gonna try that yeah that's definitely not gonna connect so I'm guessing you have to remove the bottom and then a little plug right there and then boom you got your 510 thread connector go ahead and connect it to the little magnetic piece down here boom slap it on and then you get to him this one is a full gram so that's pretty cool and honestly this is this thing is nice do you know that I'm actually looking it has like some type of like Versace what's an H but it looks kind of like some Versace logo type [ __ ] i'ma have to put it up on the I'm gonna probably gonna put the thumbnail up closer this so you guys keep the look out because this thing is freakin nice so we're gonna go ahead and try it out here if you guys are 18 and over 21 or let me know what you guys are cheating on you make sure you guys are medical patients legal patients please so cheers guys damn I think I might need it might need to have touch charges oh yeah to tree bases is you a holy smack so this flavor right here is called banana clip I forgot to show it I think it is banana clip indica and honestly right off of that and make sure hit it tastes exactly like Agent Orange not exactly but very very very similar to what to call the or Agent Orange from tree based clear and dude that when is my all-time favorite telling you guys to choose when it comes to taste treaty based kills it determine the taste and this is very very similar I'm not too sure how much these were running for because I didn't buy it but I'm pretty sure if you guys go to green lip farms and you guys aren't interested in trying this out on picture they can hook you guys up tell them some PG sent you so right here we got it on the Pocket vapor battery shout out to Pocket vapor I got my filly code link down in the description below go ahead and cop is better this is honestly one of my favorite batteries at the moment so yeah let's go ahead and rip this thing super fire dude it tastes like it tastes kind of like yeah look at that dude is hitting it I hit already two times fat hits and it's still not moving to do this thing is nice I'm not in your life yeah but it has a very very citrusy taste to it I don't really taste the banana in it but super super taste like really really tasty it's actually tastes really really citrusy and very very it doesn't really taste artificial it does taste like it tastes really clean it tastes really really clean I don't taste any ex show excess oil and you know and alpha the tip of the tongue and usually that's what a lot of distillate cartridges companies are doing that wrong in my opinion those are the cartridges that you don't want to be smoking on those men tasting like oil don't even get no freakin nice Terps in it and you know this thing is hitting all right so we're gonna take a couple more hits though and tell you guys the real full effects on this all right so I don't even know what let me see we shoulda shall I hit it on this is blue setting right here this one is the orange setting orange setting I don't even know they went out that so we're gonna hit it off the red saying we're gonna take a factually let's go back down to the orange setting because I don't I really don't want to kill myself orange right here let's get it whoo that was fat but it was so smooth yeah this is exactly like tree baits dude these guys are definitely and these guys are new to the game man for them to be able to produce something this clean and this clear it's it has a lot to say honesty man it just goes to show like companies who really put their time and effort into the product it really goes to show how clean it is and how I can turn out man when it's actually given the right time you know things like that so so how many times do we hit like three times I think we should hit it two more time to get the full effect usually five times for me does the job and then we're gonna go ahead and turn this one up to like a red setting and let's get it one more time boys bat hit whoo that one expanded the chest a little bit guys she actually hit me right there whoo now and give me the head change that one for sure gave me that definite head change like you know when you're hitting something and like it's like creeping up on you slowly and slowly and Ted after like the fourth hit you're just like oh [ __ ] like yeah attend me it's definitely a very very yeah it's definitely a head high without a doubt because the what I'm feeling right now is like I know indicas supposed to be more of a body hyper tell your truth that right now I'm getting more of a little head high I don't know if it's just because let you know once you and my opinion when you're first blasted you get a lot more on the head and then once you let it sink in more it goes to your body at least for me I don't know everyone's so different dude it's actually quite interesting how things affect people differently so we're take one more hit and give you guys the final rating [Music] super-clean headsman no the bubble is barely moving the oil is super thick and it tastes super fire the overall like the high though it's not too in-your-face so it's very subtle I feel like it's just it could just be me because I have a very high tolerance but yeah it's it's definitely hate it definitely hit me all over it I definitely I'm mellowed out I'm pretty sure if I keep hitting I'll get more mill it out but I'm not the type of person to keep you keep it going you know I feel like once I get that hate Union I'm pretty much cool so rating this overall product I it's a really clean product dude I like it I like that I like the distillate in here it's a very smooth very clear like very very chirpy very tasty too it's not bland it doesn't taste fake and the could the packaging honestly the packaging is something very very different dude I like it it kind of reminds me of like a brass knuckles I know that I know the owner that was giving it to me he said that it was kind of like it is kind of like an around the same branch area brass nervous but way cleaner and better version so these guys I can see I can see they're a little off friend of brass knuckles coming in here but a way much cleaner version like it does give off some hints of old brass knuckles flavors now that I think about it but overall it's pretty good I mean yeah the packaging is nice remind me a little Versace right here super super clean like in the thumbnail let me know what you guys think that thumbnail is gonna be the main picture of this so yeah that's the packaging and then the overall high honesty like I said the high is like it's a man it could be it could be better I'm pretty sure if I had a lower tolerance but it's it's like a six right now it's like a six you know you get it does something to you but it's not too in full effect but yeah man we're gonna keep hitting on this you guys are probably catch me hitting this on Instagram and go check that I'll go follow me on Instagram I'm gonna be doing a pocket vapor giveaway so yeah and then we're probably just getting in the video here guys so go ahead and go check out my Instagram go check out greenlit farms if you guys are in the La Puente area and of legal age and medical certification go ahead and

"3Y-JU0l7RiQ": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose we do not condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand video today yeah again we got actually a brand new brand that I've actually came across on ease before and I've actually you know I've wanted to review it for actually some time now again everybody this is an 18mm educational purpose podcast it's a review I don't condone the usage of these products nor I do not try to boost to sell these products and also we do not sell anything on this channel and again everything here is legal offer 18 and up at cannabis patients you guys are enormous good so today ladies and gentlemen we got a brand new brand to a review it's the old pal brand so I'm not promoting this product or anything like that this is just literally just a review I actually got this full gram $35 crazy huh we got some sativa check this out right here look there's actually some old pal this is actually from 510 which I believe is Oakland I think this is actually a local you know I think this company is actually in the bay keep that out and this is actually the cosmic sativa flavor it's a full sativa you know it has about eighty percent THC which is actually pretty [ __ ] good again everybody this is a $35 gram believe it or not I actually bought this and freaking off off ease and you guys already know man ease sometimes we kind of tax it check the [ __ ] out quick little test want to show you guys that this [ __ ] is look at that stuck for sure no hot water first hit now you lie you guys every time I take the first hit of this cartridge whoa I get laid man I feel this [ __ ] it's a sativa so usually before my morning my morning job you know I wake up take a couple puffs and I go go over to my morning driving [ __ ] you know and 9:00 I'll have one or two puffs literally just leaves me faint like I can already feel it right now I haven't even smoked today today I literally just skipped earlier today I don't really smoke just because I want to make sure I do these reviews with starting with sober but yeah look one thing I really do like about this product again I bought this off ease actually I got to 2 grams for the total price of $70 that includes taxes and delivery so I'm just like dude if this was a $35 full gram imagine if you actually go to like the legit old pal warehouse or whatever they're actually selling these and you buy you buy some stuff so I don't think I've ever seen these you know in the club but sometimes I'm like hmm that's very interesting it's a classic shareable cannabis oil cartridge this is shareable and it definitely is shareable because for the price and again a lot of people are gonna say oh it's fake it's just not no this is not fake this is I legit got this from the east service and they're for sure they're approved they're completely legal and it's not no neighborhood plug this ain't no neighborhood plug [ __ ] so it's crazy if a neighborhood plug [ __ ] is trying to sell you a [ __ ] for gram for like dirty dirty like $30 do that shit's fake as [ __ ] I smoked them before we actually reviewed up a car to do the super Lemon Haze one of my boys got with cool little fake cartridge or whatever and you got it for like pretty expensive but usually if you guys get this from like a a delivery service but it has to be legit though cuz I feel like some there are a couple like delivery services that are just not legit thought a homemade [ __ ] that could might not be healthy for you but please look I don't know if this is true or not I've heard this from a friend that's like a late punch tastes really good too um but I've heard that smoking like I guess fake cartridges or I don't even know if I even talked about but I'm pretty sure it's fake cartridges I guess there was like a youtuber like a weed youtuber some guy that made videos dude I'm pretty sure I don't know where the hell here is this drummer I don't know where it came from or I just don't I don't know but I believe in the obviously you know because it could have been fake cards but I guess like someone passed away from like smoking cartridges and I'm like dude I'm pretty sure it's not gonna be no [ __ ] cannabis you know like legal cartridges had to be some like fake [ __ ] you know I do know someone that bought like four cartridges for like the [ __ ] low and then with fake as [ __ ] dude like there was straight-up hot dog water personally me I know a lot of people that actually do like the old pal they like it because one so I don't think [ __ ] you know proof let's prove it right here look at that that should go it even has a little little sticker we are in California completely illegal dude and this [ __ ] gets you [ __ ] blasted i've only took like what like three four ribs and i'm ready list [ __ ] man but i really do i honestly everybody I appreciate everybody that our clinic everyone that's clicking on these videos man I appreciate you guys so much man because if you guys don't know I do have a main channel and I used to blog and like do pranks and all that [ __ ] back days ago days ago I used to do I gave me videos but that channel is just so mixed up with so much [ __ ] content random content that I got to the point where like I took a break and it just like dinah fell off I'm gonna try to revive it I've been trying for a while now you know but I was like you know what I'm gonna move on to something a little bit more different something a little bit you know like an educational type video if that makes sense so yeah but if you guys want to go check that [ __ ] out go down on my description it's my main channel 120 k subs you know and I actually reached 120 case subs like back like three oh [ __ ] it's gonna be almost four years ago back in like 2016 could've been I got a million right now [ __ ] up but hey [ __ ] have this for a reason right [Music] [Music] like I do appreciate everybody that's clicking on this cuz I know YouTube doesn't like cannabis videos and educational kind of this videos and [ __ ] but I do see that there's a [ __ ] large community there's a lot of people a lot of of age people that want to just watch you know like smoking videos educational cannabis videos type [ __ ] you know and I'm just like doing YouTube should just have its own little like section for that [ __ ] bro you know it's like I don't even wanna tie these videos if you guys see ads okay I'm telling guys this right now if you guys see ads on these videos it's literally [ __ ] YouTube putting videos and [ __ ] cuz first of all I'm not even [ __ ] partnered to me by the time you guys are watching this I don't think I'm ever gonna get this channel partnered honestly I'm definitely gonna be giving away a lot to like I can't really do like [ __ ] weed giveaway since I can't be like pack you know a shitty [ __ ] you know it's a places where like it might not even be like 100 it's legal but it's like you can't like [ __ ] receive it through the mail type [ __ ] you know like on some Canada [ __ ] it's like that legal [ __ ] hear in Caly it's not legal legal like it's get to the point where you just do it you could [ __ ] just smoke a blunt and a smoking area in some places you know people got bitched cuz let me smoke your cigarettes a bunch of tobacco products that [ __ ] [ __ ] kills you dude straight up it literally has a fat ID label that says this shit's gonna give you cancer and it [ __ ] stinks cuz you're [ __ ] smoking like cardboard a [ __ ] you know no offense to everybody that smokes cigarettes if you guys do your thing do what you got to do but I'm telling you right now that is a bad hat bad [ __ ] habit you know and if you guys switch over to vaping and all that vaping [ __ ] quit that [ __ ] brush it's also bad for you too bro and this cartridge probably bad for this too so I do not recommend any type of smoking but again this is for an educational purpose you know my personal review on this [ __ ] but a real [ __ ] though everybody that's watching this man you guys are first James 2nd Janet no matter man everybody like check this out we all got to go to a [ __ ] struggle like it doesn't matter if it's like the struggle is red if the struggle is blue of distress I don't even know I'm saying if the struggle is a triangle a square [ __ ] lid that made no sense that's the path you know that's for your life and [ __ ] but see if you're trying to grind you guys trying to come up be successful in all that [ __ ] I was gonna be a shitload of obstacles so when something's happening in your life that's part of it you know that's an obstacle you gotta face this [ __ ] to get to where you want to be in [ __ ] but damn it have like these crazy eyes like [ __ ] ideas and everything that I want to say on camera every time I say it I'm just look by the way follow me on Instagram I'm crunchy or go down in my description and go I don't check out all my social media I got Twitter snapchat all that stuff I'm gonna try to convince you guys to just chase your [ __ ] dreams take a jade tastes like it takes your passions like it chase your passion you know because in reality if you guys have a talent either if it's [ __ ] drawing you know [ __ ] writing us you're good at writing stories you're gonna like painting you could you're good at something Here I am not knowing how to [ __ ] explain myself but it's like if you guys have a passion or a talent or a hobby you guys are really [ __ ] good I meant pursue that [ __ ] right because I'm telling you guys right now bro you nowadays bro it's the new this is wearing mm about it be 2020 anything is [ __ ] possible that you could monetize absolutely everything bro [ __ ] what's that kid's name [ __ ] Ryan something to bear such the little kid that reviews [ __ ] toys for YouTube dude if he could do that and earn like [ __ ] close to 100 mice where he got like over 50 million dollars a year bro and income or more maybe like 40 to 50 million after taxes because if you got close to a hundred thousand then probably take like half that [ __ ] or even more um holy [ __ ] dude just from revealing choices so if this kid could review toys and become makers it's [ __ ] more more time like millions of dollars then you guys could [ __ ] monetize everything bro it's like you too bro YouTube is like the perfect way to just show off your personality show off you know your talents and [ __ ] there's a lot of people that could take pictures of cars they go they like you know fix cars or all that shade there's car channels shoes - actually I know David got kicks on in person and he has like he's like a sneaker head you know he [ __ ] he reviews sneakers he paints sneakers he customizes sneakers and [ __ ] like that and he's pretty funny he's a funny guy this dude [ __ ] made YouTube videos and then he [ __ ] all of a sudden from just showing off shoes at him making shoes and all this [ __ ] like customizing shoes and [ __ ] painting them all that [ __ ] he got into an eBay commercial true started by the way and I mean that [ __ ] just sounds like what the [ __ ] oven broke YouTube is like a [ __ ] stepping-stone to like this [ __ ] bro crazy like I'm trying to do that bro cuz I know everybody does not want to live that nine-to-five like [ __ ] that [ __ ] you know but if you guys do I'd beid obviously if you guys make like a couple you know small like six figures and [ __ ] and you guys have like a good job with like the benefits and all of the [ __ ] then I understand you know 9 to 5 is for you but exist you know you worked hard you got to where you wanted to be and [ __ ] and that's what's up you know respect honestly but then there's other people like me bro just [ __ ] hate I just don't like that nine-to-five [ __ ] and it's not that I'm lazy you know it's just that I really don't like I just find it so trying to upgrade myself trying to upgrade this this this brand you feel me so [ __ ] y'all shut the crazy-ass video don't even know how blood coughing oh [ __ ] we're reviewing this [ __ ] [ __ ] takes you great to give you guys a good taste it's kind of like piney honestly little piney

alright oh that's on school days this is the Thin Mints cart though I mean y'all could I mean I could still hit her like a tiny just like one hate so that's a tiny bit of oil I was like one hit after that it's pure Terminator taste for me alright so I got the count let's screw it on in this hitti alrighty then let's good sit on all right you guys go luck see that I was reading the back of this box and then I read in this little thing it said this cart brings you back childhood memories and now that I think about it it should because when I was a little kid we used to live by the cemetery and I remember in that cemetery there used to be a little tree and that would like sprout raspberries too and [ __ ] I remember it used to be like little squad of kids and we used to take care of the tree table as artists so no one else could get the berries on it so I don't know I just wanted to say that because supposedly the childhood [ __ ] but let's hit it so for this I'm gonna be taking I'm gonna say like a five-second then I might hit it another five-second and then one more five-second and yeah I'm gonna let you guys know how it tastes and everything how it goes down don't forget about the oil though I forgot the oil don't forget the oil tickets hell look at that that bubble by the time I'm done with this review that book was about to be like barely by the half of the M or like up top of the end but let's do it alright and let's take this far second here I'm not gonna lie to you guys I just took out the camera stopped recording as soon as I exhale the hit but not gonna lie it does taste good you know the taste tastes like metal well now it tastes like blueberries it does taste like blueberries I mean raspberries I'm feeling but I'm trippin I'm trippin I'm trippin it does taste like raspberries and I'm gonna hit it one more time just to get another taste I will be much easier to put my phone here well yeah here we go again take two armed five-second hey y'all you got the flavor of raspberries right away right when you want help you get the raspberry flavor and I'm not gonna let you kick this cake alright guys I'm here one last time but this time I'm doing for 10

this 9 out of 10 because you know what now eight point five out of ten because it tastes like pure metal when you dry it", "MWDniwcf064": "one two three four five hey how you guys doing just tallying up these numbers right here because I get an experiment on how many full hits it takes to or how many full hits there are and a half gram cartridge you know cuz I was curious so I went ahead and did that if you ever wondered well now I have a almost exact precise number so if you stay tuned and watch this video then that by the end then you'll know the number and you know a little bit more information as well shout out to shout our house you know these are some good good cartridges if you find them out there and dispensaries there anywhere you might want to check them out on that note stay tuned and watch the whole video and I appreciate you guys into the next one everybody has the question so I'm gonna go ahead and give you guys the answer to the best of my ability that is the question is how many true hits can you get out of a half gram cartridge so I'm gonna go ahead no not this one as you can see this one's kind of empty but I'm going to be using this one and this is a timeless sfv og right here but this so you see because most of the time I tap it and I hit them you know a few times at once but for the sake of this test I'm gonna be hitting them one time for through each pool just like this so that's one hit most of the time I like to tap them and try to give it a maximum hit for the back some effect but for the sake of this experiment we're gonna see how many of this take so stay tuned [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now people see that it might be one more Inlet someone mark 20 34 34 you know results from a berry these were fooled some of those Mayberry if you're not taking it might get up with this but I got 34 silent ones hope this information was valuable", "qkCIBbk6lBA": "hello welcome to serenity vape today i want to talk about triangle trading companies delta 8 thc cartridges these are these are really cool i've got one here in a kang vape th-710 it's a nice little drop system vaporizer works really well this is something that's refined from the cannabis sativa plant and put back together but unlike some of the delta 8 thc cartridges that have come before it this is purely extracted from it is entirely from a cannabis plant that has less than 0.3 thc what that means is that not only is the product legal there's zero risk of it containing anything other than delta a thc and the 50 milligrams of terpenes that they put in to give it the same kind of effect that you would get in flour or you know a cartridge that you would get out of a dispensary the quality is good this is really cool it's it still gives you a kind of high it it's pretty strong actually it's less so than your typical your old school marijuana or the kind of carts that you'll get out of the dispensary it's safe it's just delta 8 thc 950 milligrams of it and then they add 50 milligrams of terpenes which make it much like the strain that's on the label for example this is pineapple kush and having had regular pineapple kush and having had this i'd say the experience is spot on i've tried some other strains like maui wowie which has an amazing effect and flavor i was was very awake for it it's one of the things that happens for me i right now i really like their hybrid sour space candy takes away the pain takes away any stomach discomfort i have and i'm chill the the anti-medic or rather anti-nausea stops you from vomiting uh effects of this delta eight thc it it's so effective you know it's not like i went out and i had a bunch of junk food and overheat and tried it you know but what they found about two years ago when they studied this on juvenile chemo patients was that they administered it two hours before chemo and then every six hours after the chemo it completely stopped vomiting for these kids they were able to keep their food down they were able to work through the day you know they were able to go through the rest of their day for me somebody who has celiac and ibs this is this is great you know i could be you know perfectly following my diet and i hear this about people with crohn's too where you know they're doing everything right but sometimes you just need something extra it works for that it works for anxiety it works for pain some of the strains are mellower but for the price point you know you're paying 45 for a one gram cartridge so something that i would say is just a step below medical grade it's it's pretty good especially if you can't afford a medical marijuana license um sometimes there's some serious hoops that you have to jump through to get one and not everybody who needs the assistance that medical marijuana can provide is gonna be able to get a license or a marijuana card whatever you want to call it green card i'm somebody who is very strongly affected by my marijuana and you know 25 to 35 thc and a strain of flour means i can enjoy very little before i might start feeling paranoid or too sluggish to do anything you know like getting couch locked every so often is nice but i not a huge fan i don't feel couch locked with these um i don't feel even like the beginning phases of paranoia you know that that kind of automat like mechanical paranoia that sometimes happens when you smoke like it just there's nothing you know it's not that you don't it's not that you have something in the background that's bothering you it's just boom that doesn't happen with these cartridges i've tried three of their strains so far i started out with the pineapple kush which comes in this nice little package um you can see their qr code on the back the pineapple cush i really liked for its more mellow uplifting effects uh i wasn't like boom boom boom distracted and all over the place the maui was delicious very strong you know i felt like locked in place not because my body was was melting you know as had as has happened on some some indicos i've had but just because my head was buzzing so much and what i've been vaping over the last few days is their sour space candy this so far might actually be my favorite i'm the twist in between on that one um i do get the beneficial effects of the indica i my you know any physical pain i have is turned way down uh and i'm somebody who has fibromyalgia so even on a good day i might be in pain so having something like this uh waiting at home when i'm not at work or even if i am is good for me because i can still focus mostly but my pain is negligible for somebody who has arthritis or fibromyalgia or any other widespread pain disorder i think this is really good as a product the other strain i'm thinking of trying is actually their northern lights remember northern lights putting me out and one customer has told me that they had just one hit off of the northern lights and they were out deep asleep about half an hour they slept through the entire night worked really well for them for me there's not enough of a difference to rush out and go to a dispensary this this cuts the mustard for me now it doesn't cut it for everybody and you'll still find stronger medicine at a dispensary but if that's not an option for you these are really good and even if you can go to a dispensary you might actually be saving money and getting similar enough of an effect or exactly what you need out of these cards thanks to triangle trading company for reaching out to us we really hope that you guys keep doing this i really want to try some of your other strains like headband for example so this is jonathan from serenityvape thanks for listening if you like what you saw or you want to see more

good everybody jpeg here checking in live respectmyregion.com here with another west coast we tour review today's special guest jazzy reviewing the flav rx or i'm sorry it's no longer a flavor rx just the flav one milliliter premium refined cannabis oil ultra slim disposable and rechargeable i said it disposable and rechargeable all all-in-one oil pod and battery so this is lemon hey sativa convenient yeah this is this is super cool it is basically a disposable pen that is a full gram and it is rechargeable so we are here i'm going to open it up you let them know what the what is the say on the like the strain the the lemon haze okay this classic packaging pretty dope and then we look and dropped it here we're looking at the uh the actual device you can see the color of the oil a little bit is gold outside see if we can get out there and there you go nice little gold paint it's beaut it's a beautiful little vape almost looks like a usb drive nice and slick you know it reminds me of jules it honestly does it just reminds me of jewels so one hit review i'm gonna talk about it two hits four out of ten full review available on respectmyregion.com slave doing it big coming in hot working too hard rip it too hard yeah it doesn't say it doesn't oh it does have ingredients uh it says ultra refined cannabis oil so ultra refined is going to be distillate uh just as terpenes and then it says instructions press your lips against the mouthpiece and begin vaporizing by taking a three second drop oops so too big of a draw there that was probably fine misusing it is a common thing in vapes so here we go so you get a fat rip it's definitely potent you can taste the fruity terpenes tastes botanical does not taste like weed yeah definitely tastes like fruits and whatever else natural terps it's a little harsh it's a little harsh i'm sure it was hard for you because you took a long one yeah um i think someone who likes flavored things would probably like those products it rips i mean manufactured 722 it's going to be good until next year 7 22. i'm high you're high off that first i mean 86.84 total cannabinoids is a potent product in regards to you know thc in the best of the world it's not in the 90s by any means but when you combine some good terpenes um it can really get the job done so yeah it's so light it's very it's very light i i like i like how it feels i like how it hits um i like how it's branded i like the flavor there on both sides i think it's super dope it's a little slick for me i would like it to be a little bit more coarse and it does light up here in green when you do hit it on the second hit it's still pretty harsh for botanical terpenes and a disposable vape i think yeah it's definitely harsh look at the quality product would i recommend it not to anybody that wants live resumes or someone that wants the best of the best i think this is great for someone who's on the go very discreet maybe a cbd distillate vapor someone who is really looking for that super lemon haze like if super lemon haze is your favorite this tastes really good doesn't taste like real weed but it does taste really good so i'd say it's worth checking out score out of 10 though a flat eight for me i'm at a 7.5 maybe even a seven it just comes down to the packaging doesn't say what kind of terpenes it is doesn't give you the terpene profile and then the harshness like it just leads into this slippery slope of if you would have just told us that it was botanical terps and i would know in fact what it is and why it's happening oh nothing too just rechargeable disposable on their instagram um price point wise it's not even that expensive either so i mean if your you know disposables are your thing and you want to recharge it and um i don't know why you don't want to i mean i don't think you can change out the pod on this so i'm keeping my eight because it's just like it's convenient it's a full gram so maybe it's gonna die before you rip through the full ram i guess it's rechargeable but it can still die you just have to recharge it that's what i'm saying i feel like 7.5 final score for me i think it is what it is shout out to flav dope product uh definitely go check it out you guys this is another west coast week two review mail we're just keeping it real jazzasaurus j ping respect my region this is the west coast weed tour we

see you on the road", "j1uFvWmihGE": "what's up guys reaper here today we're gonna be talking about row of cartridges how to spot a fake one now this one is going to be one that is kind of simple but it is also going to be extremely extremely tricky and it's going to come down to really one or two things right first of all this is the road that I got I knew that it was pretty hot I knew that it was fake pretty much before I got it just because of the processing on it when my buddies hit me I was like bro I got some rosin Lanka oils I know you've been looking for some Walkers especially asking the cross hanging up the price I was like man [ __ ] I knew they were fake but I was like let me get him he's like I said they'd always says good ol never bought bad oil from this guy but came home that not well actually not that not the next night I didn't I have really didn't even test them out that much price tag on I'm the next not one of my subscribers sent me up on the Instagram asked me how I locked them as opposed to the pic on Instagram I say how Lachlan asked me ways the spot Romans and I was like did I really not even done any research you know so I did a little bit of research for him and within 30 seconds on him I was fake mine was fake for sure 100% the ones that he sent me seemed real but I did a little bit more research and this is where we're gonna get it this at right so the number one thing you want to look for on these boxes is right here there will be you want the California label you know the little California thing I'm just gonna see if it was back here but it's not you know what I'm talking about you need the California thing and then you want the THC percentage and stickers right on the box already it needs to be in stickers so don't let your guy tell you man they were on there they got pulled off blah blah blah all this [ __ ] no so that right there is it you wanted to have stickers that's how you're gonna tell right there if it's real or fake but here's the issue guys this is the car by the way 18 21 years or older smoke along with me if you are that age cheers guys great pull the flavor is amazing it tastes like sweet tarts it's not artificial it's a nice clean flavor the highest grade it lasts it does take about four or five hits to get a no let me tell you let me let me go into this right here if you just want to get a little if you need to like try to help your anxiety or you want to you know just get a little little relaxation calming feeling one two three puffs you're good but if you want to get a buzz if you want to get buzzed you want to get high you want to get smacked you need about four or five but the thing is guys the high with this is so clean and calm it's it's nice it's a nice calming feeling obviously it's it's supposed to be an indica but like I said it's fake so we don't even know if this is an indica in here it does have indica effects now could that be a placebo effect I don't know but you know it is what it is the only thing that I like I said though there's nothing to complain about the hot laughs the flavor is good the pull is good the oil is good in here and it is burning up quicker than I would lock though I've only had this for three days now and I've not been really heavy hitting it and it's going down quite a bit one more cheers guys so now we're going to get into the convoluted [ __ ] right they make fakes with stickers on them the newer fakes that are coming out have the stickers on them some made up amounts just put on there slept on there so now you're saying well how do I know if I'm getting one the trill unless you go in to a dispensary and buy yourself you don't know unless there is another way now this is what we're going to talk about unless you do that you're not going to know there is one other way there is called a store locator did they have for their side and will tell you every store and location did they sell them at that where they are sold and then even then even then you're like oh man I don't know about this or that or what if this happens or that happens no worries real rose now come with a QR code on their books so you just scan it on your phone on the app they have a rose reward app from what on the research I did and it comes on their pups up right then in there you know if it's real or not so Rove has I went into this like man they need to do something because like from what I can tell it's very hard to spot a fake aside just from those stickers in that store locator and then when you're getting deliveries and you're getting on this [ __ ] and you're getting shipments sent to you it's like man how can I tell for real how I mean it's like one of those things where it's like man but then I saw that QR code thing and I was like man props to them for doing that because you know like it you people don't want to throw money and [ __ ] that's not real like if I would have the price I paid for this I knew it was fake right and I'm happy with the price I paid but if I would have paid a price that would adjust the FIDE it being from the railroad company a dispensary price or a prostitute in an illegal state that a lot of these places these people will bump up and throw 5 10 15 even $20 tax on I would have been super mad so you know I can't that's why I'm doing this [ __ ] you guys hopefully this will help somebody but my final thoughts on this was whoever faked it did a good job like I said props to the guy if but I do think that people would just be better off buying their own all these people that have great skills and talent they're going on here week they're gonna put in a position to where they have to buy either these fake cards I mean the fake company carts you know what I mean by that I mean a real company they took real company that put fake cards from that company and then put all in it so and the sad thing is either they can one do that or to put them in stuff like exotics and Mario's Supremes off lights all that dumb stupid [ __ ] so what's the to base the options here can I put my good product in these shitty companies packs that nobody wants to buy or should I put my good product and these fake company packs so the logical choice is gonna be my product is good I can make you know my product shouldn't be put on these standards I want to put them here but now here's the issue is you're gonna [ __ ] people over unless you're doing it for this price right here to where people know like man there's no way that's real that's the only way it should be done but it'd be better off getting done with there should be like a I don't know man there's there has to be a better way than this but I guess as long as people know they hey these are fake those a lot of these TKOs are fake there's certain not just sticky Oh a lot everything's pretty much fake as [ __ ] right now unless you're walking into dispensary and getting it or you can get this [ __ ] super verified if you're in an illegal state or you're in a medical state you know like if you're in an illegal state fully legal recreational you you know preying on having problems but it's just uh it's just crazy out there I know guys unfortunately we're gonna have to wait it out we're gonna have to wait it out of here too until everything gets legal everything gets passed and then at that point you know it'll be on everyone but I'm gonna talk to you guys later thanks for watching subscribe if you're not gonna follow me on Instagram like the Reaper I'll link it down below I will link everything that I've put here down below that way you guys can go and research a little bit further yourself I hope you have a great rest here today", "fGwzqng9AOI": "[Music] hey guys dr. Shawn Mira VG here and it's time for another cannabis product review today I'm reviewing good Supply Blue Dream and this is a vape cartridge using the 510 system it's got a lot of good information even just on the box it says our oil what's inside cannabis distill a plant-based terpenes and the terpenes are quite nice in this one no additives which is what I like and premium ceramic core that sounds good anti leaked technology perfect don't want that leaking in direct airflow system alright so already I'm liking this product it's really kind of cool funky green color there's some good easy to read information on the box so this retails for $43 ninety five cents on the Ontario cannabis store it's got 75 to 83 percent THC meaning it's a quite a potent cannabis cartridge there's really no CBD in here it's a sativa dominant hybrid so a little bit about blue dream so blue dream is a really classic strain that originated in California it was made using two strains blueberry which is known for its sort of blueberry flavor owing to a sort of fruity terpene profile and a really classic sativa strain called haze it's so blue dream has been pretty much known for its sort of full body relaxing effects without being sedating now the licensed producer behind good supply is \u00e1free\u00e1 they're basically a giant here in Canada a huge licensed producer with a lot of brands under its name but good quality products I know a froyo well they're out of Leamington Ontario if anyone wanted to know and they pride themselves with this 509 step process which is basically just means there's they take five hundred and nine steps in they're sort of quality assurance program so everything's held up to a really big standard I guess 5:09 really doesn't mean much to the average person but I'm guessing if you went to their plant and they went through the whole system you'd be pretty impressed anyway so that's a little bit of the backstory about this so let's open it up I really like this box it's really cool so you open it up using these tabs so there's two tabs here so if you push them both in and then you can push the inside of the box out so really kind of sleek and cool and good child protective mechanism there and so your cartridge is inside here and you can just sort of bring it out and that's what it looks like it's got a nice heavy metal heavy metal alright a metal tip which you know it's got a good mouthfeel to it and of course just like all the other 5-10 oops 510 cartridges it fits into your battery just by turning it like this so there you go and then you're ready to go so about blue dream what really stands out about this particular product is the flavor so the flavor is very fruity notes forward it's very true to the blueberry ancestors of blue dream yeah probably one of the most fruity besides maybe the tangerine dream from San Rafael this would be the second most fruity vape I've tried now the effects pretty typical to a blue dream there's this sort of wave of kind of like hazy it just says the name suggests relaxation so I didn't feel particularly what should I say focused during the effects of this one it kind of makes your thinking a bit hazy and sloppy but at the same time it's very relaxing and other point to mention which I notice with this one is it's not sedating at all so I wouldn't recommend this for nighttime use cuz it might keep you up a bit unless you can augment it with something that's a little bit more sedating so yeah so that's pretty much it in a nutshell I'm gonna give this one hmm this is gonna be a tough one because I do like the flavour a lot I like the effects but I'm not crazy about the effects I'm gonna have to give this a seven and a half out of ten yeah a little bit shy of an eight just because the effects aren't my favorite and you know what it is is if I'm going to be taking a sativa that's not going to be sedating that you know is probably better for daytime use I want like I want to have a lot of focus a lot of energy I want to be able to get things done which is not really what this one brings to the table and maybe it's not what this one's designed for this one's really more about chilling and relaxing like during the daytime because it's not sedating but very relaxing so I think a seven and a half for me is fair some other people who want like a more chilled out experience will probably rate it a bit higher but that's what I'm going to give it all around a great product are really happy with the purchase oh yeah and I bought this from a new dispensary in my area of town called Miss Jones I want to just give them a shout out because the the store looks beautiful first of all and the staff was really friendly and I enjoyed talking with them so shout out to you guys at Miss Jones alright that's it for me I'll be back with another cannabis product review for you guys shortly", "I4uHx1zD2Xo": "hey guys what's up in today's video i got a review on a push disposable so let's just get right into this let's check out the packaging this is a live resin uh this is premium live resin this is the alien og it's an indica uh it says organic it's got a picture of the actual live resin bar it's one gram it's rechargeable you got the california medical stamp on it uh the side says push and then push stands for puff until something happens that's the branding like i said i i've not seen any of these i've not seen any video reviews on these i've seen reddit posts on them but i've not actually seen any actual videos on these i've seen the push carts i haven't seen the i haven't looked up the pods so i don't know if there may be some pod videos of the push pods but um yeah i haven't seen any videos so i figured i'd put out a video let you guys know so if you see these you know what to expect uh here's the back it's got the lab test and stuff like pretty much every other cart that's on the black market you got all those this qr takes you to their instagram which i'll give you their instagram in a second don't worry about that and this is to authenticate if it's an actual push um product so disclaimer before anybody comments something bro you're you're smoking dog water bro it's hot dog water broom save yourself time don't come in it you don't know you're talking about okay no disrespect you're not smoking what i am so you don't know what i'm smoking you don't know my plug you don't know my source so i'm gonna leave it at that i'm a little high i already tried to record this uh like twice and every time i just i don't like the way i do it so here we are i'm gonna do it real good this time hopefully but without further ado let's open this alien og it is gonna have uh a sill that goes over this i obviously already opened it so when i slid it in i accidentally slid it in so mine's not going to be sold but here open it up you have your um disposable then it says made in the usa los angeles california um yeah there's the box um their instagram is right there official push product is their instagram go ahead and check them out if you want and yeah they say you can recharge these which i've tried it just takes a micro usb but yeah on the bottom you'll see that it says usb all you do is take your finger and it's got like a little place so you can pull out and there's the charge port which for a disposable that's pretty nice actually i i think that's a game chart changer because you know you're for sure gonna get all your oil so don't be afraid to pick one of these up and be afraid that like yo i'm gonna take a few tokes then that battery is gonna die and i'm not going to be able to smoke point well no as long as you have a micro usb it does not come with a micro usb you have to add one which usually i don't know who wouldn't have a micro usb now that is but yeah so you can charge this which is dope um let me see if i'm missing anything i don't think i'm missing anything i think i hit everything about it this is the alien og again this is what the box of it looks like and yeah here's the the actual disposable i like that it's got the window over here where you can see your oil level then on this side it's actually pretty cool too it has the push the push uh logo and you can see your oil through that window as well and then it says live resin bar then push got your uh light to let you know that it is activating when you draw on it uh on the back it's got your california stamp again and then on the side just your window and that's it and yeah all right let's get right into this boys i'm gonna take uh i am pretty high off this but we're just gonna take like medium hit there is no dry hitting this for flavor as soon as you draw it does you know hit so cheers dudes hope you guys are smoking along dab it along smoking a joint roll your joint pause the smoke with me but cheers dudes pretty decent little hit for not a blinker really smooth uh the draw is not bad on this pretty easy draw uh this doesn't hit you in the back of the throat and burn your throat when you when you're hitting it or at least me it does not uh yeah the flavor on this i'm not really good at explaining flavors so i'm not gonna i'm not gonna leave a flavor description because i'm not good at it tastes just like um pretty much just like weed in a cart you know i mean that's you know with some flavor that there's not much to it uh it is good though effects i would say pretty high give this a this is an indica i prefer indicas because i like that just calm me down kind of like let me chill so yeah i would say i'm getting that i am being able to kick back i'm feeling myself just kind of my body like my muscles are loosening up and i'm just kind of chilling you know um what else trying to think anything you guys would want to know about uh how long these last i like i said this is my first one so i'm not the best person to ask how long this will last black and sap took some pretty big draws off this i mean it's got some bubble action in there going on at the top that you can kind of see so um yeah i'll just have to update in the comments and let you know about how long this lasts i'm assuming it'll last a week maybe maybe two i'm not really sure just really depends on how much it took i do like like i said i like to roll a couple joints every now and then so uh just kind of just on my go you know take a few tokes while i'm out about but yeah i want to do a review for you guys like i said i keep seeing these pop up my plugs had them for a while and i just they keep selling down i i never get any but uh i like the whole concept that you don't need to buy battery you don't need anything you grab it you're ready to go you there's no extras you know you ain't got to worry about if your battery's charged you ain't got to worry about none of that with this because i mean pretty much you know right out the box you're ready to go i mean i don't know how good the battery life is but i'm assuming it's pretty good considering like i mean look at how big this thing is i don't know this does produce some vape so there is that i hope you guys did enjoy this let me know if uh you have tried these and if you have seen them let me know what you think and uh yeah without further ado spin your boy exotica i'll see you guys in the next one bye", "PAk3eXM8VhU": "guess for starters let's put some water in the bond hey guys so today we are going to be sitting down and doing our second edition of flower versus concentrate the strain that we are going to be looking at it's going to be Girl Scout cookies or gse depending on where are you buying it from and what the hubbub about Girl Scout cookies versus GSC is I suppose the only reason I say that is because today somebody was just telling me that there has been like all of this hubbub and legal matters was surrounding the name Girl Scout cookies because I don't know trademark reasons Girl Scout cookie reasons I'm going to be sitting down and talking to you guys about the strain as a whole and talking about its effects in flower form and concentrate for him and then we're gonna choose which one I like better as a hybrid Girl Scout cookies is a really great middle-of-the-road strain great for the afternoons if you want to just hang out on the couch or if you're kind of indecisive but you just want to smoke a bong and you might get up and do something later I personally enjoy Girl Scout cookies most when I'm about to sit down and watch a movie and just kind of do mindless stuff for the rest of the day though again I do definitely like it as one of those strains were like I'm gonna sit down and I'm gonna smoke it as if I'm going to be lazy and not do anything for the rest of the day but if for some reason I end up having to get up and go run errands or you know do something I'm not totally groggy and like in the couch from the strain I feel like Girl Scout cookies is one of those strains that has a very familiar look and smell to it like like when you see Girl Scout cookies and you smell it and you taste it you know it's Girl Scout cookies umm GSC just has this really vibrant green and orange look to it it's pastilles are very very like fluffy and orange and Girl Scout cookies is such a like sweet almost like fruity scent which is kind of funny because when I think of Girl Scout cookies I think of like thin mints or dozy doats but it totally does have a very like sweet fruity candy almost like aroma it's taste does kind of represent that sort of fruity candy taste but it definitely does have more of a cookie taste I guess you could call it so the parents trains of Girl Scout cookies are Durbin poison and OG Kush which are two strains that I've never had a chance to try before so I always find it interesting to come across what the parent strains of some of my personal favorites are and just to see whether they are strains that I'm a fan of or that I've even tried or heard of GSC has kind of made a name for itself in the medical marijuana community as being a pretty popular strain for just everyday stress and depression as well as it's been known to be a really great just body relaxing strain as well as like total mind relaxing as well so like I said Girl Scout cookies can kind of be in any time strain I personally like it in the afternoon however I can see it being a really good strain to start your day with a fewer person with super high anxiety or maybe really manic depression on days that I don't have a big to-do list Girl Scout cookies is definitely on my breakfast menu so in Flour forum I would have to say that Girl Scout cookies is one of my favorites overall I mean it just has a really great look a really great smell and a really great feel to it it's definitely one of the more popular flower strains on the market I have noticed as well now that we've covered the flour part of this video let's get right on into the concentrate part of the Girl Scout cookies I have transferred my concentrates just into this little oil slick because it's just easier to contain them than the packaging that never had provided so Girl Scout cookies as a wax definitely for me is different than Girl Scout cookies for me as a flower I noticed that I'm definitely a little bit more able to relax with the Girl Scout cookies flower like I could probably fall asleep whereas the concentrate form of it is definitely a little more upbeat I notice I always find it interesting how depending on whether you get a strain in flour or concentrate it will definitely affect you differently or it definitely affects me differently I notice I've definitely heard some people say that they think Girl Scout cookies has a sort of diesel e or fuel scent or taste to it I don't really get that in the flour however I definitely do get it in the wax form I feel like in the wax form it also has more of like a desert flavor versus like a candy or fruity flavor GSC is one of those strains it's almost like a triple threat between the way that it looks the way that it smells and like it's After Effects of smoking and using it um like I don't know I just feel like it's such it's such a common strain and it's just like hit home for so many people and gotten on there like top three favorites I definitely prefer the wax form of GSC for more upbeat things versus the plot the versus the flower form where I definitely would use that for more of like an evening on the couch or you know like I don't know crafts or something I can definitely see myself using the wax form for an afternoon yoga hanging out with friends or you know just kind of getting some light work done around the house nothing too major nothing that I need like a super sativa for but all right I'm gonna have myself one more dab and then we're gonna have to choose which I like better the flower or the concentrate form of GSC and today we are devin on our xlb glass rig that we got in seattle this thing is like I was just shopping cases before I was sitting down to record this video I'm so excited at the beginning of this video I really did think that I had my mind made up already whether I was going to like the flower or the concentrate form of the GSC better I mean I really really thought that it was going to be the flower I'm like I think you know actually I think it still is going to be the flower form of the GSC that I like better but like that dad really threw me for a loop like I'm blown away right now I think that the flower is going to be the winner winner chicken dinner of this flower versus concentrate episode with you guys I guess I'll call it an episode it's our second episode I feel like Girl Scout cookies for me in flower form is just like a really great end of the day kind of like melt away the stress of the day kind of just sit back on the couch and watch an episode of something and just relax the wax form was just like phenomenal I'm still just blown away by how how incredible that dab made me feel so that's always like something that I'm going to be keeping right up here thank you guys so much for joining me I hope you get a chance to try the both flower and concentrate form of GSC or Girl Scout cookies however you may like to call it and I will see you guys again for another episode of this hopefully it'll be a lot sooner than it took me to get in this one after the first episode which was the arcade a train wreck but alright I'll catch up with you guys later feel free to subscribe if you have not ready give me a thumbs up if you have not already put some words in that little comment box if you have not already and I will see you guys later", "fyxnH-WxBMc": "all right everybody welcome back to the channel again i just want to take a second and

the bottom of my heart means a lot if you do watch the videos you haven't subscribed if you think about subscribing that mean a lot to me i'm going to constantly be bringing products into review different brands different strands edibles um tinctures i'm working with this couple of dispensaries other than the one that i might that i work at i'm um on doing reviews i they know what i'm doing they know what i'm trying to do and they like the idea so um a few of them work with me one today wasn't real receptive i kind of try to have a talk with them because a lot of their cartridges are 40 bucks out the door but they only want to run deals for 400 on other platinum vape or their mkx which is an overloaded it's an overloaded stock is what they have in that in that um in that strand they have they've got an over abundance of them so they sell them at that at that a high-ass market that the not high-ass what are they going to say they sell them at the lower market and then they want to keep the other ones and assignments sell them at a higher as market to the um um recreational patients or our clients may be then they're making more money off the product you know what i mean so like every once in a while you get like your um select you'll get those on sale for four four hundred or whatever it's whatever they have over abundance of stock that they're trying to get rid of and so i was telling them you know like your big gases are f are 40 bucks your choices are 40 bucks your fuegos are 40 bucks what's the difference why wouldn't you do 400 on all of those so they weren't real receptive she said the manager said well maybe we'll take that into consideration and do it at a later time so and then i was like so you're not going to do it for me today that you're not going to do the 400 she wasn't willing to so i took my business elsewhere i told him i'm sorry i'm going to go somewhere else today i apologize so i went over to um my gold my go-to place is sticky ipsy i went over there and um hollered at my blood tender that i deal with over there she's very knowledgeable very intelligent very beautiful but tender she went through some options with me on what i could possibly be doing with the channel um as far as good products to review we talked about um big gas they didn't have a big selection of big gas so we didn't really worry about that one um then we went forward and we talked about uh turk tanks and she kind of laughed i i did pick out three terp tanks and they're three or three for a hundred well whatever i'll three for a hundred i'll do just so i can bring something to review for the channel and uh she picked them out of a bin on the floor they're like not no you know they weren't like laying on the floor they were in a band sealed up she picked up the bin they didn't even have them on the wall and she was like got him out of there and she was kind of hesitant you know like i said she knows me she was kind of hesitant and she said well we have we offer these ones too maybe you should think about these ones then she started pitching them to me telling me that she uses them regularly and that they help her out a lot and whatnot so what we're gonna step next into guys is claw 510 thread see cell of you know i got three of them today there's three for a bill and uh i went with um zettles times gelat or gelato times littles it's a hybrid then i got um a uh ouch it is a uh blueberry yum yum and i got us a obama kush obama kush came really highly rated are recommended um by that said butt tender she said it was a really good strand so therefore that's what we're gonna check out that's what we got for the next review couple reviews we still had a platinum vape yet a sativa to check out we still got two our on one blue dream um select i've been saving because i really like those selects i've been saving that for the back burner and then um we have our stizzies i have a sour candy to review and then we have h3 to review so we still have some in the bank before we make our next move to whatever what we're gonna do next but today i figured this blueberry yum yum after i got it i was driving home and i was thinking about it i got that damn blue to chris song stuck in my head i couldn't get it out so the whole way home is just on joyful ride home but um she talked about it so much elections coming up i don't know why but i think we're gonna go with it just feels right to go through obamacare unpolitically unpolitical um so right out of the package forgot i'm sorry i've never had one of these i just opened one up for the first time right out of the package it just pops right out sits in right up here in the little like plastic are not plastic with a little like cardboard cubby type deal um the box is freaking huge for that little for that little cartridge i mean i could fit three of my batteries in here it's a huge box look at that big giant box um it's got your silicone tip cover and your normal silicone uh c cell cover there it also looks like it's re reusable it's open yeah it is reusable i don't recommend you know reusing these some people do reuse them they'll get like the dark that's still dark i've reviewed one on the channel before i believe it's mkx um og sorry i gotta move this um it was og mkx um i don't if you're gonna refilm i would say just get a clean car charge a brand new one and refill that because what happens is you know you get your cotton that's down here inside your coil and it fills up with that once it has it's absorbed all that you know resin or terpenes whatever you want to call it this lit once it's absorbed all that it kind of tends to always taste like that very first one that's been ran through it so if you want to taste your cartridge or your dart you know real pure and that is purest form i would suggest just putting it in a totally new cartridge but anyways again so this comes in at uh 79.4 no cbd that's total cannabinoids so obamacush by claw and i'm just looking to see where if it will state where it's made at this is made out of it just says uh jackson michigan and it just gives the number here it doesn't even have a name clddlcc out of jackson michigan so don't really say i don't know if this is something you guys can get locally on where you're at too if you're not in michigan i'm not 100 sure but i'm gonna rip into it and see how it is oh wow again i'm sorry if my coffin bothers anybody it seems like if i do cough and bother somebody if i don't come and bother somebody so as opposed to coughing in your ear i don't really mean to do that it's just i'm hitting i'm hitting a vape so i mean i'm gonna cough a little bit i try my best and if i do get carried away if you watch any of my videos i do apologize for it that's why i don't like doing that that's why i don't do blink or seshes and all that other stuff because i'm not here to choke while i'm trying to have a conversation with you guys but sometimes this [ __ ] gets you there's nothing deal crawls up on you it punches you're in the throat and hits you right in the lungs but this is really nice really really smooth tasting that's got a nice flowery oh my gosh a nice flowery earthy smooth taste i can't even really put my finger on that because i've never had it any of the other cartridges it's really smooth wow that is really amazing it's really clean smooth it's got a nice flowery taste to it on top of that like real earthy cushy it's got an actual kush flower taste to it it's amazing it really is i'm not even bullshitting she said i was gonna be happy that is really good i mean a1 dude 100 no cap not bullshitting but whatsoever that is a smooth ass cartridge right there obama kush wow it almost makes you want to just rip into these other ones right now that's how good it to how smooth it was now am i saying it's going to be like my top favorite i'm not going to say that off of just a few hits i am going to say that it is an incredible tasting cartridge it's definitely worth the money you know if you can get three for 100 or if you want to check it out you know you got 60 bucks or whatever you want to get a cartridge to get you through the week i think you'd be very happy with with the obama cush by claw i really do i think it would last you probably through the week it's nice and smooth it's got a good good taste to it good flow for straight from the cartridge that is probably that is really really smooth it really and i've taken like four hit three or four hits not even big ones i already feel laid back so i mean when they say that this is a defined superior vape they're not they're not bs and i can see why they charge a little bit more packaging is really nice it's really nice nice package as big as a shoe box for a damn cartridge but other than that it's really good i mean i don't find any floss i can't find any flaws in it so far i mean i'll have to see through the use of it how how last excuse me apologize um i have to see you know through the use of it um the last time but other than that yeah i'm impressed um hats off the claw this is my first claw that i had so i don't want to jump too high on on the clawed on the claw deck yet because i've only had one you know one you know what i mean one one can be one thing i mean look at presto there's littles i'm gonna tell you too i reviewed i've had presto i've had five of them and i've had all the carts over there the empty boxes i was gonna put them up on the wall but i don't even put them on the wall because i'm not i'm not even i don't even [ __ ] with presto but their zittles was good i bought one of those littles and after that i was all downhill a waste of money pissed never buy another presto again i don't know if you know what presto is but i'll introduce you to the channel so i plan on doing a whole video on presto so so i don't fall for that [ __ ] anymore right off a rip because you know i don't you never know what's going to happen the blueberry yum yum could be gross or you know the littles can be bad too i don't know yet so off of that just off of that i'm only going to give it a four now that might change coming from you know me trying the other ones but i'm gonna say it's a four it's really good it's really [ __ ] i'm sorry it's really freaking smooth it's got a nice nice dark gold liquid in it nice dark and gold and they don't do much for the packaging it's like it's got a fuego like a fuego merry metal balls um what other company i think um uh what is it choice you know you know with the tip the ceramic just the basic ceramic tip and the basic cartridge but what's on the inside man it's really they really they did really refine it and really make it smooth i will say that man it's so smooth on the exhale and you get that real flowery earthy smooth taste that comes off of it i'm really i'm really shocked by this i'm really um and i've never tried them until now i wish i would have tried them a lot sooner because i probably would like to you know i mean i probably would have been ahead of the curve here a little bit um i thank you budtender if you're watching thank you for your help today yeah hands down good cartridge let's hope that the next ones roll along with the punches it's the same um everybody out there i think again i'm going to be real quick sorry the video's already long i thank you very much for watching the videos for um commenting for for commenting for liking for talking with me i think oh thank you all for all that i'll always be here if anybody needs me if they need anything or if you have something you would like me to review please feel free to give me a holler and ask i'll try my best to get a hold of it and review it for you cbd codes if anybody's interested have those as well as well as the rewards and another thing is the tray guy uh guess five bucks i don't know who you are i forget um but i need your information so let's figure out a way we can swap back hit me up in the comments in the video maybe we exchange exchange emails and uh go from there if not i'm going to go down the line and give it to the next person from there that guess the next number i'm an honest person i just want to make sure they get you guys get it if i say i'm going to do something on the channel always going to do it so again claw by i believe monster but we're just going to say claw by claw but we know what that red x is it's monster all right everybody so four on this one really really really smooth really good seems like a really good brand so far i'm gonna keep my fingers crossed that the rest of them are like that i don't know if you've had claw if you have had it go ahead and put down the comment section let me know what you thought about it did you like it did you not i'm interested in deceive because i know a few of us talk back and forth and we have a lot of the same taste in common so i'm interested to see if you have the same um view or if you had the same experience with claw i appreciate all you guys so much i will be back later with another review um i'm gonna try to knock out that other platinum vape possibly or the other um uh select elite so again sorry the video ran so long just wanted to say a few things and i was pretty surprised by this product so again go ahead and check this out let me know what you thought about it i'll be back as soon as i can with some more reviews guys", "m_RvuDfuNIA": "hey guys we're going to be talking about delta 8 t8c uh i've been educating myself on it actually picked some up thursday before last it was by treetop himco it was orange cookies and it was the last cartridge they had so i figured why not you know just try it so i i wanted to try three chi um i actually picked a cartridge of that up this past weekend um that was purple punch i had to go to kentucky for that actually they didn't sell it in my area even though it's made here in indiana but i actually had one coming in the mail ordered it two sundays ago we just got here today and with the holiday and covid and coming from wisconsin it just went all over the place but it finally arrived so this is uh what that looks like and i like the packaging of it you can actually feel the uh the grooves these lines it's all they put some time i guess into their box and it's pretty cool how you can actually feel the ridges and it's not just a flat box and on the back they they do give some uh pretty detailed uh info which i like um now these are both uh purple punch um this i have not uh tried the effects of the purple punch tree top yet just got it in the mail but um dry hitting it it tastes uh pretty good um not very grapey um but this cartridge tastes more like grape kool-aid um as you can see there's the package and on the back they they tell you all kinds of stuff 931.6 milligrams of delta 8 thc 17.6 milligrams cbn 0 delta 9 thc and 0 cbd it tells you only two to three second puffs i recommend only take two to three seconds you're gonna get choked up and you might risk burning out the uh you know the cotton inside of the cartridge and you don't spend all that money to waste um no ingredients hit back hip extract terpenes directions remove silicone uh take one puff wait 20 minutes before determining if you need more that's only to me if you're not used to thc at all or if you've never had thc or it's been a while just take one because i've read about people you know just getting so stoned because they're not used to thc at all um don't use it pregnant or nursing uh i i i don't condone this if you're under 21 and use this um i was under 21 whenever i started using cannabis and i if i could go back i would just wait you know just live your life and uh just be happy and be a kid don't waste your brain cells on this [ __ ] right now you know just wait through they're a little bit older you know for me it's more uh medicinal i don't go around with people and do this recreationally it's personal i just want to let other people know that this stuff here is legit so we're gonna give her a role i have been kind of tugging on it now i paid 29 for the treetop one and they gave me a code and if you buy one they'll give you another code to get like 20 off so you save money either way every time you buy hemp living usa is where i got it from and it seems that that is the only one that i found that really gives you discount codes they have like my cbd haven and all that and i haven't ordered from them yet i'd like to order locally you know because uh this comes from fishers indiana by indianapolis they say not to screw this on tight i usually will go tight and then i'll unscrew it and i'm using a goo stick battery if anyone's familiar with that and i'll wait until the letter c cell are matching up with the uh button and that seems to do all right and uh we're gonna go here i picked this up uh last saturday i've kind of been using it every night and uh they last a good while if you're just not being stupid with it either so here we go now i will say that do not exceed two to three second puffs just take two three seconds stop two three seconds seconds seconds breathe in let go and then you can take a couple more and two at a time if you want to so here we go first hit feels like nothing but you'll get choked up as you keep hitting on it this stuff is very good if you're trying to abstain from flour or delta nine you know this is a very good replacement still get you to sleep still get you through the day still make you high it was just a bummer the flower illegal in indiana but i can drive 10 minutes away from where this video is being made in illinois completely legal in that [ __ ] but this is some pretty good stuff you know you know this here is more of like a one-two punch to the head they describe it purple punch hence the punch but it uh i prefer orange cookies now i've only tried now the purple punch and orange cookies but orange cookies was more of a cerebral behind the eyes you know really good for bed uh good for the day if you're trying to get stuff done this here just kind of like makes me so unproductive for the day it's better for night you older dude it seems like if you hold it on like for like even four seconds like really it's like a one-two punch to the head but this stuff is uh legit guys it's uh it doesn't last like forever you know if you just want if you just take one or two you're still gonna feel it but it's not gonna last like super long um other people will tell you it doesn't do anything um maybe they didn't consume it the right way um i did try the gummies by treetop hemp co i tried the rainbow ones they were like 30 milligrams a piece uh and i just i never was an edible guy never had him around i was just i like that immediate feeling from smoking and i get that from the cartridges i just gummies is i don't like something that just hits me you know whenever i'm not ready for it um but this stuff is good i uh i highly recommend it as a replacement um i picked one up from my local shop uh an hour away from here and then i picked the three chia from a shop uh cbd time in lexington kentucky um but then i ordered uh this purple punch from hemp living usa from wisconsin the only thing that went from wisconsin to illinois to indianapolis to kansas to missouri back to indiana then to kentucky and then indiana and kentucky again and then back to indiana so it was like all over the place but i can still track it you know on usps and uh maybe that was because it was a holiday weekend uh and then coveted also but um you know it did arrive and now i have a little bit of orange cookies left i have three cards so i'm probably gonna order uh some more so i do recommend this stuff um try it out make sure it stays legal because it is hint derived it follows the law according to the 2018 farm bill so you can't just give us a good thing and take it away so make sure you try it make sure you buy it make sure you support it and just keep it on the market because one day us here in illegal illegal states are gonna have delta nine we're gonna have cannabis legally and this is just you know a stepping stone so thank you guys for watching uh if you wanna see more um like comment subscribe just leave me a comment if you want to see some more of me sampling different strains and letting you know the effects so thank you guys see you later", "Yi3i4F-DBlo": "[Music] what's a bad simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is the interesting video this is obviously a cartridge video but this is surprising I've never seen like a cartridge come in this measurement before and that measurement is 0.75 this was only like 25 or something like 25 to 28 dollars I'm not too sure I forgot but you can see right here it says 0.75 milliliters or grams or whatever we want to call it and it is white Walker ology by cruise I've never tried cruise cartridge but I've tried they're there but and it was good you know very very decent flour for decent prices but I believe this is also this is going to be distantly I believe so you know which is still pretty good you know I'm not I like distillate but as you like I really prefer like sauce cards or live raising card some more you know but this split is it bad it's just sometimes it's just like a artificial flavor so we're gonna see what this is and this is white Walker og you see all the specifications right there everything on the back you can pause if I'm going too fast hopefully it's focusing so just like in the other previous videos I like to mention that my merch is available right now I'll post the link in the bond description below this is just one of the sweaters and they have various colors I think I have like twelve twelve designs on there so like if you don't like one maybe you'll like on another one you know so there's one things to choose from and there's a lot of colors on all of them so I got you there and if you guys are interested I'll post a link people been telling me to make merch for a while and these are all designs I've made myself and I feel like it's more genuine that way because I wouldn't want to paste to design something for me I feel like it should come from the content creator you know and not to knock on any of like other content creators but some of their stuff is a little bit lacking I really wanted to like make it known that I made these and also you know I I understand that most people don't really want cannabis on their shirts so that's why I have some shirts that's just it's more about my life you know like how I was actually born in San Francisco I have a San Francisco shirt the bridge is a conic bridge I think we all know even people that don't live in California fall you know about the Bay Bridge and there's a story behind that because like I named that shirt the bridge to the Spencer eeeh and it's because back when Modesto didn't have too much we had to go to the bay and get all their [ __ ] you know and we had to cross that bridge and it's a play on to that one movie I didn't even see that movie Bridge to Terabithia there's some [ __ ] so I thought it was pretty cool but yes you were not inclined to buy any of these things if you want to support me and buy one of these you're more than welcome to but you're also more than welcome to just not buy it and just chilled me still so let's get on with this [ __ ] review what are you doing but link will be in the book down below so this is white Walker og syndicate as you can see right here really really good stuff it looks pretty nice no no way cartridge so far it's a [ __ ] plastic radiator Calvin your sticker our caution sticker whatever you want to call it I'm not gonna lie this looks pretty [ __ ] nice this thing the oil test or whatever this is dumb as hell I mean I've seen some that's very liquidy and you know what that's just it but very thick I mean this just proves how thick the oil is I mean other than it's [ __ ] legit cuz it's not moving no it could still be sure you know trash off the bed notice that there's some like weird like thing on here that I definitely gotta wash off be using it in my as a beauty which reminds me I still need to do that giveaway for this I'm waiting on light so I can do a live on YouTube in choose a winner but guys [Music] Cheers [Music] very small - not too tasty at all of you is that some sort of taste but I'm not really sure how to describe it I mean it's definitely alright I definitely wouldn't prefer other cartridges I mean what enticed me though was that it was 0.75 for twenty-something dollars which is pretty weird for a cartridge like they usually never come in 2075 so I had to get it never tried cruise cartridges soul paper production is there though it's a very like the sensation to cough afterwards is minimal the taste can't really describe the taste but it's minimal as well other than that pretty decent cartridge if you don't really care about taste you're trying to forget about value out of what you buy because it is 80 percent THC cartridge and I believe it as some sort of amount of CBD in it other than that very good cartridge for what it is not a very tasty one in my opinion but that's just me maybe it's just because I brush my teeth no but woman playing an end the video here hopefully you guys enjoyed it [Music] [Music] [Music]", "pWJXpYvsv38": "what's up you two how is everybody I got something new for everybody today I know that everybody has seen like these in my videos honestly I don't think I've done a review on yet I'm not sure but anyways anyways y'all know my background anyways you guys we got a Maui wowie distill the cartridge now I've done the exotic arts and I've had a lot of debate and this and that but yeah I wanted to do one on an actual legit cart from an actual dispensary alright and again this is an oil oil product or a little by craft sorry a craft products it's a craft products a lot of people are familiar with them especially Paige like Denver and Colorado Springs because that's where it's from this is like I said is legit one and it's Maui wowie stream folks I know all y'all watching this video know that spraying is notorious trans so we're gonna session and cheers to it I think it's pretty good I'm gonna show you guys your label here BAM you can always positive on my channel there you know there's the potency chart a lot of people call it different things but yeah of course all your legal stuff I always show that like I said there's all your ingredients you always want to look that up I think there is legal legal pesticides of you that mean kind of legal and regulated to have you don't have so much and you know cuz it isn't supposed to be as bad for you and all that you know but I mean if you never know what something is just google it a lot of times we'll discover that there is legal pesticides in it but here's the Bashan numbers and no matter what as you can see this does not say pesticide free folks look at my last video and this does not say it let's see if it has any I mean I bet it has illegal honestly I better add some kind of legal pesticide in so I'm not seeing the actual ingredients on this you could always pause it go over it yourself but yeah a lot of you already know the three times here's the actual cartridge it is a 500 mg or a half a gram cart got a piece off go ahead and go to the office behind us here grab a stick trusty dusty adjustable battery cell protecting while it charges preheat mode optional whose batteries twists limbs dick screwed in like I said I got to stick with the little cuts at the bottom I'm purpose but uh Maui Wowi folks there it is cheers and I'll tell you what I think 80 2.54 per scene I think that's some of the higher percentages we've actually seen in here remember the exotic cars were only hitting 67 percent when they were actually testing here fire folks like I said guys good stuff man good stuff man yeah that's Maui wowie thank you guys I give this one a 8 it's been a better Carter just potency it keeps me in a boo-boo they don't got the flavor some of them got but that means there's probably no artificial flavor Kron don't you still it thanks for tuning in man you liked it any times

seen that mud we have this alaric cart I found that I didn't really see before there's holes in the bottom of the cartridge here so literally you get all out you don't lose nothing which is pretty cool so we're gonna give us a whack old iron along he'll break kilobytes my anything sodaw what up has it has a different taste of their flower they definitely stepped up their game huge on the flower we have a little bit of lemon [Music] [Music] yeah check out I love the cartridge I don't like is the air holes up here oh it just seems like you're sucking way too much area in with these air breakdown Keystone ha ha but anyways with all the cartridges I had I had the Cresco gone field I had the prime Afghan chunk or some prime Afghan chunk the Alera ecto cooler and the Calypso chem dog I brought all them down there with me all brand new reviewed them all literally had a whole day with each of them that prime cartridge will start there the prawn carton and the Calypso I started out with the rocket fuel cousin boat like the rocket fuel I didn't like it wasn't as full as I wanted it to be tour seemed like there was a lot of head space on the Cresco cartridge but I liked it the Cresco cart they always taste good to me Cresco cartridges they just have a good flavorful taste but back to the prime that prime cartridge was one of my favorites it tasted amazing tasted like you just did a DAB this'll erawan I mean pretty much what do you think it tastes like we've done yeah how's it don't really have a taste yeah it's just like it's like I can't force the off with different ones yeah this one here I do but I just I don't know I like people like P I like making the videos more than using them like I'll give whoever is with me or whatever whatever I got a med card you know I'll give them I'll give them a try the shot let me know if it turns black but I usually just smoke the cartridges from the dispenser Aries no yeah I mean it's just with all the craziness that's going on all the cartridge [ __ ] it's like it's hard to trust anybody I mean if I do make a cartridge I get all the paperwork from the company to me hey they show me the you know what's what's actually in the mixture you know main pg/vg coke or not MCO oil or MTO oil whatever whatever whatever but back so I'd rather yes I'm way around our smoke dispensary cartridges but if you can save big money smoking making your own cartridges and smoking on me I want to put some of that cigarettes so I bought a jewel down it in Florida because everything's they're cheap down there got of jewel from down Florida and as soon as it runs out I like the hash Hayes I like hash Hayes and in the gun we only really have grams I mean no we they really only sell half-grams our dispenser arey they go from anywhere from 40 is the lowest I've seen them that was from Terrapin good cartridges but I swear they go really fast like the liquid in them it's like seems like it goes really quick and that's again with the prime the prime like I said I loved it very Medicaid and heavy in the cup it got me through a couple good days but I say it seemed like it went the fastest out of all the cartridges was that Prime one but the crest no like I said it it's a crush no cartridge they're all the same they all got a little head space I like that they all taste good to me some you know are way better than others but the crest goes good they're all good they're all good cartridges but that calypso on that one there it tastes amazing and it [ __ ] lights you up lights you up it's so thick like the UH it's the oil and it's so thick that like it leaves a film inside the whole cartridge I left the Donner was burning up you know you start getting there I so I hate that's not like about this cartridge it has some air holes at the bottom so you get all we're gonna find out but you should get all of your you know stuff out of them [Music] oh oh anyways we are doing something crazy we have found a weight of it takes you ever see the guy that holds the vacuum blower thing and puts the big drum wheel up there it's like the things that blow up the car lock inflatable he died he died yes see that's that's so nice how that stays right down in there your holes are right at the bottom so you're probably gonna get every drop that Calypso cartridge it was all I mean I loved that cartridge that cartridge is my favorite powerful taste the taste of that clip suppose it was Kevin dog even their wax and waxes booze totally amazing not worry from Wow gives you the sweats face Illinois's alright if you house the Cresco cartridge is out there in Illinois because I'm getting a lot of different mixed up stories about the cartridges out there but yes we are gonna do I'd like to do it as soon as we get a thousand or two thousand on here or thousands so there 80 to $90 for a crusty old cartridge see we don't have edibles on here that's what's due fees our cartridges like I said the cheapest forty dollars Cresco cartridges are $50 to I think they have the reserve line they're $75 I think want to say that's the highest price on a cartridge but that's only a half a gram and if they do have a gram which I've seen them I think once or twice I don't know if I I don't know if I had one I don't know if I had a gram I had the new stones I don't know where I'm going with this but you know no I doubt Oh bro hell yeah I'm not watch something I was like swear I was the first one to get a sticky stick in Michigan I went to the reef dispenser Airy the owners dizzy was just there I got ready I'm at like the donors

turned up to a honey rather in fact a hundred thousand so i did enjoy this weekend and i got two products that also helped me enjoy this weekend guys you guys might want to check them out they're at another super store these i only shop at two superstores guys only deal with two superstars all right dr ganja and my other guy y'all guys already know who that is so dr ganja they have a bigger variety of the d8 cards right now guys right so i got two of them right now just to show you guys i and y'all guys know how i am about these d8s i'm still dealing with them until i find out that they're um really really not good for you or something happens to me so i'm like uh a guinea pig for you guys all right so um i hope you guys appreciate that too so this is coming in from dr ganja those are my guys over there i love dr ganja guys so when you get your package you will receive a card with all of their information it's a thank you for your purchase and ways to contact them also and yes you do get dope stickers they come in different colors so i don't know which one you guys gonna get in the pack when you get them and i got two cards guys i got the mango kush that's this one here all right and i think um the company that made this is um herbal farmer rx and um this mango kush has 92 percent delta eight thc this is a foreground and it says here [Music] it has a whole bunch of warning labels as far as don't take this operate heavy machinery you know the usual and um it also lets you know that this product is not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent any disease they have a barcode that can be scanned right there i haven't opened this one yet so let's open this up and i know this one is very very turkey deprived i mean derived as far as they put a lot of flavoring in it i guess because this one has a darker color than i'm used to with delta eight i usually have them nice and clear like the canon eight i'm going to show you guys that too and uh this one has flavor so i want to see what it tastes like we're going to hook this one up right now and then we'll go over the candy aid as well but i just want to let you guys know how this one is and this is the mango cush guys that i'm hooking up i get that later not a big deal but just let me hook this up real quick and only take 30 seconds all you got to do is get the rubbers over there now i'm gonna put it on to my battery okay and i like this battery a lot i have a few of them but this is actually my favorite battery guys so if you see it a lot that's because it's my favorite so check this out guys it's all hooked up to the battery and this is what the mango kush is looking like i'm going to turn this on low i always start off low let me tell you guys um i made a mistake with one of my delta 8 carts and i was using them on high and um at the end when it got low i noticed that i was getting um it was getting stuck basically and i had to pull real real hard to get it and i figured if i just turned down the voltage on my battery it would help and it did okay so i haven't had that problem anymore so it's not getting clogged up so i have it on the lowest setting as you guys can see that's me just heating it up a little now i'm gonna let you guys know what the flavors like [Music] definitely got some mango up in there definitely got some mango up in here yes so you guys could get it just like this that has that natural flavor okay [Music] this one is the white widow guys okay this white widow is a cross between the brazilian sativa land race and uh resin heavy south indian indica wow sounds good but what i do like about that one the canon eight is that it makes you talk alive i had a few friends over this weekend and i had them try that out and nobody could shut up so that right there is definitely a sativa uplifting blah blah blah blah blah thing right there i like it very good for company guys and this one right now i'm just enjoying the taste and i haven't got the effects yet this one is 92 percent delta 8 thc so [Music] there's a little less than this one here which is the canon eight and this one has 95 percent guys all right but there's no delta nine tac detected so all of this is coming from cannabinoids from cbd hemp so i don't know how they did it but the minute they make the flower have these effects oh man it's gonna be a beautiful day so it takes a little getting used to with that mango flavor me personally i am not big on flavor flavor when it comes to any card whether it's cbd whether it's uh even the regular cards any card i'm not big on the flavor i take that natural taste [Music] but for everybody that loves flavor this thing is packed this is packed let me grab the wrapper okay so like i said this delta eight mango kush thc is a good taste to it me i'm just not a fan of flavors in my [ __ ] that's okay um it's nothing but added chirps so it's not like it's a bad thing it's just that me personally i don't know if it's just that i'm a type dude but um this flavor is really good you know i just prefer natural guys naturally but i can't get with it so i do feel the effects right now and this one has more of a calming effect if you ask me the uh canon 8 we're going to hook that up right now let me just take this off put this to the side now the canon has that natural flavor natural terps is the white widow strand and let me hook this up real quick guys see i tell you it's definitely doing its job because i'm starting to feel nice warm and fuzzy guys nice warm and fuzzy and it's kind of chilly in um atlanta today guys also so all right so we already got it hooked up so this is the canon eight white widow right here delta eight and if y'all guys could see i just preheated a little bit before i take a pull that's just the way i do it [Music] now this tastes great this really does and it's also a little stronger so gotta be careful gotta be careful [Music] but i tell you guys i've been loving it and a lot of other people they hit me up they're also loving the delta eight so we haven't tried it yet the prices are good here on dr ganja's website so y'all guys go ahead check them out for real not only that they got flour they have accessories they have you name it they got it basically all right apparel so whatever you guys need you probably will be able to get from this so this is another superstore smoke dr shops at guys this candy it's delicious [Music] man this thing is great i love this one this one i like effect wise but i'm just not big on flavor so anybody that loves flavoring and you know that's definitely the way to go this mango kush has a ton of flavor in it guys all right so it says um i already told you guys this is a full grain directions for use hit vape cartridge until desired results are achieved and that's where we are now guys so i think we're going to wrap this one up for now but let me tell you i'm going to continue my quest to find the best d8 out their canon eight is good i really really like that one and i also like this one but not as much as the canon eight all right that's just my preference y'all guys go try them out for y'all so i will put a link below the video there is a small discount if you use my link so there you go guys all right so smoke doctor is signing out for now and i'll be back with another review soon guys all right peace [Music]", "pkBfxSyeLmk": "good morning everyone it is a beautiful Wednesday morning and I just got back from the dispensary yes yes I did yes I did yes I did and Oh zero people are watching I didn't I know that anyways what up guys I just got back from the dispensary on Hayes dispensary it's um San Jose it's pretty good [ __ ] pretty good [ __ ] um they got I normally go to Garden of Eden and Hayward California but since I relocated to the South Bay I found a new place called Hayes and I'm paying $10 more for the product I want but I'm getting a full gram more of it so that's what's up I getting ripped off as much anymore so yeah Wednesday's Wednesday's antebellum Sundays at Hayes you get it that's a cool you get 25% off oil evade oil pens cartridges whatnot so uh it's a pretty cool bag they gave me this is sublime true flavor all that [ __ ] on the lysis sublime anyways so we're gonna open it tamper resistant this little sticker is gonna keep me from tampering or anybody for that okay maybe it will [ __ ] it L embarrassing alright so taking off this sticker you know the warning sticker and I got a zipper looking zipper on this [ __ ] why hey I need a new streaming the button okay here we go mango push I know push oh [ __ ] that's right there mango crush indica v2 I've tried this once it's hella good and also a good strain is Northern Lights you know like my record label or than my tracks they're both one of my favorite sentence club are the only two I've tried but uh this one tastes so much better than mango flavor hmm I need to go to relax get you high okay so yeah that's enough this box usually truth now the mouthpiece is plastic and it's all good I mean the ones I used to get were glad her you know glass and metal look really nice called diamond line cartridges yeah maybe that's why I had to pay so much for only a half grand anyway so Oh smells so good it's ridiculous like only thing about this [ __ ] I love marijuana flower you know I love the actual flower of marijuana but so every time I smoke the blood or something I love it but it's just not like this and my house go stink no more anyways I'm probably gonna take a hit of this and I'm gonna be cuffing so much probably maybe I won't but yeah so let's take a rip can't even see the smoke I have a technique where I'm holding it in still but I'm really breathing at the same time is sleek weird because you know how they say holding it is doesn't who doesn't make much difference maybe you're right maybe you're not so yeah yeah you know how to get more like but I'm all covering myself like there's people around yeah I was good didn't [ __ ] my throat like it normally does so that's good now when it [ __ ] with your throat like you're about to cough but you're not necessarily unless you wanna cop is that what they call sloshing in lungs cuz it lightweight is uncomfortable I like it but it's like oh no unless I'm mistaken on what you are talking about when it says massaging your lungs but you notice we're gonna take another rib and that's what happens when you just blow it out right away I don't know something about blowing it out right away right right after you did it I know you're not wasting it but I just I get this feeling of waste I'm saying beast anyways I want to marijuana products are legal now and Kelly so for all my family members who were born in the fifties they don't approve of my videos reviewing marriage you wanna I mean you guys got to get over it I mean I don't not drugs okay I mean if this is a drug so without the Paul so whatever so guys that was my review if you're in San Jose I highly recommend well I reckon yeah I recommend this place is great the people that work there a cool and I mean personally for me if you like bait cartridges I mean they have deals all the time but Wednesdays and Sundays go there for 25% off your cartridges him or other baked products for that matter anyways I appreciate y'all watching if anyone watched or whoever watches in the future I love you guys and I'm yeah man see you guys soon", "4FcDrBMv3hY": "hey what up with everybody hope you're doing great welcome back to another stoney review today i got a real special review for you guys the homies over at math labs hit me up they're like yo stoney you can't be smoking those fake carts anymore man we got you so they went and sent me a stoney care package a couple different strains let me get a pound of your swedish chibok damn something told me to bring a lot of weed man today we got this one it's nice knowing that there's people and companies out there that actually care about other people and don't want to see them smoking on no hot dog water so without further ado let's get this going and get this package open for the package feels nice and sturdy it's got a cool logo right here that's where i want to be to the moon hopefully i'm hanging out with this guy by the end of this review got the math labs up top a little design there on the bottom you got the strain name skittles indica got the sticker right there sealing it shut on the side you got a qr code so we'll scan that in a minute and then on this side we got the thc and the cbd so for the thc we got 89 for the cbd we got two percent and then the back it's pretty cool got the window right there so you can see the car so far the oil looks pretty good blasting off to the moon so this is where you start that's where you end up let's uh scan this qr code see what comes up so after you scan it it gives you the lab results and i mean the full lab result four pages now it tells you everything that it passed tells you the percentages and it tells you all the canopy nodes that are inside of it on the next page and um it also tests for pesticides as well as heavy metals wow that's awesome so that's good news the qr code works let's get this opened up just take that sticker off wow this box is really nice whoever uh created these boxes and made this design did a really good job want to smoke so the part looks nice too it looks nice and sturdy let's take it out and see what it's about i really like how there's a qr code on the inside too it's legit as you can see the cart is completely full not even a bubble inside of it so we'll do the bubble test once we put a dent in it it's looking good it's got this nice cap at the bottom in case you want to store it so for the package i really like this parts nice and sturdy package is sturdy got the window unless you got the rocket to blast off i'm gonna have to give this one a 420 out of 420 even though there's no stickers on the inside not a mercy they still got the qr code and it gives you a lot of information in there so that's dope right there definitely a 420 out of 420 for the package now let's see what this uh flavor is all about the battery i'm using today is the th 710 box mod and it's a really good battery if you're looking for a new one i'd suggest getting this it lasts for days anyways let's get right into this flavor test [Music] [Music] these taste really really good definitely you could taste skittles definitely could taste weak like this tastes like some straight cali oil that's where this company is from mad labs i just took a couple blinkers and a couple of small hits on the lowest temp and i'm already feeling them so i can tell you right now this is some legit oil this is good stuff right here let's do one more blinker and then we're going to rate the flavor and we'll increase the temperature and rate the high here we go cheers [Music] so for the flavor i'm gonna have to give this one a 400 out of 420 because it tastes bomb definitely tastes like skittles and it definitely has a good wheat taste to it like some cali oil for sure let's take a couple hits and rate the high so now we're gonna turn the temperature up there we go off the blue [Music] definitely uh taste the weed a lot more with that it's temperature nice smooth bit [Music] it's good in the chest i would definitely say i'm pretty stoned i felt a nice head change off [Music] that last hit was so good i started to cry thank you matlab [Music] for the high i'm gonna have to give this one a 420 out of 420 damn just killing it all across the board today because i am faded right now i don't know if i'm to be doing any more blinkers maybe let's increase the temperature so we can give this a total score here we go so before we get into the last test see how much of a dent we've put in it now let's see if do this for about 30 seconds that oil looks really good though whoa okay people are watching oil looks nice and thick i don't really see it moving that's good so it's a little bit over 30 seconds still exactly where it was at so that's a good sign hell yeah [Music]

temperature so here we go one more temperature up white let's go to the moon still checking this no", "wbOQWlPIE6I": "faison's Kurtzman tells me local dispensaries know how to make vape products safely but he says it can be hard to tell the difference between the real thing and a dangerous knockoff this impacts the cannabis industry it results in less vape sales a new warning from the Nevada vaping Association is raising concerns in the pot business so the Nevada vape Association blamed cannabis products however they're finding this happening not just in cannabis products but they're finding this in nicotine products as well the problem illegal vape sellers are mixing cannabis with harmful oils like vitamin E mineral oil they're also finding coconut oil too as well and this is a result in a condition such as it's called popcorn lung or oil lung cannabis consultant Jason Kurtzman says pot isn't the problem and vape products from dispensaries are safe the entire cannabis industry does not have any type of coconut oil as an additive a lot of cannabis products and when you notice when you walk into a dispensary will say pure cannabis oil meaning that it is entirely cannabis in that vape pen instead he says it's bad players on the black-market who are ruining it for everyone it is extremely popular product in dispensaries especially here in Las Vegas where discrete consumption is the name of the game spotting the fakes can be hard when I have seen them in the past they tend to be a little bit darker so it appears thicker and it appears more higher-quality because it's an illegal product they want it to appear to look like a dispensaries product so Stewart's Minh says vaping is just another part of the growing cannabis industry that needs to be better regulated when you're buying anything illegally whether it's somebody's made a nicotine pen or whether someone who's made a cannabis pen you have no idea what they've added to this product they don't care about you they don't care about your family and the National cannabis Industry Association put out a call to Congress asking lawmakers to deal with the vaping related illnesses legalize and regulate weed vaping accounts for a quarter that's 25% of cannabis sales here in Nevada Siana Bonner Fox 5 News a local Las Vegas", "al6-nQkbQXk": "it may be the color of honey but the high you'll get from this cannabis concentrate will be anything but sweet if you over consume shatter can contain 80 to 90% THC but what is it and how is it made find out on this episode of Wheaties II by the growth up you might have heard of shatter a potent cannabis concentrate made from butane hash oil it's one of the many forms of butane hash oil or BHO in league with wax and cannabis oil used in vapes shatter is the solidified hardest form of BHO earning its nickname because it's transparent and can shatter like glass it's highly potent containing 80 to 90 percent THC according to Health Canada and its effects come on quickly and can last for several hours for that reason it takes far less shatter to get you high when compared to cannabis flour which generally contains up to 30% THC but how is shatter made and how do you consume it firstly shadow is made from the trichomes of the cannabis flower click the letter i' in the top right corner of your screen to watch our video on trichomes and learn just how critical they are to your high to make shatter the trichomes of cannabis buds are separated from the flower using butane and extremely flammable and dangerous gas once separated the trichomes are collected and heated to remove the butane the new substance is mixed to a creamier texture and then solidifies into shatter making shatter is very dangerous and it's not recommended to do it at home people have died or been seriously injured trying to create shatter and this is definitely not something you should do I this is because making shatter or any other BHO involves using butane gas in the process in the extraction process butane gas becomes a liquid and then evaporates when heat is used to remove it from the concentrate since butane is heavier than oxygen after it evaporates it can fall to the floor creating a very hazardous situation especially over a hot stove top this is not the only risk when it comes to BHO though any form of BHO weather shatter or otherwise is highly dangerous to consume orally there's the real risk of poisoning here so shatter and other be a chose shouldn't made into edibles that's because there's a possibility that not all the butane was removed when creating the BHO with all that said shatter can be a pleasantly potent concentrate if used correctly and with care shadow is consumed by heating it and then inhaling the smoke you can consume the shatter by adding a small piece of it to a pipe bomb hash pipe vaporizer or dabbing rig be cautious with dabbing rigs however because they can reach temperatures as high as 400 degrees Celsius and should be handled with care and keep in mind that while shatter can be baked it might be trickier to do so and you might prefer vaping another type of BHO very potent and not for the faint of heart shatter is one of many concentrates available from the cannabis plant and likely better suited to more experienced users thanks for watching we DZ by the growth

about probably two weeks a little bit over two weeks maybe that was the last time I have smoked weed I haven't touched a blood of join edible a cart anything since that video so this is gonna be a fun one this is gonna be a great one um the reason I was gone is I had a lot of school I had to do some I was working I'm still working now but I was I was getting a lot of support on the last videos I didn't think I was planning on smoking anymore or doing any more videos but like I said there was a ton of support I'm at like 47 subscribers you guys are killing it getting a lot of feedback on some of the videos sounds like I can't just end it there I gotta keep going so yeah we're back with another cart today's car it's gonna be an indica that's gonna be God's God's gift so if you guys are excited let me know in the comments drop a like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] these channels 4:18 over 18 plus 18 whatever however you want to say 18 plus if you're under 18 well [ __ ] you can't be here but you know how am I supposed to know you probably chillin right now you little minors um anyway so right here is like I said it's an indica select elite so y'all know it's gonna be fire already and since I haven't smoked in two weeks I'm about to get dumb blasted so I'm pretty excited uh the THC is running in at ninety point four five percent here which is pretty dang insane right there lets you look at the blocks for a second and I won't focus so you can't read it but there you go it says here it's supposed to tape tastes like grape sweet and earthy so that's cool and it's supposed to give you a relaxed happy euphoric feeling so that's cool they say it right there on the box I don't have planned videos for the next few we got two of them right here if you know their colors you know whether they're in because the TVs are hybrids its blah blah blah those will be coming here pretty soon um yeah so like I said it's been a minute so might seem like a little weird of a review I'm kind of trying to get back into it trying to think of how how I did it so let's just uh let's go ahead and pop this bad boy open here ah [ __ ] so actually let me tell you because I always see hey seam reviews on whatever it is and not knowing the price so the dispensary I went to was Metro meds I here in Phoenix Arizona let's see this select God gift cart right here I paid $80 for this but it was a buy one get one basically so to 480 it wasn't a biome but they always do two for 80 deals so yeah so I got this and then I got another full gram for 80 bucks so 40 bucks each basically and then I got a eighty sativa yeah well I'll tell you guys now I got a higher no that's anyway I got a hybrid half gram here which I don't think I I might have reviewed a hybrid I don't quite remember I'll have to go back and look at those um I just was charging this pen a little bit it wasn't getting full charge and I charged it for like 10 20 minutes so I don't know that's alright though uh well let's go ahead and pop this bad boy open oh no I remember you guys you kind of got to open it from the bottom these parts because if there's some long ass fingers to get to the top for some reason and poke it out stupid ass blocks and [ __ ] blah blah yeah maybe not you know this box isn't even childproof and I can't even get through it Jesus okay there we go there we go wow it's been a minute since I have touched a cart let alone a full gram cart that is one big [ __ ] that's good okay just real quick I wanted to say this cuz I was thinking about it if I don't have a video in the next few days it's because it's gonna be hard for me to it's gonna take a minute for me to get adjusted and smoke a full gram pretty fast so I'm not gonna quit again it's just gonna take a minute for me to get this done and then put out a new one so [ __ ] I'm very excited because I mean I know it's have to give me like the craziest high in the world but hopefully it should smack me pretty goddamn well um let's go ahead and screw it on the dr. zodiacs chew Moonrock clear battery there hi you already know I like that little fine point tip better than those round ones because they get less dirty well I told you guys the type of car brand price dispensary I don't think I told you guys about everything let's uh oh except for the liquids you already know peace tea still haven't sponsored me that's okay they're gonna one day don't worry pop that open go ahead take a sip hydration break yep hell yeah man hell yeah all right if you guys are smoking on anything in the what what I guess you guys are smoking on anything let me know down in the comments I'm always excited to know what y'all smoking oh by the way if you hear any random noises like squeaky toys I brought a foster dog home

snack you're right on the first like inhale God dang that is hole [ __ ] I definitely get that earthy feel for your version dammit dammit weird though I'm definitely feeling it already like I just thought that's weird that's weird how it hits god damn well I already like it says it's supposed to taste sweet / creepy and earthy the only thing I'm really getting out of it is is that earthy taste not getting really anything sweet there maybe I'm you know like that much sweetness that's about it so yeah you know that's alright that's alright you're not usually in the cards for for taste that's for those nicotine vapor guys sucks to beat them and they're getting [ __ ] end of the stick people are dying from these poisonings and these black-market cards and these guys are taking this the beating for it because people think it's believing that's pretty rough I kinda want to make a video on unlike the fake cards I might buy I know a few people I sell some TKO some banks and all that [ __ ] I might buy one of those in compare them I really want to do that I think I've said it multiple times in some videos but I really really do want to do that cuz it's pretty bad out there man y'all like some smoke and some boof and I mean I've done it before you know it happens you gotta do it sometimes but if I knew what was seen him down what was happening to the kids that are doing it now I

subscribe do all that [ __ ] deuces", "TMteMpw4YCY": "what's good YouTube today guys 1-1 like alright before I get into this video I just want to say I drove literally over like I think close to an hour to go to verified spot where I could get this and I'm gonna go ahead and put that spot right here so you guys can to see like that it's legit so as you guys know heavy hitters right here it has a reputation it's been getting a really bad reputation because there's been a lot of counterfeits a lot of fakes and then you know a lot of bunk [ __ ] going around was like these these things have been sold on eBay the cartridges in the packaging for like five cents and you know people have been filling them with hot dog water man and then they used to be one of my favorite cartridges so you guys go back in my reviews I used to reviewed like five different ones of these and they were so amazing I remember everything all the time smoking them I'm just like do this this is the most enjoyable moment of my day you know so mmm let's get let's get straight into this man heavy hitters purple punch I'm sure you guys a close up I haven't opened it this is a brand new brand new packaging this is my first time getting a heavy hitters in over a year at least a real one so let's go get into here you see the heavy hitters purple punch alright let's go ahead and look at that oil man app that bubbles not gonna move that's huh that's one way that you know you'd see nope it's not moving Bo and this is the new packaging has the heavy hitters down there push to release purple punch it has the THC percentage cannabinoids all that good stuff and then so it says push to release and then I'm guessing you just pull okay no apparently not let's see push to release how hard do you have to push man I'm literally better break it doesn't want to come out it's probably cause of this sticker though let me give me one second guys so push to release right here and then boom you get out the packaging heavy-hitters is very very nice holographic super clean man get out of the packaging boom look at that beautiful oil dude wow this is what a real heavy hitters is supposed to look like none of that bunk ass [ __ ] moving as soon as you flip it upside down so get rid of that I'm not sure if a sticker supposed to come in here or not but I'm guessing not so get rid of that here's a packaging and then like that still hasn't moved still hasn't moved look at that amazing boy so back to the video main when you go ahead and drink some water shout out to hydro class keeping my water cold at all times you gotta stay hydrated it doesn't matter what what time of the day it is doesn't matter what are you smoking up you gotta stay high you're so heavy hitters I'm excited man whoa alright so I missed these tip I honestly like the tips these cartridges have to be one of my favorite ones they just look so clean man whoo I mean I don't even yeah I'm like a purple like a great kind of so first we're tried on the ooze battery man hopefully this thing works last time I tried trying on the Gras garden didn't work so sitting nice and flush these cartridges always stay nice and flush tell your truth that's why they have on the poems problems because some of the batteries they don't have these little openings right here to let the air go through so you have to keep it kind of loose but with this one it does have the hole so you don't have to worry about that so 3.3 volts and then let's see man let's see your cheers boy so you guys are 18 and over 21 and over y'all know the deal man Mich you guys are smoking along with me y'all all that good stuff let me know what you guys are smoking on if you guys ever tried a real heavy hitters let me know what your experiences it was with like what flavor did you like what flavor didn't you like and et Cie so yeah choose guys yeah right off the bat it has that og heavy hitters taste dude has that taste that like it tastes like piney and that's the signature of the heavy hitters in my opinion you know that little piney tastes like it tastes so nice and so like earthy and that's what I like tasting about this like the one other strain I think it's at the Northern Lights oh my gosh amazing dude this purple punch though so far I'm getting a very very hint of the purple punch like if he has ever smoked purple punch who whether it be from my the purple punches that I have some up from his jungle boys loud pack and bear farms so all dude purple punch is just like one of those flavors that's going around in a super popular but not a lot of people can perfect it you know they put fillings in it like when making consec concentrates especially they put feelings that make it taste like like you know like kool-aid stuff like that for example astiz II I'm not bashing on Suzi there are purple punch is amazing but it tastes too much like candy doesn't taste like you know wheat it doesn't taste like that good good man this punch this tastes exactly like they got a purple punch flower you know just squished it put some mother did their disel it and then mix it in with the distillate and then boom in a cartridge that's it it's very nice the cold filtered just I love the cold filtered on these man so like I said like I took two three hits and the oil still not moving there's still no oil no bubbles going up man this is definitely I'm happy I caught this man I'm happy like I went drove an hour away to get this man so off with the ooze battery we're gonna try it on the bat mod the one you don't really these are just pull and then screw it on slap it on there it looks pretty nice I just don't like that these are like super wobbly so yeah cheers guys so not too much power you get you get a lot of flavor not too much clouds I'm still don't I still don't get a hype and this is this is tested at 90 percent total cannabinoids so I mean I don't know though we we have to check that the website I might have to check at the website out after the video until you as if it's legit or not you know cuz heavy hitters lot also they had I think they had pesticide fails I'm not too sure about that I mean I was gonna use the bat mock but to heat up the oil but it looks like the oil is doing pretty good still no air bubbles so don't need it you guys didn't know this is the one that you put the little tubing around and it moves the wax on top so yeah put this back on the O's and then we're gonna take some hits off of 3.5 setting and then see what those are 3.6 get some heavy hitters in there alright so cheers guys I'm gonna do five to seven second pulls on this you would just just get try to get nice and baked so yeah it's pretty good for the most part I'm getting like some pretty decent hits off of this and the oil still you know just chilling dude still hasn't moved that's what I like to see it is moving a little slightly ever so slightly though and that's what you want out of a cartridge man I'm getting the the mellowness I'm getting everything it's a very very mellow it's not very too like strong in your face and that's kind of one thing that I've noticed about purple punches like when people make the Pens like I've never had a purple punch that hits me in my face you know it's always channel like subtle very mellow and this is it you know heavy hitters brings you just that but I feel like they for sure have I don't know I don't know if I can say they have the best purple punch but it is definitely talked to I would have to go back and see what concentrated cards have the purple punch like for example raw garden is killing it if you guys haven't seen my last video go check that out this one right here is the berry punch and it's amazing dude I got this one the raw garden so amazing this these guys perfect every single cartridge ever like their their cartridge like I mean I know I don't want to bring it in while I'm reviewing it disel it this is a refined light resident but you know the purple punch on these are amazing so get back to the review man we're gonna take one last rip and finish it out for you guys and then this is going up on Monday by the way so I hope you guys have an amazing week you know go follow me on instagram at back without if you guys enjoy the video so far if you guys are new here go ahead and hit that like comment and subscribe button so cheers guys yeah whoo it's a bit it's very very smooth dude that's one thing that I can say about it very smooth if he like I could probably take like 20 hits of this no problem it doesn't really have me coughing that much as like the raw garden usually does the raw garden has me freaking dying after I hold in for two seconds and but yeah it's a very nice I'm getting the very eyes are going down my head is probably starting it's starting to think freely and I'm just chilling you know that's kind of what you want out of a pen I already see I had to take a lot of hits to get there I mean I see they lower air bubble on top just kind of um opening up a lot more and that's probably just because the wick is getting waked up and but yeah man it's not bad it's definitely a comfort of the price that I got it for it's nice like I said I'm gonna put the dispensary right here and on the in the description below if you guys ever in the area and want to go check them out they have two amazing prices so yeah one last hit for you guys are for the boys for the boys and hold it how very very smooth like I said yes so overall heavy hitters um what I buy it again probably not and the only reason why I wouldn't buy it again is because heavy hitters were back in the time you know they were great they had their they had the competition on lockdown they had they were beating everybody that's just because there were so many people doing this you know doing this game and then now that there are so many other people's like you know like these raw guard and I'm I know I talk about them so much but they're just a perfect example because they bring for the perfect price in the perfect product into the table and then you know like heavy hitters you can either get it at a very low price like I did or get it at a very high price and that's kind of what a lot of people are doing right now because they're sort of scarce like around there is and it just sucks but yeah I definitely wouldn't cop this again you can easily get something better for equal price and yeah but unless you want to try something original something that's been around for some time you know you know like if you're new to the to the scene and you want to try something that's been around for a while I recommend definitely recommend going for these you know to get a get a taste of what people in five years ago we're tasting the four years ago or tasting you know and yeah it's pretty it's good it's a good smoke overall though I'm not gonna lie just my tolerance I'd I wouldn't want to buy it in so yeah heavy hitters eight out of ten I would say you know the high is a good 7.5 the taste is amazing I would eight point five and then you know the Terps they were there they were there there but like I said heavy hitters isn't very chirpy chirp central but yeah overall that's a good quality project I would buy it I wouldn't buy it again though you know we're just rambling at this point so I'm gonna go ahead and end the video here if you guys enjoyed the video like I said they would like comment and subscribe button we'll catch you guys later", "dMgb3UnMx5I": "yo so this is Chris with G farmer TV and today I'm going to go ahead and break down different uses on liquid gold seal to syringes so the first you want to go ahead and do is take off your actual seal on the syringe remove that and I wouldn't want to go ahead and use this right away until I have my plastic needle point only because it actually helps manage the portion of your dab actually helps manage the portion of whatever cartridge you're actually using to refill and it helps you from preventing them making a mess because the last thing you want to do is spill your liquid gold all over the floor or all over your hand one messy situation so not only can you refill just the liquid gold cartridges just by putting the plastic insert along the sides I want to go ahead and recommend to let the wick soak I mean that's pretty much the component that actually keeps igniting so the more drenched your wicks are better taste you will actually consistently have on every plus that tends to be the number one part that drives up I didn't use my whole half randomized liquid ghost range so what I would do is pull back we tracked my oil back into the syringe take off my plastic needle point and put back my actual seal this is the number one part you do not want to throw this away you plan to reseal your liquid goats are in good to go how could you tell if you have a good quality co2 syringe well the lighter and the thicker the better more water down your oil is the more there is a possible chance that it's cut with poly glycol any vegetable glycerin and the artificial terpene that are turns your oil from quality to quantity now when it comes to strain-specific syringes or strain-specific concentrates it's kind of tricky to go ahead and commercialize those actual strains because you do need a lot of plant material to actually run on a consistent basis so if you have a major farm with that one string to go ahead and commercialize our power to you until then I'm yet to see that let me just go ahead and show you that not only can you refill most co2 510 cartridges with liquid gold vapor oil but you could definitely go ahead and use it on different things such as put it on your flower taking a dive out of it different alternatives that you actually medicate with and you just want to go ahead and intensify or increase the actual THC no matter what way helps you out to go ahead and medicate with liquid gold vape boy there's different alternatives I like to go ahead and choose a safe discreet way when I'm on the go so I keep my pen in handy go ahead and get liquid gold go to gene farmer labs calm and don't forget

cartridges brass knuckle cartridges this one's a girl ugly number 4 this one is Sour Diesel this one oh [ __ ] I can't remember what it was it was something else originally smoked at all pop the cap off refilled it with a blueberry old gene from - bacon so the last thing in here was blueberry OG and all I did was I went to a shop in California oh my god this thing is by THC clear this one is a Private Reserve so it's 30 dollars a gram to distillate this is true OG I got a couple other ones and all I do is pop this thing off is unscrewed and then all you do is pop this thing off without squirting it all over the place all right hopefully doesn't look down on me so all I do from here is I slowly squirt this [ __ ] in and you don't really know how hard it is to do until you film and try and do it but hopefully fill in the camera you just got a drip this [ __ ] slow in here not down this tube but down the side of it up the tube is where your vapor goes on these brass knuckles so you don't want to fill that thing up with oil because then you'll just suck a whole bunch over the lots on V plural that is alright so syringe empty true OG and then now I got a field brass knuckle and just stick this thing right back on [Music] you just got to make sure that when you're twisting it that it's everything's flushed sometimes you'll get it fresh out of the container and it's not really flush and some of the liquid will act not like it some of your you know your concentrate will leak out I've gotten a couple with this [ __ ] not really centered and some liquid has escaped not a whole bunch to [ __ ] about but enough to get the concerned about alright so I just filled this bastard up now let's see if she works I mean I know sure were three point seven two point seven max

Kush and Sour Diesel on the smell from in the bag your reeks of berries and that Sour Diesel smell is very prevalent in there just from the bag when you draw taupe if it's um it tastes like it's very strong very tasty now like a tart berry type dry token everybody and engulf your palate on your mouth and then once you fire it up it um it has that same berry taste but it's like a cranberry a very tart cranberry sight taste to me it's very sweet it's very clean burning like you know I mean it's not like is its strong but it's not going to have your coffin and all that kind of stuff but it's very strong cuz I got a lot of pretty colors in it blueberry is very prevalent in the the appearance of it you know what I do the purple hairs and every leaves and everything that's in the butt and it's a very good strand I would recommend it to anybody if you ever see it as an indica dominant strand the blueberries been living more dominant enough from the research that I've seen over the arm the Sour Diesel but it's good for pain anxiety sleep appetite migraines any type of situations like though this would be good for I hope you enjoyed this until next time peace", "F438gDUlCWU": "[Music] while dabbing cannabis concentrates does certainly give you the biggest bang for your buck accurately judging how large of a dollop you should dab or how much chatter you should share off remains an ongoing issue and will be the stoner whose jar of bubble hash opens in their bag or whose vape oil canister breaks in their pocket luckily Portland's Iowa vapor has devised a really clever solution NAB taps each of these little ceramic pellets is infused with 50 milligrams of cannabis concentrate they won't break leak sweat or spill their THC rich contents and they're extremely easy to use simply drop a tab onto your dab Briggs nail or set it in the heating crucible of your preferred vaporizer and heat it up as until it warms the concentrate trapped inside will slowly boil off for you to inhale and since each tab contains five standard doses you'll have enough for a full session in each if not just add another tab plus while the pellets released their THC cargo they visibly char and pit making it easy to judge how many draws you have left before they're fully spent the real genius of DAB cabs is their portability and versatility they're functionally inert until you heat them up so there is effectively zero risk of them spilling or leaking what's more they can be used in any vaporizer that accepts loose-leaf or wax based concentrates during my testing the tabs work smoothly with the puff coke peak the Storz and Bickel mighty the PAX 3 and the vape exhale cloud Evo heck you can even put it in your pipe and smoke it if you're off in mind I especially appreciated that I could start and stop sessions at will without repercussion with conventional rigs if you inadvertently use more oil than you meant to or have a bigger hunk of hash than you can handle your stock muscling through the bowl until it's either cashed or you're left to stone a useless heap on the couch both dab tabs which can be subjected to repeated heating and cooling cycles without any noticeable change of taste in the vapor you can set the pipe down and back up off it at your convenience this combined with the tabs set 50-milligram can ability all contents makes monitoring and managing your dosage a far more simple affair than with existing concentrates the rule of what you scrape is what you vape thankfully no longer apply though they're quite handy dab tabs are not perfect for one you're gonna have a heck of a time trying to find them before next February ILO is partnering with local concentrate suppliers and it's soft launched at select dispensaries throughout Oregon they hope to expand distribution to California Nevada and Maryland early next year what's more since the infusion process requires extra labor and materials expect to pay a premium on top of what you normally would for that gram of hash still you can't put a price on convenience and boy are these ever convenient [Music]", "YSjmQy42BWk": "[Music] what's up youtube this is shabazz and i'm back with another cbd hemp flower review what's up tomorrow can of sewers welcome back to another shabazz short today i'm reviewing something that i know a lot of y'all are going to be excited about it's another delta 8 product and specifically delta 8 vape cartridges by effects delta 8. now effects offers granddaddy perp strawberry cough and cali orange kush or calio they have one gram cartridges and guess what i have one of each cartridge so i'm gonna try each one let you know the flavor profile and by the end of taste testing all of them the effects should be kicking right in i do have a couple concerns right off the bat in the package i didn't get any paper test results and most importantly i didn't get a notice to law enforcement now when you're dealing with cannabis product and even especially with delta eight products because there's such a thin line between legality with delta eight there's such a thin line of legality with delta eight i feel like anything like this needs to have a letter to law enforcement what i did get in the package though is this absolutely massive effects sticker so here is the cartridges themselves one gram each says effects delta eight savage brand you got the granddaddy perp the cali oh and the strawberry cough they do have percentages on them so granddaddy perp has 82 percent d8 the cali o has 48 and the strawberry cough has 65.5 percent so let's start with uh the lightest and going up to the heaviest which works out for me too because of those terpenes so here goes the cali orange really nice packaging by the way i really like the packaging this packaging it's you know this is premium looking packaging it looks professional here we go pull the cartridge out the rubber caps on each no branding on this cartridge i don't know what brand it is i don't know where it comes from there has been a big issue in cannabis community lately with people using off-brand cheap carts that have lead and other things in them i don't know about this but it's always a plus when you're using good trusted name brand cartridges like c cell anyways so this is the calio i'm gonna get the screw right on here remember these carts fit on any 510 battery so any little battery like this if you're a stoner if you're in the cannabis life i'm sure you have a couple of these laying around [Music] i really like the terpenes on that really has that citrusy orange wow this is really citrusy and really orangey yeah 48 percent we'll take a couple hits of each one really smooth i mean it's a vapor it's it's it's it's a smooth i mean it's the smoothest vapor gas [Music] cali oh all right i like that one that was really cool and right here on the top i didn't even notice it says hybrid so this is going to be your hybrid smoke and i guess the hybrid terpene i probably should have started off with the sativa which i think is going to be the strawberry cough but that was cool now here goes the strawberry cough sativa terpene profile 65 d8 same packaging once again no really nice premium packaging okay now this one is a different cartridges this is one of the clear top cartridges i've had these before from a different vendor all right got that strawberry cough on there it tastes like strawberries [Music] very smooth the great thing about things they are super convenient they leave no smell you don't have to burn anything smoke anything pack anything clear anything out carry around a lighter go somewhere because the smell no vaporizers you could literally if you're at work you can literally go in the bathroom hit your vaporizer and walk back out no lingering smell nothing nobody will ever know so if you enjoy cannabis whether that be hemp or high thc flour and you are in the interest of being discreet definitely check out vape carts i think this is a good time to to warn everybody about delta eight delta h is very potent generally it doesn't come with the anxiety and the rush and the racy heartbeat and everything that delta nine thc does but that is only if you use it within reason do not overindulge on delta a because delta 8 is still thc and it will mess you up if you are thc sensitive and you cannot handle a thc high don't go crazy on the delta a it is far better than delta 9 far less anxiety but still it can get you there i got overzealous one day i was doing tiny little droplets of delta 8 distillate you know every 30 40 minutes and i was like uh you know this is nothing so i took a bowl of hemp flour squeezed a big old glob of d8 on there smoked the whole thing 10 minutes later i felt like i was dying if you've ever had cannabis induced panic attack you know what that feeling is you feel like you're gonna have a heart attack you can't stop breathing fast because if you breathe normal you just feel like you're not breathing enough racy thoughts you're worried you're paranoid that whole terrible thing that happened to me granted i did take a huge amount a very potent delta ate this to it but still don't go crazy with the delta eight take baby steps and just be cautious with it delta eight can be a very great time but if you overdo it it can also be a bad time all right let's move on over to the grand daddy perp which is the indica coming at 82 i'm gonna take a little bit more light on this one because i definitely feel the effects coming out from the other two same packaging this cart is actually branded so interestingly each cart for each different flavor is slightly different i actually like that because it's easy to tell them apart all right here goes the granddaddy perp and i'm gonna go easy on this because i'm already feeling crazy oh that's extremely creepy i think they might have overdid it with the terpenes on the granddaddy purp that tastes like purple kool-aid straight up it's good it's smooth but i'm gonna have to end that there all right vape cartridges d8 it's convenient no smell no odor no smoke i mean with this product i'm gonna definitely give it the shabazzle of approval good vape good terpenes my only concerns is no letter to law enforcement and they didn't appear to be name brand cartridges so i noticed while editing this video i got so faded i didn't even talk about the effects i don't know if you could notice if you go back and rewind my eyes got super duper red this is what i mean delta 8 is super strong a tiny bit goes a long way and it is extremely easy to overdo it needless to say the effects on these cartridges are very good they're very potent they're so good that i think i need to warn everybody that just because it's delta eight if you are prone to paranoia or anxiety intrusive thoughts you've got to take it easy but yes effects are very strong the terpenes definitely do make a difference whether it's a sativa hybrid or indica feeling afterwards a couple puffs go a long way so don't overdo it but within reason with the delta eight yeah i actually really like that that's a much more convenient way of getting the delta eight rather than smoking or dabbing distillate anyway so y'all that's the review make sure you go down in the description check out the merch hit me up on ig here here i appreciate everybody watching my videos if you liked the video hit like hit me up down in the comments subscribe to the channel and turn on post notifications so you can see when i upload new content

another church cart so church cannabis company super premium cannabis distill it adjustable airflow cartridge advanced ceramic coil 510 thread eight watts max ultimate damping experience this one is melon aid it's a sativa has seventy one point four THC and their stickers are so like blurry sorry for the steering wheel part here I didn't realize it was in the video but as I said before these don't fit on my palm battery on my claw or anything like that so I've got a normal stick battery that uses iPhone and Cecil iPhone C cell and Android I believe so church cart melon aid I'm just going to get right into this hopefully everyone had a great Monday everyone enjoyed the day four before all the rain hit it's raining again now come on so slides got locking mechanisms on it but yeah we uh pretty much finished our work day before the rain kicked in so and then came home and hung out with my son and my girl for a little bit and now now we're gonna do review I know that doesn't really because I not have a white background um as I said before on the last one I did these carts seem pretty solid reusable the top looks like it just twists off the airflow piece as I said there's like three little dots inside but uh we're just gonna get right into it see what this one's about the other church is pretty good I I don't even remember the flavor of that one I haven't touched it since I did the review so it's just sitting in a box because I've always got my palm battery like even right now let me reach in my pocket I've got my Platinum vape galactic Jack on my palm battery so break out the stick battery so that I can use this because as I said it doesn't fit on the palm it's probably not going to fit on the curve pretty sure it's not going to fit some of the hives and the Hades battery that I had this one looks like it's got a scrape on it or it's cracked one of the two possibly a small little crack you probably can't see it because my phone's not gonna focus but it doesn't seem like any liquids leaking out doesn't seem like there's a lot of residue or anything on the side of the cart so definitely get the melon tastes kind of sweet say like uh almost like the watermelon hubba bubba kind of tastes like that I'm not getting a lemonade as much I don't know if this batteries dying no [ __ ] every time I breathe out my nose I sneeze from these things tasty I'm picking these off her I think 45 apiece I'm not exactly sure what they're being sold for it a lot of the other places the guys telling me 50 60 bucks I didn't do any research on it yet but I will but until I can you know make the drive down to it to a dispensary or one of my friends houses so that they can run for me pretty much I'm just at the mercy of you know the dude I go through but he's been getting pretty damn good [ __ ] so I can't really complain yeah pretty good pretty good pretty good very tasty this one's actually a pretty good taste probably got to charge the battery so I can get big big hits but yeah if any of you like Church comment below with what flavors that you want to see me try to review pretty much any of that stuff any other car brands like I still got to get my hands on the Select do a couple reviews on that I still want to try those Rove ones but I still think they're only out in California at the moment I'm not really gonna do any reviews on dang tapes right now just I've had three good and three bed so I'm 50/50 at the moment but you know the only thing I ever really hear about this company now is it there isn't really a company it's just people buying the [ __ ] online and making their own stuff and selling it whether that's true or not I don't know that's just [ __ ] I heard I haven't really heard anything bad about any of these church carts yet other than maybe price but as I said you're paying for this big monstrous cart like I mean it's rugged it's heavy compared to it's heavier than this whole entire battery this little thing is heavier than this these are this is a little bit heavier than just the car other than that the next one will be a review on another north extracts a guy told me about them you know basically told me to go check out some other stuff cleaner products all that kind of stuff so I appreciate his comment and I mentioned it in one of my last videos I don't know if I posted it yet but this one is uh max 69 one gram but I'll get into all of that in the actual video but as I said hopefully you guys all had a great day today at a fun relaxing weekend with family girlfriend whoever hopefully you smoked down on some good [ __ ] and just enjoying life pretty much seems all work no play these days you know I'm sure a lot of you can relate to that it seems I could just work in work to pay bills and you don't really get to go out and do much just on the money cuz bills just eat eat that [ __ ] especially if you got kids but uh yeah if you guys don't line smash that subscribe button hit the like button comment below if you've had these Church or any of you have tried this one let's talk about it if there's some other flavors in this specific brains you would like me to try I'm open to try pretty much any one of them but yeah I'm probably going to end up be selling these most likely to my brother nothing nothing against them I just I enjoy what I have so when I have a family member or a friend or someone said that they want some the ones that are just sitting in a box doing nothing are the ones I'm gonna sell it's not that this is a bad flavor it's not like the other one was a bad flavor I just overall prefer a lot of the newer plant invades some of the Midnight Express flavors but that's just personal opinion at the moment there's just so much out there to try for me to me you know just general statement the ones that I like at the moment but yeah I also really like flavor XO eventually I'm gonna get my hands on some more of those and review some of those for you guys especially since they got the new packaging the new flavors that kind of stuff but as I said you guys have a great night take it easy I appreciate you guys watching to all the new subscribers whether you're watching my weed videos or my my rap reactions or music reactions or not I just appreciate you all you know thank you very much for your time out of your busy days and anyone that's sobbing hey you're a big help it only takes one thing to do that whether you watch my videos or not subbing is good obviously I need the views and all that too but kind of start someone so appreciate you guys other than that you guys have a great day peace out", "FSI-zShYMk0": "hey guys Breanna here bringing you your first how-to video from a PC so we have had a lot of inquiries from you guys on how to initially set up your vape pen for the first time so today I'm gonna demonstrate that for you so when you get your delivery it'll come in a prescription bag that looks something like this and inside you should have a battery that'll come in a package like this and a cannabis cartridge of some sort which will be like this when you remove your battery from the packaging you will find two parts one will be this top part which is actually how you charge your battery and this bottom skinny part is going to be your actual vape battery so you'll go ahead and unscrew these two and your battery comes already with a fourth of charge so that way you can enjoy it immediately upon getting it at this point you should be ready to open up your cannabis cartridge and you will find it to look something like this every cannabis cartridge is going to have security coverings on it for safety reasons at this point you should have removed the safety covering on the bottom as well as your charger from the top and now we're ready to connect these you will just screw it in and you're probably curious how do you turn it on so there's this power button right here and it's important to remember that you will always click it five times when you want to turn it on or when you want to turn it off so 1 2 3 4 5 and when you see it light up like that you know you're ready to officially start vaping so you will put it up to your mouth and you will hold this button down wow you inhale and there you have it that's how you set up your vape pen for the first time so after you've been using your vape pen for a while you're gonna have to charge it and that's where this piece comes in handy you will go ahead and screw it in and then you can charge it by plugging it in to your average computer or into a cell phone block you might have lying around as always with any of your cannabis related questions it's as easy as a PC", "PrgHGZlI_4I": "what's up you guys shadows fear again with another episode of shadows we review today on the review we are gonna be doing a bait cartridge by La Push happens to be my favorite brand la cush this is the red box bait pan we're gonna unbox it right now we're gonna check it out and see how it does you have to you guys like it so let's start off unboxing you know everything but la Kirsch has got their six packaging now this particular one is weighing in pretty high so this one's weighing in total THD is seventy one point three five percent of total CBD six point six milligrams Delta 9 THC 713 milligrams wow this is so I mean if you're looking at the THC 71 point three five percent that's a lot you guys now keep in mind I don't usually like vape pens and here's why okay don't crucify me for this but if you are looking at your lung health and if you want to smoke ten blunts a day didn't matter tons of tar on my lungs ready later in life you know so now with the mate pens here's the problem when you're usually usually as a grower they used the leftover trim to make your the joints the house joints and all that stuff is all made by trim and trim is mainly leaves with a little bit of trichome on it and it's the though it's the booboo part of the but if you're a trimmer imagine this you have a big hole and there's leaf sticking off and you're trimming off all those leaves all that leaves and junk that's left on the bottom that's a lot of carcinogens and plant matter when you burn it that's what they're rolling into those house joints that's what they're running this oil through and now running oil through isn't that bad except for you get a lot of extra dirt and extra dust and all the extra stuff that is on top of the leaf matter because those leaves stick out and they catch all the stuff of fertilizers all that kind of stuff and then you trim them all off and you roll yourself a blood of that you rollin yourself above the booboo part of the bud you want to actually like if they offer you say if you buy anything you get it either a gram or you get a two pre-rolled joints always pick the gram you'll get way higher if you grind up those nugs that have never strike homes those mugs are full of the trichomes inside that have never been touched or broken and you break those up and you grind them up or whatever and then you roll it into it one joint that one joint will get you four times as high as those other two joints and the reason is is because the other two joints are made with trim and anybody who's grown wheat or work for something that's going to be beautiful you know that that is the junk of the bud that's the junk on so when they runt oil through that it picks up all the dust all the fertilizers all the boo-boos stuff everything along with the THC and it's running across would you rather have it take trichomes off of a little bit of like dirty plant or a whole like mile long worth of leaves to get that same amount of THC is basically what it breaks down to so you get this whole bag of trim which they're trying to like how can we make like money off of this trim we we have a whole bag of stuff that can get people high especially the new high but if you're a vet you want and you're paying for something good that's what called nug run when it's run through nuts nuts have been ground up they run through or to make a joint those are always more quality but how do you know if they're it's actually mud run or they're just putting it on there to sell their product so you don't really know but that's why if you ever get the option of it other oh you get a free gram or you get Prevost always take the ground always take the wheat because that we is the quality weed the other stuff those pre-rolls when they charge ten dollars for a pre-roll it just it hurts me because back in the day I have my dispensary we kind of started that but what I did with mine was with all the trim I also got the popcorn nuts because I always felt cheated if you give somebody in anything there's a whole bunch of popcorn I than I which isn't wrong but it doesn't fill the jar good and I felt like I was cheating people especially when you're charging a lot from a dispensary so I would grind all the popcorn mugs up in there so you actually got some nugs and then you know some of the trim but you got quality joints and it Fairfax if anybody went to my dispensary you remember I was the first one to do the pre-rolled joints first willing to do it in the cone joints in my little baggies I have pictures of it the first one to do it like 15 years ago so you know it's not it's just not a good deal to get those pre-rolls usually with the way they do it now they don't blend anything into it you can smell it right out of the jar when you open that's why companies like this flavor it and they want to charge $20 but they flavor the joint wrap and stuff because out of the joint out of the tube if you open it you smell it and it smells like hey that was all trim it's all trim it's a boo boo joint if you open it and it actually smells like good weed which I guarantee you never going to most of the time yeah it's been but most of them now the flavors they're rolling it in the key to try and get you to sell it trying to make it better but you know where that key came from the keep came from trim so look that's another thing we used to do is we we keep the trim when we're done but now that's the best way to do it because if you guys don't know what keep it keesha's when you get the but all those trichomes that we look at on the on the screen when it's shaking through a filter on micron filter I will I'll bring mine out next time so I can show you so you get that you shaking off all the notes this is the purest way if you want to get the highest quality most potent stuff you gotta get cheaper and you keep the buck through it goes through a really fine screen and then at the bottom you'll see nothing but crystals now those crystals when you scrape them up and you smoke those you're gonna get the highest you've ever been ever ever ever because that is nothing but the stuff that gets you high no plant matter so that's the healthiest way of doing it now if you get a chance you can buy keep and buying keith is really good but most the people don't keep the buds they're keeping the trip so if you open it and it smells like plant matter and it just smells like fake plants don't buy it that's that's been keep duffel for the trim if you have one thing that trim is good for one thing trim is really good for is making edibles now here's why because when you're making edibles if you make them properly you use oils or fats that are inside like whenever you need to double boiling the cannabis in there if there has to be an oil or if that means butter or corn oil or something like that for the THC - barb - if you just spit it in water there's nothing for it to bond to them just walk right away that's how you hold water bubble hash but we'll talk about that later so we're talking about oh yeah okay so they keep it so if you want to get the best keep you shake it through the scent and you smoke just the pure key now in these oils like this one you don't know if it's been mud run or if it's been trim run or what but we know that it's been at least trim run through the the best weed which is like the red box the red box so that's why I'm willing to give it a try but I don't usually smoke the bait pens and that's because it's through it oil and when you're smoking and evaporated oil it goes into your lungs and then you get lung issues from that oil now if you want to do the purest way of actually Beehive where the vapor actually came in with people like oh you know you it's healthier it's healthier tell you a healthy way of vaporizing is through a vaporizer grind up your bud put it inside hot air blows in through here and you suck it through here so it's not burning all the plant matter which is all the plant it's just melting the trichomes and you've just smoking the trichomes off it when you're done slightly golden you tap it out you smoke all the stuff that'll get you high but none of this stuff that's gonna black enough mess up your lung rennet it's not as satisfying of a hit because when you smoke all the plant matter and all that stuff to get you that coffin it gets you that that exploration of your lungs which gets you extra hot so there is positives and downside that's the reason I don't just vaporize but if you honestly want to do it a healthiest way if you're vaporizing and getting your vape in because you want to be healthy you're not you you're still smoking that oil it's not good for you no matter what anybody tells you I'm a weed advocate I love it to death I use my vape pen when there's when it's low key time when you have to go to an amusement park you gotta go to a concert when you got to do something you know where people can't see you even just want to take a hit real quick great for that but if you're doing it for health reasons don't go to a vaporizer you can get a portable vapor brothers one where you put some ground-up cannabis in there and it blows just the pure vapor in your mouth you get high as hell it tastes really good because it's from the pure plant matter fresh ground up the fresh ground up weed you know what I mean if you're getting stuff that well you sometimes you can taste it but it's always slightly tainted it doesn't taste quite like the plant would if you smoked it so that's my my tip on the vape pens and that's why I don't do very many reviews on them because honestly I don't want to promote something that's not good you know what I mean well not that it's not good but it's not good for you and I want to make sure that I'd let you guys know that before I promote this okay because this is really good these are good products it's great to have a vape pen but it's only good for emergency situations and stuff where you got to be low-key don't do it for health reasons okay so that's my disclaimer well here we go we're gonna unbox this for the first time okay so right off the bat they only sell theirs in grams so I feel like at that it's a full bio and then some people go oh you know the owners the vial is more Brown it is that more potent it is not necessarily because if you've done it through like the best Keith out there it's blond white white white key to be clear technically her be very white yellow so I mean you can't judge by that at all but that's what it looks like smells lemony to be honest which is kind of scary because I hope they didn't put in the lemon stuff in there to try and cover over the plants no they ran it through trim like we were talking about before so I'm gonna put it on this one this is a pure vape pen I have a bunch of different kinds that go on the bottom but I just got this one alright you guys like we always do let's do this you guys grab your piece at home let's do this together alright let's do this [Music] [Music] anywhere we will be discreet this one's really good guys reason why I say that is because I do I've tried a lot of bait pants and usually they just get me by until I can get back to my barn but this one I gotta say it got a pretty good address right now so I give it two thumbs up you guys that's the La Push like this red box so if you can't get your bong in you got a can't roll a joint in there bring it on in try this you guys all right that's the LA curse red box see you guys on the next look like", "S1njRfo1IjE": "[Music] what's up guys 420 I'm back with a new review and like I said guys usually carry thanks but i beginni it's a new [ __ ] in I got skittles rocket carts premium distilling it is ninety percent THC right now I've been seeing the Oliver 90 percent THC and this one is a hybrid a thousand milligrams California we'd love the California we label the laws and everything down here the little whatever agreements they had whatever down there and look at this court guys look at that the courts way different in the ding babes all the way filled seal at the top seal at the bottom no bubble guys no bubble these [ __ ] come all the way through they do have you do have to rip this it's actually to get to the cart and they used to have to pop this on ziplock seal right here and then you get to this bad boy see how this one is guys I'm not shave you up and I can be trying new things but I personally like trying new things thanks don't do the job but these guys ever since I got the Girl Scout cookies and the Blue Dream and God's gift it's things are banging look at those guys here's the seal I just ripped it look you have to actually rip it to even get to it like you can't even even if you had this day you still couldn't get to it through this beautiful gold oil guys no hot dog water no hot dog water no bubble it does have that seal at the bottom the seal at the top it doesn't have any see so no Kane or nothing labels at the bottom it's just blank if you see this as well it has no prefilled hole it's sealed it's just a little knob right there you see the top look at that what do you take this you loft you can see the little filter holes where the air filters through so you can get those hits amazing tanks guys they aren't plastic this is glass so if you do drop it be aware you might break it the tanks I've dropped them way too many times in it don't break see how this is probably my lose battery won't have no more technical difficulties let me prime at first this one definitely has a little bit more of a fruity flavor than the Girl Scout cookies that Blue Dream and the gods gift all those only three they tasted like the bud this one has a little bit of a fruity flavor see how their first rip is guys you sweating a little bit guys my bad whoo okay I ain't even no lie fruity flavor rocket carts I've tried three of these this is my fourth this one's freakin delicious if y'all see these I might want to try them these are the [ __ ] right now for me they're a little bit better than Dinks but I hope y'all get to see them and try them first so y'all can give me your opinion let me see the second hey guys oh okay all right some reason I'm not getting those big poles that I got in the first three but the high I'm feeling it it is a body high it won't make you sleepy guys but it will make you gay slumped sit down you're done guys these are the [ __ ] let's give it a third hit just cuz I haven't got those big drags oh that one did it guys I'm baked my eyes for really low as you give me cotton off already the high ten out of ten rocket carts give them a try the flavor guys if you're used to the tanks that are fruity and taste just like they say these aren't like that these taste like flour and they fit skittles this one does have a little bit of a fruity flavor but it's not much so for me personally skittles as in rocket karts nine out of ten if y'all try them give it a shot these are good they're to me they're a little bit better than things you can believe the percentage more they don't go any higher than 90 like I said guys if y'all have any recommendations just put it down below don't forget to Like and

Disease Control might have data to prove otherwise here in Pima County the counter-narcotics Alliance says violence can also be associated with sale of certain cartridges or carts used for vaping our digging deeper team uncovered information about some recent cases here in Tucson news 4 - sauce Lupita Mario shows us how bad the problem has become this is a vaping cart it contains THC found in marijuana it's also sold at dispensaries and sold on the black market for half the price that's where the trouble begins in January three masked individuals went to a Tucson home where fake carts were being manufactured counter-narcotics Alliance officers say the suspects beat and robbed the homeowner of cash marijuana and the illegal carts he was manufacturing we've been to several home invasions this year where individuals have been shot because of cartridges sergeant Alfredo Meza is with the Tucson Police Department assigned to CNA his unit investigates violent crimes associated with narcotics a lot of the time dealers are dealing in fake vape cartridges a lot of times they're putting in unknown substances to cut it and to make a bigger volume and to make their their money stretch so we don't know what's getting put in those vials vial such as these all of them fake sergeant Meza told the digging deeper team these were seized during a home invasion the homeowner was shot and a CNA officer found evidence he was making the THC vape cartridges inside his apartment there's not a lot of consistency in the manufacturer of this stuff anywhere there's no FDA regulation that goes through to make sure that they're not putting in cases in California they found cyanide in vape cartridges Captain John Leavitt is also with the Tucson Police Department and heads CNA and it's extremely dangerous it's toxic to your system and it can not only make people sick but it kills people according to the latest numbers from the CDC 2290 cases were reported from 49 states 47 deaths have been confirmed in 25 states and the District of Columbia the median age of the people dying is 53 it's an extreme health hazard and if you look at the guidance from the CDC they they vary circumspectly suggest that you don't vape most of the carts come from the black market these are pictures of the fake ones authorities say the active ingredient in the carts is THC that gives the people the high but people are now adding other ingredients to the carts such as mineral oil and vitamin E a toxic combination the CDC has discovered that is causing nearly 3000 people across the United States to have lung issues all we know so far is that in its infancy it's caused the terrible problems for a lot of people in his destined to do even worse investigators say that the raw THC oil is brought in from California because it's legal there and then smuggled into Arizona to manufacture the fake carts police say just days ago a 17 year old was shot in Tucson and is in critical condition at a local hospital they say he was buying carts and when he realized they were fake there was a dispute and shots were fired digging deeper Lupita more real news for Tucson", "FT1TzVVYIqs": "oh gee shout to Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] I need to say this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less your legal state my personal information what's up guys you're on your way back at you said this video got another part review for you guys you guys kinda like that last video the off-white car in the video I didn't really get too in-depth in it and in the video I said it was real but it ended up being fake video go check it out that's a pretty cool video but in this video I wanna be reviewing banks extracts Fruity Pebbles and honestly I picked this flavor just because of the packaging like the Flintstones throne that's [ __ ] classic that's [ __ ] dope banks extracts it's a California brand if I'm correct they make edibles that make all types of [ __ ] um these are like 45 bucks if you buy them in the shop in Cali I actually got this one for 44 my homie Fruity Pebbles like I said it's a 4 gram card that's the packaging that's the front side that's the card that's the back that's us hybrid on the bottom there we go hybrid and then down here says all that [ __ ] yeah that's the packaging pretty dope pack again I'm not gonna lie I [ __ ] with the packaging but on 2018 banks it has like a little serial number in the back says the ingredients organic ultra pure cannabis oil and cannabis to our penis not for resale for use by adults 21 and all to keep out of reach of children do not watch this video after 18 or older 18 or over or 21 or over whatever the legal age is in your state or you have a medical marijuana card like I do actually so I say yeah I just gotta say that [ __ ] to cover my ass because I can't get this channel deleted don't want to get a copyright strike you know what I mean family this is a thousand milligrams of THC it's tested at ninety one point two percent THC where the one point four percent CVT I already showed you but there it is again and you can google this [ __ ] brand if you want like being set tracks that's what I did a bit they have some pretty throw products want to take it out but um let's just open up this box now we'll get right into it actually before I do that before I we're gonna be vaping the side of just my normal select cart battery if you haven't heard of the brand select these are the package and cards they have maybe I'll drop a review on one of these if you guys want to see that let me know down below in the comments but basically they have like a little carrying case thing to open it up like this a little part for your charger your pen and then you a little pod right there maybe put your carcass best there so it's pretty dope i [ __ ] with it um but it's just a normal little stick battery you know what I mean good it's not the best in the market you could find a better one but it rips so let's open this up now all right so you take it out of this take it out of the box and then it's in another packaging a little too so that's [ __ ] pretty dope let's open this up as like a gold-plated mouthpiece it's like completely completely full yes it's a lot more like yellow but when I put my hand behind it it gives you that like orange tint you know what I mean so that's the oil right there so yeah it's pretty fired looks like some fire ass oil so yeah sort of looks like on the pen and yeah I guess let's just take the first hit first impressions that last awkward car if you guys in that review really had no taste that was supposed to taste like strawberry strawberry something I forget but literally had no page let's see if this tastes like fruity pebbles oh that's left car they have like a mint mint flavor and it's actually really [ __ ] fire it tastes like a lot like me so that's pretty dope let's see what this tastes like [Music] yeah I got that little Fruity Pebbles volume that should taste fires [ __ ] already all cops a hundred times hundred times better now of white court was you guys like these videos somebody don't ball in the comments so I know to keep doing them but I didn't really get too in-depth in that video I've been smoking for a long time so I know and I know my [ __ ] so don't think I'm dumb but I just never seen one of those off-white packaging before I seen the more you know carts and exotic and all that first impressions first taste like fruity pebbles I haven't smoked all day I just got off work that first take I mean for as high for his high over tolerance as I have I mean that first hit got me got me there I mean I'm feeling it so so I was going for a second well I'm loving this cart um see the only thing about this [ __ ] um this battery is when you fully charge it sometimes if you guys can see this heats up a little bit too much which causes the oil to bubble up and then sometimes they can burn some of your oil so you gotta unscrew it and wait a little bit it works perfect with [ __ ] this with their ground carts but I noticed with every other brand car for some reason it gets a little bit too hot I'm bubbles up like that I'll probably invest I mean if you guys like these car reviews all definitely invest in a better battery but um so yeah time we don't bow in the comments like I said this cars fire is [ __ ] let me hit it again yeah somewhere dude what's on the first not off-white video the off-white card I smoked before I made that video so it's kinda hard for me to judge on how high I got off that hit off that cart and I didn't smoke before I made this video so I'm pretty high now I'm not gonna lie but but this card is [ __ ] fire like it tastes amazing it tastes pure tastes like I mean it has that little fruity pebbles flavor but it tastes it tastes fires frog it tastes like some real [ __ ] like not no [ __ ] fake-ass booty [ __ ] hot dog Cruz Carter let me know down below in the comments what you guys think about it [Music] cuz like not only in the carb like the packaging everything about it you know they can I mean like the packaging is [ __ ] too late it's [ __ ] 91 percent THC so that's like some fire at thousand milligrams and this so for girl oh [ __ ] I just noticed that that's [ __ ] late yeah I see that so I just saw a little small all the little small details on this car is like it's [ __ ] though so um like I came in like a little [ __ ] too like I said that's [ __ ] lid um the package in definitely gets a 5 out of 5 Fisher yeah so the package and it gets a 5 out of 5 for sure for sure the cart the wax I'm gonna give it like a I'll go to four and a half out of five like I've had better cards I've I've had better cards before for sure but it's there was some stupid fire when I was tested at 91% supposedly so I figure out if that's true it is a lot as far as [ __ ] you know what I mean but like I've had better cards I'm not gonna lie the flavor I'll give it like a four and a half out of five - I've had better tasting cards but it does taste [ __ ] fire but for $45 though because some of those like fire cards I'm talking about they go for like 60 bucks in the dispensary but this one for 40 bucks you know I mean like around like a little budget and you're trying to like spend less definitely go with these are [ __ ] fire so probably overall score four to five out of five or four point five out of five oh I didn't read the high um like I said I didn't smoke before I made this video I probably took what like five or six hits off that I'm pretty high right now so high I'll give it like a four out of five so yeah overall score about like 4.5 out of 5 which I mean I still a really good ass [ __ ] rating so it's some fire bug or not but a sapphire s car it's a fire aspirin and like if you guys have any like suggestions or brands want me to try and do a review over time we don't blowing the comments or like or something like a we trains tell me the names I'm low in the comments I'll do them too yeah I'll give this this car at 4.5 out of 5 overall the packaging the [ __ ] lid and then the oil everything about it it's just [ __ ] late so um yeah so tell me down below in the comments what you guys think of this whole that was the [ __ ] car that fell out I was sketched but yet I'm we don't blow in the comments what you guys think of this oral if you guys want me to do more reviews let me know and I definitely will yeah just let me know if you guys like

morning tubers my name is Matt and I'm a medical marijuana patient here in the state of New Jersey and for years I've been smoking bud break I can't roll a blunt to save my life well bong hits a nice glass piece every now and again so technology brings me to this cartridge that I I didn't discover it you know but it's new tomates the roof brand they claim its co2 supercritical extracted they also claim it tests up to 85 86 percent THC they've got several different flavors I've got a indica and Fuji indica I think you can see that okay I'll show you the cartridge real fast that's the inside the box says on the side here all natural solvent free as the size of the cartridge up top half and here's the cartridge itself a little squiggly are 4ov brand color-coordinated per flavor this purple R is the og indica they suggest that you prime them before you use it so what I'll do is and you see it's got a little rubber mouthpiece cover on there I'll take that off now this isn't the actual mouthpiece can be used as a mouthpiece I use it as a mouthpiece works great but Road does offer a mouthpiece that's attached inside I think it's a silicone mouthpiece I'm not exactly sure because robe is only available on the west coast I'm on the East Coast don't know how I got these anywhere so your average 510 thread it's an all Pyrex glass cartridge stainless steel parts it's got a ceramic wick it's um they're pretty awesome I'll read you their little info or stats card what's new it says improved cartridge the new design as a ceramic core which improves taste and flow if your cartridge appears to be less then completely full don't worry so moil has already been absorbed in the wick now from experience I've got to tell you these cards are the bomb they will empty all the way down you see that a little bit right there yeah that'll get smoked like this cart has lasted me probably five or six days and I'm a full time smoker full time like in my pocket all times I charge it twice a day like full time smoker that's here this is the sherbet flavor pretty awesome it's it's not an oily substance it's more like a gel and I find that sometimes in the cold weather just overnight kids jammed up and it won't come through you won't get a good hit okay it's kind of shitty so particular handy dandy George you gotta be smarter than it first light it you just hear it up real fast real quick spinning the cartridge around eating up the jail you'll see it fall don't spend too much time on it voila yeah it's all formed down at the bottom now okay touch make sure you don't burn yourself

"6He7nQfOLg4": "okay we have a suspect they had some mount wanna liquid form in his bag I came over the scanner I think they have lacked marijuana laws now but this was in a liquid form so he's gonna be arrested that's how much I know I will try to find out more later they call in the cage the vehicle you're gonna get the perk walk in a minute right making an alliance I'm not streaming right now I did a video yesterday I got checked in TSA it was 390 drinking or drugs whatever you but he was screaming resisting arrest great video but somebody called me in the ringtone went off right and son so you two there's some kind of thing where you could only play it in seven countries so I'm kicking off the sound now since yesterday so hopefully that video will be up [Music] but uh yeah I think that you're allowed to take my one on certain places that I do allow my wanna in your state but I'm not sure about the liquid hang on there's some kind of stuff in this bag that was Victor lax FY police on the scene and we're wondering LAPD has a substation here chum 108 we try to recorder the distance and I thought not to interfere it's been recording the police for over 20-some odd years at low level of American Airlines some of the floor but yeah hopefully that video will be up it's called LAX Airport police on a green 90 man resisting arrest somebody called sent me a email tone went off and never happened before but it was saying that this video only plays in certain countries and that's including America so I fixed it last night but it taking a while for it to go through but it's a excellent video [Music] so be careful what you take with you when you fly because they will basically arrest you [Music] you're gonna get the trick walk in a minute [Music] the perpetrator comes from New York City the cops always walk out the perks all right so look up a lot better here with the First Amendment the airport police I've been here for so many years over I think over 16 years now I've had my moments where I was attacked by Tyson bodyguard / crazy cops they've gotten a lot better hopefully this is gonna be quick [Music] who happens with the kate vehicle is here but again on the scanner have said he had something in his bag that was a liquor store in marijuana and I believe you're allowed to take a certain amount now but I don't know I'm not sure about the liquor pair [Music]", "8gLu6aKZtmE": "[Music] damn oh my god i'm sweating look i'm sweating can you see my head look at my head look that was one hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high what's going on guys and welcome back to the channel so this is another three chive delta eight vape cartridge review the last one that i did did so well that i just well i had to do another one if i release a video and it gets 800 hits or 800 views in a for like a week oh yeah i'm definitely doing another video so the one that i got is blue dream and it's a one milliliter container brand new sealed and that's how i like it and you can see right there it contains 95 percent eight delta eight th oil and then five percent of [ __ ] which you know whatever i guess you gotta i guess it can't be a hundred percent or it would probably just knock you on your ass and stuff uh the directions remove the silicone cover and screw into the battery do not over tighten take one puff and wait 20 minutes wow wait 20 minutes um usage is between one and two puffs let's see here i'm trying to focus it for you guys i can't focus it whatever uh says do not operate any machinery while using this product do not use if pregnant nursing or under the age of 21 this may cause a positive drug test well no [ __ ] oh my god uh let's see here if you need more typical usage it's one or two puffs do not operate wait a minute where's that one part at wait 20 minutes before determining if you need more oh okay 5 10 battery 100 percent hint driving contains 0.3 is that a 9 thc batch 6 out of 15 2021 batch id three chives fishery blah blah blah blah all right blue dream sweet so i have a couple other ones over here these are the fx these are delta eight fx cartridges um and i designed this little thing to keep them in the upright for me because sometimes i'll run out and these right here will be enough to get you by for a few days especially if you leave them in the upright these are this was like orange crush and like granddaddy purple if i remember correctly i didn't really care um for the granddaddy purple i do want to say one thing though there is a big difference between the ethics cartridge and the delta eight cartridges i feel like the delta eight cartridges these are put together better they just seem to be i don't know i don't have any leakage they hardly ever clog they just seem to be a better cartridge than the fx the fx are also a lot cheaper too these are like 30 something dollars and these are like 60 something dollars okay now the effects of this all right let's say you're sitting on the couch smoking a blunt there you go you're going to get high but this is great because you can be out public you could be in a mall walking around hitting this and people are just going to think that you're vaping and that's the beautiful part about it and it delivers i mean just one one good hit delivers like a serious bond grip i mean it's depending on your tolerance and how much you smoke it can get you really really really really really high um like for instance i got friends that do not smoke like me i consider myself to be a pothead meaning that i i blaze it up every day we smoke it down okay that's just me i've been like that for 20 years um but we're not talking about me this i hit it one time and i'm like whoo all right if i get somebody that doesn't smoke like me and they hit it they gotta sit down and sometimes they're out for the count like uh like i actually had one friend hit it and it ruined her whole night she felt like [ __ ] it just messed her up and then i had another buddy uh i mean it put his ass on the couch so i guess the effects is just different depending on who you are and how much you smoke but let me tell you what it's definitely worth it it's discreet nobody knows that you have it plus there's no smell like you blaze that [ __ ] up man you hit it pow pow pow you get a big old dragon's breath cloud and it don't smell like weed it's awesome you can take it to work that's the best part about it man is that there's no paraphernalia there's no weed nobody knows you have it on you the only way somebody's gonna know you have it is if they physically see it no smells man i i've been pulled over by the police and i had this on me he didn't even ask me not clean as a whistle goodbye give me my ticket leave awesome these things definitely have their benefits definitely and if you're going to have this you got to have a 510 battery okay this is an e-leaf very simple 510 battery plugs into the bottom i don't know an hour charge you're good to go all you do is you hold the button wait for it to get to about there and then you start hitting it hit it slow you're not trying to rip on it you're just trying to take a slow even deep breath and even that might be too much for you three child blue dream now one thing i did like about it was all they had so many selections for these and then they told you about what they did like this is a sativa brand um this is supposed to give you clarity um it's not supposed to make you foggy it's supposed to give you energy and make you awake and whatever whatever whatever like it claims what it is it's a um a sativa synthetic it's a blend of you know indica and this brand i mean like it tells you what they are and what they're mixed with their strands and everything so you really can't go wrong so it's not like you don't know what you're buying you know what i mean sorry if there's a little bit of an echo i'm trying to do this privately this is illegal in my state you know so you really don't want to be advertising what you're doing that's the other thing like a cop a cop knows what this is because this does not look like a typical vape that's the other thing that you need to be aware of this is very identifiable if they're a cop and they deal with this [ __ ] they've seen this before they will know exactly what you have in your hand so be aware of that uh your average person not so much you know i mean you go out for a cigarette break you hit it once or twice nobody's going to even say it or even notice it but be careful because police they they probably will know what the hell that is i mean because all vape cartridges come the same basically the same look you know all right we're actually starting to get to the meat and potatoes oh come on [ __ ] come on out now here's another thing i like is that they come with these uh get out damn it [ __ ] it's pressure treated uh is that they come with these plastic things right to keep them covered now when i transport mine for instance see like these these even have it on them when i transport them because sometimes i'll take this with me and then i'll take another flavor with me it's very important that you keep that cap on there all right because if you don't keep that cap on there lint and trash and garbage and other things that are in your pocket will get into these little holes and ports and you don't want that because that's going to mess everything up for you so it's very important that you keep these little plastic covers and if you want to even keep the mouthpiece because you know see like this mouthpiece see all the stuff that's in there that's from it being in my pocket like lint and trash and other things get up inside of that you know what i mean yeah you don't want that that's bad so definitely keep your plastic covers man you got to keep those and try to store it upright because if you laying it down you can take a good chance of it leaking and it'll this [ __ ] takes forever it's like molasses to go back in the upright um but let's let's plug it in and check it out not only that check out the quality this is the end cap that came off of the uh the new delta eight cartridge see it see how thick it is all right and then this is the end cap that comes now i ain't trying to knock the the fx vapes i'm just trying to justify the 30 something dollars more that they want for the vape you know [Music] all right and then here's theirs see what i'm saying see the difference look at the difference in the caps big difference this one's nice and meaty and this one's real thin and kind of cheesy looking but uh you know i guess that's part of the difference is that you get better coverage with it also when i bought these these just come in like kind of like this thing here uh but it doesn't have anything covering the mouthpiece the mouthpiece is wide open so but with these you get a mouthpiece covered which is nice because like i said i transport these in my pocket and stuff so yeah you know what that um this this right here it kind of it kind of sneaks up on you god damn oh my god i'm sweating look i'm sweating can you see my head look at my head look that was one hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high yeah one hit y'all one hit damn yeah see i can go in there right now smoke a few bowls that [ __ ] won't get me like how i am right now good god oh [ __ ] all right yes um forgot what i was saying yep don't remember now okay so back to what i don't remember i was talking about y'all need to get this i don't know what else to tell y'all three chive delta eight vapes leave me a comment subscribe to my channel check out

"JYcC1RudsfU": "[Music] what is up guys but from hey buds have I got some exciting news for you from Rove for new disposable pens from Rove all the same flavors you're used to right now they've only got Skywalker og tangi and wahwee og while we the most popular flavors by far four row but check it out this is going to make your arsenal complete it's got 0.4 grams of oil same oil they use in their other pens but they've made it disposable 0.4 grams you say that sucks well as you know the oil from Rove is a lot thicker which means the battery needs to be a lot hotter for that oil to burn so instead of getting a half a gram or even a full gram in a disposable you get halfway through it the battery dies you're pissed off you're at a concert or you're somewhere where you're using your disposable and and it doesn't work so what they found is this is the best combination for the consumer so there you go hot off the press if your dispensary doesn't have it yet get on them find out when they're getting them and load up I'm sure they're going to come out with more flavors in the in the near future and I will let you know when that's happening but right now check it out disposables everybody loves the disposable so there you go hop on it let me know how you like them I've only had it for a day and and really loving it so hope you enjoy like subscribe share the video

my Glendale just wanted to do this THC cartridge review because I googled this company called ignite cannabis and so far nobody has done a review on this company so I was very interested in this company because I love potent THC oil that's my latest thing and it's hard to find very good potent oil up there these days you know I gotta have a least 89 percent THC to get me good and I only like indicas or indica dominant hybrids I'm not interested Evo's you know I like getting couch locked you know I got a high tolerance you know my favorite company is select oil because they're very potent for a good price and carvanha a sinned but I was looking to find a company that's just as good for a good price and I found you they're called a night cannabis company started in 2017 California company I found a half a gram first for $45 at Green Wolf but I was like oh that's too expensive because select is only 35 for half a gram well I'm like if this stuff's 45 is gotta be fired so finally I found it for 30 yet for alpha gram at la cush on Alvarado and I laid so I went and picked it up today half a gram for 30 bucks oh gee cush cush indica straight fire 80 percent THC you know as well you know packaging looks like Hotel proof on it you got to push down on it and you open it up that's what it looks like take it out you know look at the oil look at the oil straight golden see-through so thick the bubble does not move straight potent I recommend it to anybody that wants a potent card for a good price try ignite og at Los Angeles cush I guarantee you try it once you'll be back for a second two thumbs up great job ignite", "5ndyQLqo3Y4": "what's happening party people we're here and I want to beep so odd as it sounds sounds weird coming out of my mouth usually it's I want to dad I want a bong hit one babe all of our faith cartridges are like dunzo check this out they're like it looks like there's something inside but there's nothing inside these I mean I could probably get like little baby hits but they're done I've been sucking on them dry bro like all of them we are out so the revival vape actually comes with empty hive cartridges you guys can see here and you just pop it open take this little thingy off and you can just pour your concentrates in there man simple as that so we're gonna take this syringe of beta my cream and we're gonna make a little vape syringe or vape cartridge with the syringe this is from nectar stick interesting people we see them at all the events they're always there pitching their stuff they sell these full grams in this container for $40 at the events it's probably gonna run you 50 or 60 out of dispensary but this one specifically normally they have like kind of ap flavors like strawberry cough and mango passion this and whatever I asked the guy what do you have for pain and it gave me this it's a ante what does it say pain relief sedative now actually that's upside down sorry guys now I actually hit these people up on Instagram because I was at the event you know I didn't necessarily get the proper explanation of the product you know it wasn't really the kind of place that you sit and you [ __ ] talk science and chemistry about cannabis and [ __ ] but I instagrammed them when I was like hey man I bought your Batum mersin I did I call it Mike Green earlier sorry mersin I bought your beta Mersin and I was curious I mean is this made with cannabis does this contain THC or CBD you know give me some give me some info about this all I have is the package and the package isn't too descriptive either zero PPM's solvent free ultra refined nothing doesn't tell you like percentages doesn't tell you anything so I'm curious like is this a pure I guess I should have explained it if you guys don't know with what beta mercian is I check it out on wiki because that's basically how I learned what it is it beta mercian is basically a component in cannabis it's like a terpenoid it's one of the things that are a part of the we'd like THC CBD CBN THC a all of those get you high and then there are actually compounds that give you flavor like limonene citrus scene or something lemons this is the citrus one hash machine there are a couple of different flavor compounds and these compounds are found in everything I could find citrus or limonene in limes I can find that in oranges I can extract it from those you know and it's also found in cannabis that's why some weed smells like oranges some weed smells like smoke it's are like smoke because you've spoken it some weed smells like like dirt and like earth you know like it literally has the same chemicals they're in those other things so this is one of those chemicals and if you smoke this chemical by itself or not smoke it but you know consume it it's supposed to make you feel relaxed sedative it's supposed to make you sleepy it's supposed to be a good anti and Kalama tori it's it's got a bunch of qualities you can read them all on the on the wiki so I got this and I was like man this should be excellent for medicating and then I had a realization where I was like isn't this the same [ __ ] that they have in mangoes that everybody says gets you higher if you smoke it or if you consume it so if I'm smoking like a really low grade weed or even if I just want to get higher supposedly if I eat a mango it's high in the Mersin and that is what gives me like a bigger high so I was like man this would be excellent for a cush Buster's or something where I'm like [ __ ] eating mangoes I'm literally gonna go to a scientist have him extract the Mersin give it to me straight up and I'll test it for you guys and I'll be like I'm gonna smoke a gram of this shitty weed and then take a hit of the mercy and and see if it helps then I'm gonna take a hit of the top shelf with the Mersin and see if that improves the hit as well and then do like control test like this is awesome so we're just gonna stick this in here like a mad scientist and just fill it up I want to I use it up I use half of this I want to leave some for dabbing but or just see if it even works let's just use less let's see if it even works you don't want to put all of your nugs in one basket you know what I'm saying I lost a little stopper there's like a little shirt oh there it is it's so tiny put the stopper in I guess I think I went the other way whoops got it all weedy so cool we do that and we're good to go let's try it out I've been smoking it I took it home you guys and I was like let's get [ __ ] up like we went to the event and it was like a marijuana edible sesh and if you guys watched the the podcast if you guys haven't seen it it's the podcast from the weekend of like May 14th May 15th like that and we talked about how we got trapped in the elevator we almost died going to like a weed event and if I get to the weed event and I don't even get to smoke that much or like get that high so I came home and I was like man I'm gonna take a huge hit and I literally smoked like a fifth of it at once and it was a immense hit it was super clean super flavorful particularly for the size usually you take a huge dab of something and it's really rough like it just it kills your lungs it's like it leaves you wheezing but it was super clean and a him Ian waves bro it was like at first like you kind of you feel a little bit after the initial hit but it doesn't like hit you and then like a couple minutes later you start you feel like almost like a wave hit you and like you feel like more buzzing more like higher and more relaxed and then like five minutes later boom like another wave a couple minutes later like another wave and eventually like after 15-20 minutes I was like oh gone I was just like laying in the couch like dunzo really nice I mean I smoked the point point to grammar but let's try it out I'll see how if it works cross your fingers for me I hate wasting weed drum roll please nothing I have to take the thingy out these thingies have the thingy the cartridges have the little stopper so I don't necessarily have to take the stopper out and it's hot I can feel it at the base it's just not it's not doing anything I'm glad I didn't put more one more time get in there get in there I think it's just so thick that it's having a hard time vaping it we're getting there we're getting there has a really good flavor to it it tastes it tastes very similar to the pickled monkey cartridges that we received I think they're using like a similar solvent free filler pretty sure now it's ripping brah brah it's ripping oh yeah it's pretty good it's pretty good I cannot tell you guys if it has THC or not in it I I can't offer the life let me tell you I would like to tell you that it doesn't and that I am smoking a pure beta Mersin and that this is simply the the effect of that because it almost feels a little different from a high when I take a big hit of this and I take a big hit of weed the high sit separately from each other if you know what I'm saying like one of them I like I know is like weed and on the other once it's like distantly in the back affectingly me very differently I don't know I wish they would get back to me on Instagram yo I hate when companies are like secretive about their process and like the products that they're giving you I'm literally [ __ ] smoking this and putting it in my lungs how about you [ __ ] tell me what's in this bro like people who make food have to literally list ingredients legally and that people who have these [ __ ] smokeable products don't even have to [ __ ] lab test it or anything it's crazy it was like a graphic the other day going around a mean and it was a I don't know the character name he's like a famous like character actor he has a curly hair he's like blonde and it's like um you have you notice you ever noticed how there's no more powdery mildew anymore ever since everybody to learn how to make concentrates and it was like like that [ __ ] like man you never know what you're putting into your lungs anymore you know like they could just take any weed they want run it and it just looks golden and good you know and unless it actually gets tested by a lab or something I'm not gonna know if it's safe or not to smoke so I hate when companies are like [ __ ] shady about [ __ ] like [ __ ] tell me bro like what the [ __ ] like I'm gonna go steal your process and whatever like as if there are like 10 other companies do right now how about you just be honest with your consumer base and let them know what they're literally smoking bro what strain is in this what am i even smoking is this even weed these are my questions I think they're fair I don't know but it's pretty far I ask these questions I semi complain but also smoke it also smoking I purposely did this one just so that I know I knew that I wouldn't necessarily waste the weed as much because I feel like big cartridges are more efficient than like dabbing like when you dab you just some of it burns away maybe it's too high temp of a dab like you're literally electronically controlling the temperature with the vaporizer so I feel like it's more efficient and what was my point with that right I wanted a lot of smoke because I'm actually doing a product shoot over there and I'm actually doing shots where like there's products all laid out and then I blow smoke and like smoke comes into the frame and like you know [ __ ] high production [ __ ] and it's actually been really hard to make like volumous smoke I literally that's why I have the illa Delft over here I was gonna pack a bomb hit for the shoot because I've tried vaping I've tried using is it here I tried using the dryer vape and I even tried taking a DAB and unless I took like a huge dab I couldn't get a significant volume of smoke so like look impressive enough on the screen so I have to pack some flowers bro into the old illy and start ripping I thought this would be it but it makes clouds but now I mean look at the size difference I mean if this made clouds this big I'd be scared like what is in this what witchcraft did they like make this with some make it do that but still pretty fire I'm gonna go get the weed pack up a bowl and I'll see you guys next time on the daily grind thank you guys for joining me and let me know what you guys are smoking on in the comments man you guys rocking a vape pen vape cartridge have you ever refilled one of these before do you make your own eliquid I think a couple of followers have mentioned in the past that they do their own like pg/vg mix or some [ __ ] like let me know in the comments I am really new to the whole vaping world so I am very curious to hear what people's personal preferences are particularly after they've had a consistent career token it up contouring on the vape level you know what I'm saying I'll see you guys next time stay regularly", "jK3zS3k5RWU": "hey what about you - lonely cashier bring you guys another cart review today I'm gonna be reviewing a gorilla G cart Roxy but it's purple punch it's an indica on the side of the box we have the California logo on the back

doing a review on a fake Roth cart that I just got now I know that's fake because I got it from a you know one of my one of the dudes that I know no I live in my neighborhood so yeah you know it's not real unless coming from the actual dispensary but even even then like some delivery services some shady delivery services have actually you know I've bought in a fake cart off a [ __ ] delivery service before but I was like around two years ago but this [ __ ] this [ __ ] is straight from I just want from some dude so look at it it shows the manufacturing day packaging day and then the expiration date now I know these are fake because like I said these came from my friend 75 cent THC now this is how it came actually had a little sticker right here that was on here but it basically just said tore it off so I did I'm gonna open it [Applause] all right [Applause] [Music] I just comes with this road construction thing cartridge use and care instructions says your cartridges preheat time do not preheat steady hits 5 seconds or less are ideal for optimal continued performance if the cartridge air flow feels restricted unscrew from battery one quarter one quarter turn because care

that's what a fake profile", "wWGGJlVNaSc": "what's going on God you're tuned into Bubba the food TV and guess what man I'm back on another video man I ain't never heard this y'all see that y'all let

__ ] my dad part this is what we all came here for let me lift this bad boy okay see right now we got the blue tip I never had one of these my first time having one of these they say that he's pretty far but we're gonna find out there's the bubble for the guys that be talking okay it's not going nowhere see this is a light there's no bag over here it is indica purple punch you dig seventy-seven point 21 to see this take this tip off take that off no little bitter fool that the ooze pin you know I stay with the ooze pin my frenemy give you our little taste it [Music] tastes like just like a flavor oh yeah flats per punch well yeah you can taste the purple in my baby but Alissa to her already turned it on so you know I love you preheat the [ __ ] on the buffer he not heated okay she's a little purple in it I like to do judo turn on the swing or what it's a punch and current is like I don't know if y'all remember him exotic carts they head back and a gap where before yeah that's what they kind of smoker like it tastes like but it actually smokes like a it actually smells like a [ __ ] I take it he's not a fake smart car smart carts that's what a smoke smokes like I just took a blow for fitness already you're going down a little bit but that's exactly what the roads otic smart cars do to you take a couple of hits at them halogen hose run down real quick but you know this is my first time having this but I just took two hits off of it so I'm kind of like in a little buzz but you know what I'm you know what I do i do blinkers on this channel you did bubble fool do blinkers you know what I'm saying so I don't think to hit off I'm pretty sure once I he didn't I'm a couple of time I mean once I had a blinker it's probably gonna be right here because that's how the smart cars go they like go by fast and I guess these similar to that because it's already almost going down jakka see but when I put it upside down this [ __ ] don't move anyways just go ahead and try this whole game I'm gonna go ahead and blink up for y'all", "6X3A9BVYnFo": "I was lucky all su boy master blue see back again with another video today I'm gonna be looking at this TKO skittles part I just want to make another video hopefully maybe the last video I need to make on fake TKOs um just because there's a little bit more information that I have now that I just like to give to you guys and because I finally have a box so I could show you guys really what a fake looks like when it comes the box is for wedding cake I didn't get a wedding cake current I just got this get one anyway let's get into the review so first off when we look at the TKO extracts cart we see that it has the fake symbol on it TKO extract symbol does not look like that I'm gonna do a walk-through of their website in this video so that you guys can see what strains they offer and what their pens actually look like but these are always fake and the tubes are not their real packaging they come in boxes also the fact that it's a full gram cart makes it a fake because TKO currently only sells their carts as half grams and they only sell them in two states I'll go over that more when I'm going through the walkthrough of your website but either way let's look at this wax quality as you can see whoever I bought it from and I have been hitting this cart just a little bit I think I've hit it like three times just to make sure I wanted to review it and yeah the wax is nice and slow and I will say right now that it's also very smooth on the front of it we see TKO and then it has that very fat chimney which is also another side of it being a fake I ended up weighing this cart when I first got it against this one which is one of the old atomizers from those last TKOs I got and it ended up being only 0.8 grams of wax in this cart versus a full gram so if you are buying these TKOs with the phat chimney you are getting ripped off so if you guys would like me to show you how I scaled these carts I can show you guys in an they're video just so you can do your own checks at home either way for now I'm going to be going into the first rips so you guys can see the cloud production on this cart and I can show you guys how smooth it is so let's get into that alright so I have the cart loaded onto my Cecil m3 battery and I'm just gonna go ahead and take my first rips so Cheers this cart is so smooth honestly it rips very nicely and it tastes amazing um the cart being skittles which is a mix of grapefruit and grade 8 it tastes just like if you would take the flavors out of orange juice and grape juice and then mix them into a cart um very very nice it's a pleasure to hit this card I find myself wanting to hit it more than I should simply because of how smooth and good it feels so cheers again [Music] all right so that blinker made me coffee around five times but honestly that's not that bad considering it is a blinker and I haven't really been hitting carts too much today um the TKOs or at least these batch that I've been getting have been very smooth and very nice they hit very hard as well after three to four hits I get pretty high this being my probably third hit now I don't know if I got all three on camera but it being my third hit now I'm getting lens flares with all the lights around me I'm feeling very very light um and very talkative and sort of relaxed as well I really really love the strain Skittles has been my second favorite strain for a long time I really like these TKO cards but unfortunately I cannot suggest them um now I'm gonna actually go into my computer and just show you guys some stuff about fake TKOs that I think is important for everyone to know um and is the biggest reason why I'm not gonna be suggesting them before I go into my computer and show you guys the TKO website and talk to you guys a bit more about why fake TKOs are dangerous um basically what's going on is some people actually being admitted into hospitals now because of breathing problems related to smoking fake cards and unfortunately TKO has been sort of one of the bigger companies that's been sort of under fire because of it and it's really not even their fault because they're taking the steps to produce high quality wax and all of these fake companies are just using their name and sort of soiling it which is really unfortunate um so that's why I can't really suggest these cards simply because I don't want to lead you guys into getting hurt um because well I did get a good TKO card I don't know if you will and if yours looks like mine and you hit it at least once and it feels really smooth and flavorful then it's probably a safe card to smoke but you probably shouldn't also take that chance if you know what I mean so let me go into my computer I'll show you guys TKO is website I'll show you guys the four strains that they actually do offer let's go ahead and do that and then I'll do a wrap-up so see you guys there all right hey guys what's up so I'm just gonna walk you through TKO products website it's not TKO extracts its products and then their division is called TKO extracts and as you can see here they only have four strains which are pineapple express rich gelato Northern Lights and rose gold um they also only sell them as a half gram cartridge that's fully disposable um they do not sell them in full grams and they don't sell them in tubes it will always look like this if they are legit now um and I also wanted to show you something else that's really cool so I'm in my email right now I'm a kind of bit out so you guys don't see some of my more personal information but basically I reached out to TKO extracts and I said hello I'm a small youtuber who makes videos exposing fake cart brands I've done two videos on fakes of your products which I can send you links to I'm just reaching out to find out if you can give me a list of things to look for when spotting fakes over real products from your company any reply would be greatly appreciated thank you so much master blinky and TKO actually did respond to me so I'm gonna read you that email right now says thanks for reaching out I've seen your videos and appreciate your work at exposing the fakes you are on point about what to look for including how to check if carts are cut or not we are getting reports of people getting sick from carts including a person in the ICU for lung issues what do we don't know is if the issues are related to smoking carts or other issues that were made worse from smoking anything all we know is that after years on the black market were no standards had to be followed I do feel bad about what I put in my own body being pesticide free especially after talking with people from the lab and hear about the crap they find and some of the tests they run best but for people is to only buy from licensed shops and states that require testing you pay more but quality does cost money I would also suggest looking for high potency test results RT ke o of HR testing around 85% THC we use distillate that tests in the 90 % rage 90 to 95% and after we add terpenes for flavor it reduces the potency to 85% anything advertised over 90% is [ __ ] unless this period Issel it with nothing at all at it it won't have any flavor to it as to do so will dilute the potency bill so that plus just showing you guys their vape products is a big reason why I can't suggest them to anyone simply because I don't want any of you guys to end up in the hospital because of what you guys are vaping so I'll go back to myself now um and do a wrap-up but basically I just wanted to show you guys that email and their website so you guys could get just a final like example on how to see if it's a fake or a real TKO extracts card so yeah alright hey guys what's up so it's been around 3 days now and I've still been smoking on the skittles cart I'm sorry I didn't come back sooner I've had a very busy past few days but uh I definitely just want to do this wrap up so after showing you guys all the stuff online and that email that is the biggest reason why I can't suggest these cards to people simply because I don't want any of you guys to get hurt but that being said this batch that I got or at least this part and the that last mango gelato part were both very amazing they were very smooth they hit very hard and gave the effects of the strains that they were supposed to and they tasted the same as the strings they were trying to emulate um this current is very nice if I could suggest it to you guys without having to worry about the health risks I would give this fake that I got an 8 out of 10 um flavor was good the high length was around two and a half hours so I'm not completely at three but it was very potent as well um and they hit super smooth just go ahead and take a blinker through this regular clip just to show you guys how to smooth they are so Cheers [Music] very nice I was able to hold that and I'm not coughing and I don't feel like I want to call I don't even have a dry throat right now so for this cart I thought anyway for this cart definite eight out of ten but I can't suggest it for two days of heavy use I probably have around point two grams left and I started out with 0.8 so I'm happy with my experience with this cart but if you all are trying to get some or if you guys see them around you and want to actually look into them just make sure you watch for the oil quality and if you hit it and it's dry and it hurts do not hit it anymore please either way this was this might be the last video I do want to fake TKOs I'm thinking it will be because I don't really have anything else to say about them but if you guys want I can still review ones that I get if I end up getting four so I'm master bling see thank you guys for watching if you aren't subscribed to the channel do that please I really want to try to hit 10,000 by my birthday which is in February so yeah I'm about to start really trying to get on that grind there's gonna be a few changes to the channel coming up I'm gonna try to film the channel update soon but either way I'm master bling see thank you guys please check all the links in the description peace [Music]", "wpkxIOhAp3Y": "except you guys shadows here again with another episode of shadows we'd review today on the show we're gonna be going over some vape pens now you know you guys know how I feel about vape pens I won't go into all that again but if you're gonna do it this is the one to do okay you guys ill oh gee by Los Angeles coast you know we've done the ounce we've done an eighth and you know that I love that stuff so it's gotta be good in the vape pen so we've already got the vape in let's open these guys up on camera okay so everything you get from le Kush it's phenomenally packaged you guys can see this everything's got the best packaging it's just awesome they do everything perfect the quality is awesome when you go into the shop the shops not in the greatest spot but when you go in there they have all their cannabis cups and all the cups that they've won for growing they're the real deal man so here we go I'm pulling it out the first time for you guys nice no seal no deal that's how they do it seal in a bag they do it in full grams which is legit half grams are cool but by the time it gets down halfway it doesn't doesn't always siphon as good so let's give it a try you guys will put this one second the battery pack now I open the battery pack prior to this I hate to do that to you guys but I did that just so that I could pre-charge it a little bit so that we can demo it right here on camera cuz I don't edit my videos so I wasn't gonna edit all that you know that this is live right out the package it comes right in this little purse do this little press container dang yeah now the battery pack if you get the le push one it's 20 bucks if you get the one generic one by the other brand it's 15 bucks about five more bucks and you get the beautiful white one it says le cochon if you love le cush as much as I do that's worth the extra four bucks and once you've smoked it once it'll be worth five bucks to you too because anybody who's smoking that stuff is paying that little extra money because they love the taste of their bud if you love the taste of Bud and you're an actual connoisseur of Bud you're gonna find your way to LA Kirsch eventually because I've gone to every dispensary in Southern California all over the place I used to own a dispensary I'm lower like I know all about it and now le cush they grow the best weed around and you can go to a lot of places that say they sell oh we saw like connoisseur we know stuff it's rags the best stuff they got is a purple not saying the Purple's bad but purple ism' okay when I was a dispensary owner the prices were way cheaper for Purple's than they are for oh geez oh geez have way more THC that gets way higher way longer anybody who smoked for a long time knows that so when their best stuff is a is just a purple and then they have just some rags or just like family this is the best you go like you got to go to some place that actually has an OG if you've never had an OG before a lot of places sell OG call it oh gee but it's not really OG these guys actually grow OG go here try it once they sell it to other dispensaries you might see it in another dispensary Los Angeles try it you will know what oh jeez supposed to taste like banana OD what is this strawberry Oh strawberry OG what are you talking about do people lie and make up names like crazy mmm they ruin they've painted the name of OG but la Kosh is bringing it back when they call it an OG it's an OG okay so from what my experience I've tried everything they're the best round right now so let's give it a try shall we this is the ill og I'm the vape pen with the Los Angeles cush battery pack BAM let's do this you guys you got a piece at home or a vape pen let's do this make me cough a little more than usual but as you can see I'm - with sweat and I smoke every day all day Barlow's of three foot bongs you know and they're ill oh gee can still do it I'm getting high off of the l OG so there's a lot of stuff I can smoke it doesn't even get me high anymore for that such a high tolerance but go to Le cush and try their stuff that guarantee you'll love it alright guys I'm going to the river I'm gonna go jet skiing I'll see you guys later late", "WVnhfdr6j_o": "okay everybody this is a instructional video I recently had a problem my cartridge it wasn't burning my hollow I couldn't figure out why and I went online for an instructional video and found all these things about the plate nothing fixed it so I just there's this section right here where the smoke comes up the back of it I'll show you what to do you just take top off grab like a zip tie they're flat they're long and skinny there's a groove right there if you take you see it's going inside you push this all the way down sometimes the oil likes it get clogged up in the side of right here in the cylinder so you just start poking around in it turn on your pin and I've already done mine so I don't need to you just jam it around there a little bit it will get clogged up and you it's perfectly safe and you turn it on while you're poking it and it will start to clear up the clogged oil that'll fix your issue for you and get you burning and smoking again alright that's my video thanks bye", "Az3rNy3LDdk": "what is up world Chris dad's age 4:20 here the YouTube channel for weed lovers and cannabis patients alike today is the 11th I think the May I know I can't see very good but this is just a video of a gelada it's a lot of Kush vape tip by CG extracts so we're gonna do these I'd make these videos for the people of these 19 years or 21 years and older I should say unless they have a ballot card to possess cannabis matically and I just like to say I do these reviews in four categories looks smell taste high in effect but for the look since Melbourne I can't really do the greatest job because it's a vape so I look at it like concealing the the look of the concentrators bomb it's very clear it's the way it's supposed to be at last for a while it's not right runny it is very good so I'm gonna say it's got to be a 10 on look now on smell there's no smell at all to it unless you get right up here and smell the tip and then you can smell the citrus tree of the fruit I remember exactly what their tastes like because my friend had a sunset sherbert so it's right citrusy so I can taste that and it but I can also taste the maintenance of the cookies right so I almost think the two of them combined perfectly for a gelato taste the citrusy ain't over it very like I found the sherbert the sunset sherbert one was very citrusy and the mix with the cookies and overpowers that citrus so it's like you're just getting a little bit of citrus and the rest of the cookies so I really like this it's to honor I'm gonna have to say the smell you can smell the citrus worried away first thing is you can smell it's like almost like smelling a cleaner likes very citrusy right but you can smell the citrus right off the bat that's about all I can smell some give that stiffer smell its gelada it smells like Johanna 100% I'm gonna give the smell of 10 as well so now we're on to taste min Tina's I can taste the citrus very citrusy very loved bit of a mint taste which is the cookies it's weird how the Girl Scout cookies tips that were like minty not overpowering like menthol just a little minty so I really really really like that so I can definitely taste the mint and I can definitely taste the citrus beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful taste very said to see quite a good little view here they do gotta say he's a quite a good little view see the trees in the background I'm outside you hear the nature putting the vegetable garden in right over here I grow some watermelons and some cucumbers and some squash and some I don't know what else corned peppers or whatever we can very minty and citrusy to all the taste is nothing straight but I'm gonna give it for a gelato I'm gonna get it at an Italian taste I can't understand guys why all these are tens but like I've had a few puffs off this before I did this and I don't know here I know the first time I opened it put this tip on I imagine the first couple puffs one puff two puffs but I'm too what a third pop art Bank and so I'm gonna rate dot the high and the effect off that and how high I get right now each pot for two I just can't feel it more hands my eyes are like chain very citrusy that's the last one I'm gonna take you guys to look at me though I am fake G totally so we're getting right this high in effect on this product at 10 as well and we're gonna read it overall fact the fact that ends well so two thumbs up Chris tabs is 420 gelada by C G extracts roof you can see that symbol right there anyways wicked stuff beautiful beautiful product it's got to say all of it all of this distillate whether it's in syringes I got a little bit of bubblegum oh gee at home a little bit of bubblegum oh gee at home and that bubblegum oh gee I'm gonna do a video on it and review it not only is it bubblegum it's bubblegum oh gee that's why I liked it I never knew that bubble gum was bubble gum oh gee it's like Bruce Banner it's really Bruce Banner oh gee comatose is really comatosed oh gee bubblegum oh jeez a good stream tastes really really really a lot like hubba bubba and if I could find some polyethers likely or whatever to mix my distillate syringes into this stuff and you can put it in mix it in a little shot glass and suck it up with the syringe and squirt it in there you can get them on my site for two bucks one of my sites the clean little one CC insulin syringes I just use one of them technically I'd use one of the glass syringes I was using but I want to make sure it was cleaned out good first right I think I'd rather get a brand new syringe even one from the drugstore get a little syringe one for medicine suck it up because you can unscrew these tops right off so I don't go to buy new ones if I was just taking the gram of my bubblegum distillate and making it into a tip but I don't know where to get that stuff there's no dispensaries around here no more maybe I should ask one of my sites if they can get it trying to get him to make Terp sauce good Terp sauce I got good Terp sauce it's good get you baked but it's not the right stuff it looks like melted shatter so I'm not overly you'll see a review of that coming up yeah so yeah this is it nice little peaceful night here's some noises in the background no more at music playing this is just a straight up old school strain review no music just me and the outdoors this how I used to do it when I started I made a lot of my videos with that little table right over there set great here doing hooped I'm prominent a lot of people like I look at him they got v like like what's her name silence tippy I saw it was silent hippie it's silenced sigh lensed et hippie and she has like [ __ ] tons in her own [ __ ] her own temper box her own bongs her own pay everything and the truth that matter is I got way more videos than her I'm gonna get out from this summertime I'm gonna walk a lot with my iPhone walk a lot with my tablet I'm gonna shoot my videos outside I'm gonna probably have to do it with my phone so I can have Internet actually I could just record it on my phone's camera and then upload that to Facebook YouTube when I'm home but uh yeah it's nice to be able to sit here and man that citrusy and minty which makes a wicked it tastes just like to Otto just like the weed identical there right smack on when they make this stuff I've ever had such that sherbert that was that citrusy is this weed it is this this is sunset sherbert tips I just said regular sherbert it was probably oh somehow it got clicked five times and turned off oh so my family's home so I'm gonna end this video for now singing stay medicated stay high but most importantly stay safe ten out of ten cg extracts a lot of peace", "nEceEDWyqrg": "[Music] three and I'm back here with another cartridge of you these this one today is a really good one I've tried on before I just haven't made a video but I think I'll make a video and bring it to you guys today so today we're gonna go with the clear it's called the clear Colorado it's one of my favorite I tried the line one the other day last week and that's pretty good lab tested no Kim not of the chemicals that are bad for your lungs I mean it's pretty cool it even has a scratch-and-sniff like for the flavor it's orange pink and honestly what it does smell like it on the on the back it's just all the all the back information all the warnings all the you know legal stuff that has to go through um total cannabis is 77% cannabis and anyway let's get right into the review guys alright as I open it open it you get your cartridge right here I'm Little Colorado little colorado logo right up on there get sticker orange came real nice cartridge sisa has all the branding information out an opportunity for this book and this clear honestly this has been one of my favorite cards goes out the door for about 21 bucks not really bad and you always get pretty damn high I've always tried so many different cartridges one thing I don't like is how always like you open it and it looks like it's already almost halfway gone that's kind of stuff I don't like but oh wow and let's do a oil check the oil will just stay there unless it's in that same position for a long long time daddy looks halfway gone just like this but oh well well let's get into the review let me grab my battery once again I'm using the smoking dragon battery I think I'm gonna be using this until it goes out I don't know this is the best battery body used screw that on there see that bad boy on there cheers guys turn it on five six [Music] sorry every video I'm always coughing look man these things are good and you really do taste the flavor and then about a couple minutes ah we should go that high once I once I get that hot flashlight I start feeling high within the next five minutes but if there's anything you guys anything else you guys like to see me

words are all thrown out if there's anything else you'd like to see me do please let me know thanks have a good one best stay hi", "Tz50RBGv2xQ": "I must show you this real try some more the strawberries taste like strawberries the snozzberries taste like snozzberries what's going on everybody so I want to do this review it's just some stuff that just came into the dispensary ride from down for me this is by the the clear concentrate confidence it's called to clear this is a banana cream these are for bait cartridges they fit through your basic 510 thread so the two kinds that I've tried so far from them have been the banana cream which I pretty sure I think is I'm pretty sure is banana OG the strain but it does taste like bananas and the blue razz is is that as blue dream that tastes like raspberries and then it does have the taste so first of all let's talk about content and medicinal as you can see it's definitely been refined it's a nice clear color that you know so it's not dark and gar so it's got a nice clear color I will tell you this the first few times that I hit it again this is your typical wick cartridge system but they have fixed the cartridges a little bit better on these to where there were used to be a problem down here at the bottom with the metal which would be a they would leak and be they were really weak so they kind of sucked like as far as if you put them in your pocket or anything like that so they've kind of worked a little bit on these um I was able to put them in my pocket and my jacket and I didn't have any problems these ones the banana cream and this one the purple Rhys I can tell you this it took about let's see I would say five really really good drawers and I was like stupid medicated to just basically it to me basically just to kind of get doing what I needed to do or go around about my day that kind of stuff I went talking basically it took me just a couple drawers I used one of my other another one of my attachments which is kind of like a cigarette thing where you just pull on it you don't have to push a button or anything and I still got huge huge drawers out of this so this is a this product right here so FAR's medicinally as far as taste and everything else I would give it a big thumbs up this is pretty good now I want to tell you this these are $60 they don't specify how many milligrams was in here or any that kind of stuff as far that kind of stuff so I would assume that these are a grand they look like they're about a gram so anyway but these are sixty bucks apiece I don't know if they're nug Ron trim Ron's or the devil se but one thing too is that there's some of the other ones really you know the terpenes the flavor and them kind of burns the back of your throat well not these ones these ones it's very subtle you barely feel it and anything but so if you get a chance to try these out I would definitely highly recommend them it's the clear they have about 15 or 20 nor 20 other different flavors so if your dispensary as the opportunity to get them in you might be able to get them cheaper in your area so close to live in a prohibition area so again check them out the clear cartridges for vape pens awesome Lumpy's chicken grease amen try some of this it's absolutely dynamite", "VCVklviNWrA": "one you know I use that work spot to be in the web side Oh what's I know

going because it's pretty badass the deals I got it's herbal Wellness Center it's off of Indian School and like 43rd out I think got a couple stickers they gave us this cool phone wallet and when

vape and cartridge on to the vape and battery and begin medicated so it comes in this cool plastic you know there it is so the only thing we don't have is a PHA pen battery but it's not like your stickers in there yeah it comes with a sticker so they have to buy one get one free deals because these are normally $40 for a half gram but I'll just wait till they up but I want to get one to go get one go get two so this is battery charger that the vape batteries look like just a USB you screw it in there and that's my battery this one's got a stylus on it and no button so let's try it what's funny as I dropped this battery in the sink where I where I work at I was doing dishes I pulled this out to rip it real quick dropped it right in the sink that day's good it's good like my face is

entertainment all right you guys we just pulled up picked up the precious cargo right here check it out yes this company is called delta eight hemp they gave me this whole info sheet as well some great literature here so they're saying that this is actually hemp derived delta eight so that means they're doing some type of thing to where they're able to convert the cbd concentrate into a delta eight somehow that's pretty cool in any case today we're going to be reviewing their disposable vape i want to try out the disposable vape because i feel as though every single disposable is different this one's just a standard cart we've seen plenty of those so they have let's see it says uh ingredients hemp extract and terpenes just what i like i actually haven't smoked all day you guys i usually like to wake and bake i don't know about y'all but i thought i'd give you guys a very clear-headed start off sober go straight into the delta 8 review i don't want any other highs interfering with this here are the lab results they have the lab results on the packaging that is great let's see asan we're at a 89 delta eight and we have two other cannabinoids we have some cbda and cbd cool absolutely no thc in here apparently by taking delta eight you're giving yourself a tolerance break from delta nine i don't know if like a one day tolerance break is going to make much of a difference but we'll see how it goes what i don't like about these lab results is they don't tell you what terpenes are in there all these lab results are telling me is the base oil that they used before they added the terpenes oh well let's crack this thing open nice boom cool i like this uh little grip here that's that's kind of nice i don't know oh i guess it's right-handed i'm left-handed so um interesting interesting all right well this will take some getting used to i should have read the directions for this take one puff wow all right cool let's see how this goes cheers so the strain is apparently skywalker apparently it's a hybrid tastes good i don't know man whenever people put names of the strains on these things i always take it with a grain of salt you already know though but it is really tasty i'll give them that that's fun little logo right here that's cool all right well i do want to try to get some sunlight for you guys try to go to the beach get you guys some views try out this delta 8 a little more it's a really hot day i'm not trying to hotbox today i only took two puffs and i'm already sweating it's like i think it's like 88 degrees outside last time i checked so it's pretty hot for where i'm at does this thing even light up i don't know let's see it does not we can't do blinkers with this you guys in any case we're just gonna try to hit this for as long as possible and see if there is an end to it but before we do that let's get out of this car all right you guys we just pulled up to a wonderful spot out here it's a clear as hell day you can see all the islands out i mean like wow we gotta go out there but before we do that let's hit this let's try to get as fat of a rip as we can out of this cheers wow now some fat clouds oh my god no more of that [Music] it is so nice out i really enjoy this area because i feel as though you can just like drive along the coast and just pull over at any point and you'll find this like just really nice private walking areas i like to take advantage of the area come out here catch some vibes get myself straight on this d8 wow look at this look at this nice patch of grass right here there's a really nice spot to just post up i think this is not bad at all keeping me nice and mellow setting the vibes just right i just love listening to the waves feeling that nice ocean breeze getting away from all the people i feel as though if you go to the main beaches right now it'll be like pretty crowded because it's just so nice out in the middle of winter so for me i like to stay away from all that i hope you guys are staying warm staying safe out here in la it's pretty crazy that is nice look at that there's like a whole resort over there look at all these houses yeah which house would you guys want to live in that house that house i like that one if i had a big house like that i would have huge windows for sure just have nice big windows so you can see the ocean that would be that'll be it for sure so i want to give you guys a little rundown of what i'm trying to do with the channel scary carry through this channel just want to give you guys some solid reviews on some cannabis related products give you guys some tips and tricks to make your experience lifted that much more and also i just want to provide you guys a vibe if you want to join me smoke with me vape with me whatever it is you are more than welcome if you want to just come for the ride you're also welcome to do that too right now i'm feeling a little adventurous i kind of want to check out what's over there the architecture is crazy we definitely gotta check it out all right let's keep walking i want to go over there because it's nice and grassy over there lay out and it looks like a pretty good view so hopefully it's like a public area and i could just chill oh my god you guys there's a bunny just roaming around and a bunch of squirrels check it out this is the rabbit out here by the ocean are you doing here what what it's a freaking safari out here oh my god maybe i'll take another rip right now uh-oh i kind of scratched it up already my bad got some battle scars wow so we didn't make it to our magical spot across the way but this is a pretty cool spot nice and cozy right on this cliff right here how do people get down there i've been like looking for a way down i'm not convinced that there are safe ways or at least ways that i would take down no way none of that i might be slightly terrified of heights you guys you can see how far from the edge i am i just realized i'm like sitting at like the edge of this cliff but this cliff is like part of this nice little cove right here that's pretty cool i'd say this stuff is not bad kind of gives you a little tingle in your nose ah jeez not too slumped like with that purple punch definitely a hybrid feel hybrid type of high i think like delta eight definitely allows me to keep a clear head i think with delta 9 i feel like i can have like sometimes like short-term memory loss sometimes like maybe i'll just like get so high that my brain feels kind of foggy like i definitely feel more of like the body high effects from delta eight rather than the psychoactive effects i don't think it really impairs my judgment that much but like i'm not feeling like crazy or anything you know i'm not feeling like fearful i'm pretty chill pretty tame right now just catching some sun and looking at all these people doing their yard work at these houses that they don't live at i always wanted to get a house out here i mean if i could another thing that i really like about delta eight is it doesn't make me like lazy like delta nine i feel like when you're smoking regular thc it kind of like decreases my motivation i'll admit let me know in the comments if you relate does thc kill your motivation and if so does delta 8 also kill your motivation or does it help because for me i don't get any couch lock effects with this i feel like i could get up and go probably go on like a light jog if i was uh that type of person so let's see are my eyes red no delta eight i don't know does it get your eyes red i don't really get red eyes anymore i used to it's amazing i literally watch people drive by they'll look at the ocean and then they'll they'll pull over and stop the car and hop out for a sec this one motorcyclist did just that he just he was just like yo i gotta catch this view real quick hopped off his bike pulled up his visor stood right on the edge took it in all right time to carry on look at that that's nice i almost thought i was inhaling it from the wrong side all right let's get some food i'm hungry all right you guys so we just pulled up the fat burger i have been craving fat burger um my girlfriend's gonna hate me because she's been craving burgers too and i told her uh i'll get burgers with you but now i'm getting a burger right now so uh-oh i hope this isn't clogged there we go all right so don't take too fat of rips otherwise you might get some clogging another thing that i worry about with these the disposables especially if you're going to pack a whole gram in here is making sure the battery lasts as long as the oil napkins yes french fries look at these fat fries check this out boom this looks intense guys diligently let us dig in holy there's a lot of juices i think taking that d8 prior to this was the move that was so good but we cannot forget the prize ah are you guys i'm nice and full now that delta eight has got me on a very nice level i would say my judgment is not as impaired i don't feel myself fumbling around with what i have to say so i think those are all really good signs i'd recommend it there's not too much deviation amongst delta eight so really when you go into a certain brand a lot of it is based off of how it tastes so as long as it tastes really good and you like the high that you get based off of the terpene profile then it could be the one for you as for the skywalker very fantastic daytime high highly recommend it it's a great hybrid i'm not slumped at all there's points where it's like if i laid down i could probably fall asleep really easily but i'm not drowsy by any means i highly recommend this i have no idea when it's gonna die i hope it doesn't die soon i gotta go back home because i think there's a plumber working at my place and i feel like i should be there for that so i will catch you guys later if you want to see some more reviews and some tips and tricks for cannabis related products please be sure to hit that like and subscribe down below are you guys well i just got back home all right maybe one more for good luck it's been about two and a half hours since we started hitting this i'd say it is definitely a better daytime high than delta nine i said the opposite last time i take that back it's probably also contingent on the strain that you're using but the stuff is pretty nice i'm probably gonna listen to some music i don't know about you guys but i've been really into that new kid cudi album lately probably also listen to some juice world and get in my zone i hope that when you guys get nice and stoned you're able to jam out to some tunes too i hope you're able to have a nice sesh with me i hope you enjoyed this review if you did please be sure to leave a like comment down below subscribe to

marijuana music sports gaming in the Bergman's war so today's episode of cush house TV a very very SuperDuper quick review of some Bubba our Buddha Persian cush sugar wax Sofie has a Hummer smoke device know to be doing cam cannabis related products throughout the show so I picked this up before the Black Friday special this is 20 bucks per gram and this is some Buddha purge and cush this is done by wolf marijuana vegan supernatural 1 gram like I said $20 hi turf means general use something like that the total THC is 81 0.7% total CBDs or 0.5% terpenes at 3% the manufacture date is 9/16 a 2016 the best buy day so this here used this wax before 9/16 a 2018 so it's good for 2 years and all that other stuff processor Sol's done by produced by wolf marijuana there's all the warning signs and all that good stuff I said 20 bucks for a gram just a real quick review for you guys that have been smoking on this the small test gets a 5 out of 5 when you open this up it smells like you're sitting underneath the pine tree because it just smells like straight-up real pine needles not artificial pine or anything like that but straight-up real pine needles so the small test gets a 5 out of 5 definitely very good color I don't know if the camera is doing a justice but this stuff is a lot lighter color than the camera showing right now but it's definitely a very light brown almost looks like a tootsie roll you can kind of almost see it it is very very big I do not know what I did with my dabber but as you can see there it's definitely a very soft sugar wax it's not very sticky as a making clouds as mudflap said it's a very disappear the sappy wax but the small test was the five out of five it definitely looks great great consistency great deal on in 20 bucks for a grant and the high on this very very strong very potent two dabs of this stuff here and I was good I was completely 100% spits us though it felt like I smoked a couple bulls just two dabs with this stuff like I said this THC is 80% it was definitely mostly all wool yeah basically just all THC just bounce with you I didn't really get any CBD effects when I smoked this even though the CBD czar 20.5% the TV is 80% and we would like to say when you take a dive with this stuff here you will fill it instantly right up in your head because it just it just hits you instantly very strong very potent hit you right away and like I said only two dabs and I was good I didn't need to smoke anymore to depths it was good enough for me and this stuff here I definitely give it a five out of five just for a quick little review like I said it smells great looks great great consistency it burns amazing you know it definitely lasts a long time surprisingly especially if you put it over some cannabis or even if you put it over a cache bowl or something like that or even just dabbing it because like I said it's very strong very potent but like I said it smells good looks good and tastes good and it gets you stoned very very strong very potent enough we recommend you guys to get this oh and the flavors I should probably talk about the taste the taste of this you get exotic floral taste which I've never taste ever in my life because that's the most interesting thing about this string and why I wanted to talk about it a little bit is because the flavor and all the strains of smoke all the weed I've smoked I've never ever tasted anything like this before I've never gotten this flavor from cannabis ever for Martin from everything I've smoked it's a very strange floral taste but it's like a peas on it I cannot really describe it but it's definitely there's a sweet hash and then it has that weird it's the best way to describe is exotic floral pink it's almost like thank you I want to say almost like an incense but it's very strange I'm never to gotten this taste from any type of cannabis I've smoked in my entire life this is the first time I've ever gotten this type of taste from this cannabis relax whatever but the very interesting terpene file i guess you could say but my official review like I said smells good looks good tastes good and it's very very strong very potent 5 out of 5 is what I give this Buddha urging push I definitely recommend you guys to go get this alright get as much as bit as you possibly can see if you can find out your medic or recreational wherever you get your cannabis at see if you can get see yourself some Buddha Persian cush I promise you you will not be disappointed whatsoever this is some of the best wax I've ever smoked in my life I haven't smoked too much wax with this here is better then the orange cush wax better than the orange push wise that's where how I feel about it alright an orange pushes my favourite strain for flower and also watch this here beaten this is now my favorite strain for wax orange push so much flavor strain for flower but this year my favorite strain for wax but a 5 out of 5 for the Buddha Persian cush go check it out guys go try some I like I said you probably will have never tasted anything like this yourself like I said it's a very unique flavor I've never had a strain that tasted anything like this ever so it and it tastes amazing cute tastes amazing let's go check it out for you guys enjoyed this don't forget to thumbs up check out them all they play or check out the playlist and the string to use other strategies that we have here on fishsauce TV channel you definitely make sure that I'm great here night all on 24 hours stuff we say hi stepmother face till it's an ordinary herb piece and

than that shouldn't take that long it was just stupid all right so that's on the blueberry crush here still every time I open it always smells really good but after that it just goes away doesn't smell like anything like blueberries or anything like that and actually looks pretty good in the natural looks pretty good I should say so I'm not gonna bust up one of these now just I'm gonna bust up

notifications the reason why I'm saying that it's because I'm trying to reach my goal of 5,000 YouTube videos and only you the viewers could help me reach my goal to 10,000 subscribers so all right so what am i doing this evening well I'm going to be mixing the pink push with the blueberry push so first things first gotta have a drink and then I'm gonna have a cigarette so if you're new to my youtube channel oh that's the thing I always do I always start my videos with smoking a cigarette so yeah also I bought these this evening 20 papers for $3 it's pretty good when I first saw these I'm like I definitely have to buy those all right so first things first a cigarette Oh so once again I'm basically out here here on my youtube channel just looking for conversation and also to basically put out content that's about it really and I guess to look back on my youtube channel 10 15 years from now say holy cow that's awesome or something in that general words so don't worry I'm just smoking half of my cigarette damn I'm gonna be mixing my two crazy weeds together got the blueberry cush and then I got the pink bush which is right here pinkish blueberry Kush this one has the most THC the funny thing that that gets me this little container holds half a quarter right this container holds half a quarter so why you make it so big I don't understand the company's I understand that they're wasting so much money on like not product but basically packaging like how much is it seriously to make one of these containers like a couple bucks stove nursing I read here I think just this month alone man I spent way too much money on weed but that's just me I know for a fact I done spent a ton of money this month I think at the end of July I'm thinking about in back into saving my us money so at the end of July I'm probably gonna take like a couple hundred bucks and buy some American cash probably fifteen cents mmm-hmm sweatshops in Bangladesh that's hilarious I don't think it says where the product is well the packaging is made I don't know but there's a high demand for like constant wheat here in Canada a wonderful ever ever run out I doubt it PCs are very very plentiful province of marijuana so who's out there it doesn't show that you're watching it just shows that you comment it sweatshops in Bangladesh that's a good one that's a totally funny one remember a goes a does shortage oh yeah I remember that back in the day even remember Twinkies were out of style or out of shortage before I was I didn't get that how come it's not showing that you're viewing this video it just shows that you're commenting it's pretty neat that it doesn't show that you're there but that's okay almost done my favorite well all I could say it's good to be back making videos once again those five days huh I did take a break from making videos here on YouTube but that doesn't mean I took a break by making other videos on other social media like my Twitter account oh it looks like someone's view and now we got a viewer now all right so let's mix these two weeds together all right the first one will go down will be the blueberry Kush I know I didn't bust up any but err we got someone my tray two different kinds of weed push blueberry push all right how'd you get some of this pink push out of this corner of the tray I got lots and it's gonna be a tasty Bowl tasty tasty all right all done all done all right clean water clean ball I just did that before I started the video alright so blueberry Kush and pink cush 39 percent total THC this is gonna be fun so Cheers Yolo what just happened I have no clue for sure thank you the time warping space happened used DeLorean I didn't go back in time I didn't go into the future holy cow man that was a nice nice bomb grip more technical difficulties I don't think it's my wife I I think it's because we we just had a little thunderstorm here in Sudbury so I think the Wi-Fi is just a little bit bit about that so that means I'm going to end this video hope everyone enjoyed this evenings video make sure to give this video a thumbs up hit that notification bell and I'll probably see you in the next one you too Andrew peace out so yeah thanks for checking out my livestream and I'll probably catch you later on possibly awaken bake video so Chell for now smoke responsibly and don't do poppers I'm not going to get into that big
