the estate hot tub we're chilling at the hot tub he's still showing me the little house uh it's down underground nature's hot tubs you guys looking they don't want to be robbed he was a deafened i think you might want to ask that no sorry i left that call to go and dream already paid me a lot of money to do that and i didn't do it so quackity you listen to me crack it yeah listen to me unless you've got no more talking all right so yeah i am willing to purchase the estate the whole estate well if i purchased a house is this part of it yeah yeah you can access this okay you got a key oh pog i know i know i am gonna have to go you know actually form another key because we only have one at the moment yeah no that's fine that's fine that's fine that's fine that's something if we can get to an amber i can do it now we can go sign the deeds back to the socializing club okay yeah sounds good to me let's get out of here okay let's just remember to stock up on air in the little air pocket yep yep yep yep yep you know the drill you know the drill you're a resident okay now follow me we've kind of looked at building an hour and 20 minutes walking around slowly it's true i've been here two hours you just thought oh my god i'm so sorry i'm so sorry i apologize what should we do i got i got some ideas but they all require building uh walking around someone in my chat just said what's going on now i fell asleep that's how we're not doing anything we need to start doing all right all right we just need to start building that's that's my thing what i say we do and listen to me this might sound silly but we make it because what are people intimidated by long tunnels we make a long tunnel full of fake women and what we do is we make it amazed that they have to we're just going to make like scarecrows of women is that what you're applying okay so let me just show you like a base thing so we'll go around like this and then as they're going around as they're going around there's gonna be loads of fake women what are they gonna do intimidate women scarecrows when you go around here you go see  30 fake women then then they give us your money tommy that sounds like it would only work on you and then you you give away your money tommy here's what we're gonna do all right tommy i'm thinking well me off stream i'm gonna build a whole monument i'm gonna build a lot of little little houses and different kinds of stages you you hearing this thunder we're gonna build all kinds of stages and we're going to hold all kinds of events i'm going to build but off stream because because building them on stream is a formula for for a residence sleeper ouch i would never want a resident sleeper so this is day one we got to know the server a little bit we got to we got to know uh know the uh boundaries of the of the map you know see where it leads all right day two day two is when this  begins tommy that's when the cartel rises and that's when we and that's why we why are you getting off now yeah yes okay yeah yeah thank you it's gonna be the le the lesser scuff day yeah we'll have a plan wow you can have it we'll have a plan for this you stay here me and john manifold will go all right sick okay so you're now at the desk of the estate also known as the socializing club this is where we handle oh okay oh look there's a key look look there's a key right there there's the key oh no done it was already there oh i completely forgot i must have had a spare okay now let's head over to the anvil let's get your key formed okay i like this i'm i'm having a good time tailbone by the way it's not rent it's one time payment but if there's damage to the property you would have to cover it's just it's just good deals well that hold up hold on before listen i did not sign this contract yet no no you haven't if i deal damage to the property can you define damage because that is a little bit of a relevant relative term creeper hole okay yeah i can i can deal with that you can repair it yourself or you can pay to have it fixed for you sounds good why does a payment what is the payment three times which really isn't that much things that you know you get the entire thing yeah yeah i'm somewhat of a rich person i have like diamonds to spare as you can see i'm um i look wealthy i uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay come inside come inside so okay i'd like you to use this pen use this pen pick up the pen and i'd just like you to press it really firmly into this sponge but this is how we do let's let's do it press it in press it in okay good job good job put a little bit blood in there oh uh okay okay good good good luck good blood good blood yeah i got you i've got a little bit better just better okay and yeah here's your new here's your house key enjoy your stay on the estate in the dockside estate pog yeah okay it is a blood contract you have to keep that in mind so oh it just means that you just have to keep doing it forever you live there forever but you can't move you can move you just have to return the key oh okay so there's no cult or a demon or a soul is yours involved oh oh there are there are actually demons but we don't know they're not a big deal if i'm honest okay do you want to head back over to the estate now yeah chat let's have a talk all right yeah go on you know pogcham also please give your input in both the chats now here's the thing me and you were kind of sorry someone just said all caps no off guys no talk guess the stream's over okay bye-bye come sit down that's a joke i'm coming back what we have going on we have le mann berg we have the cartel sort of and we have turbo's law business i think we've got to get some done because we're not getting any done at the moment now what is it jack i like building things that enhance the game but i worry we haven't got enough things like that well what are you thinking around my house what if we made because everyone's been out towering us what have you made the tallest tower of the entire server because then we could go up there and we could just  stand and stare down at people and on top of my base what if we make my base good we we out tower everyone that would only how long wait how tall is all right none of the other towers are two five six we need to go to build high that's true what do we think oh this is like the fifth time this has happened yeah no that's fine i'm just i was a little bit perplexed with your last statement about demons um how come it's just what is i like to look with my eyes yeah yeah i look i look with the back of my head that is i can see you right now stop squatting you can see me i can there is you have a helmet on i know i know i'm not going to question it i'm going to question it no i'm not i'm not you can't okay see like i'm putting i'm putting my own links between the fact that you're saying that demons are there and at the same time you can look through not only a diamond sheet but also through the back of your head i'm just putting a little link there but tell you what i'm not gonna judge um okay it's a little bit of an unknown behavior to me but whatever hey that the people the things are still there what things yeah yeah yeah yeah like the police have to get down here take them out are you the police no i can't say that i'm not on twitch because people get round up i do enforce the

a game where there are 26 different cases or in this case there's chess that will have different dollar amounts in them ranging from one penny to five thousand dollars the person who goes first which is george gets to pick one case to be theirs he picks the number which all of them are labeled with a number and what you pick your case and then it stays back here in this the whole game and you have to go through unlocking different cases and after you've unlocked a certain number of cases i will give you an offer based on what cases you have left and you can either accept my offer take the deal or you can say no deal and you can continue to press your luck and see if you can get a higher number and then whatever number is the final number left you win or if you take a deal you win that amount at the very end when it's down to two cases you get to either swap your case or keep your case and then you open it and you win whatever whatever is inside unless you took a deal now george is going first so if you didn't understand that you'll you'll learn based on george going and george says he knows he'll be able to learn tommy will be coming later and i'm sure some other people too [Music] do [Music] my mom says it's just mass it's probability we can do it some probability all right george don't do anything or open a chest or anything but pick a number one two twenty six quite good at maths i feel like i'm quite good at math one of ours or or one of the ones over there you can pick any of the cases okay okay um this one 18 18. okay so you pick 18. return to your thing i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to turn off my stream real quick we're not turning off but black out my my monitor real quickly all right oh my god i'm gonna put it in the chest oh my god [Music] all right george has made has made his choice for his his chest and then now we have to go with with kind of the picking of but do not open any chest we have to go with the picking of chess so now pick four random chests okay take 21. we're going to open 21. any guesses what do you think what do you think's going to be in here it's going to be uh ten dollars and so basically what happens is this chest is now gonna be eliminated from from him being able to win it so whenever he's in here he he does not win he can't win all right so 21 that's the first that's the first one i need a pen and paper i need a pen and paper okay it was one thousand five hundred oh no no it's like one of the worst ones wait that was 500 that's not even on the list it's on the top right all right we'll go ahead and because i'm going to put a sign there so we mark that it has been it has been removed from the board you get you get another one you get three more the biggest okay you can't have them all next to each other good ones 20 okay 50 cents you've eliminated you've eliminated 50 cents okay 22 as well 22. strategizing what 2 000 what would you dream why didn't you put all the good ones right there

strategies but they can't hear our strategizer yeah you're right all right you get three more okay okay okay okay we're observing and learning ten ten right in the middle we're in the middle 400 it's

these seven steps and in a few years you'll not only have plenty of blueberries to eat fresh but also lots of extras if you want to freeze preserve give away or even sell step 1 select a sunny site even though blueberries will live in the shade they're not going to produce the fruit that you want in the shade so definitely choose a place that gets full Sun and you're gonna have lots of blueberries another suggestion is to choose a site where you have easy access to water depending on your soil type you may or may not have to water a lot once these blueberries are actually established I rarely have to water mine any more but that first year it's very important they stay irrigated so for your ease of convenience select a site where you can water them easily step 2 is to do a soil test this is the most important thing that you can do for your blueberry bushes blueberries are unique in that they have to have acidic soils so doing a soil test is an absolute must you want your pH to be between 4 & 5 ideally up to five and a half might work if you have to but 4 to 5 is where your blueberries are going to thrive I highly recommend getting a professional soil test done these are blueberries that are going to last you for years and maybe even decades so you definitely want to get started outright if your soil test shows that you have a pH above 5.5 then you want to take steps to amend your soil with something that will lower that pH I recommend elemental sulfur in the form of pelletized sulfur that's usually the easiest way to lower your pH step3 clear the land if you're not already working in an established garden bed you're going to need to clear your land we rented a tiller the first year that we did it and in the process of tilling the soil getting ready for a blueberry Bish's we added different elements to help acidify the soil even more organic matter is huge for blueberries but they really don't need a whole lot of fertilizer especially the first year so don't worry about any fertilizer organic or otherwise the first year just be sure to add plenty of organic matter in the form of compost or different amendments like that when you're preparing your soil step number four is to choose your blueberry bushes from a reputable nursery I chose a local nursery because your local hometown nurseries are going to know the type of blueberry bushes that thrive in your region I'm from the southeastern United States and so I grow rabbit eye blueberries which thrive in our hot and humid climates so make sure that you choose a source that you can trust if you order online make sure that you're getting the right variety for your region that makes all the difference and if you're in the southeast like me I recommend it TIFF blue it's the most beautiful productive and tasty blueberry well except for this pink lemonade these are have to be the tastiest blueberries I have ever eaten you're ready to plant make sure when you plant your blueberry bushes that you plant them at container depth and even more importantly look at the spacing requirements for your particular bush I planted mine probably about 4 to 5 feet apart and honestly now that they're full-grown I wish that I had more space between them I know they look small when you're beginning to plant them but when they're full-grown and many varieties are taller and wider than you are you definitely want the space to be able to walk around them and harvest them easily step number six most well blueberries have a very shallow root system so you want to be able to protect it from weeds that will compete with the roots but even more importantly when it comes to weeding which you're not going to want to do with your blueberry bushes all season using any kind of hoe can disrupt those root systems so you want to be able to mulch it very well so that they don't have to compete with the weeds and you don't have to do a whole lot of weeding in step number seven protect your blueberry bushes from wildlife rabbits deer and birds love blueberry bushes and their berries so make sure that you are ready to protect not only your bushes but also your berries from these critters that want the blueberries as much as you do personally I haven't had much of a problem with having to share my blueberries and I think one big reason is because I planted my bushes right next to my dogs run since my dog is so close to my bushes deer and rabbits don't even bother it but I'm not saying that that's a fail-safe or that it's perfect for you but so far in my seven years it's worked out really well if you notice that birds like to get your blueberries before you do you could always hang blueberry netting over your bushes but I have to be honest despite a plethora of birds you can hear them in the background and a birdhouse not ten feet away from my Bish's I never have a problem with birds I think part of it is because I have so many berries that it's not that big a deal to share you may wonder if you can grow great blueberries because maybe this is your first season but I started my blueberry bushes by very first year gardening I have no idea what I was doing I read a little bit here and there and it worked out really well thankfully I got some of the basics right and now I'm harvesting more blueberries than I can eat give away and self follow these steps and you'll be well on your way to harvesting fresh blueberries every year for years to come I'm Jill McGee he of journey with Jill net and the host of The Beginner's Garden podcast for more information on how you can grow your best blueberries see the link below and be sure to subscribe for more episodes [Music] you", "vnNEqtkg8jo": "[Music] hello everyone this is Jack in this video I'm touring a blueberry farm and I'm picking my own blueberries to eat and in this video I'll show you everything you need to know on how to grow blueberries so let's get started I'm picking the ripe as' and the sweetest blueberries at a you pig farm in Hanford California this is where I'll be learning everything on how to grow blueberries from farmer John who has been growing blueberries for past 13 years we've only recently teamed blueberries and started during grew berries commercially and there's a technique and science behind growing blueberries I'm here with Jon he's the owner of Rancho nacho grande here in Hanford California it's in central California and he grows all kinds of berries and he's going to be giving us some really good information on how to grow berries let's first cover the variety of blueberries so what kind of varieties of blueberries do you prefer and what grows best in what kind of climate yeah that's really a good question because although blueberries are native to North America they don't grow in California historically and the whole blueberry industry here is only about 14 years old and how that came about was that University of Florida Gainesville came out with some varieties that are actually called the southern hi bush varieties that have lower chilling requirements so the point is it's not too hot here it's actually not cold enough so we couldn't initiate floral floral development with the other varieties so that's what made it happen here I happen to have three of the maybe 15 southern hi bush varieties well now for I just started anyone as an experiment but in the old days they believed that you needed cross pollenization so that you couldn't do the same one in the field however today we found out that they'll fertilize adequately the flowers anyway without cross pollenization why I selected three and those that I chose were based on when they came off from the standpoint that I have an early variety an intermediate and late so I can start my season earlier than the mass-market and I can finish later I see so which one is the early between submitted vs so the earliest Friday is called the star and it's amazing it's a huge very you know quarter to half dollar sizes my intermediate one is one of the older varieties called emerald that's that one there behind you very good flavor and then my last one is called South moon and really you can't even buy that anymore commercially it's it's a small berry but it's got the best flavor I mean actually I have people that call me from all over and they say are the other South Moon's ready because we're not coming unless they are yeah so it's really interesting so in a nutshell research the variety of blueberries that grow best in your region and your climate for example if you're in California grows southern highbush variety in Florida grow rabbit eye variety and in Canada grow another and highbush variety blueberries like acidic soil and pH level between 4.5 and 5.5 so how do you go about doing that let's learn about the soil native soil pH here is a seven so it's neutral which is good for just about every crop and I guess that's one of the reasons that Central California can grow anything but blueberries on their hand require acidic soil so before I could ever plant these I had them in the soil you'd like to be it may be a 5.5 pH I got as low as 4.3 but I amended the soils and it came back up a little bit so what about what kind of amendments do you use you initially condition the soil or change the so slow peach with sulfuric acid which is a liquid and it's hazardous I'd hire a service to put it on for me after that I was using urea sulfuric acid to condition my water so that I didn't change the soil pH and then after a few years I abandoned that because my pH wasn't changing so okay there so for the home gardeners that you know the people who want to grow blueberries in there in the in a home or in the backyard what kind of amendments they can use to lower the pH right then it is the most easily obtainable would be elemental sulfur and that you can mix that into your soil and then it would over time lower the soil pH you know on a smaller scale you could even use vinegar I mean it's it's per gallon it's expensive at his input but it's practical because everybody can get it you can put vinegar in your soil and then it maybe even an easier solution is to buy premix soil and bags and then do your berries in a pot or in a raised bed and then you're using an artificial media that would have proper pH if using elemental sulfur prepare ground at least six months before planting by mixing compost and elemental sulfur start in early fall and the sulfur will break down over the peat of next month lowering the pH of the soil and the ground will be ready for planting in spring now we can move on to planting you can buy plants from a nursery that are about one to two years old plant blueberry bushes and rose plant spacing should be three feet apart and row spacing anywhere from twelve to fifteen feet apart blueberries prefer full Sun so plant blueberries in an area that receives a lot of Sun soon the blueberry plants will begin to grow the leaves act like little solar panels and absorb sunlight to create energy and then blueberries start appearing on the plants the falling year after planting however it takes four to five years for blueberries to reach their potential and produce optimal harvest next up watering so what about watering you know do blueberries like really moist well do you have to water less often more often do you have to plant them on mounds how does that work yeah right so any plant you can drowned so the way we get away from from that is to have and we have pretty sandy soils here so they drain pretty well but we plan everything on a mound or on a berm and that way we can get drainage particularly with all the rain we've had this year but on the other hand blueberries have very shallow root systems and they with direct sunlight exposure it can damage the roots so you mulch the beds with a variety of substances to preserve moisture and protect the roots too I see so basically in summer when it's hot out are you like watering every single day every day every day all right just keep them moist all right the best way to water blueberries is with drip irrigation so that you can easily control the amount of water if your soil is too heavy like heavy clay or you have drainage issues just add a lot of organic matter and compost improve drainage now it's time to learn about pruning blueberry plants so what about pruning like do you have to prune blueberry bushes or harness upward right so you don't ever have to really they just want you fine and they continue to grow but I because I'm at the point maybe you'll see here later on in other areas that I have real closure which means that bushes are growing together so I do go in and I hedge prone them on the sides and top just to keep a more compact I do see that John back here you know the blueberry bushes are like closing in on the road yeah we call that road closure and you don't see it in most crops but as I mentioned the whole industry is only 14 years old these are thirteen year old bushes and they said at that time you should find on my nine-foot spacings and this is nine-foot and you can see it's not adequate let's learn about pesticides if any we need to use on blueberries so John what about pesticides like new paths really bother with blueberries and berries most of these varieties even though they're native to North America you would you would tend to think they'd have a lot of native pressures but they don't really have much the one that is only the one is significant and blueberries is basically an after harvest occurrence and that's Western flour drips and they basically chew and suck on the fragile or tipton foliage and and then it stunts the plant it doesn't kill it it just stunts it and then you get less productivity so our answer here is to use a natural technique and these are basically a thousand per bag and there's 400 of them out here if so you can do the math but these are microscopic wasps that actually parasitized by by laying their eggs into the thrips so if we start early now we're not after harvest when the thing comes if we start early we can build populations so that it will control in the end after growing a lot of berries we also need to know how to protect blueberries and I just heard I can I'm going off you know and it's just really loud and it just really gets me every time it what what is that okay so as we're filming here you're gonna notice in the background that we employ about every bird repelling technique that there is and not one of them works so you have to do everything to have any type of control and I still lose berries to birds but with that you'll see visual deterrents like flash tape we have air inflatable scarecrows and air dancers we have al decoys Hawk decoys and so that answer your question is a propane cannon and basically it creates a sound that scares the birds away lastly let's learn how to pick the ripe s blueberries blueberries growing clusters and not all ripen at the same time all right John so how do you pick really good blueberries I'm an expert and there is a technique to it here is probably a good example so if you look at the the flower in they both look blue you know that like blueberries but when you turn them over there is a distinct difference and if you wipe off the wax you'll see that this one's got a red tint to it and this one's blue all the way to the stem center so that's a good one you actually have a good one to the right blueberries are dark blue in color do not go by size go by color gently pulling the berries and the right ones will drop right in your hands without any effort you can even use both hands to engulf the closer and gently pull on the berries to harvest the ripe as once this is the quickest method to harvest the ripe blueberries these berries are super sweet almost lost one they are amazing they taste like sugar I don't thank you very much for giving us all this good information on on growing blueberries and in some of their berries as well but blueberries is what I am really you know passionate about enjoy your blueberries great so thank you for all the good information and I really appreciate it I really hope you enjoyed this video and I hope you got a lot of good information from Jonna how to grow blueberries he's an expert in growing blueberries and I'll see you another video these berries are super sweet [Music] you", "aB9U1wTsx2c": "If I could nominate one fruit to be the national fruit of the United States, it would be - the blueberry. Sorry, Apple...Americans, we fiercely guard our independence, we cherish our freedom; we're even known to be a bit wild...Let's go with that. Because that, my friends, is\nalso the spirit of the blueberry. Even though it's native to North America - even though it's been growing here for thousands of years - it remains totally untamed until very recently. You know, my grandmother never even saw a blueberry as a young woman, and she ran a fruit stand in Brooklyn! It wasn't until the early 1940s that farmed blueberries really took off nationwide. Before that, if you wanted blueberries, you had to find and pick them in the wild...So why was it so hard to farm the blueberry? To understand that, we have to find out: Blueberries - How Does It Grow? Our investigation starts in the storied Pine Barrens of New Jersey, whose official state fruit is the blueberry! This is Whitesbog Village, the birthplace of the global blueberry business. Today, it's a National Historic Site, and home to a big annual blueberry festival. A century ago, it was the first place anywhere to commercially farm the High-bush Blueberry. Wait, wait, wait, wait, stop the  music. We're not going to whitewash history...To fully appreciate the blueberries' place in American culture, we have to go back to the huge role it played in the lives of our native people. For them, the blueberry was food; it was medicine; it was a spiritual symbol. In\nfact, they called them \"star berries\", for their perfect five pointed star at the blossom end. They were a gift from the Great Spirit. From roots to leaves, Indigenous people use every part of the blueberry bush. They brewed a tea for women in childbirth, they boiled the blueberries down into a thick cough syrup. They also dried them - so they could be eaten to the long lean winter months. The waves of European immigrants who came to this country embraced this new fruit, but none of them as deeply at the Native\nAmerican peoples. It wasn't until 1911, that blueberries got serious attention again, this time from the daughter of a cranberry farmer. She lived right here at Whitesbog - then New Jersey's largest cranberry farm. Elizabeth Coleman White, a heroine in the male-dominated stories of American agriculture. She had the vision to expand her father's cranberry operation to include blueberries in the summer. And so she invited Frederick Coville, a botanist who had just made a groundbreaking blueberry discovery. Previously, people had dug up wild blueberry bushes, and replanted them in their best soil. They nurtured them like they would any other fruit crop, only to watch them die. Coville figured out a strange but fundamental secret: blueberries demand highly acidic soil - soil that can't support most other crops. And Jersey's barren pinelands were perfect for blueberries. They grew wild everywhere. But farming is all about growing a consistent crop, so White and\nCoville set out to find the best of the wild blueberries that they could then\ncultivate and eventually crossbreed. I should probably note here that there's not just one kind of blueberry, just like there are many kinds of apples - there are blueberries with different colors, sizes, tastes, and textures. White enlisted locals to search the woods for large berries. She named each plant they choose to cultivate after the person found it. Now to grow a whole field of Rubels, White and Coville used the same cloning technique that's used today. For that, we're heading to Atlantic Blueberry Company. Once the world's largest blueberry farm, it's still the largest in New Jersey. The US - by the way - is the\nworldwide leader in cultivated blueberries. While Canada is tops for wild ones. What's the difference? Wild berries grow on low bushes found\nwild, then fertilized and cared for, like farmed ones. But we're following the story of the cultivated High Bush, which provides the lion's share of the world's\nfresh blueberries. The life of a blueberry bush begins in the nursery. Small cuttings from a chosen variety are planted and nurtured, until they're strong enough to be transferred to the field. A modest harvest can take five years, but a bush bears fruit for up to 50. Blueberries are born in the spring, after the bushes bloom with bell-shaped flowers. You can see that star shape at the tips of their petals. When the\nberries emerge, they're the lightest of green. Then they\ndeepen into reddish pink, and finally into their famous dusty blue. To extend the season, most farms grow at least three different blueberries - ones that\nripen early, midseason, and late. So if you think your blueberries taste different throughout the summer, you're right! They are not all the same variety. But there's an even deeper secret here: the best blueberries, ones with flavor that would knock your socks off, they are not sold in stores. The big farms don't grow\nthem - they're too risky. The berries are too delicate, or the bushes too sensitive. But you might find these tasty ones at Farmers' Markets. They're also available in seed catalogs - so you can grow your own. That means you can pop these little powerhouses of Vitamin C and A, plus antioxidants whenever you like. When it's time to harvest, blueberries don't make it easy. They don't all ripen at the same time on the bush, so pickers need to harvest with as much care as they do speed, taking only the ripest of berries. Just to get this thing on is difficult...okay\nI'm ready...and it's a gentle...I'm watching...a gentle roll of the thumb, that\ngets these off. Oh...uh oh...see that's not good... These guys have to have the lightest of\nhand. This sort of frosted color of the blueberry is a protective coating - it's called the \"bloom\". And if you touch them too much, they turn really dark like that, which\nmeans that the coating is off, and it means that the shelf-life of these\nberries is cut by...two or three days. (Denny): I really don't call them \"pickers\", I call them professional harvesters. There's this idea that anybody can come out here and they're going to come up with a...with a great quality berry...It's not gonna happen! (Nicole): No...you don't want to see inside my bucket...(Denny): Oh no... (Nicole): No...I know...look at them...look...can I have a sticker? (Denny): Yes...you are gonna have a sticker...we are gonna give you a sticker... (Nicole): Good job...(Denny): Good job...you know... I am NOT getting the hang of\nthis... At Atlantic, berries sold fresh are harvested by hand, but usually after two pickings, machines do a final sweep, shaking the bushes to release the remaining berries. Since they may suffer a few knocks, they go straight to the freezer to be sold as frozen berries. Meanwhile, hand picked berries hit the\nsorting line. A color scanner weeds out under ripe berries - anything that isn't blue. These may go into juice, purees, even pet food. The berries then drop onto a\npressure plate. Softer, over-ripe berries moves slower than firm one, so they are rejected from the line and often wind up as frozen. Thanks to the pioneering work done right here in New Jersey a century ago, blueberries are now farmed all over the\nworld, from New Zealand to the Netherlands. And the antioxidant craze has helped global production triple in the last decade alone. It's a huge accomplishment for a wild little American berry - or maybe it was destiny...After all, the Native Americans believe the blueberry was a divine gift - and so\ndid one of our most American of authors: \"When I see as now in climbing one of our hills, huckleberry and blueberry bushes bent to the ground with fruit, I think of\nthem as fruits fit to grow on the most Olympian or heaven pointing hills. It does\nnot occur to you at first that where such thoughts are suggested is Mount\nOlympus, and that you who taste these berries are a God.

documentary purposes only beginner buzz does not condone illegal activity and certainly does not sell anything so don't even ask seriously how's it going everyone we're back at it with another update for you guys and just a precursor for this week it's gonna be a short one we're trucking along in the first half of flower and although things look like they could be better we're actually learning a lot so come on in and we'll talk about what the plans are for the rest of this run and where we'll be heading from here every girl we like to figure out one thing and this one has been all about the ph of our medium so let's get into it [Music] all right guys so just like we said it's gonna be a quick little update for you as the girls are fully into flower at this point the hash hog by 360 grow 420 genetics has been our guinea pig as we take the last few steps to figure out our feed schedule proving just that is the blueberry hulk by thc tone genetics who is just a few weeks behind but because of what little we've learned from the hash hog she's looking a little better for now the hash hog is still trying to catch up after we found the very minimum amount of nutrients our plant needs to survive during early flower however the blueberry hulk is just basking in the information passed down by her older sister as she looks absolutely flawless outside of being stunted by the freak accident that took place in the very beginning of our season as we're just happily balancing our ppms she's got nothing but water across two feedings this week bringing her ppms down to the 1300 range honestly things are actually looking pretty good in that department so we kind of wanted to take this week to talk about our learning process you guys know what we do we put it all out there so that beginners everywhere can feel comfortable in the learning process maybe we're a little slower than most but there's a few things to take into consideration here until we locked in our tents and nutrient lineup things were always changing and most of you know that it takes time and several runs to hone in one piece of equipment let alone the amount of turnover we've had going on in our grow room for a bit that said we've quit changing things and are now working with green leaf for nutrients and mars hydro for lights we went back to the basics stripped everything from the nutrient schedule except for the essentials mega crop and bud explosion of course there was a risk that taking a few of our supplements out like recharge for instance could have a negative effect but you just can't tell what's causing what when there's so much in the pot or worse when there's multiple deficiencies or toxicities remember our first season of mega crop the awesome sauce gosh that was good weed also bred by 360 grow 420 as well but we had some pretty serious lockout back then so the next few grows behind the scenes we had worked on feeding less back then we were feeding one quarter of a teaspoon of mega crop and one quarter teaspoon of bud explosion per gallon of water from the moment the plant went into flour just to put that into perspective we now use around 1 16 a teaspoon of mega crop and 1 16 a teaspoon of bud explosion per gallon a full one quarter of what it used to be furthermore we'll feed once and then water a time or two with plain water before giving the plants newts again so we were really dumping in way too much during that first season with that in mind we cut it down to 1 8 of a teaspoon of each per gallon and then 1 16 still it's not quite right and it's probably going to be offset say something like a 16th of a teaspoon of mega crop and a quarter of a teaspoon a bud explosion maybe but we're much closer than we were when we grew the awesome sauce so we worked our nutrient schedule down so that we wouldn't reach lockout levels in the soil but when do you know you've gone too far you see when you try to learn like this there's only one way to know if it's not enough and that's when you see a deficiency so we hit you guys with the update last week would we see deficiency so that officially meant we hit our floor we now know how much is too little and we already know about how much is too much now it's just about figuring out how much is needed to tow that line the whole way through flour and that's exactly what we're trying to do with the hash hog but it seems that we've hit a little issue like catch-22 of sorts we're behind with our nutrients right the problem is the more nutrients we use the more the ph in our soil will be dragged down and out of range remember the nutrients especially the pk booster here will drag the ph of your water down not just the ones you put in the pot either we're talking the nutrients that were dried out and left over in the medium that will be rehydrated and continue to drag that ph down even more despite what the ph of your mix looked like before it went in so for now we're in the process of looking into something that will balance the ph of the soil even better yet we may have something already for those of you who remember we use a product called calzine in that season the product is similar to dolomite lime in that it will balance the ph of the moisture in your medium as well as provide a constant source of calcium to your plants this may be added to our feed schedule and may be the reason we didn't notice lockout with the awesome sauce until much later that said sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do in an effort to keep the mindset of trying to solve our problems with what limited tools we had decided to use rather than just throw more stuff into the mix there's only one option ph a little higher so that your runoff comes into range rather than start in range and have the leftover nutrients in the medium drag it down out of range honestly i don't think we'll be doing this for long if even a second time but it is what it is for now for one adding anything unnecessary to your medium is just never a good idea especially when something natural can do the same thing and beyond that it will add to your ppms without giving anything beneficial to the plant so while we considered using kelzyne we went ahead with our plan to see what would happen as you guys remember we were on the brink of a potassium deficiency and needed to get our newts up in last week's episode we left you at our feeding of 1 8 of a teaspoon of mega crop and 1 8 of a teaspoon of butter explosion which gave us a runoff ppm of about 11.50 we thought we were in range but wrong wrong remember how we're figuring out where that sweet spot is well we're already behind on nutrients we're adding more to ketchup and unfortunately the plant is requiring much more at this point meaning we're still under feeding in the meantime we're also having trouble balancing the medium so pushing it too hard can be just as bad as under feeding because either way the plant can't absorb the nutrients it needs we'd get to see that in real time as we upped the nutrients as the plant was calling for it knowing the girl needed a little more we upped the nutrient mix again hopefully this time enough to catch up so with one quarter of a teaspoon of mega crop and 3 16 of a teaspoon of bud explosion it was time to ph if you remember we said we had a little plant up the ph of our nutrient mix in order to see if we could up the runoff ppm well we figured out now was a good time to try as ever so we ph to 7.3 rather than the 6.9 to 7.0 range we like of course it wasn't too much as we didn't want to throw everything out of whack but we didn't see much improve it as it landed right in the 6.3 to 6.4 range we usually see to us it only confirmed the need for something like calzine but that's not the only thing steering us in that direction as we have a few plants running behind the scenes as well we decided to give kel's lime a shot over there in order to see what kind of effect it would have on the runoff much to our surprise the same plant whose runoff ph around the 6.1 mark last week without the kel's line ph at 6.8 with it so to us the answer seems kind of clear but you guys will have to see next week if that's the way we went as for the blueberry hulk she's looking pretty good so far even though she's only got water this week she's still getting the 1 16 of a teaspoon of both mega crop and bud explosion per gallon when it's time for food but if we learned anything from the hash hog it's about time we up the newts and start aiming for a higher runoff ppm again though we're gonna have to leave you guys hanging for that one as our footage for this week is officially over we'll be back at it again with you guys in just seven days but we want to hear from you what would you do would you add the calzine to help balance the ph oh and it has an npk of zero zero zero if that helps make the decision any easier for you of course if you guys can't wait until next week you always know you can find us on any one of our social media pages for loads of additional content or heck just come have a conversation with us we'd love to hear from you until next week keep learning keep growing catch you later guys", "8rnucywj2vk": "why is everyone saying that blueberries are the new superfoods of our diets strawberries cranberries but especially

several types of chronic diseases including cancer liver damage heart disease and diabetes we know now that blueberries are one of the best sources for antioxidants one study that came out of the middle east compared antioxidant capacities of several berries blueberries blackberries and strawberries and they found that blueberries specifically not only contained the highest amount of antioxidant capacity but also had phenols flavonoids and anthocyanins and thanks to the antioxidant capacity they have they were also found to improve eye health due to the protection they have against internal damage in our cells let's not forget that oxidation is one of the worst causes for eyesight degeneration and even organ degeneration so blueberries really make a difference they have

eating blueberries can help reduce the risk of several factors associated with cholesterol plaque buildup and heart disease a 2015 study for example found that eating blueberries daily for eight weeks in a row resulted in lower blood pressures and arterial stiffness in women another study published in the journal of nutrition from europe reported that blueberries implementation led to greater decreases in blood pressure and oxidized ldl cholesterol two major risk factors for heart disease and by the way the same thing happens or can be said about berries of this fruit family blueberries

the most impressive health benefits of blueberries is their ability to enhance brain health and memory there are now many studies suggesting that eating blueberries could improve memory and cognition in a recent 2016 study published in the european journal of nutrition consuming blueberry drinks was found to improve cognitive function in children for example another study showed that drinking wild blueberry juice daily for 12 weeks was able to improve memory of older adults so don't forget that blueberries are loaded with antioxidants they can protect our brain free us from free radical damage and promote healthy brain aging and healthy brain memory very helpful especially if you're going through memory and focus problems if you want to learn more about the best foods you can consume for memory problems or conditions of brain function check out this video right after this episode number four it prevents cancer blueberries are also excellent against cancer recent studies have published some impressive findings on their ability to protect us against several types of cancer for example in 2010 a test tube study reported that blueberry extract was able to inhibit the growth and the spread of breast cancer cells which is very impressive and listen to this an animal study from boston cancer center of the university of louisville treated rats and breast cancer using blueberry powder they found that it reduced their tumor volume by 40 percent 40 not five not ten but forty percent which is an awful lot for cancer and that's not all because blueberry juice can also be seen to reduce the growth of several types of cancer including stomach prostate intestine and liver cancer i mean with all this what more can we need it's very effective if you need a quality formula that has

mean that they're not filled with fiber and other ingredients that are useful for our digestive function for example only a small serving of blueberries can help us meet our fiber needs for an entire day this obviously helps promote regularity and healthy digestion it helps improve our constipation or any other issue we might have with our gastrointestinal tract for example when you eat fiber it travels through your gastrointestinal tract undigested and adding bulk and making you regular with your stools and even better if you pair blueberries with plenty of water physical activity also helps

coming out with a blueberry pomegranate refresher i love blueberry i love pomegranate i love pomegranate so so much it's probably one of my favorite fruits to be honest and i really love the refreshers they put out last year and so i'm excited that they're introducing a new one and yeah so this beginning march 24th duncan is launching a new blueberry pomegranate flavored dunkin refresher a bright and brilliant combination of iced green tea flavored fruit concentrate and b vitamins for those seeking moments of refresh i mean yeah that sounds about right it's actually weird today is 50 degrees and friday is supposed to be 82 so it's like yeah so i wanted to try this it's like maybe friday this will be my drink of choice since it's going to be hot out so with that being said let's go get it from duncan i am so excited to try this for you guys i love doing reviews it's like one of my favorite things to film it's just fun seeing my reaction on camera and finding new favorites so i hope that's the case for this video too well you guys so my duncan did not have it and yet they actually said they started tomorrow so i am going to try another dunkin i'm actually going to sit here and call i just called they have it so that will be our next stop um i'm really excited to try it later so i'll see you guys when we're trying it medium blueberry pomegranate dunkin refresher that'll do it thank you i got so excited when i saw it i couldn't even speak all right you guys so i'm actually in the parking lot where we started all of this this is just a good parking lot you know but um anyways so i got my drink i have not even put the straw in it smells really good like i could smell it when he handed it out the window even through my mask so that was impressive um so you know what we're going for it i'm really excited like i said i love blueberry i love pomegranate and so i'm excited oh like a grape one that would be good too like ooh grape raspberry that sounds good guys it smells so good it smells it smells like blueberry hmm wonder why maybe there's blueberry in it rachel all right this tastes like a juice i've had before like as a kid what is this oh it's like some juicy fruit stuff juicy juice it tastes like juicy juice grape juice oh wait i it as soon as i sipped it it brought back like this nostalgic flavor and i used to love juicy juices kid oh yeah that's what it tastes like to me i don't know why maybe somebody out there is like what are you talking about but that was a big part of my childhood so maybe it's just like standing out to me this is so good oh yeah they got the refresher down it's very refreshing i will be getting this again this is my favorite refresher that they have uh hands down i think it's a better consistency than the other ones for some reason like maybe they've amped their other ones up i haven't had it since it came out actually that's a lie i had it a couple times last summer but like not in a while i'll say that you know they are oh they nailed it with this this is so good if you guys are interested in the price it was three dollars even that was with tax i don't know what taxes like where you live but i'm from virginia so it's three dollars even for me and i feel like that's pretty good if you just want to go grab something real quick and um this is so so good the flavor is just so nice it's got some vitamins in it some green tea and it tastes so good if you asked me would you rather have a strawberry refresher from duncan or starbucks i'd say starbucks but if you just said a refresher in general it would be this one hands down i think it's amazing my best friend bobby was actually not the biggest duncan fan until they came out with their refreshers because she's not a big coffee drinker and i feel like this was a really really good option for duncan to add on their menu and continue to add on their menu for spring of this year and add a new flavor i absolutely love to see it maybe they'll come out with a new one for summer but if they don't i will be drinking this one so what would i rate this drink would i get it again i would give it a 10 out of 10. yes i would get it again like i said earlier in this video it's supposed to be hot here in the later part of this week so i'm like i feel a stop at duncan coming on because uh you know they say america runs on duncan but rachel runs on dunkin as well um so so yeah um i truly recommend trying this if you like blueberry stuff i recommend it even if you like refreshing grape kind of stuff grape juice if you're a grape juice fan you'd love that as weird as that is to say if you love pomegranate highly recommend and even if you're looking for something like new to try from duncan that's it right there i personally think this drink will appeal to a lot of people i think it will be a favorite the flavor is good it's you know i think it'll appeal to a lot of people too maybe you're not feeling coffee that day maybe it's a hot summer day you just don't want coffee maybe you want something refreshing instead and yeah i think this flavor is so nice they did such a good job with the flavoring so yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this video and thank you for watching another dunkin review thank you for valuing my opinion um i hope this video entertains you in some way and i sincerely hope i see you yes you in the next one bye guys", "DIDgc2lOvf4": "hi everybody vtech here at blueberry hill so march 18th to the 23rd is covered in this video we're starting and finishing up the kitchen roof which is the front part of the house it goes from the living room wall um out to the front of the rusty uh colored containers um and uh another shed roof essentially uh here pop and i are doing uh the pre-cuts for the uh the actual wall it's about roughly three feet uh tall it goes against the living room wall and the roof just extends to the front of the house from there [Music] so now we're going to build the pointy wall on the living room wall goes from the back of the kitchen to the front of the house here i'm doing a little recess to account for the proudness of the corners on the containers they're about a half inch high uh use a skill saw then a hammer and then i grind it down and then pop and i basically just did a conveyor belt building five sections of these walls uh eight foot studs uh 96 inch uh full two bys and then uh we just continued our merry way building uh these sections all of it was uh screwed to the containers uh using metal screws and metal brackets and basically that's all we did that day yeah i went pretty straightforward the weather was nice it took our time [Music] uh we still checked for a level and all that fun stuff but uh the walls should be level but nevertheless we made sure it was that you can see that two by four bouncing um so all the sections were you know sister together like that um and then the following day i came in started welding up the thread the all thread to the containers for the bottom plates surrounding the the front of the the what we're calling the kitchen uh containers so continuing with the the bottom plates for the surround of the kitchen containers here i'm doing a little recess in the two by four that goes on the back side there um about a quarter inch uh proud the corners are so i'm taking that out with the skill saw you make a bunch of slits hammered out with a hammer and then i come back with a grinder and make it nice and flat so it's just nice and nice and even with the the top of the container um that way like joint join the two bytes from one contention to the other anyway easy peasy so here you see me using the grinder to smoothen it all out it does much better job than just whacking it out with the hammer um i like it smooth just for whatever i didn't do anything extra but uh just feels better then i cut the drill of holes out for the all thread um you know some adjustment required but uh that drill bit is dead this is on its own this last life it did the entire containers um all the bottom plates um and it's not cutting all that great anymore so end of life for that drill bit but it finished the kitchen so we're good to go the pop came over on the 20th to help me do the uh the wall and uh hopefully start the rafters i'm not sure we got to it but we did the 20 wall and i did a little test for the rafters uh there's some weather rolling in at the end of the week so we were trying to get uh get it done uh this time we actually made uh sure we were making the right height of the wall so that the kickouts would just sit on top of the two by without using any kind of shims or adjustments for the most part it worked out pretty good [Music] with all these angled walls basically i do the top somewhere in the middle and on the end get the angles right and then 16 on center mark everything and then i use the the level to actually mark the top top of the uh the angled portion of the two by and then we just cut the studs accordingly pops do a little finish nailing on that because the uh toenailing some of the boards uh sometimes the nail doesn't go all the way in the head being flush against the two by so just making sure it's set yay fun time here we are starting the rafters and this is the beginning of the end here so i did a bunch of blocking pre-cut um ended up uh i measured measured measured um on my uh nice chop saw and i ended up making just a tiny bit fat so when it came time for panel work you'll see that i had to do a couple of sisters on the rafters to get the the panels to be able to nail them up to the rafters but it is what it is um i i always cut a bunch and i measure cut a bunch and i measure and i must have tweaked the uh the stop or something but nevertheless this was pretty easy work uh um all in all uh basically angie was popping the raptors up on the roof and i was just throwing the blocking in and just hammering them away so overall we had to see 30 rafters um i'm sure you guys all know now that i mean the price of lumber is just ridiculous each one of these uh they actually didn't have any um i want to buy 18 footers they didn't have them so they gave me the almost the same price for 20 footers which actually worked out because we're gonna have a little bit of a bigger overhang um where the door is of the entry door to the house and you'll see that in a little bit here i'm just showing the uh the process you're making all the pre-cut blocking and stuff everything goes pretty straightforward pretty quick here so here i'm doing a little persuasion work on some of the rafters they were twisted a little bit as with all the wood i ever buy um i have to persuade it and to be nice and flat um here i am doing you can see the double top plate and i'm nailing sideways to that also on the bottom and that lets me actually put a significant amount of support into the the rafters and i'm doing blocking in the middle you can see part of them protruding up there so as i go i'm doing center blocking and on the ends and that's plenty plenty good strength for that [Music] almost done with the rafter work here i'm doing one rafter against the wall this uh rafter i was going to return this one but it ended up being cracked pretty good uh but since it's going against the actual garage wall and i'm nailing top bottom um i decided to keep it safe save some time for me otherwise i would have gone just to return one stupid board but anyway seems like always uh you know one or two boards out of the whole group is uh dorked up a little bit um you can kind of see the longer kick out over the overhang for the door it's almost 50 inches out from the wall pretty much a little over four feet i didn't cut the rafters down 20 20 foot long i might just cut the 2x4 thickness for the extension above the entry door um and here i'm finishing up the blocking actually for the under the overhang the garage overhang so here's the next day um pop came over and he's uh working on the uh the anchors the hurricane anchors um he pounded basically every single one of them in which is awesome so i popped the hurricane hangers i was doing the last set of kick outs um that go on the right side of the kitchen um and everything was pre-cut the blocking and the overhang as well again the overhang is two feet um so these were 21 past the wall and then three three inches for the nail plate and the so almost there this is the last couple of pieces uh then uh the next bit of work is doing the the nail uh fascia part um and then jake and i there he is where we start putting that up um i ran out of the 20 footers uh which i used it on the the 16 foot size and just put the other one up which i didn't show you on video but pretty straightforward we're using clamps to make everything line up properly of course you know two bytes being uh they they move around a little bit so we've got everything clamped together screwed it i screwed some of the stuff and jake nailed it [Music] jake was doing the last bit of nailing up here he's really good at this stuff so appreciate his help a lot [Music] so here we are finishing up the kick outs on the right side of the uh the kitchen roof uh jake did a pretty good job he's uh moving around and then two bites pretty good all the rafters and he can hang over pretty good nail things up so i let him do it yay so here's jake do a little persuasion work on the two bias because they're not always straight right so level everything out just so the panels can be up there nice and tight um clamped it down nailed it and moved on to the next one good job [Music] and right after finishing up the the overhangs onto the paneling and this this went really quick we basically started top of the uh the walls uh that allows us to do whatever cuts we have to do on the bottom end and it worked out pretty good uh we used uh i bought let's see 40 the prior week which finished up the back uh roof so you might have seen that video and then these are the leftovers of that and uh we needed three more i went to buy three more the following day to finish it up you'll see that in a little bit you can see how windy it was uh that day was we were being threatened by rain um this evening when we're doing this so we want to finish up and tape as much as we could uh just to reduce the amount of water that gets on top of the red containers didn't go in the building but nevertheless we wanted to dry it in as much as possible not get everything wet so we continued to continued and uh got it all done we went burnt through the panels and then we ran short so we ended the um not making the uh the full roof but majority of it so yeah i'm doing a little bit of sistering work so the panels are eight feet long and uh i got a little bit of the blocking just a hair off but when you put 16 of them or 20 of them together um it doesn't line up to an eight foot measurement right so anyway no big deal you just drop a couple of two buys and then uh when we span the the panel's over we can nail to it easy solution that's what they do so jake did good again here he's manhandling the panels he's going to lift them up and throws them down on the roof and off we go uh the wind died down a little teeny bit it was really weird weather that day um again that night we ended up getting a really really solid storm uh tons of water and uh the roof did the trick and so after after this roof we're gonna be very dried in and we're gonna continue on the inside of the house so that's a huge step for us so it's pretty good three of us doing uh three different things pop's finishing up the hurricane hangers jake's doing the rest of the paneling um on the main part of the roof and i'm doing the uh small cuts that go underneath the overhang that i'm cutting the winner um just filling up all the holes on the the paneling and then we get that done and you'll see us taping in a minute [Music] yeah we're almost there we saw the end of the tunnel uh we did we banged this out pretty quick it only took us a few hours to do all this uh work uh but anyway uh here i'm doing even more sistering um that side required uh two two buys and uh i already mentioned when i measured the the blocking it was 14 and a half and a hair sometimes you know 16 20 whatever it adds up to an inch and uh off you go so i was also doing the uh we didn't sister up the outside nail nail trim piece so i was doing that jake was finishing up the paddling there and uh pop was watching so anyway good times [Music] so jake and bob were finishing up the the last few panels i started doing the taping on the against the kergulated metals that's always no fun this is all kind of temporary anyway we're gonna have walls of course on the uh container the metal part uh but just to dry things in um and so water then flow on the back side of the wall and underneath the roof um i started taping that section and here jake the last last panel yay i'm not sure what was looking at there but anyway that the roof is done and uh they're going to help out in a few minutes doing the rest of the taping and uh that was always fun doing the tasting underneath so this is kind of you know we're kind of kind of asian inspired the kickouts are two foot it has a really interesting um element to the house it's not just a normal normal style so it looks pretty interesting taping and taping more taping we uh just enough uh tape we probably have one or two more rolls which is uh gonna let us do some other stuff uh whatever uh they're expensive too right so um here we're doing uh all of us taping but the paneling is ridiculous in pricing just to let you know the first time we bought the panels it was 40 something dollars uh they're now 50 and the this roofing one i got them in mccoy's it was actually priced at 63 dollars i talked to guys down six dollars from there and the 40 pounds i bought last week were actually uh 53 dollars so very expensive um we're spending quite a bit of money on the paneling but uh overall you know this this material is awesome it lets us kind of not have to do the metal roof right away so that's that's this is the way we're going and uh we can let this weather out just fine that's what it's made for [Music] so after the stormy night i went and uh bought five more panels i i got to use three of them so i get to return to yay um save us you know 100 bucks right there um i was actually up there with my sauce because uh the dirt was still wet and i had it all over my shoes so i didn't want to track that around um it's all crap on my feet but anyway uh i used small pieces that were left over to fill some of the cuts um and uh got it all done here you see me doing last last piece and then uh next i'm gonna do the rest of the taping and uh the roof is complete well this portion anyway good it was an awesome feeling and uh thanks all the help from pop jake and angie um it wasn't all that difficult um a couple three days of work or whatever and uh got her done all right thanks guys uh thanks for watching guys uh this is a it's an interesting experience next bit of work is gonna be uh finally getting to the inside of the house i'm gonna do more window frames out of the two by two square tubing i'm gonna start cutting holes and uh putting them into the building uh the windows are coming in a week so uh we've got another 30 window frames to make and then uh we'll set them all in and then we'll start the two by construction anyway appreciate it talk to you later", "pWuPGafUIXs": "this is from barrowski in from sweden a rampant lime bear reviews country um the catching topped me blooming that here it goes better there we go that's better so yeah a blueberry blackcurrant and vanilla berliner so we'll crack it open and see how we go and uh just put my asset good evening so this time a beer from sweden and it's available at low cost now look at that for colour flipping wow that's some tinge um flipping that that tinge on it don't think i've ever come across anything like it um amazing looking beer so it's a blueberry black currant and vanilla berliner weissa from brewski brewing here we go that's better wow the aroma yeah yeah i was there watching i said and it went up there was 70 people on more than when simon left it was hilarious yeah i was on the computer doing the internet and i i switched over at the time and it was all there and i kept commenting i did if it had invited me on i'd have um no no yeah he seems he seems a decent fellow he does yeah no he's not missed nothing and good evening yeah yeah no notification oh well it just means for a quiet review so yeah this is a blueberry black currant and vanilla berliner rice and look at the color yeah yeah yeah [ __ ] me i was covered in paint i painted all the back garden that's all done all looking rather sparkly so the color uh it's like a [Music] i think yeah he was decent he was alright taking over i was commenting and you know laughing and it was hilarious it was let me just knock off that thing here we go so lovely on the nose beautiful aroma the vanilla the blueberry and blackcurrant are all there and they they combine so well there's like a red wine color to it river good evening uh he's good actually yeah got a bit of jaundice but uh yeah he's he's all right i think he just needs a bit of some bit of food down him i would call that purpley tinge to it beautiful smelling yeah beautiful taste not too in your face berliner survivor brewski brewing 4.7 percent i'll leave that aside that side looks nicer here we go that looks better oh yeah you can't beat these notifications can you good evening so look at that for a beer this is available at low cost now um i think there's six different beers from this company swedish brewery and it's got some right taste to it beautiful and i normally find berliner rices have got a bit of a twang to them but um like a sour amazing nose so it's it's called blabber blabbers faber i don't know i'm not i'm not obviously from sweden so yeah there's the um that's what it says on the back good evening so yeah um a very unique uh berliner i've had some of these berliners and florida rice's yeah james wouldn't be all over this and it'll probably be gutted that i've done the review and let him know i'm doing the review yeah it does look a bit dodgy doesn't it well you got a doctor's appointment bless you nothing serious hope it does it and it tastes nice as well i mean i'm not massive on the sours and these berliner ices i've had one before it was so intense i was like well i don't ever want to drink that again well this is good isn't it but this is it's just something special it's um the aroma but even um yeah the aroma that vanilla and all three elements are there and very strongly there as well you know they're not in your face there but they are certainly you can certainly easily pick them out vanilla blueberry blackcurrant wow i can't fault you there um what an amazing day today i mean it's a bit cool now it's gone down a bit but um yeah it's gone down a bit uh the temperature but absolutely amazing today although i'm i'm actually quite chilly at the moment that bloody eating one and i've got the paints off my arms as well so yeah didn't realize that it all down man i know i got splattered with something but um i didn't realize it was actually the paint that's a very different drop that pink grapefruit again yeah we need to cook some dinner it's one of them nights where you look at the cup and you think i can't be bothered what we're gonna have so i dare say we'll pick something out oh it was bloody amazing although i was off cut drinking it to be fair so good evening so my first one brewski brewing and uh the um the perler honey was something special yeah um the ho hans this too there's i think there's four of them but there's definitely two near doors you know there's one in arnold which hit far away from that daybreak hotel and there's one um in shareholders not far away anniversary and they do max from that i mean they're not cheap you know you're paying 12 quid for a burger but then again you get to a restaurant you pay 12 quid for a burger and these are proper decent burgers if it says steak burger it is steak burger and not um you know a bit of minced beef made out of mistake oh yeah mcdonald's we don't want none of that so what a color and what a taste aroma taste color you know this is one of those that absolutely ticks the boxes moving i go to restaurants i normally go for either steak or something chickeny but um i try and keep away from the weird stuff because i picked something weird that sounds nice and it ends up being crap i went to a french restaurant one night and i seen this uh meal with muscles prawns and whatnot and i'm thinking that's the box sticker percentages 4.7 percent so not too strong and um yeah this this is like a little bit of fish in a source and i'm starving afterwards absolutely bloody star but never go down that road again oh what a fabulous day to be alive the the sun today beautiful temperatures i don't know what you mean i like a bear too nice decent beard hammer oh second one of the night i had one when i got home before i started painting for sod it i'm having a beer and now the second one might try and sneak four reviews and again as you do stafford oh beautiful part of the world what would drayton manor and alton towers on the doorstep although drayton manor be interesting to see what happens there um will they reopen the rapids that's certainly not going to get rid of loads of rides and turn it into a family venue only because that will kill it i mean they've got the hotel they've got the hotel they really need to keep the the um yeah it was i was in my t-shirt at work and what was when i got home i'm a bit blooming chilly now though let's put the fire radiator on below my legs yes gangly ghouls or something um yeah another ride i like it when the lettuce is fresh as well you know so a different beer not everyone's taste i suppose in some we want to go back to america you know florida back on in the disney world in orlando but um next year i reckon the next year's the earliest is a good time to go i don't think this year you'll be going this all i've got a friend who's already bought not very sour at all it's nice it's an introduction to sours good evening yes very much an introduction to sours rather than in your face grab you by the bollocks sort of sour when you look at it you know it's uh really it looks it looks let's say it's my first one from these i've got six of these to go through or they're not burning the rice's of all sorts um but yeah very nice so purple paw with a purple tinge of head a blueberry blackberry black currants on the nose all three elements that on the taste all three elements are there it's lovely even though it's a slightly tangy tarty sort of beer oh i don't have the chilis um it is very drinkable yeah i've seen his i've seen his his reviews up on the internet it's ridiculous this is bloody you can't get them you can't be purple so that was lovely the taste was divine first bear from them um can't fault them at all and i don't think this is a collaboration brew because with some of these it tells you it's a collaboration oh yeah blueberries black currants and vanilla yeah yeah like a liquid blueberry blackcurrant with a base a dash of vanilla that's what it says on the back and yeah it's about five um probably the best berliner because it's not trying to be too in your face but it gives you perfect flavor perfect aroma a good one uh a good four point five out of five for me very good for what it is and uh yeah not too not too dear however um right that's it for this review i'm going to come back with another review um god knows what i'm going to review something back

outside of dunkin donuts and we are gonna be checking out their iced blueberry matcha latte look at the color on this thing green as green can be looks a little suspect to me i have never had matcha before so this is going to be a first for me uh first for trying this drink and i also found out that they have a matcha donut as well and i have never i i've seen this on the picture look at that that is very green as well it has an interesting and interesting scent but mostly it just smells sweet like a donut so we're gonna put that down i think the first thing i want to try is this drink now the way it comes in the app uh it comes with whole milk and if you try to switch to skim i tried to switch to skim when you hit update the app automatically switches back to whole milk so there must be something about the recipe that dunkin donuts feels whole milk is the best presentation of this so if you do have to have it with whole milk or oat milk or something like that you will want to order this through the drive through and tell them rather than go through the app just just a heads up for you okay i also added two splenda to this because i like it a little sweet so we're gonna try it now the iced blueberry matcha latte from duncan let's do this that's pretty good i can definitely taste the blueberry in here it's very strong blueberry flavor just on a another note i don't know how's the how's the lighting on this guys i bought a new light on amazon it's a it's called a wee light paid about 90 bucks for it it's adjustable i can change change the uh the the the warmth or the coolness of it i can even change the color it's pretty cool um but uh i wanted to get something for when i'm doing things at night or doing things early in the morning like this it's like uh 6 46 in the morning i wanted the light to lighting to be as good as it is when i'm here during the day so ice blueberry macho latte this is really good but uh look at that it's really good i i'm enjoying this but i would definitely buy this again it's very creamy very blueberry flavored i recommend getting it with a couple of sugars or a couple of splenda to make it nice and sweet it's very tasty now here's the the matcha donut i'm gonna give that a try as well looks like a glazed donut you can see the glazing on there looks like a glazed donut that they they dip into some kind of matcha powder so here we go it's the matcha iced doughnut let's do this pretty much tastes like a glazed doughnut with a little bit of powder um let me try another bite i gotta be honest guys i don't know if this is a gimmick um or if it's just uh to go along with the iced matcha blueberry latte but frankly because they do market they are marketing them together on the poster um frankly i don't see the value in this um it doesn't taste any different to me than a glazed doughnut it's pretty that glazing comes across pretty strong and this powder is not super thick so i don't know it's not bad it's okay uh how would i rate these um on the ice matcha donut i think i would give it a three out of five it's not my favorite thing um it's okay but as far as this iced blueberry matcha latte i like this a lot um i would definitely get this again uh even though it's not that appealing looking but it'd be good for saint patty's day if it was wasn't over already but uh it's pretty good i love blueberries so for me that blueberry flavor come across strong really good i would give this a 4.5 out of 5 on the iced blueberry matcha latte from duncan and that's pretty much it guys if you like this video give it a thumbs up hit subscribe tap the notifier bell so you know when the next video comes out and remember before you take the first bite you gotta stuff it in your pie hole you", "-kwDUhlCJ1w": "welcome to another edition of the comox valley horticultural society garden chores today we're going to be pruning some some blueberry bushes which are over by the pond and we're also going to be pruning some gooseberry bushes which are right here in front of us and today helping us out is is karen cummins who's uh spent her whole life pruning bushes i understand and he's an expert so welcome karen thanks gordon uh so this this uh gooseberry that we're going to start with is one of actually gordon and linda's older gooseberries and gordon and have been doing the right thing with um the last few years at least taking out some of the older stems and we can just look at what an older stem looks like and um maybe just to preface why we would be taking out older stems is because uh gooseberries currants um even the blueberries we're gonna see later but particularly the gooseberries and the currants bloom and produce the most luscious berries on one-year-old growth which one a two-year-old growth this is probably two-year-old stem whereas these smaller stems are one-year-old stems so the berries on those are particularly bigger and produce more luscious berries and also after about three years the the canes three years and older start to have a lot more branches these are these are second year branches so you can see they start to fill in the shrub and what happens then is that you have less light penetration into the middle of the shrub as well as older wood that doesn't produce flowers and berries quite as well so that's why we have the strategy of taking out three-year-old wood in particular and making more room for one-year-old wood so again the way to recognize older wood is to look at um the size of the canes or an indicator that because the one-year-old wood is smaller and we'll look at another bran bush in a minute and we can show you some very vigorous one-year-old canes over there but the three-year-old canes are much bigger they very much darker woodier and you can start to see there's actually on this one that might be even four years old um quite a some a bit of dead wood happening so not as vigorous uh so um i would like to take out um this one this this older cane leaving these younger canes to have more room and i'd also like to take out this this one which is also an older cane crossing over this one and i would like to take out um this one um and that will to be about 25 of this bush um and that's a good amount to take out in one season and we also this is a good time of year to be doing it right at this the end of the dormant season just before the first plush of spring so we do want to take these particular ones out right at the base um doing it about as low as we can go but not hurting any of the young ones new girls coming up um and i'd also say there's some opportunity here instead of taking this whole branch out right now i'm just gonna hedge my bets a little bit and prune it to here uh leaving this actually nice quite quite nice vigorous one-year-old branch again it's nicely going out to the outside um so i think what this does is it again it allows a lot of light to penetrate and because we've taken out some wood the shrub will really be that the shrub response will be to push new wood which is what we want so karen by only taking say 25 or a third of the older wood out and leaving some in does that protect the vitality that was even older than this one and very not vigorous you might actually cut it right back um the whole thing really low in order to get that really strong vigorous response but i you don't need to do that with this one i think by doing it this much taking that oldest would you will get good response and and by doing it this way you still get fruit if you cut everything uh next year you you won't have any fruit okay and so next year we take out the ones you've left right right and by that time uh you really do have a whole new shrub almost yeah it certainly looks much better even with those gone well the thing is is to watch it this year and do you see what what happens yeah now what about pruning white can you do that as well or is that not wrapped well if you pruned off anything off of here you'd be taking off flowers and fruit okay so um i would say no and you can see how quick that was in five less than five minutes um this bush is done so it sort of gives you the best bang for um long-term good health care and are we worried about branches that are kind of crossing over at this stage um so something like there's a little dead one here that could come off that kind of thing but actually it's really not too bad yeah it looks good it looks it looks good to me and about the only other thing that i do in the summer probably a wrong time to prune but if one of these grows out over here because i'm cutting the lawn here i'll usually cut it back yeah just just so it's easier to get by and not get hooked up on the spines because this does have horrible spines on it yeah yeah you're allowed why don't we move on to the next push now we're back at the blueberries uh we've been we've just finished the currants and the or the gooseberries and we've talked about currants and gooseberries how um we want to prune them so that we maximize the amount of sun penetration into the middle of the bush to maximize good fruiting and flowering and growth and so to choose which wood to keep we want to keep the younger wood just like we were talking about with the gooseberries and the currants and on the currents we talked about the one and two-year-old would have the best blossom and fruiting possibilities and in blueberries is very similar but blueberries can be a little older by about five but about year four they also start to get older and aren't as productive um for flowering and fruiting so that's the kind of wood we want to remove in order to keep renewing the shrub and keep sunlight in so if we look at this particular branch right here in the middle if we compare it to this branch here this particular one this particular part of this branch is only a year old that's very young but it already has some some nice buds on it and you can see the bark is quite green or red quite shiny quite new um compared to um the previous year or two so this is probably a three-year-old branch whereas this branch is probably a four-year-old branch much older wood you can see a bit of it is dying back now here and here um you can see in fact where there are still flowers to come they're very small this one in fact is barely there and so you're gonna have much less fruit on on this branch and it's probably smaller fruit and also this one is crowding in the middle so that that's one we would like to take out to encourage more new renewal growth and also um to more sun this is also a very old branch you can see it it also has quite a bit of deadwood small small flowers another just a small one um one like that small old going into the middle now when i took off there still is this nice little one going up here's an old one old one another old one in here small and over on this side see this one here is also um quite old small not very vigorous and then the same over here this one and there's another small old one here there's a little dead branch right there some of this just kind of fingertip proved it's so short and really that's probably about all i would do with this particular shrub this year um they'll probably linda gordon will probably see a quite a bit of renewal growth right in this center area for next year karen thank you that's very informative um and we're hoping to get bigger and more fruit off this than the others once we get them pruned um now i've been told that the blueberries like acid soil so i've been putting the the pine needles on them every year and compared to the rest of the soil around here isn't you know getting any acid but would this be enough to keep it acid enough for them or would i need to add some more amendments that would take it down um that's a really good point on a couple of aspects because it's really good to talk about something other than pruning because even though our focus is pruning it's not just about pruning in order to get good fruit and so the fact that you're really considering the soil is really holistic and a really good thing so the main thing about blueberries is yes they like acid soil but we generally with all our rainfall are unless you're continually putting lime on here our soil is naturally pretty acidic you're you're certainly helping with the pine needles you're not hurting but generally uh blueberries are a forest edge plant like a lot of the other berries and they all like a woodsy kind of mulch which means some leaves some bark or something up bark but wood bits of wood anything that you would see on the edge of a forest floor is how they've evolved and what they seem to do best in and they also it's really good to remember they have a very um because they're in the vaccinium species they have very shallow roots and are very drought prone so whenever you give a really good mulch like this you're really helping to keep to keep the water in and shelter those shallow roots really good thinking okay and then what about fertilizing is this the right time of year to be fertilizing once you prune them um so i think if you have mulch like this you're fertilizing because as this decays this this organic matter is feeding the biology which feeds the plants so i think what you've done here is perfect is enough for it yeah wonderful yeah well thanks the needles do keep the weeds down so that's that is another bonus yeah yeah well thank you very much karen on helping us prune our berry bushes our gooseberries and our blueberries more next year more next year thank you", "vLswsSfq9uk": "hi guys in today's video i want to show you how to make these realistic blueberry muffin cookies using a couple fun and simple techniques so you can make them at home too [Music] in order to get the realistic texture of the muffin liner on the muffin cookie i'm actually using a muffin liner to create that texture so i'm just cutting it in half and removing the bottom so it's just a strip of that pleated parchment paper then i outline and flood the bottom portion of the muffin with some brown flood consistency icing while the icing is still wet i'm going to press that parchment paper into the icing once it's dry i'm going to peel off that parchment paper really carefully you're going to want this icing to dry at least overnight it'll take a little bit longer with that parchment paper on top then i'm going to pipe in the top portion of the muffin using a stiff to piping consistency icing i want it to have a lot of dimension and so that's why i'm piping just kind of a rough blob on top and i'm using a damp brush to just smooth out the surface a little bit to make it look a little bit more uniform and flat but i still want a lot of dimension in this cookie so you can see that the bottom portion of the top of the muffin is standing a little bit higher than the back portion or the top portion of that muffin and if you think your muffin needs even more dimension and more bumps then you can keep adding more until you're happy with it but still work a little bit fast because this icing will dry quickly next i'm going to pipe in some dark blue blobs where the blueberries were in the muffin and you know if you've eaten a blueberry muffin that those blueberries kind of pop and expand once they've been baked and they look like they've kind of melted out of the cookie and once both portions of the muffin are dry i'm going to go in and start adding some painted details first i'm going to add some shadow to the crevices of that muffin liner using a dark brown or black gel food coloring diluted with a little bit of water or clear alcohol and then i'm going to go over the ridges the top points of that muffin liner and pipe on some white gel food coloring or a white gel paint really you want to make the the top points the high points look even taller by adding some highlight in the deep points look even deeper by adding some shadow once you're happy with it go in and add some spots where the blueberries are kind of poking out of the bottom of that muffin and showing through the muffin liner now it's time to paint the muffin top i'm going in with the same gel food coloring i used to actually color the icing so a light brown i'm just adding a little bit more color onto the top of the muffin and just stippling it around to create a little bit of texture but i want to add even more texture to the top of this cookie so i'm going to stipple on some light brown piping consistency icing over the top of that cookie with a round fluffy brush and this just creates the illusion of a more rough and textured surface of the muffin then i'm going to go back and add a little bit more paint on top i'm going to concentrate the darker paint on the bottom of that muffin top where it meets the muffin liner the muffin typically gets a little bit more color there where it's hitting the actual muffin tin and then i'm just going to blend it out to the top of the muffin then to bring a little bit of life back to those blueberries and make them look like they're actually just like melting out of the muffin i'm gonna paint over them with some dark blue gel food coloring just to give them a little bit more depth and dimension i even like to add some color around those blobs of blueberries to make it look like there's juice kind of flowing out of the blueberry the last step for these muffin cookies is to dust some white food coloring powder over the bottom of the muffin where that muffin liner is to make it look a little bit more like a paper surface the next cookie i want to show you how to make is this muffin tin with fresh blueberry muffins inside so the first step is to outline and flood the entire muffin tin i'm actually leaving circles where i want my muffins to be you don't have to do that you can just flood the entire thing but it just helps to have a planned out kind of map of where you want those muffins and how you want them to be spaced so i'm just outlining and flooding with a light gray flood consistency icing you'll want the icing to dry for at least four to eight hours and once it's dry you can add some texture on top by brushing on a little bit of that same gray icing and once that icing is dry which should only take a couple minutes you can add on some painted details to the muffin tin by making it look a little bit more weathered i'm adding some shadows to the inside of those holes of the muffin tin just to make them look a little bit deeper and then again some shadows around the outside i'm also going to paint on some silver edible food dust to make it look a little bit more metallic and make it look like an actual like aluminum muffin tin and the last step to sort of weathering this old muffin tin is to add some brown painted details around the actual cups of the muffin tin this would be where like grease has burnt or there have been spills over time you know how old muffin tins kind of get that weathered look so that's what i'm trying to recreate with this brown color now it's time to fill the muffin tin so first i pipe in some stiff consistency ivory icing and then top that with that stiff consistency light brown icing and then i just kind of swirl them together it's not necessary to use the two different colors i just like the idea of having a lighter inside of the muffin even though you probably won't see it now it's time to add in some blueberries so i'm going to use both dark and a lighter blue icing to create the blueberry blob so this is going to look like there's a big blob of blueberry juice that's kind of spilled out topped with an actual blueberry that's still intact and that's what the lighter blue is for my biggest advice when piping blueberries on top of these muffins is don't make them identical or symmetrical or even or anything because it's just going to look like blueberries are kind of scattered on top of these muffins and the last step for this muffin tin cookie is to add some painted detail so i've already brushed on some of that brown icing to create the texture and then i'm going to go in and paint on some brown color again focusing more of that color around the base of the cookie where it's meeting the muffin tin and then blending it all on top to create a nice golden crust on those muffins and you don't want to forget about those blueberries make sure to add a little bit more blue coloring to those blueberries to really make them pop and that's all there is to making these realistic-looking muffin cookies i hope you enjoyed this tutorial and i can't wait to see your very own muffin cookies be sure to tag me on

home [Music] so [Music] you [Music]", "Laa1KyPVjSA": "what's up guys welcome back to another stevenville food review today we stopped by duncan to try their new blueberry pomegranate refresher let's check it out all right guys here it is the blueberry pomegranate refresher from dunkin donuts so this thing starts with green tea and then it has natural fruit flavors blueberry and pomegranate hence the name blueberry pomegranate refresher we'll find out most likely because the other two that they did were very refreshing uh strawberry dragon fruit and peach passion fruit i think something like that it was it was something in that kind of category there they were refreshing this one probably will be as well blueberry is always a good flavor for me i always enjoy a good blueberry pancake or you know blueberry muffin a blueberry doughnut as well we'll get into that in just a few minutes but blueberry pomegranate refresher 2.69 for a medium 2.91 after that refresher tax let's uh let's get into this thing and find out if it's refreshing and if it's good yeah yeah that's uh that is really good that is really really good the the blueberries like right there up front you get that blueberry flavor like like right at the tip of the tongue and then the the pomegranate a little bit of tartness from that pomegranate kind of comes into the back notes this is uh this is really good also a little bit of that tartness from the green tea as well this it says it has uh vitamin b6 which i guess is what half as good as vitamin b12 i don't know that's that i don't know if that's the case or not but vitamin b6 so if you need vitamin b6 here's a good way to get it very flavorful man that's going to be a good one for the summer look at the colors it's nice and aesthetic let the sun kind of shine through it yeah this is really good it's delivering on its name blueberry pomegranate and it's refreshing so it's a good refresher it almost has like a like a kool-aid flavor but a lot more crisp a lot more cleaner a lot lighter you know kool-aid has that really heavy sugary weight down this is not that this is not that this is this and this is pretty good it's a good price too speaking of good prices check this out so to go with the blueberry pomegranate refresher i decided to get a donut and the reason i decided to get a donut is because this is the best donut you can get you know what the best kind of donut is that you can get that's out there it's a free donut this is a free donut right here so on wednesdays duncan is doing a free donut with any purchase on wednesdays through april 21st starting today all the way through april 21st you got plenty of time there's i don't know how many wednesdays somebody calculate that hit it on the calendar how many wednesdays we have a free donut every wednesday from now to april 21st in the selection process i decided to go with actually one of my very favorite donuts from duncan it's one of their original donuts when they're regular donuts uh i wanted it as it usually comes this is the blueberry cake doughnut and uh they didn't have it but then he said well hold on just a second we do have with the vanilla icing and uh and this brown sugar on top i've never had it like that before usually just uh just the blueberry cake doughnut and if you've never had that do yourself a favor and give that one a try let me grab a napkin down here i always have napkins always if you haven't tried the blueberry cake doughnut like that right there do yourself a favor and give that one a try if you like blueberry muffins blueberry pancake kind of flavor yeah you'll definitely like the blueberry cake original donut but i'm going to give it a try with this icing vanilla icing check out the blueberry that the blue color from the blueberries inside that donut right there let me go ahead and break it apart and get a really good look i mean it has that that blueberry pancake appeal all about it you see the blueberries inside there yeah this is a really really good donut all right so the the flavor of these two things together there and there they should play very well together i mean they should be like playtime buddies uh the blueberry with the blueberry in here should go really well together man that is so good that is really really good if you if you like a drink that's not overly weighed down extra weight down with uh with sugar [Music] if that's your kind of drink then uh then the refresher is really the right way to go if you don't like blueberry and you don't like pomegranate like i said they have the other two they've had those for uh almost a year now i believe so you could try one of those but as far as the blueberry pomegranate refresher one more look at the aesthetic colors there it just sounds listen it just sounds refreshing on a scale of 1 to 10 for me that's going to be an 8.1 i like it i would definitely buy it again we'll definitely buy it again i wish it came with like uh some kind of uh like an energy kick i know green tea is supposed to give a little bit of energy kick a little bit like a very very minut amount if they put a little bit of energy in these things they would sell like blueberry hotcakes yeah so this one gets the 8.1 the best donut ever a free donut don't forget wednesdays get your free donut from duncan swing through you have to order it on the app is i forgot to mention that it has to go it has to be ordered on the app to get it free so just drop your uh your your cup of coffee don't drop your cup of coffee put your cup of coffee in the the basket on the app and then pick your donut out put that in the basket as well the donut will uh be deducted price wise not the donut but the price you get you a free donut that's what i'm trying to say here what i'm trying to say is get you a free donut so so do that anyway that is my view of the blueberry pomegranate refresher with a little mix in of that blueberry doughnut because it's free and with that i say good day you", "esAKCaoxIsk": "Good morning everybody! My family loves\nblueberries. The problem is I am in Ohio and I have alkaline clay soil which\nblueberries hate. I have tried doing in-ground plantings, I've built up raised\nbeds, I've amended the soil, but our native\nsoil leeches out the acidity so quickly that my blueberries have always just\nstruggled the entire time they've been in the ground. So the compromise that I\nfound is growing them in containers because I can control that growing media\nand make it the perfect environment for blueberries. Now I'll never be able to\nopen up a blueberry farm but we can have a few blueberries sitting on the patio\nand actually pick fruit off of them which is really nice. So if you're in a\nsimilar predicament where you'd like to grow blueberries but your soil is not\noptimal for blueberry production take heart. You can grow them in pots- they do\nreally well. The key is getting your soil right. So blueberries have a low pH\nrequirement typically between 4.5 and 5.0. This is much lower than most garden\nvegetables and some fruits. They also prefer over 3% organic matter and good\ndrainage- they do not like to have wet feet. So we're just wanting to provide\nthem a mix which is going to give them all of those things. Now you can take the\neasy route which I have done before with great success. You can buy pre-mixed bags\nof potting media for acid-loving plants. So I have used, it was called the\nBlueberry Success Mix from Gardens Alive for my own blueberries and that's\nworked really well. You can pick up acid-loving potting mix for, usually\nit'll say for rhododendrons, azaleas and camellias, from your local big-box store\nor garden center, and those mixes will work really well. Often those have\nfertilizer for acid plants built right in so you just basically fill up your\ncontainer, plop in your blueberry plant and you're done. It's really quick and\nsimple. Today though I was out of my mix so I wanted to blend up something with\nwhat I had on hand. So in doing a little research on the\nbest do-it-yourself blueberry potting mixes what I came across repeatedly from\nplaces like University Extension agencies, The American Highbush Blueberry\nCouncil and several other sources, was they were all recommending a 1:1\nmix of soil and peat moss. And that will achieve the purpose- it does provide good\ndrainage and blueberries will be very happy. The only problem with that is- that\nif you can avoid using peat in your mixes you probably should.\nThe continual harvest of peat is really starting to lead to the destruction of\nvulnerable wildlife habitats and there are other options. So you could go with\nsomething like a coconut coir and just do a 1:1 mix of potting soil and\ncoconut coir, and then throw in an acid loving fertilizer and you would be good\nto go. What I am using today is this Pro Mix premium organic garden mix. I like\nthis because it has mycorrhizae in it and it does really well for containers. I've\ngot some coconut coir that I'm gonna mix in. I actually already have some mushroom\ncompost in this planter here. And mushroom compost is just the leftover\ngrowing media after the mushroom crop is harvested and typically it will contain\nthings like composted animal manure, sometimes leaf compost, it does sometimes\ncontain peat moss, but it's whatever that particular grower happens to be using to\ngrow their mushrooms on. And this is a local source I've been really happy with\nthis. I use it in my containers and in my gardens and it seems to make my plants\nreally happy, so I'm throwing some of that in and then the last thing will be\na fertilizer for acid loving plants. And same thing when you're looking for a\nfertilizer you can typically find- this is a slow-release it's a 14-7-7 and it\nis for acid loving plants so it says azaleas, camellias,\nrhododendrons any type of formulation like that your\nblueberries are gonna be happy with as well. I've also used this in the past--\nit's Gardens Alive's blueberry fertilizer again formulated for acid loving plants.\nAnd typically when you're getting an organic slow-release acid fertilizer\nthey're gonna contain things like cottonseed meal because cottonseed meal\nis low pH but a good source of nitrogen for plants. It may include things like\nfeather meal, sometimes it will include elemental sulfur. Elemental sulfur is\ncommonly used to lower pH in the soil. The thing to keep in mind with elemental\nsulfur-- it actually has to be converted by the soil bacteria into sulfuric acid\nto be effective and that can only happen in warm moist conditions during your\ntypical growing season and it can take at the minimum three months to a year. So\nwhat I saw was that recommendations for lowering your soil's pH with elemental\nsulfur said to apply it to the soil three months - up to a year ahead of\nplanting time. Now that's in a scenario where you're actually wanting to lower\nyour native soil's pH. Since we're planting in a pot and we've already got\nall of the elements in there that are going to make our blueberries happy that's\nnot so much of a concern but it is something to keep in mind anytime that\nyou might be using elemental sulfur. Holly Tone is another commonly recommended\namendment for acid loving plants and that's pretty commonly available. But\nanything formulated for acid loving, preferably a slow-release all-natural\nfertilizer, is gonna work really well. Do follow the manufacturer's instructions\nfor application though. Blueberries are very sensitive to over fertilization and\nin this case more is not better. You want to follow those instructions and you do\nnot want to over fertilize! So with that being said I'm gonna mix up my potting\nmedia and get this blueberry planted. So as I mentioned I already have some\nmushroom compost in here I, actually already have a little bit of the garden mix.\nI'm gonna add some of this coconut coir. You can see very similar texture to peat\nmoss. I'm gonna add some of my garden mix here-- it is a compressed bale so this\nwill kind of need broken up. And then I am just gonna get in here, I probably\nshould have done this in a bigger bucket but that's okay, and I am just going to\nmix all of this. You can also do this in layers which is really effective.\nSo basically think of making a giant parfait you would do a little coconut\ncoir, a little potting mix, a little fertilizer in one layer and just\ncontinue to layer that up the pot, which makes it really nice and easy to mix\nthis. And then I'm gonna use this stuff today because, like I said I've used this\nbefore. This calls for one cup per planting hole for newly planted\nblueberry shrubs. So I am just going to add a cup of this fertilizer now and mix\nthat in. And then you'll also want to make sure to reapply fertilizer each\nspring, ideally before the new growth starts leafing out to keep your\nblueberries happy. So we're gonna get this all mixed in. Next I like to\nthoroughly saturate the potting media before planting. This just seems easier\nto me because I can make sure that the media is soaked all the way through to\nthe bottom before planting. Now it's important that you keep your blueberries\nregularly watered as they grow. Blueberries have shallow root systems\nand are very sensitive to drying out so 1 to 2 inches per week consistently is a\ngood amount to aim for. Adding a mulch on the top of your planting media can also\naid in keeping the roots cool and damp. Ok now we can go ahead and get this blueberry planted. \nThis is pretty fibrous, has a fair amount of root growth in there, so I'm going to\nbreak it up pretty roughly here, rough up those roots, it'll make that plant reach\nout into the soil. And then you just want to plant these at the same level they\nwere growing in the nursery which means you want this to be level with the soil\nsurface. I'm just gonna dig in there plop this puppy right in here.\nNow pot size I'm sure is a question that you probably have. I've not grown a\nblueberry in a pot smaller than 20 gallons and I actually prefer a 50\ngallon pot for most blueberries. The smallest you can probably go is about 24 inches\nwide by 24 to 30 inches tall I would not try going any smaller than that. Now if\nyour plants are really small when you get them you can pot them up in a small\npot and then transplant them into larger pots as they grow, but you just want to\nmake sure that whatever your plant ends up in it has plenty of room for its root\nmass. And then my final step here is going to be to add a pine bark mulch. So\nthese are pine fines, it's just a finely shredded pine bark, but this works really\nwell because as I mentioned before it helps to hold moisture in the soil as\nwell as being a little bit acidic so you could even actually mix pine fines into\nyour potting soil, that works really well, but they make a great mulch. Now a few\nother bits of advice for blueberries in containers. There are different types of\nblueberries-- so there are things like Northern highbush,  Southern highbush, dwarf, wild blueberries or rabbit-eyes. So true to their name Northern and Southern highbush are going to be larger plants,  rabbit- eyes are as well, but they can get up to\nsix feet tall. Now growing them in a container is going to restrict their\ngrowth so they won't get that big, but you're definitely going to want to opt\nfor a bigger pot if you're growing one of those.\nYou can get a dwarf or half high or a wild-type blueberry, Tophat is a variety\nthat jumps to mind, they're only gonna get about this tall and they're really\nideal for smaller containers on patios because they're really suited to that\nsmaller size pot. The other thing is that while most types of blueberries are\ntechnically self pollinating, except for rabbit-eyes they do need a pollinator,\nand those are typically grown in the South, other blueberries are going to set\na higher yield of fruit with another cultivar with a similar bloom time\nnearby. So if you can do two pots with two different cultivars in them on your\npatio that's a great way to do it. One plant you will get some fruit you'll\njust get more with another one close by. Now the cultivar I have planted up today\nis called Ka-Bluey blueberry and I've actually already got\nsome of my patio that are the Ree-ka, Ray-ka, it's R-E-K-A, I'm not sure how to pronounce\nit variety, and so all of these blueberries will be sitting there\ntogether. You also want to be considerate of where you place your containers. so\nblueberries do prefer full sun, that's six to eight hours a day of sunlight. If you\nlive in a warm climate you may want to provide some protection from that strong\nlate afternoon sun because sometimes that will tend to burn up in the berry\nplants. Full sun is going to give you best flavor and best fruit production.\nConversely in cold climates you're going to want to think about winter protection.\nMost blueberries are going to be hardy to about negative 20 Fahrenheit, \nbeing above ground in a container is going to make\nthem more susceptible to freeze damage in the winter, so it's a good idea to either\nmove them to a protected spot in the winter-- so like an unheated greenhouse\nand unheated garage with some windows something like that. You can also put\nstraw bales around the base of your planter or wrap everything really\nthickly in burlap-- basically anything that's going to insulate that pot. I've\neven heard of people digging big holes, dropping that whole pot in the ground\nfor the winter because that's gonna give it similar to protection to being in\nground. I typically do the greenhouse or the straw bale method and that has\nworked well for me. And again I'm in Ohio 6a-- so if you're in\nlike zone 5, 4, 3 you're gonna want to give even more consideration to how\nyou're protecting these plants through the winters. And then the very last thing--\nnext year when you've got fruit on your plants, be aware that the birds also love\nblueberries and they will try to steal all the fruit. So you'll be admiring your\nwonderful crop set, you'll be waiting for them to turn the perfect shade of blue,\nyou'll think \"oh tomorrow's the day\" and that morning all the birds will strip\nyour plant! It happens inevitably, it's happened to\nme a million times. So if you notice that birds are eyeballing your plants you may\nwant to invest in some bird netting. Again it's easy with containers because\nyou can just drape that netting over the whole plant and pot and that's gonna\nkeep birds from most of the fruit so that you're getting some to actually\nenjoy after all your hard work. But that's it-- go get yourself some\nblueberries and big 'ol pots and plant up some blueberries today.

a well-known superfood this is not only because blueberries are nutritional an antioxidant powerhouse but can help to reduce the risk of developing a number of different diseases they can easily be added to your diet since you can consume them raw add them to healthy recipes such as oatmeal or add them to your smoothies now let's discuss some of the incredible health benefits of consuming blueberries regularly first as mentioned previously blueberries are a great source of a number of different vitamins minerals and other nutrients and compounds that can promote our overall health they are a gray source of vitamin K manganese and vitamin C as well as copper thiamine and vitamin b6 blueberries are also an excellent source of fiber and loaded with antioxidants such as flavonoids in addition to being nutrient dense blueberries are an incredible source of antioxidant compounds that can help to reduce the risk of chronic diseases and boost immunity in fact blueberries have one of the highest antioxidant levels when compared to other fruits and vegetables and are one of the best sources of antioxidants when compared to any other food choice they are rich in polyphenols antioxidants such as flavonoids and contain a unique and powerful compound known as anthocyanins not only can blueberries increase antioxidant levels in the body but they can also help to reduce damaging free radicals and oxidative stress blueberries are also incredibly heart-healthy and can help to reduce the risk of developing heart disease a number of important ways studies have found that the potent antioxidant compounds and blueberries can help to reduce levels of oxidized bad LDL cholesterol significantly as well regular consumption of blueberries has been linked with lower blood pressure levels the high levels of fiber and blueberries is also helpful in this regard surprising to some but blueberries can also help to promote and maintain proper brain function and even improved memory when consumed regularly due to the high levels of antioxidants and nutrition blueberries can help to reduce free radicals and oxidative stress which can negatively affect the overall function and health of the brain and speed up the brain's aging process they have also been found to improve cell signaling which can have a positive effect on brain function and memory lastly consuming blueberries regularly can provide benefits for those individuals with diabetes or those who are at risk of developing the disease this is largely attributed to the anthocyanins and bioactive compounds found in blueberries studies have shown that these anthocyanin compounds can have positive effects on both glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity blueberries may also be able to help lower the

(bright playful music)", "3IQqBePHL5g": "that's what rooted the best that's what's got all these fantastic roots on it is that soft new growth that's just in a prime growth stage [Music] so if you guys watch that orchard tour video you remember that i brought you out here and showed you all of our blueberries and the blueberries that were producing the biggest and most abundant of all was this toro and i showed this to you earlier but i think i want to take some cuttings off of this particular plant and i've seen some good areas that we can take cuttings off of and i want to go over that with you real quick exactly what type of material we're looking for so today is july 11th and that is early enough in the summer late enough we're past the spring that this material on this plant has grown it's started to harden off and it's ready to take soft wood cuttings from so here's what i'm talking about this particular branch right here is actually more of a sucker uh it's coming from way down below and shooting straight up and this will help for more branching for the years to come we could take some material off of this but really what i want to show you is this because people get hung up on what time of year to take the cuttings and really what's more important is the condition of the wood so if you look at this branch right here up at the top it's just kind of it's really flimsy and floppy and it's just because it's new succulent growth if you look down here it's a little more firm a little more woody and if you go down all the way near the bottom it's really tough it's hard to bend it's just really firm and so that's what we're talking about is the condition of the wood so when i'm going to take some cuttings from this but this is this is really soft up here i don't want to start with this wood i think what i'm going to do is clip that off right there at the top and then take a probably an eight inch section and i might even be able to get away with one further down although this is woodier and it's it's a little bit more lignified i guess you'd say and so it's not going to root as quickly now here's the next blueberry bush right close by that toro and i wanted to show you this because i saw some growth coming up from the ground now this is new fresh growth and you can see that is just really soft supple growth that is not good growth for cuttings i wouldn't try to use that for cutting material you definitely want something more woody all right so i've gotten a bunch of cuttings off of those plants and i'm going to whittle these down to six to eight inch sections and now before we go any further i want to show you real quick this was that long branch i was showing you where it was a little bit more soft at the tip but firm down at the end it grew real fast early on this was coming off of an older branch and it's new growth from this year but it's already started kind of hardening off a little bit more at the tip and it's nice and woody at the base this actually might be a better cutting than that one down below but it's a good idea to take different cuttings from different parts of the plant just to make sure that you're going to get something to take so these shorter cuttings i won't whittle down at all i'm just going to remove some leaves but the longer cuttings here i'm going to whittle down into a couple different sections all right so in the end here what i've got is it looks like seven different cuttings and what i've done is left two leaves at the top of each of them there they're about six to eight inches long each of them depending on how much growth they had on them to begin with and you can see those are probably i don't know the about half of pencil thickness these are some smaller ones we'll see if they root but either way i'm treating them all the same now the last thing i'm going to do before i stick these cuttings and i'll pick a bigger one so you can see that easier is we're going to go like i always do right below a node because the node the area where the nodes are have a higher concentration of undifferentiated cells that can turn into roots and then i like to cut an angle let's see if i can do this with you seeing actually i'd like to usually go about this way from the node here and just snip little end off and then that's what you end up with there and like i said there's a little node there it's right below a node and so the chances are higher that those cells will multiply and divide in that area and then start growing out roots now once i snip the ends off i want to work quickly so i'm going to snip the ends off all these and then i'm going to dip them in some water just to moisten the ends i don't want them to dry out and then we'll dip them in our rooting powder and get these guys stuck so now i've got the ends of all these guys clipped and we're going to dip them into some rooting hormone i got them kind of lightly damp in there and shook off the excess water and this is hormone three like i usually use but you can use any rooting hormone that you get at your local garden center you can find it on amazon it's not of too much importance the type that you use it gets a little more important if you start getting into hardwood some hardwood cuttings even some semi-hardwood cuttings but i just kind of dip it in there swirl it around make sure there's hormone on the ends of all of them and that's good enough so a lot of you saw the rose video that i did and you saw me dip the cutting into the rooting hormone and then push it right down into the sand and a lot of you were asking hey mike won't that just as you're pushing it down through actually i used fur bark for that one but aft as you're pushing it down through the medium won't that just push off the rooting hormone and you know i've been getting that question a ton and i was even thinking about it when i did it because i knew i was going to get that question but here's what i do this is my little tip or secret or whatever you want to call this is what i do with all my rhododendrons anything that you know i want to make sure that it's got a good coating and it's going to absorb the hormone so i'll dip them in the powder just like this and then i just set them on the bench i just lay them down for a few minutes and just let them sit there and soak up that hormone and you can see there's hormone all the way in the tips and it's just kind of moistening on that water and right down there in the base of all these guys and these plants will be able to absorb that in now here's the other thing when i push this down into the medium it's pushing the hormones on the bottom side of it it's not necessarily along the stem that this is going to root although it may it's got hormone on the bottom side so as i'm pushing it down it's just pushing that hormone against the base it's not going anywhere some of it may get rubbed off but it's inconsequential it's not the biggest deal in the world just push it down in there if you feel like you really want to you can use a dibbler and you know just a stick push it in the sand make a hole and then push it down but i like to just push these right down in there because it gives it full good direct contact with your medium so we've waited for a few minutes now and this has been able to kind of soak up and absorb some of that hormone now i'm just going to take our little cuttings and we'll start right in the center of the pot and we'll push them down about halfway and we're going to go all the way around and just kind of work our way around here trying to be careful it doesn't you don't have to be perfect about this but we're trying to be careful not to overlap too many leaves just so that the leaves get as much light as possible and there's some good airflow around them because you don't you don't want uh a whole lot of uh moisture buildup in one spot you want plenty of air to be able to get around all of those little leaves so that you have less likelihood of getting any rot so i want to make a point here now with my rhododendrons i'll put them in the medium like this and then i let them sit just like they are for an hour two hours something like that and it gives them a chance to sit in their little fur bark medium now we've got sand here but it gives them a chance to sit there and just absorb some of that hormone then i come back and water them in so they're fully settled it's been you know only a few minutes here for these guys i'm going to go ahead and water them in now i'm not too concerned about it i'm sure we're going to get these to root because it's earlier in the summer and these are soft wood cuttings and you know generally things root a lot faster and a lot easier is soft wood cuttings all right so i water them in and then one more thing people ask me all the time won't that rinse the hormone off yes it'll probably rinse a little bit of it off but these guys are stuffed down in there and it's a little cocoon in there around that sand and there's going to be hormone left around that cutting so i'm not too concerned about it and then finally the last thing we're going to do because these are soft wood cuttings i know i've preached about not covering your cuttings but those are hardwood cuttings that you're not covering the last thing we're going to do here is cover these guys and we're just going to use this one gallon water bottle i used a soda bottle before but any kind of a plastic bottle or covering will work to get these tucked up in there and then i'll just kind of push it down to the sand a little bit maybe a half a centimeter and just set it in place and that's it we're going to leave the cap on here for right now just so it builds up good amount of humidity i'm going to put this on the north side of a building because i live in the northern hemisphere if you live in australia or new zealand you'll want this on the south side of a building and you don't ever want the sun to hit this lots of overhead skylight but no direct sun or these things will cook all right so here we are again north side of my pole barn and there's absolutely no direct sun but lots of overhead skylight plenty of light for these things to root if you saw that par meter test click on the link in the description below here and you'll be able to see that we were able to find out that the north side of a building blocking complete sun but allowing for lots of overhead skylight is the perfect amount of par in order to get cuttings to root so here we are we're just going to sit here it's already starting to build up humidity we'll come back and check on these when something's happened here we go all right so it's been several months since we started these little blueberry cuttings and i thought now would be as good a time as any to see what they look like it is october 13th today let's see if we got roots now some of these didn't make it i think we started with like seven cuttings total this one you can see has died back last and i think part of the reason is because i just kept tugging on them to see if they had roots but we've got four left that are green and viable two of them still have their leaves on them which actually are the smaller branches here i've got thicker branches right here where the leaves fell off and these smaller ones i feel like when i tug on them they're really firm down in there and i feel like the smaller ones might have done better this guy just came up real easy let's start with him and see what we've got i'm gonna dig down a little bit and it's got some roots just very very small little roots here show them to you that's cutting number one and some of these guys like i said i've been tugging on a little bit a little bit impatient here let's set him down and let's go after some of these let's go after this bigger fatter one right here see what he looks like nothing on that one no roots at all on that guy all right these guys i know have roots because i've been tugging and they are firmly entrenched in that sand see what we got here i don't want to tear them up too much there's one of them nice solid roots right there check that out pretty cool nice solid roots and there's some things i'm noticing here that i want to talk about and here's the other one good solid root system nice little blueberry that's going to grow into a beautiful little blueberry plant so here they are with the roots rinsed off yeah i had to do that just to show them to you isn't that cool nice little root system on both of these little cuttings and they'll grow on into beautiful little blueberry plants now the other one rooted a little bit had a few small roots on it but i'm not that impressed so i'm not even gonna count it i think we started with like seven cuttings it might have been nine i think it was an odd number though i can't remember i'm sure when i'm editing this i'll find out for myself but you know we got two of them this was a pretty low percentage rooting percentage but what did we learn from this i know i learned something from it for instance the fatter cuttings tended to rot or not rude at all in fact here was one that rotted it was a fatter cutting this one didn't root it didn't rot but it didn't root but these little guys here look how much smaller in diameter look how much smaller diameter the other thing that you'll want to notice here is i actually snip these from further down the branch the wood was a little bit more semi firm so as the as the branch matures and grows upward you've got the top growth and you've got the middle growth and the bottom growth and as these things grow the wood matures over time this was more semi-firm wood and this was the top you can see it was the top of the branch the top growth and it was more soft wood it was just in a real high active growth state so that tells me in the future if i take these blueberry cuttings which i'm sure i will take more blueberry cuttings i'm going to be taking them from the tips of the branches mid-summer maybe even sooner maybe even earlier on in the year like early summer or late spring from soft wood cuttings because that's what rooted the best that's what's got all these fantastic roots on it is that soft new growth that's just in a prime growth stage so can you root the semi-firm wood like this yeah i've seen it done but we had a lot more success with the soft wood cuttings the the material it was more soft so i would just you know if you guys are really interested i know a lot of you out there want to see a video about rooting blueberries and there it is i think this told us a lot right here if you want to root your blueberries take the tips take about what is that five inches off the tip of your growing branches when they're just growing like crazy you don't want them to be too soft you don't want to be so soft that when you cut it they just limp right over you want them to get a little bit firmed up that's why i said maybe early summer not late spring but i would take the top of the growth and stick those guys try to get them stuck earlier on in the summer so you've got all summer to root and then if it gets too late in the season you could put them on some bottom heat but there you go the little guys rooted really really well so i don't know about you but i'm really impressed with what i learned from this one and i think i'm going to take this into the future and really do something with it i'm going to be taking the tips of these cuttings from now on i hope you guys learned something too if you did hit the like button subscribe if you want to follow along and see how these little guys turn out i'm going to put them right back in this sand and we'll just let them go dormant through the winter but anyway have a fantastic week guys and i'll see you in the next video adios [Music] you", "bxLV9z7aKdM": "[Music] i like no blue berries in my ice cream

special bushel and berry varieties for what's neat about these is that they are fantastic cropping plants that also give wonderful foliage and ornamental value kind of taking off on the old days of cottage gardening where plants were growing cheek-by-jowl close together vegetables fruits ornamental plants the whole lot well here in these varieties you've got the whole lot in one plant for as you see now in springtime they are literally covered I mean covered with masses of these beautiful little white bells that are the flowers then when they pollinate just imagine what's going to happen all of these will turn into berries so this is very quick instant crop that you're going to get berries off this year add to that the fact that they are ornamental not only do they have pretty flowers but they also have really pretty foliage and then go a lovely shade into the autumn now the one thing about these is that they are self pollinating that is that if you get one plant and put it in the garden it will carry fruit but get more than one you're going to have better cross-pollination and the more you have the better the pollination and the heavier the crops are now as you see I've got for selection set out here that were shipping in the nursery this is pink icing which has really nice young growth that comes out with a pinky shade on it and then later on carries big juicy berries then this is one of my favorites and I think probably one of the nicest ones of the whole selection it's called peach sorbet fantastic flavorful fruit but also superb foliage that's almost evergreen whole up really well and gives a really nice color into the fall then if you're looking for something that's a little shorter and more compact and very free flowering and covered literally covered with masses of fruit then look for this variety that's called jelly bean and then this is blueberry glaze that has a different kind of berry on it as you see this is smaller and darker lots of pretty little flowers on it it's an attractive plant whether you put it in as a single plant or better still plant it in a container or better still planted as a group planted as a hedge that way you're going to get better cross-pollination you're going to be and you able to enjoy it as an ornamental plant but also of course you can look forward to lots of luxuriant berries this is the bushel and berry range of homegrown blueberries that you can grow and you can pick this year", "Lj2TP5YxOyI": "so today I'm gonna walk you through how to prune your blueberry bush not only for the health and vigor of the bush but also to increase your harvest yield I'm Melissa Kay Norris the author of the made-from-scratch life handmade host of the pioneering today podcast and we raised 100% of our own meat on our homestead as well as over 50% of our fruits and vegetables and this is how we prune our blueberries to make sure that we get a harvest to take us through the entire year without buying them from the store so the first thing we're gonna need is we have got some handheld pruning shears and for the larger canes I've also got the lockers so we've got our long-handled and I just used these to prune our elderberry bushes a few days ago you always want to make sure that you are sanitizing your shears so that if there is any disease but you're not transferring that between plants so an easy way to do that is to just take some rubbing alcohol or this is isopropyl alcohol and pour that over the part that's going to come in contact with the bush when you're making your cuts [Music] now a pruning time is going to depend upon your growing climate for us I like to prune here in the Pacific Northwest and we're a gardening zone seven the end of January into February the reason for that is because you can see your fruit buds so you know where your fruit blossoms are going to be and where you're going to have your blueberries versus what is just the leaf buds and this is going to be really important when you're making your pruning cuts and your pruning decisions it's best if you can prune on a dry day so when your blueberry plant is only one or two years old the only thing that you would prune for it would be any broken or diseased branches after that as you start to get into three four five six and hopefully decade old blueberry plants then you're going to be making some more severe cuts and I'm going to walk you through each of those this plant right here is about a nine year old blueberry plant so no matter what plant it is or the size I should say age of the bush that you're going to be pruning the first thing that we're going to look for is the new growth vs. dead or diseased growth your new growth you're going to be able to visually see really easy as this bright red color and it's more supple and Viney looking your old growth is gonna be the darker gray and more woody looking wood then you're gonna have areas where you have got dead branches and you can see those because they're usually very dark brown sometimes they'll be black and they don't show any signs of new growth so the first cut that I make when I'm looking at a plant and we're getting ready to prune and this is going to be true no matter what age the plant is even your younger ones is you want to cut out any of the dead areas so whenever we're making a pruning cut when we're cutting out dead we're gonna do it at a 45 degree angle and a nice sharp and clean cut so pruning shears are essential and you want to make sure that they're nice and sharp so you're gonna come right below that dead area into the healthy tissue and at a 45 degree angle you're gonna make your cuts with that another one right here that's right above a fruiting bud and so we're gonna come right above there and we'll also get that cut off so this is obviously a dead branch so they want to remove that now when you're removing a full branch that's dead we're actually going to come and not do that 45 angle cut you're gonna come right up to this part and you're just gonna do it flush right up against it now here we've got at the tip here these are all fruiting buds so these larger swollen ones at the tip these are all going to be multiple blossoms and you're gonna get a handful of berries right here then down here these are all what your little leaf buds are so this is just going to be foilage and you can tell when we're looking at this branch as this comes out there's hardly anything on this this is older wood and it's also growing out into the Iowa where we go through and mow so I'm going to remove this because even though there is a couple of brooding buds they're very small and there's no growth or proof happening on this so we're going to remove this and again we're just gonna do this right up flush on that branch you always want to make sure you remove any of the material that you're pruning you don't want to leave the dead or diseased branches and you want to take those out and this is just on the end of here this is dead so we're gonna take that off as well as right here but we're going to leave these because they're fruiting and when they're really small like this this little suede just doesn't have anything on it you can almost just pray from off the little tiny ones when you're looking at the center of your blueberry bush the wood that is six years or older which is going to be characteristic of being a lot thicker around dark and this is my the oldest pieces they have all the moss on them after they've hit about six years of age you're gonna be able to tell that they stopped producing as well and you're gonna want to start thinning them out so some of these younger newer canes can become a part of the blueberry bush and that you always keep it bigger so this here has got a lot of dead and there's nothing coming on this so I'm going to take this actually all the way down to the ground and we're gonna cut that off really low and remove it that also is going to allow more Sun and airflow to get in here so that we don't have fungal disease setting in as much and that the berries can get ripen but they're not shaded by a lot of boilage so one of the things that I like to do is to travel up this branch and I'm going to leave part of this even though this is older wood when I'm looking at it there's a lot of blueberry blossoms on this branch and there's still a lot of good here however this older branch right here it's shooting into the middle of the plant which I want to keep that a little bit more open as I said for airflow and to help those berries to ripen and this doesn't have a ton of new growth it actually has quite a bit of old on there so I'm just going to remove this portion and take that out and then we're gonna let the rest of this grow and then next year I probably will remove this in its entirety when this one has filled in a little bit more okay so as we're looking at this plant over here you can see this is one of those older canes and as I come out and examine it there's hardly any new growth on this there's a few little fruit blossoms but there's just not a lot it's not very vigorous it's not adding much to the plant and it's taking away so I'm gonna actually when you get to these bigger canes on here we're gonna take our loppers we've got the longer handle so you just got more leverage and you want to go down really low when you're removing a cane and we're gonna just remove and cut that out and again as I'm looking at this older wood now this wood isn't quite as old it's got a little bit more red to it a little bit of moss growth on it and it's not as thick so I can tell that these are slightly newer though they are getting older but I need to evaluate them because I have a lot going on in the center here and we need to see which one is the healthiest because these are starting to rub and you don't ever want to have your canes or if you're even pruning your fruit trees when they start to rub that's a place for disease and insects to enter into the plant so we want to remove anything that is rubbing and causing friction against one another so we're gonna evaluate and see which of these are the healthiest so this has a lot out here there's hardly any fruit buds on here there's a little bit but there's not a lot of new growth and it's not going to be a lot of fruit production whereas this one I've got quite a bit of fruit buds here and a lot coming up through and here so I'm gonna remove this one out it's also an older cane and it's just less vigorous so again you're gonna get your lopper right in there at the base making sure you have the right ones selected and we're gonna take this one out actually now that I've got it removed I can kind of get in there in a little bit better angle and we're gonna go even a little bit deeper taking that out at the ground level so this one here even though this isn't a super old one you can see where we've had breakage here you want to make sure that we remove this because that is an easy entry point for disease and insects to come in I've also got some dead branches coming off of this and as we look at it even though this is a little bit newer growth it's not very vigorous there's quite a few dead spots and there's only a few fruit buds so I'm just gonna take this one all the way out and completely remove it from the blueberry plant now these are smaller but there's only one fruit bud on this entire thing and they're growing back in towards the center of the bush and because they're not showing good signs they're not very vigorous I'm gonna go ahead and take these out as well remove any dead dead wood like that even though we're going to keep this cane so we removed a couple of canes from the center but as we come into this one this is an older cane again and this growth down here doesn't really have a whole lot on it I've got some dead stuff I don't have any growth coming here this is all dead and even though I've got one healthier vigorous spot on this cane it's in the center and because it's so old it's gonna stop producing each year I'm going to get less and less fruit off of it so we're gonna come down to again you want to come down right to the base and get as low in there as you can and we're gonna remove that cave that also really opens up the center of our blueberry plant so these blossoms that are in here and these canes can come in and have good airflow I've also got down here some younger canes that are just starting and these ones already have fruit buds right here and are showing good promise so I'm going to leave this one because it's already showing fruit production and I'm going to take this one out so this can actually replace the cane that we just removed so we're going to come over on this side of the bush and here I've got some older wood and as it comes out there are some fruit blossoms on here but it's not really vigorous so what I'm going to do is this is some newer wood that does have some fruit blossoms on it but as you look at this it's got a lot of new growth but there's only one blossom on here so this cane I'm gonna take out right here at the bottom now as we look over here I've got some good fruit budding coming on over here and this is new growth I don't have a lot of new growth coming out here and this is an older cane but I know I'm gonna get quite a bit of fruit off of this section and this section so I'm going to leave this this year and just take out the part that is a little bit dead here on the end and then this one's not doing very good there's a couple fruit blossoms but there's not a lot so I'm actually just gonna cut this one all the way back and then just remove the dead parts here on the tip and on this one I don't have a lot of fruit bud and I've got some dead wood so again we're just gonna take this down to the bottom there and kind of this one has some fruit blossoms here so I'm going to leave that because I'll probably remove this pane next year but just so you can kind of see how you can plan to leave some for this year and then you'll know the following year you're gonna remove it and if you enjoyed this video on learning how to prune your blueberries make sure that you hit subscribe and hit the little bell so that you get notified when our next video comes out thanks so much we'll see you in the next one", "NeikYD7SQgM": "welcome to Hort tube my name is jim putnam this is the final video in my how to grow blueberry series we've covered this the basics of blueberries container planting blueberries how to pick blueberries how to plant them in the ground and this final episode I'm going to cover propagation I have shot another series on propagation which I'm going to link right here I would advise that you watch that because I'm going to go pretty quickly through the details of propagating blueberries I won't cover every single detail of how to propagate things in this video and that video series has over 10 videos and would be very very helpful I'm going to put this flat that I'm sticking these blueberries in into a mist house which I showed how to construct in the other series if you'll follow along with that you'll see how to do that I'm also going to stick some in a more basic little high humidity structure I'll show you that at the end of the video so let's get started so let's cover the basics of what I'm using I'm actually using a 50 sell trade these are 50 individual cells in these trays the mix I used in here is 50% peat moss and 50 percent perlite you can route pretty much anything in that I cover that in the other series if you want to take a look at that there's some additional things you could use if you want to but for these blueberries 50 percent peat 50 percent perlite is absolutely perfect kind of hard to wet the peat moss so it takes me a couple times watering this I just watered just like three times to get this thoroughly wet throughout the entire depth of the media I'm using dip and growth which is a liquid rooting hormone you could use a powder if you choose to the cuttings are being taken in early summer which is kind of the ideal time to be taking the cuttings we're using semi hardwood cuttings which I'll show you in just a second and for that we use one part dip and grow mixed with ten parts water I just cut down a little plastic cup to use as my saucer to dip the cuttings into I definitely label every tray that I ever make that labels tend to stick up too high and will block the water from getting to the flat so I'll usually cut them in half and mark them with the variety there are hundreds and hundreds of varieties of blueberries so it's important that whatever blueberry plant you're taking the cuttings off of especially if you're going to sell them obviously be keeping them for yourself it doesn't matter what variety it is if you have any intent seldom you need to know what variety it is it's very important we make sure we use a permanent marker of some kind because anything else will get washed off very easily in a very wet humid propogation setting and I'm using this pair of corona snips they're AG 4930 all of these items I have linked below in the description of this video if you're interested in taking a look at them and getting them for yourself so now I'm going to show you how I went about collecting these cuttings so here's a blueberry plant like you would purchase from any nursery you can take cuttings off blueberries planted in the ground but if you're going to I would make sure you fertilize them in the late winter early spring the year you're going to take the cuttings on them and make sure they're very vigorous if they're anemic or off-colored or have disease issues or just not thriving you'll get a very low percentage on your rooted cuttings these container plants you can see this plant was cut right about here in the late winter we're not very concerned about getting blueberries on the plants in the nursery we're trying to get nice full plants and it has grown from the time it leaped out in April until now it's probably grown 14 inches this wood that is now green right here that's kind of firm it's a little more difficult to bend it is the absolute perfect material to use for rooted cuttings this material up at the top is very soft and it will route you could actually route this material but it's kind of difficult it takes absolutely perfect conditions to do so so I usually will dispose of that material and use this piece from here down to here and we can probably get three even four cuttings off of one of these single stems so this is a pile of cuttings I had collected earlier this centerpiece in this one I'll collect that whole piece but I'm not going to use the center part of this it's an older piece of wood and we'll definitely root much slower it will route but I'd like to take consistent cuttings and I'll take this year's growth that's maybe two months old it's very important that we keep this material moist I'll usually keep a mist bottle close by and hit these occasionally if I've got them laying out on a table or just keep them in a plastic bag I showed how to collect cuttings in a plastic bag in one of the videos and the other backyard plant propagation series videos if you want to take a look at that but I'll take this piece and just come back to this main stem with the object of just disposing of this Center heavier woody stem I'll discard that this material here is actually hardened off all the way to the top I don't have any new growth on this I could actually take this one all the way to the top I'd like to have a couple of places where I'm removing leaves right on the bottom of the cutting like this the area where that is wounded is a plot spot that will play get roots from I'll keep about two leaves maybe even three I'm going to keep three leaves on this one that's an ideal cutting right there I'll put a fresh cut angled cut on the bottom of it and then if you want to you can go along the bottom and just scrape off the side of that cutting but this is an ideal piece it's a slightly rigid piece of material from this year's growth that I took off a very vigorous plant which is very important I'm going to dip that into the dip and grower for just a second tap that off a little bit and then when I put this into this tray I'm only going to stick this cutting about halfway down and pinch it in it's very tempting to slam these cuttings all the way to the bottom but the bottom area of these flats is way too wet and you will get disease issues if you do that the roots for the most part will just come out near the surface anyway and root downward so it doesn't really even do you any good to anchor them all the way to the bottom but again I'll take the bottom two leaves off of this one put an angled cut on it scrape it off let's make a little scrape like that that's where we'll get our roots coming from is where we took these leaves off and where that cut is and where that scrape is I'll stick it in there and pinch it in now there's no real difference in blueberry varieties at all so once you learn this technique doesn't really matter what variety it is again the main issue with these blueberries is the best time to do it is in the early summer as this wood is slightly hardened off you can do hardwood cuttings in the winter time it's very possible you will get a very low percentage typically I'm going to take the bottom of that one off leaving three just like that taking my little piece off the side dipping it sticking in halfway and pinching it in I'm going to go ahead and fill out the rest of this tray okay I completed this flat most all these cuttings are very consistent across the whole flat I put my label in here these are Tiffany berries so I just put TB on that tag and the month and year on there so I'll know when I stuck these cuttings I took some additional cuttings that I'm going to stick in a different technique that I'll show you that it's not quite as involved this plat right here is going to go into my mist system here's the flat of blueberries we did the other things that I've stuck in this house is a mixture of other flowering shrubs and trees and again you can follow that other backyard plant propagation series to learn how I built this little hoop house and how this irrigation works which will come on in just a second I'll show you that and then I'm going to show you our alternative technique for rooting these blueberries so there you go I've got it coming on about every seven minutes for just a few seconds here's the other technique I'm going to be using to route these blueberries I have about 10 or 12 more cuttings I'm going to put into here this is just a wooden frame it has a weed control fabric liner in it and then under this plastic container I've put the same mix into this flat as well which is the perlite and peat moss fifty-fifty after I put these cuttings in I'm going to stick them about halfway down in the soil and pinch them in exactly like I did on the flat after I put these in I'm going to put this back on it and I'm actually going to slide it under my deck I'm going to lift this cover up about once every few days and I'm just going to spray a little water under it and I'm going to seal it back up the main thing is that don't want this in the full Sun if this is in the full Sun it will definitely cook the cuttings that are under here all we're trying to do is hold some humidity in so here here our cuttings already prepped and ready to go and sticking them maybe inch down in there and pinching them in I'm giving plenty of room from the edge for this cover to not hit them when I put this cover on I'm gonna get about two rows of these blueberries and so we're going to have some in a little more sophisticated house and then some in just really a humidity chamber is all this amounts to but thank you for watching this video if you have any questions on routing blueberries or any other types of things that need to be routed fruit plants ask ask questions in the description of this video and I'll do a follow-up video later in the summer and show you how these have routed [Music]", "PjGdk7GVH0I": "hello and welcome back friends hope everyone are staying safe today we will be learning about blueberries and how we can grow blueberry plants from the locally brought blueberry fruit blueberry plants are native to North America but people are growing in various part of the world these days the demand of blueberries has been hiked over the years because they are low in calories and high in nutrition as well as they are packed with antioxidants that help in prevent aging and by removing the free radicals in the body they are loaded with a vitamin C makes the herd stronger lowers blood pressure improve eyesight keep bones strong and they are also rich in fibers that helps making the digestive system very strong this plant can be used from the leaves to root to make the horrible tree to cough syrups and many more because of their tons of benefit and the plant can live up to the lifetime of a person if taking good care it is always a great idea to have such a beneficial plant at home so let's learn how to grow this pan here see is grabbing a pack of blueberries from the market and I am taking care after that so these are perfectly ripened blueberries collect few of the well ripe blueberries and smash them like this inside the fruit they have around 15 to 20 seeds in every Cruz so clear the fruity part of that blueberry so clean it properly and you will get hold of the seeds here you can see the blue berry seeds now place the blueberry sieves in the paper towel and make it completely wet and put it in the Jeep lock back and place this back in the place where it gets warm but in direct sunlight so here after three weeks so we're gonna check now whether the seeds has grown or not so taking out the seeds generally you should check the seeds once twice in 3-4 days so that the seeds are doing good or not so here after three weeks some of the seeds have grown but not all of them the growth is pretty slow but it's okay we still get some blueberry seedlings so now taking a cup and using peat moss and perlite as a growing medium generally they like the acidic soil so you can still add some coffee grounds on it to make the soil little bit acidic or even you can add vinegar to make the soil a city so here I'm putting a few of the blueberry seedlings into this growing medium [Music] so you can see just cover it with some more of the wing medium and water it up so they are good to go for a while so similarly we are preparing another of brewery cups for a few other blueberry seedlings now putting these cups inside the Jeep lock back so that the moisture will be locked inside the ziplock bag and blueberry seedlings will grow in a good environment so now placing them in indirect sunlight where there is nice and warm place so checking after six weeks you can see that these seeds these blue berry seeds has really turned into small blueberry plants which is really cool they are literally very small but eventually they will grow into a big plant all you need to do have a little bit patience while growing these blueberry plants [Music] you can see few other plans in here checking after three months of time I even added some more blueberry seedlings that grew up in the jeep block and added in the part and you can see here these blueberry plants has grown a little bit more taller but there is no much of the significant change you can see but still they are growing and you need to be little bit careful with them so I'll keep like that and they will keep going during the harsh winter you can bring them inside the room or place at the window where there is good sunlight or nice and warm [Music] you can see a three-year-old blueberry bush growing into this container it's going super fine over here the plant is really healthy the leaves are really growing well it's a mid summer time and but the best growth in the container if you want to keep into the container whisky barrel would be an ideal container to grow this one because of its shape and size so we have used peat moss over here you can add pine bark to make the growing medium more suitable for this blueberries during the winter they go dormancy all the leaves fall out and they just remain woody and you can prune at that time as well you can see over here a six year old blueberry bush grown into the ground and you it has a lot of blueberries in it so generally blueberries are divided into two categories low boost and high boost you can see this is the low boost which grows up to 3 feet tall whereas there are high boosts which grows up to 12 to 13 feet so five blueberries can be transplanted from their cuttings and you can have number of cutting and grow number of blueberry plant one main thing is that generally blueberry plant doesn't get any disease but you should always be careful about the root rot because they need very low amount of water to grow properly so if you water them too much a root rot might occur and you plant might I'd so this is how you can grow blueberry plant at home if you have any worries please comment below I'll be more than happy to answer your comments and if you like my video please do share it give it a thumbs up and please don't forget to subscribe for more interesting

there's the Mexico Lam house anyways list goes on but today we get to do the blueberry video yeah so we've got like 15 16 different strains of blueberries I don't even remember what we've had because this is like a year or two or something so following this up we're gonna do like a little blueberry taste test but right now we're just gonna kind of figure out what types we've got here so I'm gonna fill them and Austin's gonna call off the types that we've got okay you get to read the labels so let's go okay okay let's just start from one end to the other here where's the label on this one [Applause] sure sharp blue yeah sure blue okay let's put that one back in had those before those aren't bad and this one I know it's got the flag in it so this one's Patriot I thought that was too funny how to do that and this one is some of these have to let me see that Chandler Chandler right and then this one is legacy over here so there's have q so we've got two there so that's what four total so far okay blue crop okay what's that one over there that's Duke I can't see it from here this one's a blue ray oh yeah you like blue Ray's those where you like your favorite last year hey no eating the merchandise these ones are the one'll oh yeah we have a couple of oatmeal most of these we put three bushes three small bushes in each planter pot so that's oh yeah this is my O'Neill right I like O'Neill's those are good and this is the rare kind we ordered this one yeah completely this do taste good so we actually just got back from our Alaskan cruise so we had a neighbor watching when they watered a lot of these so we have a lot of blueberries it's a pickle right now but these are still pretty young plants so they're not even producing super-heavy yet next year we should have like insane amounts and we've got 1 1 avocado cage to build yet that's for the holiday and this one is what's this kind in there somewhere oh there it is this one's an emerald Oh emerald oh yeah how to smuggle those on to okay what's this guy the Jubilee Jubilee okay three Jubilees and then here we've got is that all three of them or any other tag okay and then what do we got over here misty misty and I think this is an O'Neill on the end I think we have two two O'Neill's that's a O'Neill down there somewhere yeah I can see it says O'Neill okay these are a little rosemary for for our B pollinators once we get get cranking along that brings in the bees okay so we've got one two three four five six that's the second O'Neill so we don't count that seven eight nine yeah they're all good ten eleven this is the split one twelve thirteen we've got 13 13 kinds of blueberries yeah oh yeah there's your banana pepper Cajun picked it out yeah you break me figure out what to cook with that don't don't Togo that's gonna fall off be careful until you're ready to use it [Music] I'm not eating those jalapenos get too hot for me I'm too much of a white person and then here's our lime tree oh wait no I'm sorry this is our Myers lemon tree and get confused we have lime tree to looks exactly the same till they start turning yellow oh you killed the banana pepper murderer don't even that I know I'm able to make that with dinner sometime okay so we got 13 kinds of blueberries man why do we stop at 13 that's not a bad that's not a good number oh well I thought we had like 15 but we're gonna do a taste test so that'll be coming next okay we got Austin who fired up his banana pepper show it off to the camera this is a blueberry video why are you eating a banana pepper pretty hot actually my scale one to ten try a little bit nice taste like a bell pepper ooh wait for it yep that's what you normally cook something with these you don't eat them just by themselves hmm oh well it's your pepper do what you want okay these are a bonus these are uh I've already ate like five blackberry you're supposed to wash these right before you eat them you know oh boy all five at once I will tell you these are our Triple Crown blackberries they're pretty good too this is a medium-sized one some of these things are huge hmm those are good you'll never find blackberries that are that good at the store okay so now we've done a little bit of our blueberry video ad for the doghouse video yep okay that's our next project out there the doghouse project troublemaker Oh a cute dog you like puppies just sleeping on the egg are you ready to have a house blitz huh ready for your house I'll get you a house okay that's good don't worry that's not where she has somewhere to sleep right now she goes inside at night anyways yeah okay we're gonna get it going on our puppy dog house next", "Ov6sE7Lfy9Y": "all right welcome everyone to my garden channel calm if you're watching the video on our YouTube channel and you're new to the channel make sure you do subscribe we've got a lot of growing videos there and we try to upload at least one video a week but today we're going to talk about growing blueberries from seeds I'll show you an easy way to grow your blueberries and just slice it open here you're gonna see how small these seeds are they're very very small if you guys have watched the strawberry video this is gonna be a similar video to that just a little bit different you can see how just tiny they those seeds are the seeds are actually smaller than a strawberry seed so we're dealing with some very very fine seeds here let's get a close-up try to see there you go you can see how small they are there's some seeds in there yeah they actually will sprout most people keep their blueberries in the fridge so I keep them in the fridge they're staying chilled and it causes them to go through what's called cold stratification so once you plant these into a nice warm spot they're gonna start sprouting within a couple days to a couple weeks so again when you use a sharp knife you're just gonna cut that blueberry right and 1/2 and here we go here's some more seeds for you very fine very small the darker red color a little bit bigger the seed the the more ready they are those those yellow ones though they will solve the previous blueberry they'll be just fine they'll be able to grow and sprout but we're gonna we're gonna cut about four of these open here slice them open just kind of give you guys an idea of what what we're dealing with here how small the seeds are I like again to use if you guys watch the strawberry video but the blueberry seeds they are so small and I like to use the cups you see the cups on the grow bench there what that does is allows us to water without losing any seeds or moving around too much so it gives us a little bit more control with the little cups I do put them in pots as well and this is a good time to do it it's a winter for us or we're ready for a spring we're gonna start sprouting some blueberries and strawberries and that was a really good time to do that so let's let's grab a couple cups let's get some soil in those cups you want to get the soil near the top of the cup all right now we're gonna start placing our blueberries just right on top you place the whole blueberry one per cup these are some small cups here again I just buy the cups in bulk they're so cheap just given up a big box and it's pretty much gonna last us quite a quite a while depending on how much planting you're doing and there we go here's a close-up of the seeds close can we get so yeah the darker seeds for sure are going to they're going to grow you've got some immature seeds in there that may not sprout but again this is a small cup those blueberries go a long way all right we're gonna take some soil we're just gonna cover the tops I'm just going to cover the top with some topsoil there we're going to use about a quarter an inch to half an inch on the blueberries once we water we want to make sure that we don't expose them pack it down a little bit here give it a good pack on on the soil there and once we've water we're gonna make sure that we're not exposing the top of the blueberries we want to cover those up that looks good a little bit more so there no we're covered that's good good good a little bit of water skin get the soil a little bit wet here there we go blueberries um they like a little bit higher pH levels you guys are really into the science of it go ahead and look that up on the Internet blueberries require a lot of Sun you want to get them at least 3/4 of the day with full sunlight they can tolerate partial shade but you want to give them some sunlight stop our blueberries out here we're gonna do the same thing we're gonna use a little bit larger pot Sealy space and we're gonna we're gonna do the same method where it's gonna cut these blueberries right in half blueberries like to be well-drained as well when you're planting them when they when they sprout you're ready to plant those or Transplant them into the soil you want to be about a foot foot above the the rest of the soil and then you want to plant them in rows if you're gonna plan them in rows you want to go three feet wide I'll tell you what there's nothing better than going out and picking fresh blueberries from your from your garden here you can see some of the seeds exposed here well that's a good one there's a lot of darker red brown brownish eat the seeds in that one that was going to do really well blueberries love organic matter you know I'm just using a top soil right now here some kale bit of perlite it's just a potting mix go I'm really happy with the seats inside that blueberry we're gonna have some we're gonna have some blueberry sprouts here in a couple weeks so there it is again we're going to cover with our topsoil here you want to place it when a quarter an inch at least on top to a half inch we don't want any any of the fruit exposed make sure all the blueberries are covered so those seeds can grow if you expose the blueberries they're not going to grow you got to keep them under the soil keep the soil moist put it in a warm place you put these right on your windowsill maybe even your kitchen if you got a sunny area there we've got a sunroom or wherever it gets a little bit of sunlight and it's warm for sprouting you don't need to you don't need a whole lot of Sun but you just need of you have a warm spot once they start sprouting that's when you need a little bit of a little bit of Sun so if we're gonna do this in a winter right before spring it's actually a good time to do it for us right now it's January I'm smooth that around make sure it's level looks good let's look at some of the results here well thank you again for stopping by checking out our channel on YouTube if you come over to my garden channel comm preciate you there enjoy some of the blog information that you're going to get there on that channel and we'll see you guys in the next video [Music]", "tlRdP_r7tdE": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] sleep so so so so

get a really cool blue purplish or purplish gray color at the end you'll need you only really need four ingredients listed here to make sure you have some blueberries something to match the blueberries with a saucepan or small pot a funnel and a bottle I used 12 blueberries for this recipe but honestly if you want more go for it I used a bottle but you can use anything clear like a mug or jar put in about 1 centimeter deep of water put up the burner to medium high heat I used my broken mallet to mash the blueberries with covering it with plastic wrap just helps reduce the wash once the water boils add in your mashed blueberries want you can mash the berries even more if some of them have not been mashed properly now add in about 2 to 3 teaspoons of sugar so I'm using 3 teaspoons because it's overly if it's overly sweet I know I can just add more milk stir just to distribute the sugar reduce or remove from heat after about a few minutes so you can let it simmer for a bit I'm removing it from the heat add in the milk about 2/3 of the jar you can always add more later if you want then add in the cooled blueberry mixture see the purple started forming cool Hey alright so I underestimated how much syrup I had here okay so I screwed up a bit here and added too much milk so instead of the gradient it's just one color in the milk section I'll show you another sample that looks better once we finished with this one so the reason I wanted to use a jar is because it's easier to mix than stirring with a spoon you can just shake it shaking it helps redistribute the blueberries on the bottom easier then stirring all right so let's give it a try so how does it taste hmmm pretty good I like strawberry milk better but this isn't bad at all so this was the other sample I was talking about where I didn't screw it it does it looks prettier than the one that we made here Julie alright thanks for watching like and subscribe for similar content [Music]", "vbntRyiq4Lw": "hi my name is James Sheridan and I'm here at windmill farms in Aurora grandi and I have my own local landscape business called destination gardens and what I'm going to demonstrate for you guys today is how to take the blueberry that you just purchased and put it in a pot what you're going to need for this project of repotting your plant into the pot is of course a commercial grade potting soil I also like to use half and half of the peat moss you're also going to want to go out to your nursery center and find a plant that's probably best for your area it's also a good idea to select a good size pot what we're going to do is we've got a bigger pot because a larger pot means more roots bigger bush more berries for you in the future being at the blueberry is an acid loving plant and most soil you know potting soil is going to need a little help so I like to mix my commercial grade potting soil with about the same amount of peat moss now again this raises the yes City level to what the blueberries naturally like in the wild stop in half and get your pot you want to just hold it so it doesn't fall on the ground for you slide it out of your pot now the plant literally has a memory of the pot that it was just in so you want to kind of let it know that he is able to get out he's able to start growing so if you literally pull off some of these roots that stimulates more roots to grow you go ahead and put them in the pot now one thing that's really important is in the pot is that you don't put the plant back up here so I can demonstrate this better this is this is called the crown right here of the plant now if you're if you're to bury that farther than what it is right now you're literally going to kill this thing because it's it's it's bringing up too much water to the branches here that prefer dry so it's very important to literally plant your plant a little high so that when it settles as you water it's now at a level level ground so that's very important I've seen a lot of people kill plants doing that very thing so that's what we do we just continue mixing in the potting soil and the peach once you get this thing back up to the top of the crown like I said I said you want to give it a thorough watering and with a nice clay pot like this it's able to breathe so your your going to be not worrying about over watering in a clay pot thrille handy they again they breathe and you'll want to test the soil with your finger or you can get a commercial water tested to see how much moisture you're getting biggest problem with plants is we we like to over water everybody drinks a bunch of water each day they think their plants need it every day as well you have to take into consideration the weather where you live and not over water that's just going to cause fungus rot in the roots and kills the plant from the bottom up", "Oe71U3eyxVg": "Chris here Caribbean park um welcome to my kitchen quick recipe hot sauce it's like a pepper sauce but more of a I guess it's more of a glaze than anything else you can use this to top your eggs in the morning you can put this on your barbecue during the summer months and it is summer here in Canada well it's very hot outside right now speaking about how to be using some of the hottest peppers in the world but I believe it's the second hottest pepper in the world Trinidad scorpions am I gonna tone things down with a little bit of blueberries is I just picked up some blueberries in the grocery store and some orange juice so we're doing a scorpion blueberry orange juice pepper sauce let's get a lot of the sauces we make the pepper sauces we make in the Caribbean would be considered raw because we use the ingredients where we don't necessarily cook them today we're doing some cooking in a saucepan here on a low heat I'm going to go in with some vinegar and I've got here and I'm using lethal peppers these are Trinidad Moruga scorpion if you want to tame that down you can use habanero peppers you can use scotch bonnet peppers any sort of spicy peppers that you like use it you can certainly use for the sauce and I'm using about five or six of those just going to go in there I'm using my bare hands please I beg you use gloves and wash your hands immediately after with soap and water couple scallions that I chopped up slightly just give it a rough chop some brown sugar and I've got all that lovely blueberries so sea salt I've got here one line I'm just going to get the the juice out of one line I'm going to use some fresh orange juice as well just going to bring everything together so two oranges one line bring that up to a boil and then turn your heat down to a simmer and let that go for about twenty minutes we just want to bring everything together to incorporate everything stir it and do turn the fan above your stove on because once that pepper starts cooking it is going to really start to choke you you will have a tendency to want to cough open the windows to your kitchen and bring everything together and then turn your stove off let it cool and then we're going to go into the blender with it if you want you can certainly add a little bit of allspice in there as well as a little touch of cinnamon and some honey in my case I'm going in with what you see here because I love it that's the way it is afterward 2025 minutes or so everything would have broken down you can use the back of your spoon to crush those blueberries if you want but it's going in the food processor in the well you can use a food processor if you want but I'm using the old blender it's just going to break down in any case you will get this rich color everything and it's going to be quite you're gonna get an intense heat scent of heat of pure pepper in there because remember we using some of the most intense peppers in the world like I said Trinidad Moruga scorpion if you want to add some more peppers in there you can certainly do that there is no need for that it is cool now we really need this to be cool you really don't want to put this in a blender and work with hot ingredients just let it cool it's all going to go into the blender everything into the blender pulse it until smooth and that sauce is done so there you go friends Chrissy a career path accom an amazing pepper sauce made with blueberries I know it is not native to the Caribbean but a great combination of Canada which I call home now and the Caribbean store it in the fridge keep it away from the kids and do remember to check out the website Caribbean pod comm great recipe as usual have fun take care much love much respect", "QbEQnjttmDw": "hello and welcome back to gapey's garden today we're going to be talking about blueberries so if that is something that you've been thinking about growing now is the perfect time to get those planted and there's tons of different varieties so hopefully this video will help make that decision a little bit easier for you so there are evergreen varieties like this one and the leaves turn purple in the winter time but i think this is more ideal for milder climates so if you're in a really cold climate you may not be able to get the evergreen varieties but most of the blueberries are not evergreen so they lose their leaves during the winter time and each variety also has different ripening times of the season some are early mid or late so that's something else to consider but i did take some video over the course of last year so you can see just how productive each one is and stay tuned till the end of the video and i'll let you know how many pounds or ounces of blueberries i picked off of each variety [Music] i've got these in a raised bed that's about four feet wide by i can't remember how long it is but i will post that up in the notes and we've got ten different varieties of blueberries in here and they're all pretty low bushes none of them get super high um but i've had these first five here in this row i think about four or five years and then the ones behind them were mostly planted by the previous owners so they're a little bit older so the first one we have here is called brigitta and this is one that we had at our previous place and really liked it so it's a little bit hard to find but if you find it it's definitely a good one to get it gets really big berries and it's my second most productive blueberry at least last year i'll see how this year goes after i finish all the harvesting and see how it compares to last year but so far it's looking like it's going to be pretty productive this year i've already gotten a few harvests off of it and i've been harvesting today and got that bowl so far and have a lot more to pick so that is called brigitta next we have chandler and this is the one that gets probably the biggest berries out of all of the bushes here and it was the most productive last year and it is pretty productive this year so we'll have to see if it's number one again or if brigitta will take its place but it has some pretty tasty berries and it is growing a little bit wider than some of the others so i might have to do some more pruning to this one this summer or this winter but it's pretty loaded with berries lots of berries to pick and lots still to ripen and next we have patriot this one gets a really cool red color in the fall it's really pretty the berries are not as big as some of the other varieties that i have but they are pretty productive anyway and are very tasty but this one is probably i might just have one more harvest left on this one it's a little bit earlier ripening variety so it gets done earlier this here is the sunshine blueberry and it is one of the few blueberries that is evergreen so it does keep its leaves during the winter time and the berries are pretty small probably the smallest variety that i have they are pretty sweet very good tasting but it's not my favorite bush just because while it is later ripening for one thing and i'm i like the bigger berries so um and also this one does get tend to get a lot of this mummy berry where the berries kind of turn white and just fall off and don't ripen um but i've had that problem with this bush since i got it so i'm not super happy with that one i may replace it at some point we'll see this one here is called blu-ray it might be the tallest bush of the bunch um it does get quite a few berries i've harvested most of the berries off of this one already it's also a little bit earlier fruiting one than some of the others so i've probably only got one harvest left on this one and it'll be done i don't see too many unripe berries on this one but that's been a pretty productive one as well maybe my third or fourth most productive but i'll see what the final tally is this year in another month or so i wanted to mention the netting that we're using this isn't your regular cheap bird netting this is some pretty heavy-duty stuff it's kind of almost like plastic bag material but it is super easy to work with it doesn't get all tangled up birds don't get caught in it which is a plus because our previous netting we kept getting birds stuck in it and it wasn't always an out a good outcome for the birds that got stuck in it but this is what we got on amazon it works super well i was able to get this onto the onto the bed in probably two minutes by myself and we've got some little screws that we put into the the board here and we just are able to tighten and just put those on there just to secure it so that it doesn't blow away and so no critters get under it but we've been really really happy with this and it it we've used it for i think three years now so it lasts a long time we do take it off in the winter time but we do really really like this net and i'll put a link to the amazon where you can get that now on the other side we have a row of berries that were planted by the previous owners so i'm not sure what some of these are this one here on the end is another evergreen one i'm not sure if it's the same exact variety as the sunshine or a different one it does seem to be taller it actually did not set any fruit at all last year but this year it's it's pretty loaded with fruit and i think i haven't done any harvesting on this one yet this year so i need to get on that because it's starting to actually kind of fall over and partly is is because of this rhubarb that's behind it that's probably pushing against it a little bit so it's not a great place to put a rhubarb but i'll probably be moving that rhubarb somewhere else at some point next to that we have a little one called blue gold this is my newest variety i had a pink lemonade here previously but i wasn't too happy with the pink lemonade variety because it was just not very productive some years i didn't get any berries and the years it did produce berries it just wasn't very many so i got rid of it and then i replaced it with this variety here which is supposed to be a good one um it's only i think three years old so it's not super productive yet but hopefully in another year or so we'll get more berries off of that one now this one here i think might be called duke they did leave a tag um somewhere on here so i'm thinking that's probably what this was though i think the tag was actually on the bush next to it but i'm pretty sure that's not duke so i think this one is the duke um but it's got pretty small berries as well and it's been super well i wouldn't say super productive but it's kind of hanging in there kind of in the middle compared to the other berries next to that is a very very small bush and it's it's a pretty old tree so i'm actually thinking of getting rid of this one i think this one might be the top hat which is a a dwarf variety which explains why it's so small but i think it's never been very productive so that's another one i am thinking about getting rid of because it just doesn't really grow and i'd rather have a more productive bush over here and then finally we have the pink lemonade and this year it did really well it's got actually more berries i think than i've ever had since we've been here last year it didn't get a single berry but we've got loads of berries it's it is a later ripening variety so you can see there's a lot of unripe berries in here but we should get some more ripening here over the course of this month and right now we're just at the beginning of august so i'm looking forward to that they do taste a little bit different than a regular blueberry they're kind of more i know it's kind of hard to explain they are a little bit sweeter i think but it's just got a little bit different taste maybe kind of citrusy but that is all the blueberries we have if you have any really great blueberry varieties that don't get too tall let me know what they are and i'll think about adding those to the bed thanks for watching and we'll talk to you again soon if you enjoyed this video please like and subscribe you can also find me on instagram twitter and facebook", "bARyNAewh1I": "[Music] so what a great day to go out and

And today we're making\na classic blueberry pie bursting with flavor, topped and cradled with a flaky butter crust\nand it's just amazing. Look at this. It holds its shape but it's delicious. Let's get started. I made a batch of my favorite\nall butter pie crust dough and let it chill overnight. You can click up here for\nthe full how to on that or you can click the\nlink in the description and it will have all the details. But for now, we're gonna roll this out. When you take it out of the fridge, let it come a little bit\ncloser to room temperature, otherwise, it will get a lot of cracking. Unwrap this sucker, sprinkle\nliberally with flour all over the place, spread it around and now we're gonna roll\nout from the center, add more flour to your rolling pin if it's getting a little sticky. And it's imperative that\nyou flour, flour, flour and move it around. I like to flip mine over. Flour, all right, everywhere flour. And because this pie\nwill have a lattice top, I made a double batch of dough. You'll have a little bit left over but you can bake that\nseparately for a delicious snack or just keep it in the\nfridge for an emergency mini pie crust, whatever you want. If you do have cracks developed, just pinch them together,\nit's not a big deal. Don't worry if the dough\nis not totally round, it's really gonna be fine. Once you get to the desired thickness, a little bit more flour and\nroll it onto your rolling pin. I find this is the best\nway to transfer dough. But, you can quarter it,\ndo whatever you want. Use your dough hover machine. (laughs) Okay, unroll that unto your pie, and now I like to lift and\nkind of jiggle it in there. I don't wanna stretch the dough because I really think that if you do that it's gonna like kind of tense\nback up in baking and shrink. Now we can use the knife\nand just cut around. You can use a giant knife\nbecause that's what is available. Don't worry about the edge because we're gonna be hiding\nthat with our lattice top. So, just cut around the pie dish. Okay, all of this can be used up for decorations if we want later. This, I'm just going to tap\ndown, make sure it's all there. And pop this into the freezer to chill out while we work on our filling. For the filling, I have five\ncups of fresh blueberries. Look at these guys. You can use frozen\nblueberries if you want. You have to add in maybe\nlike an extra half cup or so. All right, I really like some\nlemon to zing up all my pies. I feel like it wakes them up. Apple pie, blueberry pie,\nstrawberry, the works. Otherwise, all that sugar\njust feels a little bit dull even if the blueberries\nhave some zing to them. And they do, but it's not like lemon. To my blueberries, I'm\ngonna zest one lemon. Already it's gorgeous. Like yellow, the blue, amazing. Let's add in my three tablespoon of this. One tablespoon, two, I don't know. Let's make that three full\ntablespoons of lemon juice. Gonna add half a cup of sugar now. Get out there. One quarter cup or 30 grams of cornstarch. This is our thickening agent\nand it's really gonna help the pie not be a watery mess. Now, we're gonna toss this\nup, toss those blueberries. This is like such a simple pie filling. Just move things around so all that sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice and\nzest really mixes together. You have a nice uniform and\nwet, gloopy, blueberry filling. Okay, that's great. Nice. All right, let's set that aside\nand then fill our pie crust. So, pull that pie crust out of the freezer and just dump in those blueberries. (soft happy music) Okay, spread them out a bit. And I like to make sure that all of that lemony, thickening agent\nis kind of out of the bowl, into the filling and spread around. Now just flatten it out. Just make sure you don't\nhave any voids in the pie where there's like a gap in blueberries because if that happens, when\nyour lattice is baking up, it'll collapse and it\nwon't look as pretty. It'll still be delicious though. This can go back into the fridge now just to keep chilled while\nwe work on our lattice. I have batch number two of pie crust that I just started rolling out. Same deal as before. Keep it moving. That is the main thing with pie crust. You can't let it sit still,\notherwise, things get sticky and you get frustrated. This one I don't have super control over but it would be great if it rolled out to a perfect square so I can\ncut nice, beautiful strips. I don't think that's gonna happen though. Feels like I'm making\na very luxurious pizza. That's good. Any cracks can get pinched together. And right now, we're gonna cut our strips. I'm gonna go for, maybe, an inch in change. If you want thuper, thuper thin strips, If you want super thin\nstrips, just be careful because they become harder to work with. If you look at those pretty\nreally beautiful pies on Instagram, the key is how does it bake. You'll notice you'll see a lot\nof insanely gorgeous raw pies because they tend to\nfall apart during baking. Not all of your strips have to\nbe the same size by the way. So don't worry or panic if you have some thinner ones or thicker ones. Just say it was part\nof the plan all along. Before I add my lattice\non, I'm gonna grate about two tablespoons of\nbutter right onto this. It'll melt in there and make it really just\nthat much more delicious. This is kind of optional\nthough, you don't have to. So, to make your lattice, you're going to arrange the first row. You can have as much or\nas little gap as you want. It's really up to you. I tried to be really ambitious once and do a Chevron pattern\nduring a Facebook live video and it did not go well. I had to start from scratch,\ncause even though I knew what I was supposed to\ndo, I totally lost track and it was kind of a disaster. Just to be totally honest. Now you're gonna lift up every other strip half\nway through, two, three. And place your lattice in\nthere, nice and straight. Place back on and then you're\ngonna repeat that process with the alternating strips. We're almost done with one side. Okay, so this is a gonna\nbe one, two, three, four, do one little tiny strip\nhere to finish it off. Our lattice is complete. Now we have to deal with the edge. Kind of up to you how to do this. I'm gonna trim my edges. Gonna place this into the\nfridge for a few minutes and see if I can do a braid. If I can't, we're just gonna crimp it. So, bear with me. So, okay, I have my three strands. The problem is I'm horrible at braiding. Okay, but let's give it a try. Ideally, I will start in the middle but I always lose track when I do that. So, that's not gonna happen. (gentle happy music) Just moving them back and forth. (chuckles) Okay, so one, two. I'm getting it and I know the pattern. (gentle happy music) It's gonna be like enough for a third. (chuckles) Anyways, that's what it'll look like if I had the patience to\ndo the rest of the braid. But, I don't, I just don't. So, I'm gonna push it to the side and what we're gonna do now is crimp our pie dough together at the end so that it holds together. Am using a knife to trim\nsome of the overhang. This pie dish actually\nhas a very narrow lip. Most of yours will have a bigger one for your crimping to rest on. You can take some of the\nexcess and just smoosh it on for some extra hold. So now, if you want, you can just give it a little bit of a crimp with your fingers just for the smallest bit of\ndetail, not like that braid. Just run around with\ntwo fingers on one side or a thumb and your index finger\nand your other index finger and just crimp, crimp, crimp. This will help everything\nstay glued together and I think it gives it a nice very homey but wonderful finishing touch. We're gonna brush the entire\nsurface with an egg wash. Mix one egg and a tablespoon\nof cream in a small bowl so it's a nice, even consistency. And we're gonna brush this on the top. The egg wash is gonna give\nit a glossy, golden color. And also act almost as a bit of glue to hold everything together. It'll seep into those\ncorners of the lattice. And I like to use a smaller brush for this so it's a bit much precise and\ndoesn't damage the pie crust. It's much easier to add an egg wash onto a chilled pie crust because it won't move around with your brush. You do wanna try and hit\nevery bit of the pie crust with the egg wash because\nin the absence of egg wash, it'll be a very visible\nas a totally different color and texture. At the same time, you\ndon't want to smother it in egg wash and have giant pools of egg. I'm gonna finish this off\nwith a sprinkling of sugar. I think it adds a nice little bit of crunch and sweetness to the top. You don't have to add it though. It's totally up to you. This is gonna bake for 20 minutes at 425. We're gonna lower the\ntemperature down to like 375 and bake for an additional almost hour. So, you don't want the edge to burn. That'll blacken, the whole pie crust will be black on the outside. If that's happened to you,\nlet me know in the comments. We can share our pie failures. So carefully, wrap some\ntin foil around the edge. This will protect our pie during baking and let the center become nice and golden without burning the edge. You can check on it after\nlike maybe an hour in total and just maybe just take the tenting off if it's not looking golden\nenough on the outside. Onto a baking sheet and into the oven. Okay, I had to show you, it's\nvery slippery, very slippery. The pie was bubbling, done golden brown. It baked for 20 minutes at\n425, then 40 minutes for 375 after which I removed the tenting and cooked it for an additional\nlike 10 to 15 minutes. I just watched it. When it was bubbling and golden\nbrown, I knew it was ready. This is gonna be set aside until it is fully room temperature. I wanna eat it all. Oh my Gosh it's so hot. Forgot the pan is hot. Anyways, not gonna eat it,\nsetting it aside gently. All the components tasted amazing raw. I can't imagine what it's\ngonna taste like cooked. Mmmh good. I love the lemon in there. It has a lot of flavor. Well that's like secret lover. (laughs) If you like this recipe,\ncheck out my Apple Hand pies. They are delicious, filled with caramel and kind of addictive.

So what we wanna do is talk\nto my friend, Dave Lockwood, UT fruit specialist with\nextension and figure out what do we need to do\nwith a plant like this? That looks like it needs\nto be pulled up. Dave - Yes. - Help. - Okay. - Talk to us about this blueberry plant. 'Cause this is pretty typical\nof what you'll see right now before the plant starts bushing out. - Yeah, blueberries can be a\nslow starter in our planning. So, one of the things I like\nto do is, build a canopy up in the air and not worry\nabout early fruit production. And to do that, similar to\nwhat we talk about in trees, we're gonna look at the\ntree or that the plant and determine whether we've\ngot any dead or broken wood or shoots in the tree. We're gonna prune those\noff like we do here. And one thing I always caution people, about is, look at the\nbasal part of the cut and see what the color of the wood is when you make that cut to\nmake sure it's healthy, green. Okay. So those were dead shoots. This is also a dead shoot. So the first thing that I\nwould is to cut those off. Now, blueberry, can set fruit\nbuds on a very young plant and the first few years of their life, especially if they're\nkinda weakened growing, they don't wanna have fruit. We were gonna de fruit them. This plant does not have\nany fruit buds on it. I do think the deer have\ngrazed off a lot of them. Well, I actually, I said it didn't, but it does have a couple. You can\nalways tell the fruit buds on blueberry, in that\nthere are larger plumper around their buds, as\nopposed to the leaf buds, which are much smaller, more pointed and occur further down the shoot. So there's a couple of fruit\nbuds. There are couple here. - So this is leaf. - Yes. - And this is fruit. - That's correct. And so, in a young plant like this, where your primary\ngoal is to grow up the plant, you don't wanna let it fruit. So, I like to come in while\nthe plant is still dormant and cut off the shoots with fruit buds on, because we're attempted\nto leave some fruit, to see what it's gonna be like. - So that the way just showed\nwith the fruit grownup, you're gonna cut that off and\nnever let it, go to fruit. - Right. And depending on how the plant goes, we may do that for the first two, three years of its life.\nAnd then after the canopy gets on up, then we'll\nlet us start the fruit and you'll have a bigger\nplant and you'll better crop. And it's gonna be up higher\nwhere you've got better air circulation around the\ncanopy for disease control and also for ease of maintenance. - You know Dave, I get that though, because if I had seen that, I would have been like, Oh, maybe we'll have just a\ncouple of blueberries. And but you, that's not what you want to happen at this plant. - No - Okay.So let's look at this\none because, this one, to me, it looks similar to that. So\nI'm assuming this comes off. - Right? - This comes off. Okay, all right. And then what about, I mean,\nthis looks kind of odd. - With that, the shoot\ndied back to this point and I liked to always cut\nback into healthy woods. So, I'm gonna cut that\ndead tip off, again. We'll look at the color\nof the wood under the cut. It's healthy. That's good. If it wasn't healthy,\nI'd cut further down. - All right, and let's\ngo to this one other one that looks like it's kind\nof in that same, boat, do they typically all\nkind of match each other when at this point of the year, when you got nothing really going on. - It's quite common for\nthem to have very similar growth habits. So on this one, the two you're touching\nin this one are dead. The tip of this one is dead. I probably would go below\nthose and cut it all off. And again, we've got a healthy shoot. I'm gonna cut this dead tip\noff here and leave this. It's fairly healthy. Now,\nwe do have fruit buds here. - No, well, where are\nyou gonna cut those off? So I'm gonna come below\nthose and cut them all off. And actually, I do the same thing there. So we've, gotten rid of\nthe weaker... shoot growth, where it's a side-branch\nand we're trying to build stronger growth and more upright growth. - Okay. So Dave what did you do with this? Do you mulch this? How do you take care\nof it from here on out after you've done all of these? - Well, blueberries are\nkind of a unique plant in the third one. They're\nacid loving plants are a lot like azaleas in the landscape, so they need an acid soil. So we build a raised bed.\nThen you can see the bed here, and we may have a contained bed like this, or it may not be contained, but we, incorporate a\nlot of organic matter. We lower the pH, and\nthat does several things. First off, blueberries have\na very shallow root system. So, they're very vulnerable\nto hot temperatures in the summer, or if it turns out dry, those roots are gonna be apt to dry out. The mulch will, tamper both\ntemperature and moisture levels in the road zone of the plant and makes it a whole lot more\nconducive to good root growth, which of course is\nessential for top growth. - Right, - Following that, we like to irrigate. And you can see that\nthere's an irrigation line laid down on top of the ground\nhere because, in the spring, we quite often get adequate water. But as we often see, mid-summer, which is still a critical\ntime, in the blueberry plants growth we'll, run into die times. - Right? - And so, without a\ncombination of the mulch and supplemental watering,\nthe plants are gonna suffer. - So, this summer, you just\nkeep it mulched and watered, and you don't do anything\nelse to the plant. - I would probably, fertilize\nit about three times, very light application. So, if you've got just\na few blueberry plants and you've got some Mosaic\nplants, I use the Mosaic food. Mosaic fertilizer on\nmy blueberries as well, because I had similar\nfertility requirements. If I had a lot of blueberries\nand Northern areas, I would buy a fertilizer\ncalled ammonium sulfate, which is an acid forming nitrogen\nfertilizer, and use that. But it would only be like an\nounce, so at bloom about six weeks again, and then\nsix weeks after that. So about three applications, assuming that either we're\nirrigating or that we're good in good rainfall. And by mid-summer, I would no longer fertilize the plant. - And let it just do its thing\nand just keep it watered. - Yes. - Okay. All right, so\nafter about, three years then is when we start\ngetting some yummies. - Yes, Yeah. Generally\nand depends a little bit on how the plants go on, but if it's grown, like\nwe'd expect it will, the third year I'd be inclined\nto let us start to fruit. - Got it. - Okay, Dave, thank you so much for this. I've learned a lot. You're a good pruner Dave. I'm sure the plants will agree, but it looks a little scary at first, but thanks for the lesson on\nthat. I think we all needed it. - Well you are very welcomed. - [Narrator] For inspiring garden tours, growing tips, and garden projects, visit out website at volunteergardener.org.
