it in I think you get 15% off but yeah subscribe I'm going to be doing a lot more of these this thing came out very very good", "F76VX9CWFEE": "Schaffer I've been thinking about ways to try to help your skiing and I thought after visiting you last Christmas which was awesome by the way steam goes fantastic thank you for that that maybe we could address some service work I got to know your waxing setup in your garage pretty well it's sweet really nicely done I didn't watch you wax very much because when you first came into work on skis I saw you approach the ski with fear in your eyes and then when I saw you work on the skis I realize you should have had a lot more fear in your eyes and I want to try to start to eliminate some of the cause for that fear and so I have come up with a system for you a special system for special guys like yourself to try to make this easier first of all excuse need wax they gotta have paraffin ironed on to him once in a while and what you're going to have to scrape skis and when you do you need the right tools group scraper first of all you should always scrape your grooves first my groove scraper is this beauty you can't have it my brother made it for me it weighs about 6 pounds with a brass handle and a stainless steel rod I hate this but it works it's a cheap piece of plastic that has just the right shapes and contours to get into a groove even a Rossignol groove so you need to you need to get one of these I'm gonna send you one of these maybe I already did it I sent you one of these Red Creek groove scraper super cheap next thing are normal scrapers all professionals prefer three millimeter scraper with the reason is this skis don't stay flat they never stay flat and so you have to sort of be able to bend and flex the scraper a little bit and help get the wax out however we have some special edition 5 millimeter red creek scrapers for special people like you because if you're perched up here over the ski and and you're a little bit terrified stiffer scrapers a little more stable I'm gonna demonstrate really quickly I am gonna use my tool [Music] special five-millimeter scraper for special people protip John if you're doing the edge of the ski use the end of the scraper so you don't dull the scraping surface come son like this right here if you see 45 degrees there you go do it like that so I don't have to get angry at you when you're scraping the ski get your thumbs right over the work put them down low on the scraper like this and then they sit right on either side of the groove and your fingers can be little guys just like this there you go that'll make it less terrifying don't go like this don't like perch your hands up high don't you just just get behind it and push that's good this thing is for when your scraper gets dull and it will get dull it'll take a lot of Wax right off the surface you're gonna need this brush we call it the monster brush it's really good for getting wax off the surface between the five millimeter scraper a good sharp groove scraper and this you should be okay you really should be able to scrape paraffin after the monster brush you just want to use your standard brushes if you're not a total cheapskate you might have some roto brushes like me now look this is when we pick up and get exciting I have here some liquid paraffins almost every company is making liquid paraffins now they're not all the same I haven't tested all of them I have been working with the star ones for a while and I happen to know that lakhs contributed to some very fast skis in some of the early World Cups these are really really high quality HF paraffins so we're looking for both convenience and performance here because there's so much wax material in this product you can actually iron it after spreading it on the ski with a relatively low temp iron about 125 and you will get some saturation of the material into the skis and they tend to perform better that way as well so I'm just going to demonstrate it's a solving based product which means that shipping is a bit of a pain you got a ground ship but you just spread it on my finger paint it if you're concerned about the chemicals just use a little fiber lean doesn't take a lot it covers pretty easily the cost is relatively low and if you don't want to use heat you can just let it dry but I'm going to show you an ironed application quick pass with the iron down the ski will put the wax into solution not deeply into solution but plenty well enough to ensure really good durability and really good performance at that point you're pretty much done there's not much heat in the base it cools really really rapidly and if you just let it dry that's fine too I'd recommend giving it a few minutes you can skip scraping altogether that nice five millimeter scraper that I got you you don't need it I really like this brass brush it's inexpensive it's really fine it's really mild on the base it just cleans the structure really well and takes the the excess material off one bottle of wax one brush quick iron hit if you've got the patience in time for it and you want a little better performance and durability otherwise you're good to go we've got a cold a medium and a warm and they're really high level performing products we're using them at all levels of racing and finding some added benefit to them over regular paraffin I want to reiterate though skis need paraffin skis need to be fed with paraffin the bases need paraffin in solution and this isn't really gonna take care of it you get good performance out of the surface but you got to get your skis waxed every couple of weeks so my recommendation is to check with one of the local you know local people who know what they're doing like check with smullin know check that go for tape get Brian Kate over he's a nicer guy anyway I should be good to go this stuff will keep you keep you going fast dish you know relatively speaking",

ukulele where we're going to be learning the easiest chords that you can play on ukulele and get started with some real songs right from day one I've got my recommended first song that you should learn on ukulele coming in just a couple of minutes and at the end of this video I'll show you my top five with cochise link to in the description that you should start to learn as soon as you've got a little bit of experience and you've learned these three easy chords but first of all let's talk a little bit about the ukulele itself this is a concert ukulele and most ukuleles that you probably have if you do have one with you now and likely a soprano concert or tenor ukulele which are all absolutely fine for this course it is just a baritone ukulele which is quite noticeably bigger and we have different tuning notes for that one but the tuner notes for your ukulele here are g c e and a and we can check those and I recommend that you do check them by getting yourself a tuner that can just clip onto the edge of your ukulele here and this particular ukulele is an act lot ukulele which I'll link to in the description it comes with a gig bag it comes with a tuner selection of picks and even a little sort of starter guide which is really cool to have all your chords laid out a few easy songs how to record diagrams a lot the stuff we'll be looking at in this video but you know there's there's a great little free booklet in that one and it's a good affordable option if you already have a ukulele do not upgrade until you realize there's a reason that you need to upgrade for example you know yours is going out of tune all the time or it's particularly hard to play or you don't like the sound of it or look of it those things are good reasons to get yourself a new ukulele if this is something that you wanted to do and you're wanting a nice portable instrument that's really easy to play and it can have loads of fun playing some new songs with now other than a tuner there are no other accessories you need at all to be able to play ukulele you can grab it and get started right away you have the option of getting a strap if you find it easier to hold in your strap would clip onto here and here the tube pegs and then you can put it around your neck and that will support it and can make it easier however the easiest way to do it is to support the ukulele neck with the side of the palm of your hand and then just rest in your thumb almost on top but just around the back like this and then supporting the body of the ukulele with the inside of the forearm here if you're sitting or standing or if you prefer just rest it on your lap and keep it a little bit lower like this and it can be more secure in that fashion if that's what you prefer the first chord that we're going to be learning is a C major chord and it just takes one finger to be able to play I would prefer if we could use the third finger and this would be at the third fret and holding the ukulele in the fashion that I described before that would sound like this when we hold the ukulele in this fashion we want to really curl over our fingers like I never claw hand like this that just means that when we're playing any other cause that we go for we're not muting any strings and just getting this sort of dead sound keep your fingers right on the tips and curled over and don't touch any other strings at all and then it should sound really good and wring out exactly how we want the chord diagram that's on the screen now is written this way round so the top of the chord diagram is actually the end of the ukulele here every line is a fret going horizontally every line vertically is a strength and that is what this particular chord would look like the C major chord the second chord we're going to be going for is the F major chord now any guitarists among you must be thinking oh my word the second chord we're going for is an F that's really difficult well on ukulele it isn't it only actually uses two fingers and the fingers that we will need a fingers one and two on the first fret of the second string and the middle finger on the second fret of the fourth string so counting at one two three four the one nearest to you and there is our much easier F chord than it is on guitar we're hey this is good thing now it's with the F chord that you may wish to experiment a little with having the thumb a little bit higher or a little bit lower so we have these two ways which we can support the ukulele with this hand this is tends to be more secure with the outside of the palm of the hand and the thumb just here so some of you may prefer to have that thumb lower and particularly children may prefer and may get better results and a cleaner sound and a better sound bringing out takes a quite a bit of pressure when you're not used to it but ukulele strings are much more fingertip friendly for anyone children and adults alike so this is a great gateway into learning stringed instruments and perhaps one day again yourself a string six string guitar and being able to rock out but we're gonna rock out in the ukulele at the moment we want to strum all the strings on the ukulele unless there is a little cross over a certain string in which case you wouldn't strum that one but if very rarely happens most of the time we're going to be strumming all four strings just with our first finger and kind of using the nail a little bit so let's just change between those two chords now for around ten or fifteen seconds just to get some experience of doing it before we look at our first song so the C chord third finger third fret and then the F chord chord number two F major the C major chord number one the F major chord number two and the more practice we have the more repetition the easier it is going to get and the faster you will get playing real songs [Music] in fact that is how we can play most of the song that we're going to be going for today right now and this is you are my sunshine I'm sure everyone watching this video knows how the lyrics go to this one let me give you a quick demo and then I'll show you how to do it yourself just strumming every time that a chord is written and the chord sheet is linked to in the description below we want to play you are my sunshine my only sunshine you make me happy when skies are grey you'll never know dear how much I love you and it's just the final line please don't take my sunshine away though we need a third chord fall so there's so much of this song we can play with two chords let's do it right away let's not delay at all so ready with that C chord changes are nice and slow and just strumming every time a chord is written starting with the C chord on sunshine ready play along with me you are my sunshine my only sunshine here's where we need to change to that F chord the second chord that we did do that for me now and ready on the word happy we strum again you make me happy we need to get straight back to C now so that first chord with the third finger here and it's on great when skies are gray it's the same as that again so back to the F you'll never know dear back to see how much I love you so hopefully now you see how important is to get those changes down you need to be comfortable changing no super quick but quick enough to be able to do it at that sort of speed so I invite you one more time you can skip along if you've got it but just change between the C and F and try and figure out can you hold the ukulele like this or are you going to go for this method which is perhaps a little bit more advanced and I'd encourage you to try it if you haven't yet we're we're using the thumb at the back of the neck and just the tips of the fingers to support the ukulele or you have this the third and final chord we're going to go for here is the G major chord but we actually make the shape with our fingers of a D major chord if you're familiar with that on the on the guitar and that is played if you're not familiar with it with the first finger at the third string second fret middle finger second fret on the lowest string on the bottom string and third finger third fret making a little triangle now it's this chord that is really handy to get used to the method of gripping the guitar between the side of your palm and the thumb because that puts your fingers on this angle which can be really handy and just really helps us support going between the three chords that we have the C the G and the F G major chord uses the shape of a D and although we're using three fingers should be okay for most people and the final line of our song is please don't take my sunshine away that was please don't take that's the C chord geez shaped like a D my sunshine away so if we're comfortable with those changes we can have a go at this song now and then add some strumming to it if you're not you just need to drill those changes a little bit more till they are there but I'm sure most of you will be able to change at least between those first two chords to do the bulk of this song and really get get going with you ukulele straight away so from the top we're gonna start with the C chord and just stay there for two strums ready play along with me on sunshine strum on sunshine you are my sunshine my only sunshine to the F the second chord which was this you'll make me happy back to a C when skies are gray f you'll never know dear how much I love you please don't take the g-major chord my sunshine end on C away one last time let's go for broke let's do it guys ready from the top you are my sunshine my only sunshine you make me happy when skies are grey you'll never know dear how much I love you please don't take my sunshine away now I'm gonna be suggesting another five great songs that are super easy and use these same three chords and just in a second but the last thing that I want us to do with this song is just try strumming on what we call the beat so when we play you are my sunshine my only sunshine we're playing on what's called the first beat of the bar and a bar is where some adults choose to have a drink but also it is a count of four beats okay so four beats to a bar to a regular pulse of one two three four okay and where we're currently strumming you are my son three four one two three four well we want to try and do if we can is strum and every one of those beats and just change chord on the word where you already know where to change to because you've had a few goes it so just as an example and just to go for broke with you guys because because I've got confidence in you is to start with our C chord and strum on every pulse on every beat you Wow my sunshine my only son you make me happy when skies are gray okay sounds really good right but does make it harder for those chord changes and it makes it harder if you strumming and singing at the same time so let's try and take it back to just what's happening on the ukulele for now we're gonna start with the C chord and we're going to strum it two rounds of four we always count to four in music there's a running joke that musicians can only count to four and somewhat that's true especially for me but we can start off with that C chord and we need to count for twice but stay on the C chord for example one two three four one two three four okay it's after that last one though we need to lift off as soon as you've strummed and changed to that F chord strumming four four and back to C for form okay let me shout it out now you've got the gist of it and we'll have a go at playing this together I will shout out those changes as we do them ready on the C chord in 1 2 3 4 C 2 3 stay on the C chord 3 4 F 2 3 and back to C F again and C and here we just have two strums of a C G G and C you are my sunshine my only sunshine you make me happy when skies are gray you'll never know dear how much I love you please don't do just took my sunshine away [Music] and I is a really simple way of playing you are my sunshine we're gonna learn some cooler strumming in tomorrow's lesson and but that's a great way to get started and I wouldn't do the strumming more complex than that if you use to more complex than that get on to the other days we're gonna learn some really cool stuff the other five songs that I would recommend at this kind of level if the score cheese that I link to below just use those chords C F and G but many of the songs will work with just these three chords in fact it's kind of hundreds really and you can follow chord sheets off the first one is happy birthday happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday happy birthday happy birthday to you we also have Amazing Grace again link to in the description the cauchy and I'm looking forward to filming some tutorials for these soon this is Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me so on and so forth there's lean on me by bill withers as well this is a simplified version just using these three chords lean on me when you're not strong and I'll be your friend I'll help you carry on [Music] it won't be long till I'm gone and somebody do they and finally something a little bit more rock and roll we've changed the key which we'll be talking about in later days in this 10-day course but this is how to play twist and shout by the Beatles played in this fashion CC f''fgf FG and just repeating that and singing along the rocky now we'll shake it up baby now shake it up baby twist and shout twist and shout come on baby [Music] lots of fun to be had there alright just a little bit to get started but if we start with real songs and those are great choices we can start to get more experience under your belt of how songs work and how you can go on to learn any song that you want even without a youtube video tutorial thank you so much for checking out this video please check out day 2 if you have enjoyed this 10 day static

this product is gonna do and how the overall flavor and effects are gonna be being a blend based concentrate you never quite know what to expect when you're diving into something like this so i'm looking to see that it's something tasty and something heavy hitting but the only way we're going to find out you guys is by cracking into it and checking it out so that's exactly what we're going to do right now let's pull up the website and get this information going so we can dive into this review y'all i'll see you on the other side of the intro welcome back everyone so as i said in the intro we're going to be diving into blend crafts indica blend wax you guys i am really curious to see how this is going to do so this package is only a half gram container so any of the information around the price you do have to be aware that this is only a half of a gram and it came in right around the 35 range for the half gram so it's not outrageous but it is still a little bit on the pricey side the thc content for this sucker is going to be 72.6 percent we've got a cbd total of 0.89 and a package date of september 26 2020. we do have the decibel website pulled up which is going to be kind of the over lapping company for quest blendcraft uh what other brands do they have prairie records and general admission oh general mission is decibel so that would be that's actually really good to know that's really really good to know so craft blended is going to be the base information that they give us here and then blend carb blend craft keeps it simple with indica blend sativa blend and hybrid blend created only created using only flour and trichrome coated sugar leaf from quest collection of superior cultivars small batch grown in bc the strains are hand selected based on aroma flavor and effect then blended for a smooth smoking experience that is all the information that they have right now for it which is a little bit disappointing but it means that we don't have to wait any longer to dive in and start smoking we're going to crack this package open take a look at how it's packaged before we go into our first reviewable smoke and that's going to be through the puffco that sucker come on don't be dead on me already don't be dead on me don't i think the puffco might be dead on me you guys let's uh plug it in and make sure that we can smoke through this sucker for the review i'll see you guys on the other side of the urban scale we're diving in to the puffco cheers [Music] okay guys so we're gonna give that puffco a little bit of uh time to charge up i think we're just gonna have to leave it and let it get nice and fully charged before we do the next one of these reviews but for now we'll just get it charged up enough for us to be able to dive in and take our first dab of this blendcraft wax so right on there you got a thc sticker and opening this up you're getting a lot more of a kind oh you're getting a lot more of a sugared like sugared shatter concentrate here you guys stuck pretty well together and it's held its consistency really well you're getting a really sweet sticky s not not syrupy a kind of a sweet berry blend for the overall aroma oh honestly you guys it's quite exciting and uh quite a rich sweet sticky kind of a smell i am very excited to see how this is gonna taste and to really see how it's gonna melt down and break as we uh vaporize it and we run it through the different temperatures and the different ways of of dabbing you guys oh it just smells so sweet and it's got a little bit of a kind of a gassy gassy tone in there that i'm not minding i'm enjoying actually quite a bit you guys so let's turn the puffco on let's get that sucker set to the right temperature ah yeah i know that thing's good that thing's gonna take a while so you know what we're gonna do the same thing that we did last time we're gonna run it through the glass first give it a lot of time to charge up and then we'll come back to the puffco so the way we're gonna run through our glasses we have three different temperatures we will be trying this wax out at you guys so the first one will be a cold start through our hydros banger here and that's going to allow us to really taste um all the variants in flavors and just overall experience with this wax because we're gonna be able to start tasting and experiencing the vapor at the lowest temperature because we are starting it from cold all the way up to the highest temperature because we'll boil it off right until there's there's nothing left you guys so we've got a good little scoop in there you're not gonna be able to see it too well because my bangers are starting to get chased and i definitely need to pick up some new ones but we're gonna start her out with a nice cold start bubble dab of this indica blend wax and we're gonna see how it does you guys i'm hoping that it stays with that really rich sticky fruity flavor because if it does i'm going to be enjoying myself all the way through this review so we're just waiting for it to start melting down and start bubbling there we go we've got it now take our first haul and see how this is you guys cheers it is very sweet you guys let's give this a little bit more heat try and encourage a little bit more intensity cheers okay guys before we actually move into scoring this i thought i would uh hit you up with a little bit of a reach out that i want to say thank you uh the couple you that reached out in the last video and were thinking that i might have been a little bit too soft with uh with the scoring so we're gonna make a little bit of an adjustment and we're gonna start scoring with this video kind of being the tester and friday being the full commitment to the transition for that sativa review we've uh adjusted the way the scores are going to be so one through two is just going to be non-smokable you guys like it is barely able to get it down if it's getting a three out of a four it's harsh like it's making you cough a lot it's just not enjoyable the flavor's not quite there that five to six is going to be tolerable the six is where the flavors are going to start playing factor where you can enjoy it the seven to eight is the enjoyable side of it where you're actually looking forward to smoking that and then the 9 to 10 well that is gonna be pristine experience and smoking flavor you guys we uh we're gonna start having a little bit of a harder ranking and harder hitting scale but uh let's go ahead and hit up the evan shorebanger with its warm up we've got 50 seconds on that before we give it a minute cool down and we're back taking another dab for the low camp experience you guys i'm looking forward to it i hope you are as well i'll see you on the other side okay guys so we're gonna end up giving the cold start a six out of a ten it was enjoyable it had a decent flavor to it where we could definitely come back and smoke it like that again but it just really didn't have the heavy flavor experience that i'm looking for with my concentrates because there really are the more dessert style of my smoking but this sucker is almost at its minute cool down let's dive into it and see how the uh low temp dab taste before we rock it on the high one rip rip it not reap it but rip it through the puffco then the email before we wrap the sucker up but let's dive into it on a low temp dab cheers hey guys so i'm going to give the low temp a 5 out of a 10. it was just not memorable very bland very light in the overall um like the overall experience for the flavor and just didn't really have anything there that i'd be looking to taste or experience when i'm dabbing this for flavor you guys it's smooth it's really enjoyable that way to smoke but the flavor is really lackluster and with for me my concentrates being the dessert i want them to be quite tasty and potent for the flavor you guys so we're gonna warm up our uh cheap chyna banger for the hot dab because i've chased my good ones up already enough there's no reason to do it anymore so i'll see you guys in a little bit when we're dropping a hat hat dab to try this ending blend wax out from blended craft [ __ ] show okay guys so with our high temp dabs what we do is we heat the nail up and then we let it cool for 30 seconds and then we drop our dab into it so it's been 30 seconds cheers okay guys so the high temps are only going to get a 4 out of a 10. it was really harsh like outright disappointing kind of a harsh um hit to it it didn't have any of that flavor but it had that burn to the back your throat that just wasn't quite enjoyable there are some concentrates that i find smooth at that higher temp not overly flavorful but smooth and uh still relatively enjoyable but we've got a puffco ready we've got that sucker warming up and i'm just curious to see how this wax is going to melt down in here because uh usually you get some pretty big bubbles with anything that's gonna be really flavorful i found with my puffco i don't know if it's just a personal thing or uh anything like that but this one's right down the middle so let's see if the flavors down the middle too cheers y'all and uh we'll be right back with the score sometimes you need to go okay guys so we got the email ready here and the uh puffcoat's only gonna get a four out of a ten it's definitely the strongest tasting experience i've had so far and it tasted like strictly burning terps like it just was a raw burnt flavor similar to what i get when i press some hash rosin with some really old keef where it just it hits heavy and it hits with an extreme intensity but it's it doesn't taste very good at all so that's a little bit disappointing but we've got our email here i decided to set it a little bit lower than typical we've got it at 500 degrees so i'm curious to see how uh how this wax is gonna do in the email and at this temperature you guys so let's drop her in there and uh let's try it out and see see how she is cheers okay guys so the email's gonna end up getting a 5 out of a 10. it's not bad it had a decent flavor hint in there like it was very light kind of peppermint hint in there with a little bit of a spice rack medley and it's overall quite nice quite light in the experience so it's only getting that 5 out of a 10 just because it's not really all that exciting you guys it's just kind of that the old 7 it's gonna be the new five you guys and that's that's really all we're doing for shifting this course it's just making it a little bit tougher to get into that beautiful garbage curve because some of you some of you have noticed that we've been given a lot of the higher numbers i i've been thinking that myself but with the 5 out of 10 for the e-nail we've got a high at it with a 6 out of a 10. it's not bad it's got a decent enjoyment to it a really heavy mental drift to it like my mind's already focusing on the next three things that i want to get done today and tackle and it's just overall not not a bad experience for this strain but it it's got a headache that came in right after the second dab and that that was quite disappointing you guys and that really is the reason why i've knocked quite so many points off but we end up getting an overall with a nice mid-range 30 out of 60 down the middle um so honestly this is called straight had just a lack of flavor with a decent high to it it it's it's something that'll serve a purpose it'll get you baked but it's not really overly flavorful you guys and that's disappointing for me and that's that's really all all i can say about it i wish there was more flavor to it i'm curious to see if the hybrid or the sativa blend does have more flavor but we won't we won't find out about that until they come into stock but for the time being i'm just gonna say probably not gonna buy another half gram of this i'll finish this one up and i'll be content but uh hope you guys enjoyed this review if you guys did definitely leave a like down below let me know what you think of the new more uh a little harder praised based review yes new scoring system let me know what you think because we'll adjust it to where more where it it kind of balances out my appreciation for the bud as well as what you guys are actually looking for in a review because that's part of the reason why i'm doing it is to one to be able to experience as many different strays as i can which is a benefit for myself and as i take as kind of a little bit of a selfish benefit to doing these reviews and then the the other part is being able to provide them for you guys which i love doing and i don't think i don't think my uh my interest in smoking as many different strains outweighs the fact of wanting to get these reviews out for you guys so you guys can pick and enjoy the strains that you actually want to smoke but um for for this wax mid-range score for kind of a mid-range experience hope you guys enjoyed when the end card slides in all you got to do is hover over my logo to be able to click that subscribe button and the bell notifications that you know anytime one of my videos go live and then the bottom two videos one will be the most recommended for you and the other one will be the most recently uploaded i would definitely appreciate it if you check out either of those videos or both that's up to you guys but for the time being c'est xiao and i will be back later with some more content tomorrow we will uh we'll dive into a little bit of the 4x4 grow tent with the uh seed drops that we had in there and a little progress up to how they're doing today but we're gonna have all that and more this week i'll see you guys in the next one cheers y'all back later with some more content you", "yLoe9ufP9vE": "are you guys so we're gonna do a lower leg locks with roll-on softbox want to use our set I saw the blue roll-on I've already prepped her skin with our purple gel and I've let it dry make sure you let it dry fully so it's your waxes and roll and it can stick to those hairs the right way so the way you want to hold your warmer is with a star pillow go outward so you notice is roller has like an angle you want to make sure the rule the angle is downward outward with the hair growth so I'm going to start at the highest point and I'm going to do it quickly just like that you should go in the entire leg this is the most effective and time-saving way to do it rather than the wax strip wax strip just roll onto the entire leg or at least the first half the upper half and so the rollerball is cool because it actually does not have a temperature dial like all of our other star performers that's because the heating unit that it comes on heats to the perfect temperature already so you don't even need to mess with it you just need to plug it in let it melt all the way and you're good to go so I can use the strip a few times in a row I'm just gonna use it about twice don't want to have her legs stick Eve this is our first leg wax ever listen this is definitely one of my favorite methods for legs chest and back as well it's just really easy it's really quick and that's probably the most important thing the time-saving because you know you want to fit in be able to see as many chains as possible in this excess off [Music] so the tweezers take this hair up here and remember you guys with the softbox you're not gonna want to go over same place twice I know the roll on into tempting because it's so easy to use to cover area I'm gonna go in with some both oil and our post emulsion lotion there's some oil in there we'll show you guys the backside and justice", "KypNADeYK1s": "[Music] do [Music] so today we're going to work on a solo arrangement of tears in heaven by the great eric clapton this song was actually voted on on my patreon page where every month we do a different tutorial based on suggestions and votes of my patrons so check it out in the link in the description below where you can download the tab that's on screen here too let's go and dive into tears in heaven starting with the intro so i think the intro is probably the hardest part of the song and it's also the most fun to play we're going to start here by spreading a g chord taking our index finger placing on the second fret of the c string and take your ring finger and place on the third fret of the e string now what you're going to do is instead of placing the middle finger on the a string which we usually do when we start a g we're going to leave it off we're going to pluck now the c and the e strings and you can use a lot of different combinations of fingers you'll notice what i prefer to do for most of the song is what's called forefinger picking which means my thumb's on my g string index is here on the c my middle here on the e and my ring finger here on the a there's actually a link to a seminar i did on this technique linked down below that you can check out another way that you can do it though is you can pluck with like the thumb and index or you can even just use your thumb to play those two whatever's comfortable it's okay and then we're going to play the open g string [Music] and then we're going to play open on the a and we're going to do a hammer-on to two on the a and then we're going to pull off this is really hard this is the thing i mentioned being probably the hardest part of the song and of course it's right at the beginning right but the trick to doing this is making sure that that ring finger excuse me that middle finger that's doing the hammer on is coming down on the string very perpendicular and then when you do the pull off portion you want to make sure that you actually pull the finger down and pluck the string so that very first part sounds something like that now if you're really struggling with it it's okay to take the other fingers off to see if you can get that hammer on and pull off to sound a little bit better and worst case scenario you can just play the two on the a and skip both the hammer on of zero to two as well as the pull off if those are too difficult for you so so far now we're going to play the open g right after that hammer on pull off from here we're going to go to our first chord change of it we're going to go to a d chord to do this we just take our index finger barred across the second fret take our pinky finger place on the fifth fret of the a string and we can pluck or using our thumb strum through all four strings either way works then we're gonna play the five on the a again then we're gonna switch chords again at the very end of this measure to an e minor to do this your index finger is going to move all the way down to the second fret on the a string middle comes up to three on the e and the ring comes up to four on the c with the pinky coming off so we have zero four three two we're gonna pluck that or strum through so the first measure is something like this now going in the second measure you'll notice the symbol is a lot frequently shown on the tab that 0 4 3 2 is in parentheses next to the one that we just played when you see that and they're tied across that just means that the notes continue to ring into this next measure so whenever you see that we don't play it a second time we just let it ring because the chord starts on the end of the first measure but rings into the beginning of the second and from here measure two is going to be all single notes we're gonna play the two on the a which is right there with our index finger already then we're going to play this little riff that's really fun to play you'll see the middle finger is already here on three of the e we're gonna play that and we're gonna immediately slide it to five so you'll notice on the notation there's that little line leading up to five that means we play the three and immediately slide it to five but here's where it gets even trickier right after we do that immediate slide we slide back down to 3 on the e so it goes like something like that so holding the e minor [Music] and then for the end of measure two we're going to play two on the c which you'll notice your index finger should be ready to go on and we're gonna hammer on to four on the c with the ring finger to get a good hammer on sound you want to make sure that that ring finger is going perpendicular to the string we don't want it to be relaxed like that that's not going to get a good sound perpendicular gives you the best hammer on sound and pretend that you're literally using your fingertip as a hammer and really hit it and maintain that contact so that sounds something like this that little riff starting with the five it goes [Music] and then measure three is going to be open we'll play the open c and open e strings together we're gonna take our ring finger place down the third fret of the a string play that by itself then we're gonna play a d7 to do this we just leave our ring finger here on three of the a take our index and bar it across two of the gc and e strings and we're going to pluck or strum with what's called staccato you'll notice on the music here these little dots above the chords those dots are a musical term called staccato which means to play things very short and the way that we do this is simply taking our left hand or rather a fretting hand and we're going to remove the pressure so that they're very short so we compress play remove compress play remove and then from there to finish this we're going to go to a g chord every day g index on two of the c ring on three of the e middle on two of the a pluck all four let it ring into measure four now and then we're going to pluck g c e a to finish that all off so it's a little bit easier there at the end here's measures three and four just so that you can hear it go something like and here is measures one through four so the entire intro part of the song should sound something like this [Music] now as we go on to measure five you'll notice now we're at the melody of the song and the reason this is so important is this is where we start with the actual words you'll notice it says would you know my name by the way one of the saddest songs of all time beautiful melody we'll talk more about that later but we notice now there are words associated so whenever you're doing a chord melody like this we're trying to intermix the melody notes which are often what's saying along with chords or harmony little fillers to make it sound more full so in this case on measure five you want to start playing the notes that don't have lyrics associated with them quieter and the notes that do have lyrics associated with them we want to play louder just to create that dynamic difference so when we start on measure five it's going to start with our g chord again everyday g index on 2c ring on 3e middle here on 2a we're going to play the c in e strings and then the g string nice and quiet then we're going to play 3 on the a louder because that's the word wood and then for u we're gonna play the three on the e nice and loud and for the word no we're gonna play a d chord this is a little bit of a tricky transition you'll notice it's actually the same that we played in measure one going from a g chord to a d so a quick tip is that index finger doesn't have to come off you can actually just pivot and slide it to bar across the second fret all the way and add the pinky finger on five of the a and we're gonna play that all four strings that's the word no then the word my we're gonna play the five on the a again and then we're going to switch to an e minor chord so index goes down to two on the a middle finger here on three of the e ring finger here on four of the c now that's measure five it's a bit of a doozy it looks something like this would you know my name now going into measure six some more filler action you'll notice all of measure 6 is filler so we want to play it nice and softly and it starts with the chord continuing to ring so that's what the little parentheses around the e minor chord are telling you but then it has the little line with a p which means pull off to zero on the a so what that is is after we play this we let ring for a moment then we're going to take our index and we're going to pluck the a string by doing a pull off so it goes so i'm physically plucking the string with my index finger that's the trick to getting a really good sound with your pull-offs let me play three on the e which is already there then we're gonna switch chords now to an e minor seven so the way that we do this is we have to take both of these fingers off the index goes to 2 on the c and the middle goes to 2 on the a we play just the c and e strings then the g then the a they're at 2 on the a and that's that filler so that measures something like this starting with e minor as we go into measure seven we play our c chord again three on the a for the c note there if i so that starts back with the word so the c is quiet if i a little bit louder then we go to our g chord another pull off we really like these embellishment techniques with this song so zero two three two g chord index middle and ring with the index on two of the c ring on three of the e middle on two of the a pluck all four strings or strum through them and then do a pull off to open on the a so this is exactly the same as the intro the exact same little pull off technique instead of doing a hammer on and pull off we just have to pull off so if you're finding that difficult again you want to make sure that you're plucking the string so you'll notice my finger is bent this way when i start and when i do a pull off oftentimes i'll let it go recessed so that i can get a good connection coming off if that's too difficult you can just not do the pull off and play open a and that's totally fine as well let me play three on the e which is already there the two on the a just add the middle finger back on and then to continue on with this we're going to go to measure eight we're gonna play a d chord it's a little tricky um you know d chords are uh they can be tricky and the way that i like to play this is the index finger barred in what we call a partial bar so what that means is my index finger is going to bar across the g c and e strings and it's going to raise off so that the a string is open this takes some kind of yoga for your fingers of getting that bend so that the e string is going right in that little slit so that you can bend off of it took me a long time to get comfortable with it but once i got comfortable with i never played a d another way if you're finding that really difficult to play you can also play it with three fingers stacking your index middle and ring and that's okay too but we're going to play those three strings the c e and a and then g c e then we're going to continue with this filler because you'll notice this is the word then of heaven and then filler the first filler thing that we're going to play here for a chord change is we're going to go to four and three on the c and e what we do is we leave our index finger where it was take the ring finger add it on four of the c middle finger on three of the e and play that just the c and the e strings and now the index can come off it doesn't need to be playing anymore i'm going to slide it up two frets to six and five to get the completion of that little filler so let's hear measures seven and eight real quick it's something like this if i saw you in heaven right and here's all of measures five six seven and eight should sound something like this would you know my name if i saw you in heaven so you'll notice i play those filler notes softer right because they're meant to be more in the background so sounds really good it's a lot of fun to play if you're struggling with some of those filler notes only play the notes that have lyrics with them that's a really easy way to make sure that you're playing [Music] just the song that you know so kind of a little tip if you're struggling with it so now as we go on to measures 9 10 11 and 12 it's actually pretty cool because these measures are exactly identical to 5 6 7 8 except for one note literally every single note is exactly the same except one note and that one note is here on measure nine so we start with the same g chord going to the same d chord but and then instead of playing the five on the a a second time we play open on the a which is tricky so what we do here is we just take our hand off now the reason for this is because we're immediately going to our e minor so it's okay to have that hand kind of come off but other than that other than that one note that zero on the a for the word the of the same it's exactly the same 9 10 11 12 are exactly the same to 5 6 7 8 which is kind of neat so measure 9 going all the way through should sound something like this would it be the same if i saw you in heaven exactly the same right so again we want to create those layers by playing our melody notes louder and more pronounced and our harmony notes our non-melody notes a little bit softer make it a nice differential so from here we go on to measure 13 which is actually sort of the you know the if that's the verse this is kind of the chorus you could call it section a b whatever it's uh the next part of the song it's gonna go to an e minor chord here so to do this we just take our ring finger place on the fourth fret of the c string middle finger here on the third fret of the e string and index here on the second fret of the a and we're going to actually just play our g c and e strings to start and that's a filler note you notice there's no lyric then we're gonna play four on the c and then three on the e which is our first melody note i and play it again must and then open on the a so we're moving that index finger for the word b and then we're going to go to strong and here it goes to actually a b chord and and this is kind of cool because our e minor chord that we play here if we move it all up one string so not a fret but a string so instead of being zero four three two it becomes four three two zero we get our b it's a b7 chord but we're working on it here for b and we pluck our g c and e strings kind of cool right so it goes [Music] and after we play that we've got some filler that's going to take place we're going to just play g c e a for measure 14. pretty straightforward 13 into 14 should sound something like this i must be strong and then we go on to 15. we're gonna play a d minor chord just like the d chord there's a special way to play d minor that you should work on um to eventually get comfortable with that's much more difficult but once you have it much much better of a of a fingering and what that is is this it's just the index and middle fingers so earlier when we did the d chord with just the index we did that partial bar right where the a string is open with this one it's even trickier because now it's just the middle finger is barred across the g and the c leaving the e and the a strings both open so that then the index can come onto one of the e i remember the first time i saw somebody play this chord i thought it was physically impossible but i assure you it's not and it's a very good way of playing the chord my big trick for it is have that middle finger come up over the fretboard a bit because i'm trying to stick the c string right into the divot here on my finger where it sort of bends backwards middle finger does not have much flexibility and so we want to make use of every little advantage we get so that's my favorite way of a d minor you can practice that if you're struggling with that a lot it's totally fine to play a d minor like this two on the g with our middle finger two on the c with our ring one on the e with our index both are going to be fine and then we're going to play two on the c and then one on the e for the words and care and then re we're gonna add the three on the e with our ring finger here and then at the end of measure 15 it switches to an e7 chord to do this we take our index placed on one of the g middle finger on two of the c and eventually we're going to play the a string but not yet so just have those two fingers there pluck the g c and e strings we're going to play open on the a and then we're going to add that 2 on the a for the cuz i so 15 and 16 should sound something like this and carry on and now all of these measures measures 13 14 15 and 16 should be something like this i must be strong [Music] now we're in a full e7 chord here right so don't move that chord as we go on to measure 17 because what we're going to do is take our middle finger off and then slide both fingers up one fret it's actually really easy to go to this a minor chord two zero zero three index on two of the g ring on three of the a and we strum through all four or pick all four again it doesn't really matter which technique whatever tone you're looking for then we're gonna play open on the a and open on a again so that's no i don't then we're gonna play three on the e with the ring finger b and then we're going to go to a d chord here for the word long belong and we're going to bar across the second fret and what's cool is we can actually bar completely across the second fret because we're not going to play the a string for a while and when we do we're going to need two on the a string so bar all the way across for this d even though it's only two on the g and two on the c for the word long it's going to set us up and so let's kind of rewind just a bit measure 17 so it's no i don't be long and then 18 has these two little fillers same little staccato plucking of the d chord that we did earlier right instead of being a d7 all the way it's just the g c and e strings [Music] then we're gonna play two on the a which is there on the full bar here then take everything off open a twice and have and then we go to in heaven which we're gonna get to in just a moment so let's go and hear what this whole thing sounds like measure 17 and 18. it goes like this [Music] now when we go to vin we're going to actually go back to the intro of the song so the very beginning of the song that we played we're going to play the exact same thing for measures 19 and 20. they're exactly the same as 1 and 2. so the same little riff all of that is exactly the same to what we played in measures one and two so that's kind of neat if you got comfortable with one and two 19 and 20 should be pretty straightforward but then 21 and 22 are going to end the song so it's a little bit different here to start with 21 we're going to play the open c and e which is exactly what we did on measure 3. we're going to play the 3 on the a also the same as 3 but now it changes we're still gonna go to that same d7 chord two two two three barring your index across the second fret of the g c and e strings with your a already threaded there with three on the ring we're gonna pluck our c e and a and then we're gonna do g c e now when i do this part when i play this i like to slow it down a lot because it's the end of the song we want to convey a little bit more emotion so when i get to measure 21 i really really really slow it down and as we go into 22 22 starts off the same way as one it's exactly the same which is uh excuse me that starts off the same as measure 19 or 1 not 21. uh measure 22 is the same as 19 the beginning of the outro or one the beginning of the intro and it's going to do that little riff but then it's going to go all the way up to 0 11 on the c string with the middle finger and then 10 on the e and the a with the index bard strum all the way through all four that's a really pretty g chord to kind of end it so 22 exactly the same as 19 or 1 until this chord and because we started slowing down on measure 21 we continue slowing down through this to kind of end it so here's what the outro sounds like starting at 19 with the then of heaven so it should be something like this then [Music] and that ends the tune tears in heaven this is one of my favorite arrangements i've actually done here on this channel because it's so much fun to play and it really makes use of those embellishment techniques like hammer-ons pull-offs and slides and the reason for that is because it's a clapton song and clapton's kind of the you know king of guitar at least one of them so we really wanted to to pay respect to that by including as many of those little embellishments as we can it's a really fun one to play a lot of bar chords and other things to work on and remember if you're struggling with it just play the melody just find those lyric words and you can still have some fun with it as always if you have any questions feel free to leave them down in the comments below as well as if you haven't already please check out my patreon page which is linked down below it's really thanks to all my patrons i'm able to make these lessons here on youtube and if you're a patreon patron thank you so much for your support i can't tell you how much it means to me i'll look forward to seeing what you guys think up for next month's tutorial and i'll see you then take it easy you", "APKSTn5zRt4": "hey guys it's Nikki and today we'd be doing an honest review of the Sally Hansen hair removal wax drip kit and apparently it's the number one waxing brand in the u.s. fa and so I kind of wanted to see what this would be like because I have used hair removal products in the past and I've also used Nair on my legs before and that has always been okay but there's always the possibility of getting a chemical burn which is not safe to do and I've definitely gotten a chemical burn before from using there so I feel like this is going to be a good thing to try to do an honest review form and I've also heard some pretty good things about this product but I wanted to see for myself and for you guys to see if this was actually a product that you should go out and purchase so basically in this kit you get six extra large waxing strips and 24 regular large waxing strips and so this is what the extra large looks like it's kind of hard to see because it's a little bit transparent well that's kind of what it looks like and here is the regular large strip I guess if I put in four am I sure it's better to see here's the extra large and here is the large so the largest basically half the size of the extra large strip and it also comes with this finishing oil which is supposed to remove any of the wax residue and also remorse dereyes skin so let's go ahead and let's try this okay so first thing you have to do is pick a wax strip I'm going to go with the regular large wax strip for now and you have to warm it up with your hands in a gentle way just to kind of warm up the wax and the selling point about this waxing kit is that there's no mess there's no microwave involved so you basically have a safe temperature to apply to your legs so you're not overheating and burning yourself while you're waxing okay I think I've warmed it up enough and you have to go ahead afterwards and you need to pull these apart China okay this is kind of cool okay there we go so then you have to pull it apart okay I don't know which side is the waxing side I'm assuming it's the Sally Hansen so I'm going to get my leg put it here and I guess I'll put it right here for you guys you have to put it in the direction of the hair grow so guess like that then after that to go ahead and you have pull in the direction of the hair very quickly and they specify that stretch skin with one hand pull strip off very quickly in the opposite direction of hair growth I'm going to go like this pull it back like they want me to and then make at the edge okay I'm not looking forward to this bar the stair it's so bad and you have to pull back really really quickly ow oh my god that hurts so freakin bad holy crap so there is definitely a good amount of hair here and my leg is super super baby smooth now holy crap whoa that is like the smoothest wax I've ever done at home by myself wowza okay just so you guys can kind of see I don't know if you can see it's kind of hard to see the hairs I kind of have these long sort of blonde baby hair so it's kind of hard to see what it looks like it's pretty pretty good I have not seen a wax strip kit that has been this good and honestly I mean it hurt really bad but your waxing yourself you should expect vents that are hurt so I also think that it's really important to use the extra-large strip too during this review because I feel like because it is so big that the results can vary based on just the amount of wax you have my theory is that it will pick up as much hair as the smaller condensed large strip so I thought we'll take a look and see if it has the same result as the large strip so I've warmed it up with my hands and now I'm going to rip this so you have to put it in the direction of the hair grow and then slide it down oh oh my god that hurts so bad Wow oh my god that hurt really really really bad but it looks super super super baby smooth my god that's a really really baby smooth Wow after you wax your leg it says that after hair removal apply a small amount of the finishing oil to the treated area with cotton ball or tissue to wipe away any wax residue and help remoisturize the skin so I have a tissue here and I'm just gonna oh that actually smells really nice I thought it was gonna smell sort of kattiline and it doesn't okay so I'm gonna apply a small amount to the tissue like they want I just put a little bit this is really really moisturizing and really relaxing and it's removing all the rest of your wax also reading through the directions I'm starting to realize that this isn't just for legs it's also for arms for your armpits it even says that you could use this on your neck area and bikini area so the box also says that results can last up to eight weeks and that obviously varies on the individual and it also says that it can help to slow the appearance of regrowth which i think is really really cool um basically it's hard to give a full review in such a short amount of time because I would like to see how these wax strips are going to look in eight weeks or even two weeks or even a week from now so I think I'm probably gonna do a follow-up video as well to this video to see how it looks compared to when I started basically in that respect I think that this is a really really cool product and I if I felt like I was going to like a fancy event or a wedding or whatever I think I would totally buy this again and use it I personally don't know if I would use it on something sensitive like my armpits or my bikini line because I feel like you have to have a high pain tolerance to handle that but if you are like hardcore and you just want to go ahead and do what you do and like rip off your hair on your bikini line and be fearless I say go for it that concludes my review for the hair removal wax drip kit from Sally Hansen I totally would recommend this to a friend or even family I think that this is a good product so far I will make a follow-up video in a week or two to kind of show the results so far and if it really is um kind of reducing the appearance of regrowth of hair and even if it lasts up to eight weeks or however long it might so stay tuned for the next video and I'll see you guys next time bye", "N-NJXtQn_M0": "a lot of people think that crispus addicts invented addicts he did not but he was a very important figure in the american revolution now a lot of people also think that krispy kreme donuts invented donuts they did not but they were also very revolutionary snacks with wax krispy kreme donuts the alliteration in krispy kreme is cute and all but you got to be careful with alliteration with the letter k you know what i mean two's company three's a crowd and it's not a good crowd lucky they don't sell kimchi i'm just here to try the glazed donut that's what i want oh it's hot holy moly oh my god you know that expression that feels like i'm floating on a cloud it feels like i'm floating on a cloud and eating that exact same cloud that i'm floating on eating this krispy kreme donut straight off the conveyor belt is pure joy you know how people always say it's the simple things in life because life is really so meaningless when you really think about it in terms of like the larger scale that we have to say that because really the only joy we can get that's any type of near purity is the simple things this is the epitome of one of those simple things it's the cure to any existential crisis it's the cure to any mid-life crisis one which i'm going through and when you drink the coffee like you don't need a lot of sugar in this coffee because there's so much in the donut they're just such a perfect union it makes me think of sunny and cher or who's another sunny and cher like uh abbott and costello costello laurel and hardy bartles and james do we have any modern references lil uzi vert and megan the stallion they're together right is that true i don't know upon picking up the chocolate one i can tell with my finger senses that it's a lower temperature not as fresh the glaze it goes from liquid to solid but it's good either way it's good as a liquid then the cream crispifies and it becomes solid that's what a krispy kreme donut is it's not crispy or creamy it's not cream because cream cannot be crispy inherently the only way to crispify cream is to make cream crispy into a donut therefore it is no longer cream and it has gone from cream to donut i got a degree in donatology when me and herbs were children and teenagers we went to catholic church with our family and once a month they would have donut day so on that sunday they would sell boxes of krispy kreme donuts and that was the one day the one sunday that we were like cool we're going to church you know what i mean and i always would think like why don't they sell it every sunday first of all to get people excited to go to church and also why don't they just use this as the holy communion if the catholic church used these krispy kreme donuts instead of the styrofoam wafers as communion as the body of christ because we all know the body of christ wasn't made of styrofoam wafers anyway so why not just say it was this delicious donut the church will be full every sunday the roman empire never would have fallen the spanish conquistadors could have conquered the aztecs without a single use of a sword pope would be fat as you know what i mean he'd live in vatican city it would just be more popular you know [Applause] i think that's what it is that's what i would say you're all good yeah yeah yeah good job on the donut donuts are great y'all thank you did you just throw away a shitload of them yeah we have to throw them away after 12 hours damn we used to give them away but people sued the store there's a homeless lady that just waits for them to throw away those donuts and just fills up her shopping cart with i mean with a hundred dollars they literally had like 200 donuts at least well you got a top on them i don't know it's probably pretty they probably have 400 i'd say you know texas hold on the word nuts when it's the best hand you could possibly have yeah you got the nuts this is the best dough you could possibly have you're trying to eat that one yeah i was expecting it to be more yellow like a boston cream or whatever the cream that's in like a normal doughnut not in boston anymore toto may not be boston cream but you sure like seem like you have more than a feeling about that this white stuff and the brown stuff to me tastes identical if you're familiar with a tootsie roll it's like chocolate but it's not really chocolate i mean a tootsie roll doesn't even taste like chocolate that's way better than i thought it was gonna be the workers here are cool the donuts here are delicious and the coffee is downright vivacious i give this place a nine out of ten and not to mention this place is open 24 7 so come on in whenever you want [Music] [Music] the snack choice this week was suggested by my boy kurt b let us know in the comments what should we review next", "x3uCW6EyGQQ": "[Music] Oh before anything you start with putting in your waxed which is this right here and if you can see it has a roll on so basically you just slide it in like that all the way inside and it are you important to note is that you need to prepare this ahead of time because you do need to have it warm for about thirty minutes before you're gonna um do it so basically you just slip in the AC core do it in plug it in let it sit for about thirty minutes so this little B right here the little logo and I think you can kind of see it where it turns on there's a little red light so that means it's warming I'm going to be trying this wax on him since he has much more coarser and much more hair than I do and so I'm gonna go ahead and do that for him and hopefully he's a really good trooper by letting me try it on him first and then I'm gonna do myself I decided that I would show you I opened one of the little packets of the removal wipes and they really are feel like a good quality they feel cloth like this feel like actual cloth and you can kind of see it you hear it um I've had other wax kits that um the little removal strip feels very very delicate and I've had some break apart in my hands and so I really do enjoy the quality of this strip after 30 minutes you need to check on a strip paper to see if it goes on smoothly if it doesn't then just leave it for an additional 10 to 20 minutes and then if it starts going smoothly then you can go use it so this is the area that we're gonna wax um right here it's just part of a area that he decided he wanted to get rid of and as you can see as the wax starts warming up you can see a little pink show from the wax and so now his um this area has already just taken a shower it's been washed dried clean and so it's ready to apply now you have to apply it in the same direction as the hair growth and one thing I do want to mention here and maybe you can tell see how it's still kind of tacky I still had to leave it warm up a little bit longer and you can tell because it didn't smoothly remove all of the area and it was a little bit more painful that way so once I warmed it up very well and it was more of a runny consistency my husband said you could it wasn't painful at all also um when you were going to remove it you remove it and the opposite on the opposite of the hair growth so in this case if the hair growth is going down you pull it the opposite way also um my husband was very stubborn and he doesn't want to trim his longer hair it is recommended to avoid any skin and you can damage or also to have uneven hair removal you need to trim the longer hairs now here are all the wax strips we used in order to remove his hair and as you can see it's very well quite full and we used many many strips but it was it was successful it was a pretty good removal as you can see by this picture right here it did remove quite a bit and then after we did remove it we use the little finishing wipes and they're very good it's a very nice light fragrance and it's like an oil to soothe the skin after it's been you know waxed and irritated which wasn't painful at all my husband it was much easier than he imagined and keeping the temp remain in a good temperature and it made it really easy actually um it would have helped if he would have trimmed the long hairs but in overall it was a very successful hair removal and now I'm gonna try it on myself okay so I just finished training myself but it was very hard to remove first of all you can hardly see my hair second of all so the little that you can't see since it's so thin it's very difficult for the wax to actually grab onto and remove so there was areas that it didn't miss so I did my arm my underarm area and there were areas that were not removed completely that is one of the areas that I do actually have more thicker hair but even so it didn't completely remove all of my hair I would say out of a hundred percent it probably removed 75 which is still not that bad but not as you know in my husband's opinion he doesn't want to come out in camera but did he did not in it this did remove a hundred percent agreement that I don't have to worry about guessing the correct temperature of having to reheat it in the microwave or hurrying up and using it and then going back why did you have to warm it up according to instructions was thirty minutes it wasn't three minutes that I did the wax needed to preheat for about 40 minutes 45 minutes in order to be at a more manageable temperature where the wax would actually glide on easily and I was moving remove hair let's see I do like that it's very easy to use you don't have to worry about this slipping because it does come with a really really good um little grip here on both sides so this doesn't slip while using it I do like that it's much less messier than any conventional exes that I've used in the past all the spilling and the little spatulas or whatever you get a little bit here but you know that nothing remained up I did my husband's area of hair removal was pretty big and I did my underarms and look this is the little refill and it's only down to here and we did a pretty big area so it's only like a quarter or less than a quarter of the of the whole whack so definitely will be buying more for hand I personally will not be using it because like I said wax I've discovered is not for me since the type of hair that I have is not the type of hair that can easily be removed with wax um but for him he definitely did like it he will be using it again and like I said the racks the literal cartridge seems to last a good amount of time so that's gonna that's good and like I said is that you know you have to preheat it for a good 40 minutes 45 minutes which you know you have to plan out your waxing well ahead of time other than that I general I think I would give it a seven or eight for my personal use I don't give it anything lower because it's not really the waxes fault that I have very thin hair and my husband gives it a nine because it's very easy it was relatively pain-free I mean it wasn't anything excruciating like he's had before mostly because I think he's burned himself so that's good you're getting of the temperature and if it's okay or if you're gonna bring yourself so yes we will be using this in the future my husband well I won't just because I don't have enough hair for it to grab on but in general yes we're pretty happy so thank you Influenster think you beat for this awesome awesome product and I do awesome because it did remove my hair at my husband's hair so yeah I have a less hairier will husband and so thanks for watching and I hope I didn't bore you guys see you in the next video bye", "aNDaoF4QxM0": "hey everybody welcome back in today's lesson I'm gonna be going over what I deemed to be the prettiest ukulele song in the world I posted this on YouTube a few years back and I got a lot of comments and questions on it so I thought I would do a new in-depth tutorial kind of explaining the chords and the strum patterns for the song a little more in-depth than I did before so join me today and we're gonna go through this song I'm gonna play you the whole song and then we're gonna break down each section going through the chords as well as the strum pattern and then we're gonna have a little chance for you guys to play the song along with me so you can work on the song at home yourself so thanks for stopping by and let's get into it so first I'm going to play the entire song for you guys in real time so you can hear and see what I'm doing as far as the court progression goes and the strumming pattern and then we're going to break it down into the left hand and the right hand and eventually put that all together so you guys can play this song on your own all right so let's take a look at the chords we're gonna use here for this song so we're gonna start off with an a major chord so the a major is played with our middle finger on the second fret on the g string and our index finger on the C string on the first fret and that sounds like this [Music] our second chord is a major 7 so what I'm going to do is I'm going to put my index finger on the first fret on the g string and my middle finger will also be on the first fret on the C string and if you guys want play along as we go here to make sure your chords are sounding the same if they sound a little different make sure that you're in tune and also make sure that you're getting all of the strings to ring out equally as you go our 3rd chord is the a7 chord and that's also a major chord and that's just going to be played here with my middle finger on the C string on the first fret the 4th chord is an a 9 chord so I'm gonna keep my in my middle finger down here on the C string on the first fret and I'm going to add my pinky to the a string on the 2nd fret and that looks like this [Music] the next chord is a D major chord you can play this a couple different ways the way that I prefer to play it especially for this song is with my middle finger on the g string 2nd fret my ring finger on the C string 2nd fret and my pinky finger on the E string so kind of crunching all my fingers in here for this chord you'll notice my hand is kind of tilted a little bit towards the headstock of the instrument here that gives my fingers better ability to space or not space but crunch in here or this deeper another way to play the D chord is by compressing all three G C and E strings down at the same time with the pad of either your middle finger your ring finger or your index finger so try those different options see what works best for you I prefer this way for play the next chord is the D minor chord so very similar to the D major chord I'm going to keep my middle finger on the C star on the g string 2nd fret ring finger C string 2nd fret and now I'm going to have my index finger on the 1st fret on the E string and that sounds like this I'll also note that it's very important to make sure you're staying on your finger tips if you notice here I'm bending my fingers at my last knuckle here so my fingers are not upright like this my fingers really are bent almost at a 90 degree angle and my thumb is behind that chord squeezing the chord down so your thumb position should typically be intersecting the middle of the chord where you're playing the final chord that I'm going to show you is the Kord and that is played with your middle finger on the g string 2nd fret and your index finger on the 1st fret on the E string and that sounds like this so those are the chords we're going to use for the prettiest ukulele song in the world ok let's talk a little bit about the strumming pattern that we're using here for this song there's a couple different strumming patterns that I'm going to use so I'm going to break each one of them down individually the first pattern that I use and I'm going to be playing this with an a major chord so if you want to follow along this pattern is down down up up down up so with my index finger sweet spot that I like to use for strumming is from the back of the sound hole here to about where the neck meets the body of the instrument so you'll see me strumming kind of in this general region so the pattern is [Music] so let's just do that together really slowly here now I'm not really getting very big with my strum here I'm keeping it within the confines of the body of the instrument so that's important especially as you get into more intricate strumming patterns for having your timing stay on board keeping very concise with your strum so that's the one pattern that we're gonna use the next pattern that we use is kind of a staccato bouncing down strum so you'll hear this part when I'm playing the D chord in the song and that pattern simply goes like this so what I do is I kind of cut my fingers and do a little bit of a C shape and as I do that I play the chord and I release my left hand so that I'm still touching the strings but I'm not compressing the strings down so you'll hear the note or you'll hear these chord stop after I play it so that when you do that multiple times in a row will kind of give you this bouncing effect so I play the three strings for the D chord if you strum all the way through you got to make sure that you get all of the strings muted with your left hand so let's do that together slowly here so I use that in the B section of the song and then let's talk about the little quadruplet strum pattern that I use towards the second half of the B section so this part here that I'm using I use on the a chord in the B section the last chord of the B section so that strumming pattern I'm gonna go down with my index finger down with my thumb up with my thumb down with my index finger so [Music] so let me play that a little closer to the tempo of the song now on the very last time I play the a chord of the B section I add one extra up strum as we go back into the a section so it's [Music] okay so at the end of the a section you'll notice there's a little variance in my strumming pattern from the down down-up up-down-up so I just wanted to go a little more in-depth of exactly what I'm doing at that part for you so after we do so that's the variance there right at the end so let me show you how to do that so I'm gonna be holding the a 9 chord for this part so refer back to the chord section or the PDF chart for this and you're gonna be doing an up strum and it's a staccato up strum so what I'm doing with my right hand is I'm just doing an up strum but to give it that kind of staccato effect I'm muting with my left hand so to do that I basically take my fingers and I decompress them from the strings but I keep my fing fingers touching the strings as I do it so so the first 3 strums are on a 9 and then I pull my pinky off with my left hand and I do an up strum with the a7 so let's do that together slowly here so it's a nine a seven so that is the little nuance and the strumming technique that occurs at the end of the a section let's go ahead now and do a play along for the prettiest ukulele song in the world so I'm going to do this repetition at about fifty to sixty percent of the actual song tempo for you so grab your uke make sure it's tuned up get in good playing position and let's try to play this song together at about fifty to sixty percent of the actual song tempo here so I'll give us a one two three four count and then join in with me one two three [Music] all right so that is about closer to 75% of what the actual song tempo is now let's do a play along closer to the full tempo of the song and I will also include a tempo marking on the PDF worksheets that I have attached to this video so you can check out all of the chords charts and strumming patterns in a physical copy that you can download from my website so let's go through this now at full speed thanks for watching make sure you hit the subscribe button below for more killer ukulele lessons also make sure you stop by all four EUCOM where I

[Music] do [Music] [Laughter] do [Music] you", "ZHUEFLwEtMA": "welcome to another ukulele tutorial I'm Lara and today I'm going to show you how to understand chord diagrams and how to read tablature chord diagrams represent the chord shapes that we play with our left hand as we strum the chords and sing through a song tablature on the other hand shows the notes that we're playing to finger pick a melody we'll start off by looking at chord diagrams and I'll teach you five key tips to understand how to play these chords we'll look at several different chord examples after that we'll move into tablature and I'll share with you five key tips to reading tablature and finger picking a melody we'll look at a song example of a famous song that you will likely recognize now let's get started with our chords the first thing to understand is how your strings relate to the lines in the chord diagram the vertical lines in any chord diagram represents from left to right strings four three two and one so from left to right you can also think of it as g c e a chord diagrams generally show five frets so if we look at the squares at the top the first row is the first fret the second row is a second fret and then we have the third fourth and fifth fret the next thing to understand about chord diagrams is that an open circle indicates an open string so there are no frets played on that string a closed black circle indicates that that fret is played the first chord that we'll look at is c6 notice the open circles at the top of each string on the chord diagram this means that every string is left open we don't have any fingers of our left hand on any strings this is the easiest chord to play I want to point out that I'm playing a tenor with a low G if you have a high G on your instrument you can follow this entire tutorial just keep in mind that when we play our chords they'll sound slightly different because your fourth string will be one octave higher than mine now let's take a look at our G chord the fourth string is open the third string will play the second fret on the second string we'll play the third fret and on the first string we'll play the second fret this is the most common fingering for G however some people on certain occasions may switch the index and middle fingers generally for transitioning between g and other chords this is the finger you want to use with your index finger on the third string ring finger on the second string and middle finger on the first string the next piece to understand is that in general you will create your own fingering for these chords there are some occasions when you might see the fingerings on the chord diagram and we'll take a look at this but most often the fingerings are up to you now let's take a look at our E minor seven chord for this chord we have open circles above our fourth string and second string so those two strings will be left open we have closed circles on the second fret of the third string and the first string so we will play those two frets notice that I'm playing this chord with my index finger and my middle finger this is just one option I could also play it with my middle finger and my ring finger you can experiment with different chord fingerings and you might have a preference based on how comfortable the different fingerings are and also which chords you're transitioning from and transitioning to as an example I may want to use this fingering of middle and ring finger to play E minor seven when I'm transitioning to a minor [Music] on the other hand I may want to use my index and middle fingers to play this chord when I'm transitioning to see the nice thing about chords is that it's entirely up to you how you would like to play them on rare occasions you might actually see left hand fingerings indicated on a chord here's an example this is a g chord and it's showing two three and four indicating our index finger as finger number two middle is number three and ring finger is number four so this diagram is showing us that our second finger should be in the third string our third finger should be in the first string and our fourth finger should be on the second string the next tip is that if you see multiple circles across one fret you can play them with one finger rather than playing them with multiple fingers across the various strings this is called a barre chord I'll put a link above to my short tutorial on Barre chords if you want to learn how to play them I walk you through five essential tips to make them much easier to play let's take a look at an example of a barre chord this is C minor I'm playing the 3rd fret across strings one two and three I'm only using my index finger to play this chord another option for playing this chord is to use your index middle and ring fingers to play these three strings you can try it both ways and see which one you prefer the last piece to understanding chord diagrams is that four chords that are play at higher up the neck you might see a number on the diagram that indicates which fret to start on let's take a look at an example of a chord that's played higher up the neck this is a D chord keep in mind that chords can be played multiple waves up and down the neck you may have seen D as a second fret across strings two three and four this is a different fingering for D and it starts on the fifth fret looking at this chord diagram you'll notice the number five and the letters F are to the right of what is usually our first fret this is an indication that this chord actually starts on the fifth fret there are two closed circles on strings one and two so I'm going to play these two with my index finger next we're moving one fret upped to go to string three which I'll play with my middle finger and then one more fret up on the fourth string which I'll play with my ring finger the tip to keep in mind here is that if you see a number two the top right of the chord diagram then that number is the fret that this chord starts on if you're enjoying this tutorial please give it a thumbs up and thank you so much for subscribing now we're moving into tablature tablature is a form of musical notation that's different than sheet music and it allows us to read all the frets that are played for finger style ukulele when we read tablature will be finger picking the notes so it's important to have a bit of background on finger picking if this is new to you I'll put a link above to my tutorial on finger picking 101 where I walk you through some of the essential fundamentals the first step in reading tablature is understanding the correlation between your strings and the lines in the tablature it's different than what we saw in the chord diagrams let's take a close look at this tablature is displayed with the strings and horizontal lines there are four strings so you can look at these as either a down to G or string one down to string for the next piece to understand is that the numbers that you see in the tablature represent which fret is intended to be played on each string the numbers do not represent which fingers of your and play these notes that's often a piece of confusion so remember that the numbers represent the frets as an example we'll use the first line of the chorus from the song you've lost that lovin feeling notice the numbers above the bars that separate each measure these indicate the numbers of the measure and they don't impact how you play the song but they're there for reference for example if you're playing in a group and you all want to start together partway through the song then you can reference a certain measure to start on looking at the first measure the number three is shown three times on the a string this means that we should play the third fret of the a string three times moving into the second measure we have five zero five zero still on our a string this means that we play the fifth fret followed by a zero is an open string and the fifth fret again and then another open string in the third measure we have a rest and then two zero two so we'll play the second fret open string and then second fret again in the fourth measure we're bringing in our second string for our E string we're going to go back and forth between the first string and the second string on the third fret now here's what it looks like if I play through this entire line [Music] now remember that you get to decide which left-hand fingers you want to use to play the melody and it's also up to you which of your right-hand fingers you would like to use to pick the strings the next tip for understanding tablature is that you may play more than one note at the same time let's take a look at an example let's look at our sample line again and you'll notice that I've added more numbers underneath our second note there are now three zeros notice that they're all stacked on top of each other and that means that they should all be played at the same time there are two ways that we could play this the first way to play this chord is to finger pick all four strings at the same time the second way is to play all four strings at once in a Down strum for the first measure the two options would sound like this either or [Music] if we look at the second measure instead of playing only the fifth fret of our first string we now have three fives listed as well as a zero so this means that we're playing the fifth fret on strings one through three and the fourth string is open here's what this sounds like so our two options for playing the second measure would sound like this either or our third measure has not changed however we do have some additional numbers at the beginning of our fourth measure instead of playing only the third fret of the first string we're also going to play the third fret of the second string and then we have two zeros four strings three and four indicating open strings here are the two options for playing this measure the first is the second is [Music] here's a look at this entire line [Music] the next tip is that sometimes tablature will also list the chords playing the chords is optional and generally you'll want to play either the courts or the tablature sometimes you can play both at the same time but this can be a bit confusing when people start learning tablature so let's take a look at an example of this now here's another look at this line with the chords added in above the measures you'll see C F G and C if you were to play this song by strumming the chords or finger picking the chords you would use these chord changes as a guide in general you'll want to either follow the chords or follow the tablature if you want to combine the chords and the fingerstyle melody here's an example of what you could do on this line you could play the C chord at the beginning of the first measure and the G chord at the beginning of the third measure here's what this would sound like [Music] [Music] the last tip is that our petty OHS will have a squiggly arrow next to them and arpeggio is when a chord is played out note by note rather than played all at once let's take a look at this notation now we'll go back to our sample line where we had the additional notes you'll notice now I've added squiggly arrows next to these notes these indicate arpeggios when we play an arpeggio we want to hear the individual notes so instead of playing them all together we're going to play through it more slowly notice the direction of these arrows they're pointing toward the a-string this means that these arpeggios are played like this you may also see an arpeggio pointing in the opposite direction toward the g string that would be played this way it's much more common to play arpeggios in a downward motion toward the a string here's what this line sounds like incorporating the three arpeggios [Music] I hope this tutorial has helped you to better understand chord diagrams and how to read tablature now have fun with your ukelele and thank you so much for watching you", "bGk1yG6nIfs": "the great gatsby what a masterpiece of a book it's

twizzlers collab jacket on you know what i'm saying to commemorate the moment let's take a peek i mean we know what twizzlers are they look like the braids of a redheaded person you know if you had this as your hairstyle you'd have corn syrup rose these look like what drumsticks turn into when you're on acid i can't keep time on my beat because time is non-linear it's all an illusion if you made a gingerbread nightclub this is what the velvet rope would look like outside you see all these claymation characters standing there waiting to get in the club speaking of claymation characters a really depressed claymation character would tie this into a noose you know what i mean is that too much gumby attaches this to his harness when he goes mountain climbing or do you think gumby free solos i don't know gumby is an old reference even for me i know what you're thinking you're like hey wax what else is going to happen are the california raisins going to make hammocks out of them these things are like a rope being that they're a rope why don't they sell them in like a spool you know like bubble tape they could do a twizzler spool i think they do sell like just really like long ones really that could be red vines i don't know i think it's the the word spool sounds weird it sounds like stool and splooge and it just sounds gross it's not like tape which maybe tape sounds gross too but tape worm i think that's actually a genius marketing idea twizzler spool yeah absolutely you know if you get them at the movie theater they just like what length you want and they just kind of like if you go to like a like uh if you go to michael's arts and crafts in my fabric what length twizzler do you want speaking of movie theaters this is true by the way twizzlers other than popcorn are the most eaten foods at a movie theater that makes me think it's not just movie theaters taking a hit during the pandemic it's also all things associated with the movie theaters like twizzlers or even movie theater popcorn suppliers conspiracy theory the coronavirus was invented by microwave popcorn companies because they're probably killing it right pop secret indeed what is your secret pop secret a laboratory where you're making coronavirus the fda walks in for a random checkup what are you guys doing here pop secret they're like just making new butters i picture it as like you know it's a conspiracy in that there's like a zoom call between uh orville redenbacher the dude from jiffy pop and the pop secret board act 3 or whatever covet 19 which is a conspiracy between the 19 microwave popcorn leading brands and we're here to take down big pop you know the mafia family meetings where like all the different families get together it's just like the mafia of popcorn yeah when they find orville and redenbacher dead in the back of a studebaker poorville and redenbacher when they find both orbital and because that's two different people orville and redenbacher oh i'm thinking of uh you're thinking of the wright brothers orville and wilbur oh i am i am i am orville redenbacher when orville ran reading by when orville redenbacher's found dead in the back of studebaker with tommy gun wounds to the face we're going to know that he's the one that's snitched we're talking about twizzlers right talking twizz you know licorice candy forget all that nonsense let's get down to beeswax which is probably what those taste like i don't get it i don't get it dude you know when you're a kid and you blow out the candles in a birthday cake and you lick the frosting off the candle and you get you get one lick you get all the frosting then try another lick and you just taste the birthday candle this just tastes like that back in school did you ever chew on the top of a pen um it tastes like a pen cap this is probably the first thing on snacks with wax where i would say it doesn't have enough sugar you ever think about um you know you're kind of trashing these but you could actually be a good spokesman given that your name is wax so you're asking me would i sell out like if twizzlers can to be and be like look we love your music we love you your snacks series we want you to give us a 10 out of 10 and we'll give you a million dollars if you endorse twizzlers and you go on tv and you say twizzlers are the best the best best candy i've ever had you asked me if i would do that my answer to that would be two million for two million i would do it i would do it for a hundred thousand dude for a hundred thousand dollars i would go on tv and tell the world my favorite candy was twizzlers it tastes if you like lipstick blender you put in one luden's cough drop about a 10 year old worth of birthday cake candles a little piece of a rubber tire and a stick of lipstick mix it all together then hardened it into into uh what it really tastes like a crayon it tastes like that it tastes like a crayon i'd rather eat a crayon there's something pray off about it i know you want to eat one yeah whenever you wear that hat with your hair you look like some kind of like 90s rocker dude what band are you in bro not like stone temple pilots more like um what's that bush yeah you're being a bass player i was actually the drummer of soul asylum i'm gonna tell you up front i haven't had a twizzler probably in since i was a little kid you know i don't know why i'm laughing at that so hard it doesn't look like a food product it doesn't feel like a food product it feels like it's made out of polyurethane it doesn't feel like it's biodegradable yeah if you put if you rolled up enough of those you'd make skateboard wheels i can't even believe that this is actually what it's like what is this even it's like leathery almost the texture of it i can't believe there's no plastic or like you know some kind of non-renewable energy oil it's like petroleum-based you good it's all good yeah it's okay though long story short i would never buy these i would never eat these i'm an empathetic person and i know that a lot of people like these twizzlers because of that i consider this generous i'm giving these things a three out of ten because personally i think they taste like crap there you have it legendary tactics i'll be very active even when i'm geriatric big wax i'm coming at you with that laid back maneuvering if you'd like to know about this pocket that we grooving it you get one what do you think you're so good why is it good i want you to explain to the camera what's good we're starting we're starting your career as a youtuber today okay sometimes it's just like hard to explain like when you like food like you like hot sauce why do you like hot sauce it burns your mouth and it's painful okay wow fair take look at him kids love him i don't get it [Music] how many do you have in your mouth right now um at least 15. do you know the heimlich maneuver this kid's about to choke on twizzlers you can't eat that many twizzlers before dinner no give uncle mike back those ones funny [ __ ] today's snack was recommended by travis eddie let us know in the comments what should we review next", "oLFia317XvY": "hey everyone it's audrey from mom generations thanks for watching so right now a lot of us are doing things at home that we don't normally do okay we're cutting our hair we're dyeing our hair we're doing our nails uh we're giving ourselves facials anything and everything that usually you can get done on a spa we're now doing at home so waxing is one of them so when i go and get my my self wax normally on my face i basically get my whole face wax but i get my eyebrows i get my lip and i get my chin those are usually the three targeted areas so i actually still can't go yet to get them waxed so i picked up today sally hansen wax strips i did a little bit of research on what to get and um this was one of them i think this was around 5.99 and i'm going to check it out all right so i'm opening it up this is for face and bikini i'm going to spare you and out to the bikini um let me see it says it lasts up to eight weeks inside it says leave skin feeling smooth easy to use in the on the back it says before peeling apart rub wax strips between your hands to warm the wax separate the wax strips oh man this is gonna be let's see let's see how difficult this is all right so i have opened everything up i have opened everything up i wasn't sure what this blue stuff was this is finishing oil oh i guess that's we put on at the end all right so these are the actual strips i was thinking like like literally gooey wax that i have to put on my my face okay so important it says before peeling apart rub wax strips between your hands to warm the wax now this is going to worry me how um how warm do we need it but i'm going to go it says to getting it good i'm getting it good i actually can feel it getting warm all right let me get the directions again okay rub wax strips between your hands to keep to get the wax warm i'm gonna do my chin over here you see this little see these little buggers they're white look at white hair i'm getting old i'm getting all peel apart separate okay i can feel it oh my gosh what size they both feel waxy all right so i'm going to put this one on here how long do i keep it on for you guys are going to see me peel this off and either scream smooth on one direction of hair growth and pull off close to the skin all right that's good enough ready three two one i'm scared wait ready three two let me let me put this down oh my hands get stuck ready three two one go all right i had a couple little hairs come off i have two hairs there i had two hairs come off with that let me okay let me do it again see i feel like this side is what maybe this is the wax okay all right ready this one feels more waxy okay ready all right so i peeled it on let's see how many little buggers i can get off ready three two one go all right that got way more off all right as you can see definitely feel so they have a little wax residue all right all right not bad that whole area there it's a little sticky but this is probably why we put the the finishing oil on right all right i'm gonna dab a little on oh yeah i can feel the wax coming actually right off all right all right so i was i was a little nervous is the first time ever doing like wax strips like this at home not good oh it's very smooth here i love all right so there we go if you're looking for some wax strips sally hansen very impressed i will say this i don't know if i would do my eyebrows because it would have to be a really targeted area but i would definitely do these on my lip and on my chin and any straggler hairs that i have over here i would do that on all right so if you're looking to do a lip and chin wax and also it's a bikini too so you could do bikini at home there you go thanks for watching", "EZiNlR-ENHk": "this is beeswax which is what i'm going to be working with today um this is how most people are familiar with it if you're a seamstress or you do quilting you've probably seen it put up like this this is one of the ways that you'll see it at fabric stores the other way is a little round cake of it that goes into an acrylic holder so you can slide your thread across it um this is a one pound block of beeswax and it's a little cloudy because i store mine in the freezer um i bought uh probably 10 pounds worth of these and a couple of these this is a two pound block um at least 11 years ago because i've been vegan for 11 years and i haven't bought beeswax since um i got this on ebay but you can also find it if you have uh local beekeepers very often they put up their beeswax just in these very rough one pound blocks um beeswax comes in two flavors unfiltered which can be very dark or a little lighter and filtered which very often is an extremely pale amber or almost clear i like the unfiltered stuff um so i store this in the freezer because what i really need to do beeswax collage is this little tiny pieces uh of broken beeswax block that i can drop into a melter or in some cases like very small pieces like this i can just throw this onto a surface and heat it and i'll talk about the tools that i use to do that in another video um so to get from this to this uh the easiest way to make it happen is to stick the block in the freezer and then when it's still frozen take it out and just whack it against the side of a table um very often what i'll do is i'll put the block into a plastic bag and seal it up and then whack and it basically shatters because it's frozen solid and you end up with little tiny bits and then from here i can cut these with a craft knife or i can just melt off a little bit with a tack iron or whatever but um this is really not very useful in its current state it really needs to be smaller pieces uh or chunks tools that i use to work with beeswax the first one is a melting pot this one is put out by ranger um and i started using this before they started making the little pans that you drop in you can see it's pretty much a mess because i never remember to clean off the extra wax while it's still warm so it sets up and gets it all gunky um i like this because it has the little divot for a brush and this brush is the one that i've dedicated to uh beeswax work it's a bristle brush kind of like this one that i got at the hardware store and it's good for applying wax onto most pieces [Music] uh it's stuck in there right now because the wax is set up and that's okay because uh um once i get to work i'll just uh heat this up i like this melting pot because it has a temperature gauge on it so i can make sure that i'm just getting the wax melted without getting it too hot wax is flammable if you get it too hot it will burst into flames um so if you're using something like this and you see smoke coming out of it or you see a black sort of scum forming on the top your wax is too hot you need to dial it down a little bit so i use a melting pot but i have used in the past wax melters there are some that are made for like melting scented waxes in your home those are fine they look like little crock pots um and there's also beeswax melters that uh estheticians use for waxing your legs if you go and get a professional wax you've probably seen the little pots they look like little crock pots um and they have a temperature dial on them um that allows you to get it so it's just melting the wax and not too hot okay so that's the thing that i use to pre-melt these are tack irons this one is from uh ebay and it's um [Music] it's for framing and um you can buy tack irons like this at like framing supply uh stores online um but really i just bought a used one because i use it maybe once or twice a year for 30 minutes and that's it um this one is by clover and it's for um quilters uh you can just do a very small iron if you're like flattening out seams and also it's pointy so you can get into deep corners um so most fabric stores i think still carry these this one has kind of a vague temperature dial on it low to high um i try to do a test before i use this start it out low and dial it up just a little bit and you want to get it just so that your piece of wax melts quickly when you put it on but not so hot that it liquefies the wax completely because then it gets messy um the other things i have are tweezers and these are really useful because this is hot and the wax is hot and there's a huge potential for burning your fingers i never seem to come out of a collage piece without at least one blister on my finger so tweezers are great for moving things around and for flattening things into the wax when you've lifted out your iron and i'll probably show you an example of what i just said when i do my collage postcards", "LTInyUzeZIA": "[Music] begin by choosing the right size wax strip for the area that you need to treat rub the strip gently between your hands to warm the wax peel the strip apart both sides can be used so now you have two X trips press the wax strip firmly on your skin and smooth it down in the direction of the hair growth hold the skin taut with one hand don't pull the strip up and away from the skin pull the strip horizontally to the skin pulling quickly and in the opposite direction of the hair growth finish up with a saline oil to remove any residual wax and to moisturize skin now you are hair free for up to eight weeks you [Music]", "aG9BccTbTGU": "hi everyone i am sally welcome back on this channel i really hope you all are doing great 26 january is approaching the minnesota patriotic song tutorial when i enjoy so that's what we are going to do today we are going to learn terry mitty song from ksri movie so let's get started [Music] [Music] of this instrument many videos so if you don't know how to tune you can check those videos a link description box so a lot of you guys reach out to me asking which ukulele should i related stuff so you can find the link in the description box [Music] you can play is song in two different ways [Music] string and pinky finger on second fret second string that's d chord next is b minor chord so that's your b minor chord next is g chord g chord up middle finger on second fret first string index finger on second fret third string and ring finger on third fret second string and last chord a chord to play a chord all you have to do is put your index finger on first fret third string and middle finger on second fret fourth string so that's your a chord d b minor g a h with capo on the [Music] [Music] string that's c chord then you can use a minor chord to play a minor chord all you have to do is put middle finger on second fret fourth string next is f [Music] [Music] [Music] if you are putting kepo on first fret then you have to play chord progression d b minor g a continuously in the loop throughout the song and if you are putting kepo on third fret then you have to play c a minor f g continuously in the loop throughout the song so i don't know how to explain logic behind it basically so [Music] first strumming pattern is simple down strum okay now there are two options you can use for the strumming pattern first is down down up up down down down up down down up up down down [Music] [Music] [Music] alternative strumming pattern that is second part is up up third is down and fourth is down now just break the entire strumming pattern into small chunks practice each chunk one at a time or if it's a mixer though that's how you are going to practice your strumming pattern so down down up up down down down that's all about strumming pattern now again over here in the song flow there is nothing to explain as such so d b minor g and then we will start the strumming pattern so it will be like this [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's all in the down strum and then you have to start the strumming pattern igboora chord progression bajalo db minor ga and then start singing [Music] patterns [Music] is [Music] [Music] my [Music] oh this progression will follow throughout the song so that's all about it it's very very easy song to play and quick to learn so that's all about it i really hope you enjoyed it keeping this video very short and informative at the same time so yeah that's all about it i really hope you enjoyed it if you did then make sure you hit the like subscribe now and i'll see you guys in the next one until then love and positive vibes bye [Music]", "So7N7i-ajec": "[Music] [Music] [Music] hey everybody happy wax on wednesdays today i thought it would be fun to add some additional layers to that cold wax painting that we started last week here on wax on wednesdays so this is a little cold wax medium painting series here in wax on wednesdays and i'm mixing up my colors i mix about a 50 50 ratio of cold wax medium to my paint which i'm using gambling artist colors all of the supplies that i use on each week's video can always be seen on the blog post for that video on sherryriplogical.com so if you go over to there'll be a link belo beneath the video for each uh blog post and you can go over there and see the full blog post for this video as well as all of the uh every all the supplies that i use each week so this week is all about those middle layers in a painting in an abstract painting you have the under painting and you have those middle layers and sometimes those are the most fun layers sometimes they're a little bit of a struggle to find out exactly where that painting is taking you and i'm starting out here just by warming up the entire painting with some indian yellow so this week i really wanted to focus in on what i do in those middle layers to add some excitement back in to the painting so a lot of times can it's easy to get lost in those in those layers i am having fun adding different colors color combinations and really exploring the color and that's part of the fun and the excitement of the middle layers but every once in a while you sort of get stuck and the way i get unstuck is to add some exciting bits and some texture back into the painting so a lot of times i call these middle layers my character layers because they really are what adds in the end the character to the painting so of course not all of this is going to be visible by the end of the painting a lot of the colors and things that i'm adding now will get covered up in the end but a lot of the texture that's added will be visible in one way or another so a lot of times that adds a lot of character and interest to the painting even though you can't see the colors that i added you can really see that texture that is built up on the painting so today i'm going to show you two ways that i add a little bit of texture back into those paintings and that creates a little bit of excitement for me it adds a little bit of interest for me as i'm painting those middle layers and gets me a little bit excited about what's coming up next so for that this week i'm going to just use some scratching techniques with the palette knife you can use whatever tool you have you can use that catalyst tool a wedge a palette knife and also some plastic film some plastic wrap to and that will both pick up the paint it'll transfer it to another spot in the painting once that plastic film starts to get sort of dirty with paint because it's picking up that paint in one area and laying down it the paint in another it also creates some lovely texture as it does it with those wrinkles in the plastic wrap so it's just a fun way of adding a little bit of getting a little bit excitement in those center layers so i hope that you enjoy this painting this unlocks on wednesdays this week if you want to see the full painting video they're always available on the patreon channel i have full voice overs a step-by-step process of each and every wax on wednesday's video so you can check that out over on the patreon channel and we will be wrapping these little paintings up and finishing them up on wax on wednesdays here next week so next week will be the final layers of this painting and this today will just be those fun center layers so i hope you have fun with this and we'll see you next week happy wax on wednesdays [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "F2lpQtEYWNY": "hey what's up guys this is Curtis I'm five here with the unboxing and review of Nair spa clay roll on wax this is the Brazilian type so you can use it in those more sensitive areas if you so choose the reason why I got this you know I already have a full-on brazilian waxing kit he's because I am on a travel and I couldn't possibly want to bring that huge pink wax and get it all over my lucky stuff so I bought Swan but it's shipped to me here it is as you can see some waxes re on here that's because I have already opened up and you say not to say this product is quite amazing but just for the first half of this video just show you the packaging so you guys know exactly what you're gonna get when you purchase this product for about ten dollars currently on Amazon alright so these do come in several different scents I do particularly like this one I might try out other ones when this one runs up but anyways it's a friend this is the back here yeah I am happy to say that the instructions are very very clear you can't go wrong with these very articulate well written so that's pretty much if I packaging let me just go ahead and open this up so it does give you quite a few actual cloth strips that are actually reusable so since the wax is actually on while you water soluble sorry so you can actually rinse off the wax after you are done using it and reuse and try these cloths to be used again so that's really handy so you probably don't ever have to get and buy anymore cloth strips unless you you know make holes in the wall somehow here's the instruction manual itself unfortunately it did get wet so that's why that's there and here is the actual wax roller here it is it's really smaller this one is a 5.7 ounce size so here's a roller itself there's actually a safety compartment I'll show you quickly that you definitely want don't throw this out you need this because it prevents the wax from reaching the roller when you are not using it so definitely don't throw that away when you're using your net also it's very clear in the instruction so that's it for the embossing portion of this video let's go ahead and talk about the review first let me show you how it's done I like to pick out a clean area and lay out paper towel so it's easier to clean afterwards and then I would take the wax roller here unscrew the top and then you see there is a little seal that you want to remove before you microwave it that way the wax can actually reach the roller make sure to put the co in a safe location so you can use it again later and then just simply screw back on the roller cap and it clicks in really nicely in place really seamless and in the microwave if you want to set the timer for 15 seconds if it's a full bottle ten seconds if it's about a half bottle once the time is up you want to check that there are no bubbles seen and he should just feel very slightly warm since this is a soft wax it does not need to be heated up very much not like hard wax and now you can begin waxing so you want to apply the wax in the direction of the hair growth and then you just want to apply race-tin layer and then a play quickly the cloth strip Pat it down rub it in and then pull it in the opposite direction of hair growth to remove the hair it's normal for you to not get all the hair at the first time so you just need to do it several more times until the Aereo trace is pretty much hair free and once you're done cleaning up is pretty much a breeze since this is soft wax in combination with the roller there's really little messes to clean up yours near wash off the leftover wax on your arms and in the residual waxing hair that is found on the wax strips so you can just rinse out all of this under some warm water and you also definitely want to rinse out the roller cap as well as the stopper to make sure that it no residual wax will come out when you don't want it to as you can see when I didn't clean it out very well the first time made it ended up being in the bag afterwards now all that stuff to do is to lay out your classrooms for them to dry one very important tip is when not in use make sure to put back the stopper and make sure to have the container always in this up position so that you don't want any of the wax to accidentally spill out as I did accidentally one time on this chair so hopefully using this quite a few times I have to say I'm very satisfied with this product at ten dollars is a great value especially with your on-the-go traveling in comparison to hard wax which I had previously used before using this this is much easier to apply use and much quicker to clean up in the whole process is only took me about twenty minutes maximum to wax both of my legs as well as my pits in the effect so pretty much just as good as the hard wax though I do want to point out that this could be more painful than hard wax especially in more sensitive areas of your skin is not taunt like on your arms or your legs but that is more towards just soft wax in general and not particularly this product I think an arrow did a really good job implementing this role on wax design it has a nice ergonomic shape and the pricing is not too far off the only suggestion I would have from there is to implement a more user-friendly stopper or something that wouldn't be easily lost both ways I would totally recommend this to a friend but they'll do it for this unboxing and review of this product I hope you found it hopefully as usual if you did please consider subscribing to my channel scuffles 95 give it a like to help support the channel and thank you for watching you", "gDH0-cuf724": "hey everyone Ally here and today I'm going to be doing a review on the Nair Brazilian spa clay roll-on wax so waxing your only legs this is something that I started looking into because I just get really tired of shaving my legs all the time I did some research online and then was poking around and it looked seemed like a lot of people liked this stuff so I decided to give it a try and turns out I love it it's super easy to use I've experienced with like some of my friends when they use wax and it just gets everywhere it's an impossible to get off or you have to get like a special solution to get it off this just comes right off with water so it's really easy to clean up and you don't have to use any complicated warmers or anything like that because you just pop this baby in the microwave the only thing about this stuff is that it comes with ten sheets of paper strips to use I do recommend going out and buying your own better quality strips to use with this stuff it just hurts less and it seems like it sticks better to the wax these are by a suddenly smooth or something like that but they almost feel like really thin foam it's kind of weird and they work a lot better than the ones that come with the narrow wax before you get messing with heating the wax up the first thing you want to do is wash your legs just to make sure that they're free from any oils or product or anything because you want the hair to be clean so the wax can stick to it and rip it right out also don't watch anything if you're in a hurry make sure you have lots of time to take your time and relax and do things the right way if you try to wax anything when you're in a rush most likely it'll just not work out good you'll miss hairs you might tear skin it just give yourself some time give you some time when you open the package the first thing you want to do is just unscrew this guide and take out this little plastic plug otherwise it might explode or something I don't know but it's somewhere safe because you're going to want to put it back in later when you're done and put this cap back on and then you're going to stick this bad boy in the microwave for 15 seconds to start off when it's cold and then do like increments of 5 to 10 seconds to keep it want to get it so that inside you can see in the bottle that it's nice and liquidy and ice flowing around real smooth then you can just squeeze it and work it around and make sure you want to spread the heat around evenly a few quick tips if you have long hair definitely get it up out of the way normally when you do this you would wear I would just wear underwear but obviously since I'm in this video I'm just wearing my lil yoga shorts they are something where your sleeves and get up out of the way because while yes this is really easy to get out with why are you still don't want to get everywhere so just try you know use some common sense of that this plastic thing that it comes with doubles as a stand for the wax so whenever you're in between wax things you can just pop it in there like this so keep this because this is important so how long does the hair on your legs need to be um people say like around 2 weeks of growth or something like that from shaving um I usually end up if I want to keep up with it I wax my legs like once a month I'd say um the hair on my legs is pretty long but it's also fairly fine so I don't even know if you can see it you're just going to roll on one or two layers and you don't want obviously I want to go longer than the strip because you won't get it all at once so we're just gonna this going okay you roll the direction of the hair and then smooth on the strip nice and firm in the direction of the hair and then pull tight on the skin and then you're going to rip backwards be careful not to rip up because that will hurt and that work very good oh and you can use the strip more than once um I usually just keep going with the same strip until the wax on the strip is getting a little too thick and after you do it a few times you know what I'm talking about but so it's pretty quick and easy and it's very efficient um I hardly ever I have very few missed hairs when I do this remember you want to go in the direction of the hair when you're applying the wax and the strip and pull this tight and then go in the opposite direction this part gets kind of awkward getting behind your leg can be difficult might need to have someone help you with this part once you get the hang of it gets easier for sure kinda have to do some funky twisting sometimes to get the wax on where you need it to go yeah so as you can see I've got quite a lot of wax built up on here so this is when I will throw this one way use a new strip you want the wax when you're applying it on your leg to just go on like really smooth and liquid like so I can tell this already needs a little reheat so I'm just going to pop in the microwave for a few seconds remember when you reheat your wax do it a little bit at a time it's really key overheat it tin you lean on so what I do is I go in patches around the lower half of my lower leg I go all the way around in a row and then I'll do the top half well I know some of you are wondering right now how much does this actually hurt well it definitely gets better and do it more and more and the more you the more you wax the less hair will grow or grow back less resilient to me so will be easier to rip it out and they'll be less of it so that reduces the pain definitely hurts a lot less than when I first did this pain area just depends on how strong your hair is how thick it is how much of it you have so and is it worth it you know for me definitely if you have a lot more hair that's a lot tougher to get rid of it might be worth it for you to go have them wax professionally but honestly you know this is going to save me like $50 moving on up I only wax from the knee down because my hair my thighs is really fine definitely do your knees separate from the top of your leg so after I finish the top half of my way I'll go around once more for my knee and I'll show you what I do for that for your knee what I've found the easiest thing to do is make sure your leg is bent so that pull all of this nice and tight and because your knee is round and bony it's kind of difficult to get but you just got to have patience with it take little sections just a little sections sure you get it nice and firm pull it tight tight as you can and get that off make sure you pull the skin as tight as possible I did this once because you already have a loose skin on your knee right so you can bend it and I did this once like with my legs straight or something I don't know what I was doing I thought it was going to be okay and hurt really bad so don't do that so remember take little sections is your knees a funny shape and I've all done it's seriously so easy guys after you're finished watching waxing your legs what I actually do is as soon as I'm done and just hop in the shower and go ahead and give them a once-over with my razor just to catch any hairs I might have missed as well as it helps your skin feels even more silky smooth because or razor really exfoliates your skin and of course don't forget to follow up with a gentle soothing moisturizer if you're finding it difficult to rip the paper off try not to think about it too hard um sometimes you can sing a song don't count because once you get to three you know it's coming and then you'll check it out again if you sing a song to yourself or something like that just kind of try to distract while you're ripping then you won't cringe as much or anticipated much and might even help to make it hurt less so that concludes my leg waxing tutorial it loves stuff I highly recommend it um I give it from Target fairly cheap um I think it's like between eight to ten dollars and this container lasts me for four legs my bottom from the knee down like I said you better off come getting your own strips once you are done waxing your legs all you have to do turn this guy by the other directions a little wax settles back down here take off the lid put the plug back in and then I just rinse off clean out this whole thing I just pop this lid off and put the plug back in and then just rinse off that part isn't getting sticky and then this here if you just push on the roll apart it actually pops out up here just like that so you can get this whole part nice and clean and all you need is a nice warm water to get this back to me again and once that's reached your desired level of cleanliness you can just pop this little roller guy back in and put this back in and don't forget to rinse off your handy dandy little holders and voila you are all set hope that helped you guys out if you have any questions leave it in the comments below and I'll get back to you as soon as I can meanwhile don't forget to check me out at Facebook at facebook.com slash the Miss Ellie K as well as my other channels here on YouTube talk to you guys later bye", "F4IqezFrVKY": "Hey

poacher let me go give you the future know might even be Monica hi guys welcome to yoga guide I hope you all are well now in today's lesson we're covering a song request and I'll be teaching you the very very melodious song Harriet from the movie tutorial so it's a beautiful song and I'm so many of us must be waiting for it the song is very very close to us these days as it's from one of the finest film sponsor sound singh rajput so as I'm sure you all are pretty excited and with no more ado take out your youth unit in standard view and let's start with the lesson to guys subsequently bad critical ski or is Tonka play technically up coach I need chair asan say chords over chords and called a minor called G chord C called F chord D minor and chord E now in case you already know how to play these cards then you can skip to the next part of this lesson and let's first learn how to play these chords so to play chord a minor you need to place your middle finger on 2nd fret 4th string and called a minor should sound like this [Music] to play chord G you need to place your index finger on 2nd fret third string your middle finger on the second fret 1st string and your ring finger on 3rd fret second string and chord G should sound like this to play chord C you need to place your ring finger on 3rd fret first string and Godsey should sound like this to play chord F you need to place your index finger on 1st fret 2nd string and your middle finger on 2nd fret 4th string and god F should sound like this to play chord D minor you need to place your index finger on 1st fret 2nd string your middle finger on 2nd fret 4th string and your ring finger on 2nd fret third string and called D minor should sound like this to play chord E you need to place your index finger on 2nd fret 4th string and then you need to bar the other 3 strings over it for like this and god ii should sound like this to guys about curtains coming pattern key or joe strumming pattern hum a song we use knievel a hair that would look like this [Music] so now let's break this pattern into parts and understand how you can play it so this pattern is actually a combination of down down up and chuck okay so you have to practice it like that so down down down down so guys keep on practicing this pattern the same way and gradually as you get confidence you can increase the tempo and this pattern would sound like this [Music] so now down touch up down down up down down up down down so in the same way you have to practice this pattern on all of the chords so called G called L called D minor chord C and God II you have to practice this pattern on all the chords well because when we'll be playing this song we have to change we have to switch chords pretty quickly and only when you get confidence when you get a smooth movement of your hand you will be able to achieve different parts so then in case you're not comfortable with chucking you're still a beginner and you still want to play this song then you can play an alternate pattern that would look like this down down up down down down up down down down up down down knock down so let's to play this song I'm using a capo on fret 1 now this is as for my waist range but if you want you can skip it and you can play this song accordingly now one more thing which I want to update you that as I'm using this capo my chord positions will be changed slightly so for me called a minor would look like this called G would look like this and other chords will be shifted one fret apart like this so guys let's understand different sections of this song so the song starts with intro part and in intro will be using chords in this order so called a minor chord G called a minor called F and chord G ok so this is the part where we'll be playing intro melody as well so at one side you have to play these chords and on the other side you have to play the intro melody which we'll be learning in a while so chords will be played like this [Music] so-called f you have to play a single downstroke and then you move to chord G and you play rest of the pattern like this so so that's how you play intra part now the next part of this song will be chorus and to play chorus you have to play chords in this order so called a minor chord G called a minor chord G chord C chord G and then again called a minor okay and the good news about this part that you have to play our pattern exactly one time per chord on all the chords except the last one so on the last chord you play our pattern two times so it would sound like this [Music] okay and you have to repeat the same thing again and once you're done with this part you have to start prequels and in pre-chorus you have chords in this order so called G called F chord G called E and then you play called G chords 3 and called a minor okay so pre-chorus will be played in two parts so for first four chords by chord G chord F chord G and called e you will be playing a pattern exactly two times four chord so it would sound like this [Music] alright and after this we have to play down strokes so on chord G you play a single down stroke on chord C you play another single down stroke and then on called a minor you again start playing the pattern so just play two times and then you again start chorus part so there's the next part of this song would be worse one and to play worse one we have to play our cards in this order so called a minor chord F again called a minor chord F then called D minor then called C and then called E ok so this part is again fairly simple you have to play all chords exactly one time okay you have to play our pattern exactly one time per chord except chord D minor we're really playing our pattern two times so let me quickly show you how it will sound [Music] the [Music] okay and after that you have to repeat the same thing again now once you're done with this part you again play pre-chorus and then you have to play chorus part okay so that's the complete layout of this song and that's how you play different sections so guys now it's time to learn that intro melody and as I have told you earlier that we have to play certain chords at one side and intro melody is something which I have raised especially for you now if you can't play it then you can completely skip it that's up to you so intro melody would sound like this [Music] so thanks I'm giving you tabs over the screen and I'm sure you can relate each and everything so I'm gonna play this melody really really slow for you and I'm sure you will be able to relate different parts then repeat the same thing again so guys as we understood all instructions when it's time for the song play part so let's play this song and see everything in real action [Music] can you torture your ego give you departure no might even be one good you see a departure there baby good evening getting so sorry Hey oh dude you dirty - Holly calathea the word you could either give me at the butcher

just wanted to run through our strip wax kit as you can see the instructions are all inside the kit includes a pre-wax wipe then the large packet of wax strips the small wax strips and an after wax wipe so to begin you're going to be using the pre-wax wipe so you need to use this wherever you're waxing whether it's legs this will do both of the full legs or a back or a chest or maybe arms and then you're ready to go so place your wax strip down on the skin where you want to remove the hair press really firmly and this will kind of stick the wax to the hair you can see the hairs there through that then we have an s-shaped grip so you can see it has space your thumb and then remove let's see yep that got us and then all you do now is repeat the same process so you can press it down and you can use the same strip once it's still sticky s-shaped rip to grab a hold of and then remove and you can just continue this again and again and there you have it so a tip here would be to bend your knee up if you're doing um down kind of the center of your leg tends to be a little bit easier to do and you can see here we're just placing it and removing it and going again so you can reuse that strip um until the stickiness is gone so these are the small wax strips these are so handy for tricky areas like on the knee because the hairs can grow in all sorts of crazy directions and they can sometimes be broken as well they're great for toes for hands knuckles anything like that to even go down the thigh and i'll show you that now in a few minutes onto the upper thigh now place it straight down bend your knee up and that way your thigh will stretch out and it's much easier to remove thy hair grows in all different directions so just watch that i know there isn't hair but we're just showing you here as an example so it might be going left right straight just have a look try and hold your skin and support it that will help with the removal and any little sticky bits you're going to be able to just go back the little strips that we mentioned earlier are brilliant for maybe just the one or two stray hairs you might have on the inner thigh again any sticky bits you can remove with the wax strip and then we're on to our after wax wipe so just wipe this all over the area that you've just waxed it's super soothing and it'll also remove any sticky bits you might have missed and that's it you're done", "VjStL3L1OU0": "I've got something show-and-tell this week I got a lot of cool stuff but I wanted to show you this this came from and I can't quite read the name it's either Popple or maybe it might be a form of Paul I'm not sure this came from Poland it was really nice Leonard look at look how nice the writing is on that I don't know Americans who could write that neatly really but it's got this beautiful paper and everything it was really nice no and but the really cool thing look at this it's got sealing wax on there sealing wax that is so awesome I really wish I want it I want one of those I can just stamp that's old school but I really like it and so he's a 20 year old mechanical engineering student and likes the show and that was really nice I love getting letters like that I got this from Brian Claggett you know what this is what state this is can you guess I bet you a lot of you already probably know I hope I'm holding it up the right way I didn't check on him I think that's the right way did you guess yeah it's West Virginia yeah someday they're gonna settle their differences with Virginia and they'll reunite I use that joke all the time North Carolina South Carolina North Dakota South they're always those States just hate each other if they hate each other and so someday they'll they'll all get together anyway that's West Virginia so I'll hang it up probably with my California and I have Brazil around here somewhere kind of a mess it's still a mess in my shop I'm still you know I try to clean it up and still kind of make the show at the same time which is a little bit difficult I wanted to give a shout out to Jack hey Jack it was nice meeting you jack is a fan of the show and he came over and met me the other day and he gave me this while he was here do you know what that is that is not a map of Virginia what that is or what or West Virginia it's a it's a Center finder you ever see one of these it's just two dolls and it's got a nail in it so say if you wanted to find the center of this this board here you would just take it twist it and then you could just mark it down that way and it finds the center assuming you didn't know that that plywood in the center was the center but on other boards it would work out really cool that that was cool and it was really it was really pleasure to meet you jack oh and I got this a while back and I forgot to mention this this is from Marlon Givens in Pennsylvania and he sent me this picture after it looks like my shut the box game remember but they it's a little bit different and he gave me instructions on how to play this and they just call it the game the game I like making games that was nice and like I said it's always fun to get stuff in the actual mail mail you guys write for football this weekend this is a great football weekend it's 12:15 now that means in a little over an hour the first playoff game starts so there's two playoff games today and then two tomorrow tomorrow's gonna be the good one in San Francisco is playing and I'm sure they'll win but my guess is that the Super Bowl is gonna come down to I'm just gonna I'm gonna make a prediction here it's going to be Denver I think Denver's gonna be in hands down easy it's just a matter who's gonna play Denver and I think it's gonna be Seattle I'd like for it to be San Francisco but I think it's gonna be Seattle and if it were San Francisco I just hope it's not the same clobbering San Francisco took from Denver and when they played in the Super Bowl the last time Winter Olympics are this year too and I always always enjoy watching the Olympics whether it's the Winter Olympics or the Summer Olympics and I really enjoyed curling curling is something I always want to play when I see it play it's like it looks like bowling on ice and it just looks like so much fun but we don't have any curling I did a search on the internet during the last Olympics four years ago because I got really excited about curling and I think the closest one there might have been a place down in San Jose I don't think there's an e anymore it's mainly it's a Canadian game I guess so I kind of wish see there's a good reason to move to Canada to play some curling did you enjoy the palette project yesterday I had a lot of fun making that project I really like the way it turned out I really it was a project that I wasn't expecting it to look as cool I I think as it turned out to look the the nail holes and everything and they're all just kind of came together and I thought it was a pretty cool project I've done a little bit of research on bathroom cabinets and what might work and that one most of them stick out farther if you want to put towels on but I didn't want to stick that our bathroom it's pretty small that's our guest bathroom and I didn't want to hit it all the time so it's a little bit narrower but the nice thing about those pallet projects is that you can really just you have to kind of modify them according to the wood you have because the the planks are the slats that the pallets are made out of just seem to be all over the place as far as widths there's some that are three and a half inches wide all the way up to four and a half inches wide they're different thicknesses so it's actually kind of fun to just go through those boards and just try to pick out mix and match as it were still think I got a couple more storage projects for this month I think next week I'm just I'm just brainstorming here brainstorming that I'm gonna do an under the bed storage box next week it's kind of one of these things that and I was mentioning this to Jack when he was over here the other day about how much of woodworking is just well it's making boxes everything I make is just a box really and you know the my bathroom cabinet was a box and my storage cabinet over here was a box if you can master the art of making a box then you can pretty much build anything you can make a house I'm thinking about making the under the bed storage you know I'd liked it for it to be on wheels but I don't want the wheels to really stick up high so they've got to go on the side don't want the box to be heavy so I'm gonna use some I think thinner plywood if I can't it's the kind of thing that doesn't get used a lot you know so those are all considerations that are going into this and then I want to try to do something a little bit different with it rather than just well make a box I mentioned the dowel of poo in my audible commercial I did yesterday this is really a good book I really enjoyed it's a short book it's easy to listen to or read if you want to actually read the book this isn't a plug they're not paying me for this part I'm just kind of doing this because I enjoyed a lot of these books and I did read The Hunger Games because I liked the movie so much and so I read the book I listened to the book when I say I read I don't read I listen but I listened to the Hunger Games and I'm not sure if it really added anything that the movie didn't already have so don't know it was pretty close to the movie you know a little bit difference here and there but I enjoyed it and I think I may read the next one the Catching Fire because I did like the the movie Catching Fire I'm still really into frozen it's funny to see all the people from all walks of life who are just discovering this film it's really kind of a phenomenon and I don't know what it is about that movie that just kind of strikes the right note and the music is really good and now I've seen it twice already I'm really looking forward to when it comes out on DVD and if you saw yesterday's video you'll know that I used my router as a jointer that's because I said well I don't really need a jointer I guess I don't need to join her because I was able to use the router so there and to be honest if I buy a couple of boards at the lumberyard or you know a home center and I need to make a panel and glue the edges together I don't usually bother jointing them at all usually you know the store-bought edges are pretty close or I can just run it through my table saw and that pretty much flattens them out and then just clamp them down really tight just has squish em together and that seems to work out fine for most stuff but the pallet wood is just right it's so gnarly it really needed a flat edge so I could get a good gluing surface on it there's my thoughts on joining jointer in joining jointer why is it called a jointer it should be a jointer right jointer I'm always confused by that jointer there's a biscuit joiner is it a biscuit jointer or biscuit joiner somebody's got their leaf blower running I guess that means it's time for me to end this video I will talk to you guys later bye well that was strange I just had a visit from another fan Michael Coolidge and he brought me this this is a wine bottle you know you put this over a white I had to ask him what it was and then I remember seeing these before you put this over a wine bottle like that not a finger and then in these little slots here you hang wine glasses so you know it's a decorative thing I guess and if you're gonna give somebody a bottle of wine many ways it's a it's a cool idea I think so thanks Michael was nice meeting you it's been a busy shop this week", "vUp_2mIwM5Y": "hello its me the ukulele teacher here with a very quick lesson to teach you how to read tabs for the ukulele now as a musician tabs can be both good and bad on the plus side you don't need to be able to read or understand music whatsoever to be able to play them on the downside tab doesn't explain rhythm at all so unless you know the song you're trying to play tab will only ever give you half the story but if you're trying to play a tune that you're familiar with ukulele tabs can be a very quick and easy way to help you learn so grab your uke make sure it's in tune and let's learn how to read ukulele tablature so what exactly is tab well if you look at the four lines they represent each of the strings on your ukulele so the fourth line down represents the fourth string of the ukulele the third line down represents the third string the second line down represents the second string and the first line of tab or the top line represents the first string or the top string so the four lines of tab represent the four strings that's all well and good but what do the numbers mean well the numbers represent what threat you have to push down on which string so if for example there was a two on the bottom line of tab you would push down the second fret of the bottom string of your ukulele like this if there was a zero on the top line of tab you would play the top string of the ukulele open that means not pushing down on any of the threats like I said unfortunately with tab it doesn't give you the rhythm but if you know the song that you're trying to learn then it can be very helpful indeed so to learn tab I've picked a song that pretty much everyone in the world will know hopefully even without the rhythm being written down let's take a look at the first four notes all four notes are on the third line down which means you play them on the third string of the ukulele the zeros mean you play the open string and the two means you press down on the second fret I should think even without the rhythm you'll probably be able to guess what it is that we're playing so the first four notes go like this open open to open like this have you already guessed what the tune is yet well let's move on to the next two notes they're on the second line down which means you play them on the second string of the ukulele the one means you play the first fret and the zero again means you play the open string like this so let's put them all together with the first four notes and then we look at the next four notes and they're exactly the same as the first four notes then the next set of notes are back on the second string three and one so you play the third fret and the 1st fret like this then we're back to the open third string then we go all the way up to the first line the top line which is the same as playing the first Ringel and that's a third fret followed by an open string then back to the second string for one and open and then back to the third string for a two so let's play that whole section and then the final notes are back to the first string four one one open and then one on the second string one final thing you might need to know is that if there are two or more notes on top of each other you play them at the same time so let's look at those last two notes now we've got to play the third fret on the second string and the open third string like this and then the final note we play the first fret on the second string and the open third string and first string at the same time like this so now the last line goes like this so let's try and plate the whole song using the tab have you guessed it yes it's the birthday wishes song and that's a very quick explanation of how to read tab for the ukulele and it's exactly the same for guitar there's just two extra lines of tab to represent the two extra strings on the guitar open the ukulele teacher if you have any requests for future lessons let me know in the comments below until next time I love you all and I wish you the best", "7Qh2JQwkhjk": "[Music] hey how you doing justin here today we're going to do a lesson on getting started on our ukulele great fun little instrument these are i've only been playing a few months but it's really really good fun uh if you've played a bit of guitar the skills kind of transfer over pretty easy so uh that's kind of a cool thing and if you've never played a musical instrument before it's a really nice little starter one this one it's got nylon string so it's easy on the fingers the chords are pretty simple to play small portable great for parties you know it's a really good little instrument in this lesson i want to show you how to tune the thing how to hold it how to strum it i'm going to show you four really simple chords and uh give you some progressions to put those chords in so you can play some tunes that's the aim at a little less than a day so first thing getting your uke in tune really really important nylon strings tend to go out of tune a bit so i would recommend getting something like a clip-on tuner or something that that that is there all the time so you can tune up real quick you know rather than having to get a tuner out and do all of that sort of stuff so either a little clip-on tuner this particular uke has a built-in tuner um this is a mate and uh ukulele australian guitar company uh makes great instruments all round you want to check them out mate m-a-t-o-n dot com dot a use their website but uh if you're looking for a uke this is a great one it doesn't matter what one you do this one's a i should mention this is a concert sized uke there's a soprano uke which is a lot smaller same tuning although sometimes they tune the smaller ones up a tone from what i'm going to show you um but uh you know and there's a couple of bigger ones as well but uh so this one's a constant one if you wanted to get one this this size so the tuning is c sorry g c e a and it seems to be commonly called when i looked it up my dog has fleas i don't know where they get that name from but you can hear that the fourth string which is the one closest to the ceiling is actually the highest note so it's kind of high low getting higher that's going from the top down okay and i mean physically down okay the the string closest to the floor is the one i call the first string so first string second string third string and fourth string okay so from the ground it would be a e c and g and from the ceiling down g c e a okay now like i said i really recommend that you get a tuner if you don't have a tuner i'm going to play the notes for you now so you can tune up so this would be the top string or string four this is the note g okay and now to the third string which is the note c this is the lowest note on the uke [Music] and to the second string which is the note e [Music] and now to the first string the one closest to the ground the note a okay so when you pick it up and strum it dog has fleas that's what you want to be hearing okay so that's first really important thing getting your yukin tune second thing holding the uke now it makes sense to me that the uk should be stable and not supported by this hand so that means i'd have to support it with this hand but just supporting it with this hand and leaving this one free means i've got to hold it so tight i can't strum very freely and that's no good and if i just support it with this hand then i can't change chords so really it's a bit of a balancing act here where some of the weight of the neck is held by your hand that you're fretting the chord which is quite different to guitar on guitar you would never be holding the neck the neck should just be completely stationary and it does make kind of changing chords a little trickier when you're having to support the neck a little bit okay and otherwise it's just your forearm kind of holding the ute down i have seen a few people talk about being able to hold the uke like that and play quite freely but you know i i haven't been able to get it together that quickly so you know it might be difficult for you to one thing i do find especially when i first very first started out i just rested the uke on my lap like it was a guitar and now my strumming hand feels quite free and i'm not kind of having to hold the neck up so much so you might want to try that as well it doesn't really matter whichever way you want to do it you know you want to be kind of holding it up quite high it's not like a guitar where you'd be playing it right down on your left that feels pretty weird so i'm going to have a little bit further up but it's really it's what's comfortable for you um i think if i was going to play it standing up i would almost certainly use a strap you could i mean they're so light and small you could use a bit of string you know it wouldn't be a big deal but so generally you're just using your forearm to hold the uke against your body and a little bit of support from that hand okay so that's first thing that you want to get sorted out is just that you know how you're going to hold it now strumming normally with uq strum with your first finger okay there are other techniques and you can do finger style and all sorts of stuff but to start off with you want to be just using your first finger and interestingly you strum kind of around where the neck meets the body of the uke right it's not like guitar where you're back here further it's more here okay and i'd recommend just starting off just doing four down strums with your first finger and then get used to doing some up strokes and making sure that your finger's not getting caught on the strings and then doing down up down up down up down up real common kind of patterns will be like one two and three and four down down up down up down that kind of pattern works really great on you but there's you know there's lots of different kind of strumming patterns you can use like on the guitar you know there's that's one of the things that you want to be studying as you kind of progress is learning different strumming patterns and different ways of playing it but to start off with just don't don't be all stressed just first fingers strumming around the joint of the neck and the body of you strumming it up and down right that's all you need to really be worrying about to start off with so let's go to a close-up and check out your first four chords [Music] so the first chord we're looking at is a c chord and all we need to do to play a c chord is put our third finger in the third fret of string one that's the one click the string one is the one closest to the ground okay so open open open third fret okay this is a c chord okay very very easy okay another really really easy one a minor all we need to do is put our second finger in the second fret of the top string or string four okay so second open open open just make sure your second finger is not laying over and muting the third string there nice using the tips of your fingers that'll be an a minor chord so c a minor now from a minor we can get to f really easy i know f chord on guitar is a bit of a nightmare but on the uke all you do you started with the a minor you put your first finger down in the first fret of the second string and you leave your second finger down so you've got second fret open first fret open and we've got an f chord okay so start with the first finger first fret second string second finger second fret fourth string [Music] that one we've got that's an f chord okay and the last chord we're going to look at today is this one and this one is a g chord i can hear some of your guitar players go no it's a d chord well it looks like a d chord but on a uke it's a g chord okay open first finger's going in the second fret of the third string third finger is going in the third fret of the second string and second finger is going down in the second fret of the first string okay first finger second finger third finger okay this is a g chord so we've got c a minor f g i'd recommend doing that as a little exercise to start off with and just getting used to those chords c a minor f g and back to c just using those four chords that we learned there are hundreds and i actually mean hundreds of songs that you can play now all you want to do is start off learning some chord sequences i can't teach you the actual songs and name them because then i get into copyright problems i've got to get clearances and it gets all complicated so i'm going to put a list of songs up on the website okay that use these particular chord sequences because i can get away with that so first really common chord sequence that you're going to get is going from the c chord to the g chord to the a minor and to the f okay c g a minor to f now just i'm just using my thumb here just because it's really easy for me to hold the you can kind of strum with my thumb you probably want to be using your first finger okay c g a minor two f okay now this chord sequence is used so much it's insane some of you might have seen the axis of awesome doing this little four chords uh little medley of different songs that use it so this is that chord sequence right so if you want to dig that up that video out you know and check out all of the songs that they do and again you can google it or i'll put a list up on my website you know that that chord sequence it's actually called a one five six four okay one five six four that's the name of the chord segment but there are others even that the chord sequence i showed you at the beginning there's lots of songs that use this having this one chord c to a minor [Music] f two g hundreds of maybe i can't think of hundreds of those but lots and lots of songs use that chord sequence as well right so it's a that's what i would recommend for the uk to start if you're gonna get started on the ukulele rather than trying to learn like loads of different chords and any sort of fancy stuff check out those four chords get really confident with them and confident with your strumming and once you've got that together that's kind of the thing that you need if you're playing at a party or whatever you want to have a a good repertoire of tunes that are really easy that you can play if you've had a couple of beers and it's it's no kind of stress and you're not kind of getting all complicated with it you know so that's that's what i'd recommend to starting off with on the ukulele um i'm going to see for plenty more lessons i'm going to do some songs and some more videos with some more complicated chords but as i said for getting started on the uke you've got enough to get yourself going so uh have fun on that it's a fantastic i really really enjoying the uk it's such a laugh i hope you enjoy as much as i do and i'll see you for plenty more lessons very soon take care of yourselves bye-bye you", "MBBmUVqM6Vw": "[Music] Aloha everyone today we have a tutorial on how to chuck so Chucky is that percussive sound that you can make while you're strumming and it's an important tool to have because it really adds a lot of rhythm and that sense of percussion to your ukulele playing almost like you have a little drummer in your one-person band here so today we're gonna walk through the steps of how you learn to chuck so essentially what you're doing and chucking is you are strumming yeah you are making sound on your strings and then you are taking the heel of your hand and you are swishing the strings right you are crushing the sound and actually you're moving those ringing strings against the fret board and it makes a smack kind of sound and it actually sounds like a chick so that's that's why I think you call it checking some people call it chunking that's cool too but to me it sounds more like so I call it Chucky okay so let's walk through that slowly right you can strum with all fingers you can strum with one finger doesn't matter it's a strum he'll to the hand right strum mute strum push those strings into the fretboard strum okay now we just do that a little bit faster and a little bit faster until it gets crisp okay a little faster strong you okay have it a little bit faster than that okay and then if you can get even faster than that and get the timing just right then you get almost no sound and you just get that smack okay it's just a matter of practicing that speed that adjusting that timing until it is really just that strum and then you get that smack down and make that percussive sound I find that students sometimes have trouble getting enough sound before they mute they're so excited to mute that they just start muting right away you need to get that sound first you need to let the strings ring before you then clamp down on it okay so the way to practice is really to go slow let it ring mute ring mute ring a little faster a little faster than that right try to get that smack it's like you're just clamping down right away okay that's how you achieve your Chuck now how do we use the Chuck let's learn the chucking strum now okay so what we do with the chucking strum we're essentially doing a regular down-up strum you're just going down up down up but on every other down you're going to do a Chuck and a Chuck is always on the down strum so you're gonna go down up now you're going to Chuck on the way down Chuck and then come back up so down Chuck down [Music] Chuck and essentially it serves as like a drummer hitting the two and four in the background like one two three four one two three four so we're doing one two three so the timing should be as if you were just playing three four and but it takes a little while to just get fluid with adding the Chuck in there in time so let's try that slowly really slowly go one and Chuck Chuck Chuck we're just doing an open string let's try it on a C be a little bit friendlier sounding ready okay we can practice this with different tutorials we use it and build me a buttercup and banana pancakes and you could check below I'll have links for the different tutorials you could practice that with you can also use the Chuck in the island strum the Riptide tutorial is good for practicing that that's a more complicated strum essentially what you're doing is the island strum is down down up up down up again you're replacing the two and four beads with a Chuck so it sounds like down chuck up Chuck it's more complicated so you got to take it slow okay so let's do the first half we're gonna go down Chuck pop again and down Chuck one more time down chuck up now we do the second half will go up Chuck up let's just do the second half drop your hand up Chuck again ready and up Chuck let's put the two halves together ready down Chuck up drop that's where you want to get to it adds a lot of rhythm compared to just the regular lindstrom right regular island strum has rhythm when you add that Chuck then you can you can rock with it okay so that's an introduction to the Chuck and the chucking strum and the chucking island strum so hopefully that's a good foundation for you for adding percussion and rhythm to your ukulele playing happy checking everyone and I'll see you out there happy practicing ciao [Music]", "zq5Q0IsMn5Y": "hey everyone its Katie with one music school and today I'm going to teach you some basic finger picking patterns and by the end of this lesson you will be able to finger pick any song that you like now the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to finger pick on quarter notes so it's just the actual beat one two three four is this incredibly important because once we add something called a metronome it's going to make so much more sense and it's going to make your finger picking cleaner when you actually try it so I'm going to use a metronome that I have on my phone it's called seven metronome and I like it because it's clean it's simple and it's free you can find a bunch of different metronomes that are free on your app store also online it's a great resource to have and I highly encourage that you practice with a metronome regularly so the first chord that I'm going to be using is AC chord I'm going to take finger number three and place it on the third fret of the a string and then my right hand is going to be in charge of a certain string and I say that because it's not going to move to a different string for this basic finger picking exercise my thumb is never going to leave the C string finger number one or the pointer finger is never going to leave that a string and my middle finger is going to be in charge of the a string so I'm going to pluck with my thumb so I apply a little bit of pressure and I pluck down on the C string and then with my pointer in middle I'm going to be plucking up like that so it would be one two three four one two three four now I'm going to add the metronome that's going to be very important [Music] now the second thing you have to do is subdivide so you take that beat and you chop it into smaller equal parts so the next subdivision of a quarter note would be an eighth note so 1 2 3 4 becomes 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 and so the basic finger picking pattern we're basically going to double it in speed 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 it let's try that with the metronome [Music] so the next step would be to add your pointer finger so first just on the quarter notes it would be 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 so we have thumb pointer middle pointer and then we go back to thumb pointer middle pointer let's try it with the metronome [Music] [Music] now you can use that same finger picking pattern while you're switching courts it's actually really quite simple I just avoid this string right here that's tuned to the high G if it's tuned to a low G it sounds just a little bit more fluid you could still pick with this one but just for the basic part we're just going to focus on these three strings right here so I'm gonna choose a chord progression from C to F 2 C to G and what's going to happen is I'm going to hold my fingers in the court position so just in case my thumb accidentally plucks this string right here it's going to sound like you meant to do it because your fingers are in the chord so you really can't loose let's start with the quarter note finger picking pattern one two three four one two three four F one two three four one two three four back to C one two three four one two three four G one two three four one two three four let's try it with the metronome [Music] [Music] [Music] and that's it those are two basic finger picking patterns that you can use as a beginner of course there are more complicated ones that you can use you can switch between quarter notes and between eighth notes to switch it up it's really really simple just start off slow don't try to go too fast and eventually you can always speed it up I'll see you the next one bye", "5l2ASKiFlF8": "ok so here we go [Music] hey what's up everybody this is Tata from 10 thumbs procom coming at you with another lesson today we're doing I'm Yours the easier beginner trimmer version alright so you can go ahead and look for the advanced person on Saturday Saturday and B but if you just got your ukulele let's say it's Christmas time you love this song you want to learn it I'm going to break this down as easy as possibly to playing the song in no time alright 10 thumbs procom check the links below so you can ball to help us grow but if you came just because that you could live these years and you want to break it down that's cool like they get not respected I want you got your ukulele bring attention span following out anything let's click this lesson up right now alright time to break down I'm yours by Jason Mraz now remember this is the beginner easy version we will be dropping the full version in B major this Saturday but this is going to be a simple version for anyone view up that I've got the ukulele and you're just beginning but you really like this song and you want to play along with it we are going to need AC major all right ring finger third fret G major pointer finger second strip second fret g string middle finger third fret E string I'm sorry middle finger second fret a string your ring finger will be the third fret E string a minor middle finger second fret E string and an F major which is going to be the same as our E minor but we're going to put our pointer finger on the first fret of the D string and later we're also going to need something called and B diminished that's a little later okay no the idea is to go from one measure OC to one of G to one add a minor to one of F so if you were to count it would go one two three four one two three four one two three four one two three four one two three four one two three four one two three four one two three four we need to make it a little groovier than that so we're going to play it like this [Music] all right now make sure at this point you're a true beginner that you're able to join the course and kata for one two three four one two Accenture once you get that down let's break the stroke down what I'm doing is I'm going down up down up down up down down down but you'll notice the second time I go down up the down is a little stronger down up down up down up down up down up down down down and this happens four times over each chord so over only the C would look like this down down up down up down down up down down up down then you switch the Jeep down up down up down down up down up down up down down a minor move down up down down up down down up down down I'm down death [Music] all right so what I'm going to go ahead do is I'm going to put that together and I'm going to play through this loop three times in a row your goal should be to play along with me and try to keep the rhythm the whole time okay so here we go [Music] and believe it or not that is 99.9% of the song there's one other little part that I'm going to show you right now all right so that's it that's the entire rhythm go ahead and put that to the lyrics and you have the song all right now there's one other part that part where goes should be love love love love and what we're doing there is we're going through the loop like normal singing those lyrics we give this part so got the same commands me love the what we're doing here is we're making a core called an e diminished middle finger first fret ring finger middle finger first fret of the C string ring finger first fret of the a string and you're going to let that one just play one two three four then you go right back into the rhythm alright so if you run through that really quick [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right that is I'm Yours give that under your fingers practice it because we're also doing the advanced version in the key of E minor as well all right I'll go ahead if you're beginner really get this one under your fingers so you can play it so you have it down so you feel comfortable with it before you go ahead and alright 10 thumbs procom thumbs up if it helped you and until next time keep playing ukulele keep letting us know what you want to learn and we're going to do our best to help you out all right cheers and take care of yourselves all right I'm yours now you got it I know a lot of you probably bought this you cook your ukulele just to play the song it was so popular super uber mega hit millions and millions of copies sold and now you got it you can play it on ukulele gonna go oh dude I'm yours you know ya know tenth ultra calm that's how I learned it boom check it out and we all win alright okay until next time big thumbs up a big hug from us to you take care and ukulele bless ciao", "0ZZmaE0X328": "oh hello it's me the ukulele teacher and I'm here to teach you how to play Le'Veon rose by How I Met Your Mother so grab your uke make sure it's in tune and sit back and relax while I teach you how to play How I Met Your Mother the first thing I'm going to do is teach you the intro because there's a couple of chords in that but you'll need all the way through the song now this song is in the key of G and that's a chord that you're gonna need all the way through the song so let me teach it to you now and make sure that you know it Berta Lee put your first finger on the second fret of the third string your second finger on the second fret of the first string and your third finger on the third fret of the second string the chord of G should sound like this the second chord you'll need in the intro is the chord of G major 7 now it's actually only one note different to G but the way I'm going to play it is to bar the top three strings on the second fret so you play it like this the third chord you'll need is the cord of E minor for a minor put your first finger on the second fret of the first string your second finger on the second fret of the second string and your third finger on the third fret of the third string E minor should sound like this the next chord you'll need in the intro is the chord of C six now C six really is the easiest chord of all because for that you just put your fingers nowhere in fact it's all four open strings C six should sound like this and then the final two chords of the verse are D and D seven now for D you put your first second and third fingers on the second fret of the for third and second string like this and to go from D to D seven just add your little finger to the third fret of the first string like this so let's just check we've got a chord for the intro G G major 7 E minor C 6 D and D seven now the great thing about this classic old jazz song is you can play it really really slowly so you can really play whatever strumming pattern you like but I'm going to try and play it similar to how they play on How I Met Your Mother which is a sort of lilting down down up up down like this so let me show you the intro then it's just all the chords that we know I'm going to play them through really slowly G G major 7 E minor and then for C 6 play two down strokes and then one down stroke on the D and one down stroke on the v7 so let me show you that intro again G G major 7 E minor C D D 7 and again the cool thing is you really can play it as slowly as you like so now that you've got the intro sorted the first line of the verse is very very similar to the intro as well it's G G major 7 E minor C 6 and D so let's go through that first line really really slowly then hold me close and hold me fast this magic spell you cast this is lovely on and then 2 down strokes on the C 6 rows and 2 on the D then the second line you stay on the D then go to d7 and then back to D like this when you kiss me heaven sighs hello I closed white eyes I see La Vie on and then 2 down strokes on the G and then 1 on the D and the c6 rose so let's play that second line again when you kiss we have sighs though I close my eyes I see La Vie en Rose and again remember you can play this as slowly as you like then we go onto the third line which is really similar to the intro and the first line it's G G major 7 E minor C like this when you press me to your heart I'm in a world apart a world where roses bloom and you can just play one down stroke on the C if you like now the next bit is where the tune of the song changes a little bit but don't be put off by that because you can still play it really slowly and the strong pattern gets even easier what we're going to do is just play three down strokes on the first two chords and then one down stroke on the next two chords so the four chords you'll need are C 6 g c 6 and d 6 now if you know what c 6 sd-6 is just exactly the same but you bar the second fret so instead of all open strings it's all the strings on the second fret this is d 6 so 3 down strokes on the c6 and the g and when you swing angels sing' throw above and then one down stroke on the c6 and one now stroke on the d6 every day would seem to turn into love songs and then the final line starts like the first two lines with the G and the G major 7 but then it goes to C c6 d and G but again we'll go through this really slowly let me show you if your heart and soul to me and life will always be La 3 on Rose let's do that last line again give your heart and soul to me life will always be la3 on rows so let's put the whole thing together and play it through really really slowly hold you close and hold me fast this magic spell you cast this is the V on Rose when you kiss me heaven sighs and though I close my eyes I see the V on Rose when you press me to your heart I'm in a world apart a world where roses bloom and when you speak angels sing from above everyday words seem to turn into love songs give your heart and soul to me and life will always be La Vie on Rose that's how to play La Vie on Rose from How I Met Your Mother I've been that ukulele teach it if

you can you come [Music]", "Ky9W3tffVyU": "hey what's up guys welcome to another video today's song is on the circles and it's on the ukulele so let's get started alright so let's make this easy and quick tutorial I'm gonna teach you guys the chords and then to strum patterns so the first chord is gonna be a C major 7 2 E minor 7 F F minor and then a G so we're gonna be using these five chords for the entire song so I'm gonna teach you guys two ways to play this the first way is gonna be easier to understand easier to play and the second way is gonna be kind of closer to what you hear in the song so I'm gonna be using the verse as an example we're gonna be changing each chord on the 1 so 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 and using the strum pattern of down up so in the chorus it's gonna be a little different we're not gonna use f minor we're gonna use G instead so that was an easy strum pattern for you to use now if you want to get it to close as possible to the actual strumming we're gonna be using 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & and as you can see the C major 7 chord is on the one and then the E minor 7 is gonna be on the end right after the 4 so and then I'm just gonna use the same thing for the F to the F minor [Music] so together that was song like this and you'll do the same thing for the chorus also using the G so knowing the strum pattern and the changes between the chorus and verse hopefully you guys can use that to play this entire song thanks again guys for watching this video don't forget to subscribe give this video a like check out my other videos and I guess I'll see you guys on another one", "zHUGok_U2mE": "hi guys welcome back to my channel with me rhea today i'm going to teach you another bts song butter and play these are the cards that we need to know to play the intro first and a little bit of the chorus feel free to skip ahead if you already know the fingering position to play f chord take our index finger place it on the first fret second string middle finger on the second fret fourth string next we go c tiny finger on the third fret first frame and then e minor seven so middle finger goes to the second fret third string ring finger on the second fret two but on the first string [Music] plus is a minor seven my favorite chord [Music] to sound like the original song we need to put a capo and place it on fret one but in this tutorial i'm not going to use kpop okay chord progression in this song is mostly f c minor seven and a minor seven so make sure we can do it smoothly okay but later in the chorus we have a new chord progression but it's okay we can talk about it later so the song starts with the first in the first we just need to strong once each card let's go [Music] [Music] and in the pre-chorus it's different we need to do one two three four one two three four okay with the lyrics is it true [Music] untrue [Music] now in the chorus the strumming pattern is like this down down up up down down down down up down okay [Music] and then we head to the post chorus this is different so we have two additional cards in the post chorus the first one is g sharp major seven so our middle finger goes to the third fret third string our ring finger just below the middle finger our tiny finger just below the ring finger and then our index finger goes to the first fret fourth string it's quite tricky yeah next card is b flat it's also tricky so close everything on the first fret using our index finger our middle finger goes to the second fret third string and our ring finger on the third fret fourth string yeah it's quite tricky the stronger pattern in the post chorus is the same like the chorus but the chord progression becomes this yeah it's hard but we have no other alternatives so just practice okay especially this to this [Music] oh [Music] in the second first we need to play like how we play the pre-chorus so this one two three four three four okay later in j-hope's part it's a little bit different but it's okay we can just play along directly with the lyrics [Music] is [Music] and then we go to the pre-chorus again so it's the same like the first [Music] pre-chorus so yeah we need to play another chorus after that so i'm just going to head straight to the bridge rms part the chord progression in the bridge is this one the same like the post chorus the tricky one remember i don't like it either but we have to do it so and then there are times when we only need to strum four times each card and then some parts we have to strum eight times so it's okay we can just play along directly after the bridge we're going to head straight to the lost chorus and the post chorus technically all the same so i'm just going to play starting from the bridge until the end of the song okay foreign [Music] is [Music] home [Music] that concludes today's tutorial i hope you have fun playing it and just in case if you haven't been able to play this smoothly yet it's okay it's tricky i get it it's tricky for me too just remember keep on practicing and be patient and we're going to do it in no time okay i believe in y'all so anyway i hope this tutorial can be helpful and i really hope you guys will enjoy this video if you do please support me by giving it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel okay i'm going to be so thankful thank you so much for watching and see you soon", "kBBaSE0NSxk": "[Music] all right so I did a lesson on this song about a year ago on guitar and I just thought it'd be cool to do a ukelele adaption go ahead hit the like and subscribe button so I can keep making these videos for you guys and let's get started so what you want to do is we're gonna start with a G major 7 chord so what you're gonna do and this might be hard for for some people to kind of smash all their fingers in there but you're gonna put your index finger on the 2nd fret of the 3rd string middle finger 2nd fret of the 2nd string and your ring finger 2nd fret of the first string and then what I'm doing is I'm assigning my thumb to the 4th string my index finger to the 3rd string middle finger to the 2nd string and then ring finger to the 1st string so what you're gonna do is pluck first with your thumb and your index finger on the 3rd and 4th string so you're gonna go alright so the chord we're playing should sound like this [Music] if you just strum all the strings so anyway you're going to pluck with your thumb and your index finger on the third and fourth string all right then you're going to use your middle finger and ring finger and pluck the first and second string so you've got then you're gonna pluck with your thumb and your index finger again now when you go back to pluck the first and second string you're gonna pluck and then pull off with your middle finger and your ring finger so here's what we've got [Music] so then after you pull off you're gonna pluck again the first and second string so you've got time now we're gonna slide down to a different chord so your index finger was set down there on the second fret of the third string you're going to move it to the first fret of the third string then you're gonna add your middle finger to the first fret of the first string and your ring finger to the second fret of the second string then you're gonna pluck with your index finger twice so you're plucking that third string note you're holding down and again plucking the first and second string simultaneously so the rhythm for that chord [Music] all right so here's what we've got let's just take a look at it all right then we go back okay now this time we're gonna go like this so we've got so see what I did there is I'm hammering down my middle finger and ring finger onto the first and second string from open so you're open and then hammering down so one more time okay so all together from the top so here's what we got okay now we're gonna play I think this is a B minor chord so instead of using just your index middle ring you're gonna just bar across all three of those so second fret of the 1st 2nd and 3rd string and then you add your ring finger here on 4th fret of the 4th string then we're going to strum so we're gonna go down yeah all right down down so here's what we got one more time from the top we're almost there [Music] all right down up down now we got to play a little riff here so the riff is just gonna be index finger is gonna hammer down onto second fret of the 1st and 2nd string so you pluck and then hammer down on the 2nd fret and then you pluck again and pull off so you've got [Music] so look hammer look pull and then singularly pluck the second string it's singularly pluck the first string all right so that's that's pretty much it the second time through there's a slight variation I'll show you but let's just run let's just run it one more time so we're in the homestretch here so we've got all right that making sense so that's what we got so far now the second time through it's all the same except for when we go to the second chord so the second time through we've got ok so what that is when we get to that second core that's the same you're just plucking with your index finger on the third string then the first and second string simultaneously then you're gonna pluck again the first and second string and then quickly pluck the third string then again the first and second string I hope this is making sense so [Music] one more time all right and you don't have to do that you could just play it the way I did the first time all the way through you could just keep repeating that but let's go ahead so now we're running the second time through the riff which is pretty much the same except for the rhythm on that second chord so second time through the riff so I hope this helps you get a good start on this song go ahead hit the like and subscribe button and I'll see you on the next video you", "Y1SWR2s8lAw": "what's up only be teaching on how to make some crime wax speed

actually apply the wax because some of you are getting breakage and some of you are not being able to get all of the hair it's actually really an easy fix but it's an easy fix that you have to practice with and get used to doing it and then it works really good when you take your stick i'm going to put this on my arm here and i'm not wearing gloves because i'm doing it on myself okay so the pressure uh maybe you can see the pressure you need to get the angle correctly and the pressure see how i'm actually kind of pushing it into my skin where i'm actually bringing it down a little bit you need to use that pressure it's hard to explain it i can't go like this and have you feel it okay you can actually see the pressure and the angle so when you're putting the wax on and we also had a question about oil so it's just one little tiny drop little tiny tiny drop is all you really need um because if you're using too much oil the wax isn't going to stay so when you move your wax again you just bring it back here bring your wax up so i'm going to put i put hard wax on in this manner and i bring it down and see the pressure i'm doing it really slow and a little exaggerated but i'm really getting that pressure on there and one of the questions was my wax keeps coming up do i have on too much oil well if you work your wax too much when it starts to dry that's going to help it happen as well so again this wax is going to dry pretty quickly and then you just take it off okay so let's do that again so we can and you don't have to re i'm not going to have to re-oil myself so i'm going to take the wax you don't want to put it on this way when you're using hard wax because if you put it on sideways like this your wax is going to be too big of a strip and it's going to hurt too much when it comes off so when you're using hard wax let it pool bring it down work it down two or three times and then i'm actually pushing it to the skin and getting it on there so we're going to let this dry a little piece of wax i got it off a little too soon so if you're doing a strip wax okay the pressure is exactly there goes my oil okay the strip is exactly the same you don't need oil but let it pool but this you want to do sideways and i'm actually pushing it down not to the point where it hurts but it actually comes off a little bit thinner that way too so this one here we're going to lift it up we're going to pull it and i talk a lot about i'm going to take this opportunity to be a good salesperson we talk a lot about the wax not being with it being resin and not breaking like the polymer waxes do this wax is going to stay more pliable than anything that has a polymer in it which is the plastic so it'll work with you instead of fight you a little bit so when you get your strip i can get one strap it here again then you just take it off in small pieces if i were to take this whole strip and put it down like this like we were all taught in school and pull it off you're probably not going to have a client that's going to come back because that hurts so when you do your strips see the thickness of my strip i always try to do it about the same as the stick the width of a stick and then it doesn't even hurt so when i get people that say you must have the no screen cream in your wax because your wax doesn't hurt either it's because of the way you take it off okay", "h4Pc0hgplR4": "hello Aloha today's Oklahoma tutorial remember me will be there easiest that I think you will ever find there are tutorials out there that have the song and eight chords 11

chord C so guys now let's understand how you will utilize this pattern to play in various sections of this song so the song is super easy you have to repeat the same thing again and again so we have our chords as called C a minor F and G okay you have to play all these chords one by one okay so first chord C then called a minor [Music] then God F [Music] then chord G okay and when you play together extra sound like this [Music] so there's the song starts with a pretty funky intro melody and that intro melody would look like this so there's to play this intro melody you have to focus on those strings so string 2 and string 3 and you start with fit 7 so you start like this ok so Fred 7 then right then then fret 8 [Music] then you again play fret 7 now you tap string to one foot 5 3 times then you go to a string 3 then you play fret 5 on string 3 then you go back to string two ok so Fred eight seven then you again play fret 8 and then a slide to frettin so 8 and then 10 and then you again play fret 7 and Fred 10 okay so one more time very very slowly [Music] so as to play this song I'm using a capo and placing it on second fret okay so in case you have a capo then you place it on second fret and you start playing the same chords and you also add just melody over the fretboard now in case you do not have a couple then you can also play this song without a capo this is not mandatory however if you want to play around with your scale you want to adjust the song as per your waist range then you can use a capo so now as we understood everything let's start playing the song

out a record make sure it works because you kind of get a little bit of that and you're like oh wow that sounds amazing and you're super excited to bring it home but when you're at home you want to be able to sit on the couch or a chair like you said with a drink or or something throw your feet up and just close your eyes and listen to the music and you can't really do that come really great with headphones on because you're kind of you're even more stuck to that one spot i mean unless you got i guess portable you know uh wireless ones but but if you have wireless then there's sound degradation in the in in the wireless piece there yeah like it becomes diminishing returns you know the true the true purist analog audio files will want the analog signal to come in or uninterrupted

through what you love to do and now we watch right over you with your heart I'll never toy Georgie I die how these sleep and drink and laugh with me take me from myself see I'm a basket case until I'm able to see your face you save me from myself oh but girl don't you worry about me it in you to me feeling this way [Music] if you ever happen if you ever happen if you ever baby baby let you go hello everybody I'm Vasco from ukulele cheats calm and today were making corduroy dreams by Rex orange county and I'll show you how to play it in the original key if you want you can change the key right here anyway let me show you the chords first alright so the first chord we need is e major seven which for this song we'll grab like this on the fourth fret barring with any of your fingers on the sixth fret a string okay then we have the chord of F diminished seven [Music] then the chord of f-sharp minor six like this and then the chord of be augmented seven alright so these are the main four chords in the song so it's very important to practice the chord changes alright [Music] okay then after be augmented seven we have B thirteenth which is just holding be augmented sound like this but you are sliding the ring finger one fret up okay sometimes we're doing this okay and after that for the course we also need the chord of D sharp major 7 which is the same as the a major seven we want for it down also the D major 7 the same shape you just slide it down then we need the code of a major 7 which for this song we'll grab like this the other way to grab it is like this which may be easier but we have this slide from G sharp major 7 so that's why it's better to grab it like this and then we have the chord of C major 7 and finally the chord of C sharp major 7 which is again the familiar shape so with this shape we have C sharp major 7 D major 7 D sharp major 7 and a major 7th in this song alright ok so this is the main part he major 7 2 half diminish 7 2 s sharp minor 6 to be augmented 7 so we have a few different strings on these chords the most complicated one is the picking so what I'm doing is hitting the C string then the chord and then C string again and going quickly to the next chord where you start again with the C string ok so then on the f-sharp minor 6 the bass is the E string and then on the be augmented 7 I'm just hitting the whole chord so alright this is a little bit tricky in the play along for you just strum all right I personally am doing it like this down up next chord down up next chord down up up and on be augmented 7 I'm doing down down so baby now is best used to weigh me down whereas here and then we have the course but girl don't you worry about it a new to me and here we have slide the whole shape one fret down and slide it back to a major 7 it ain't near to me feeling this lovely darling girl don't you worry about me if you ever happy then baby baby I must let you go in this town the main party yeah and also in the second course this thing if you ever is repeated three times instead of just once in the first cause if you if you [Music] and you continue and baby maybe must let you go and after the second course you have this which is on the etching just two four six and you start out true which is pretty much the main part but you finish it with be thirteen to be seven to emajor seven and this is how you finish the song all right let's do the play long right now [Music] that was my ukulele Storyful corduroy dream thank you very much for watching you can judge we do here like button don't forget to do that and

me just clear my floor nightmare want a solid practice back to review if you don't like it you can do what now say with me so far there but but oh yeah yeah welcome welcome my channel my name is Michi Rochelle meet you 69 I floated on Mondays over anime on other days and I do crappy comedy and review it's like tons of cameras cuz I'm a medical cannabis patient in Florida so if that's your bag subscribe it says to my channel sis and if you new here welcome if you're here welcome back and if you're hater oh my god okay so let's address the elephant in the room um my hands are a little it stain from cooking and there's no no pause but besides that my eyeshadow it's flawless I mean let's get into today's video so today I have a little bit of a dispensary fail so I went to cetera and I picked up some shadow the shadow that I picked up was the string called sherbert and it was really burning my throat I mean hella bad I did a review on it and I didn't even upload it because I wasn't quite sure if I was getting sick or if it was a product so I did some quality control it was the product so I returned it and I picked up some one this is what I have left of it it's like orange II there it is this was my kyon ativ which is a hybrid Leslie sets and here's you not leave Leigh sad I could not find this [ __ ] on Leafly or anywhere so uh what did they make up the strain I know it's florida finest but it makes for a really good read because apparently the guy who made this I don't know he's in [ __ ] jail for something or went to federal prison I don't read the article it's like I say read your Donnelly please that's okay so first of all I want to talk about the shatter I really did like the effects of it but it was just making my throat [ __ ] light on fire so I was like okay I'm big you know we refi they gave me credit I'm actually give me $50 credit so I didn't spend $10 and I got this mkhaya native but there is an issue with it so I'm just gonna let you guys know I have already returned this product of course they let me keep it and I'm gonna show you why and I did get some flour in replacement which was kind of low THC I haven't even smoked it yet I'm gonna do a different review on that so that being said let's talk about this wax and what's wrong with it so at first it doesn't really have much of a smell the smell that it has is pretty much identical to how it tastes which is actually I mean it's pretty good you're gonna see what the problem is in two seconds let's take a DAB so we got my dad too and I'm gonna do a quality assurance check with you guys just so you can see what I'm talking about I have a different banger originally when I made the video and I had problems even when I put it in my nectar collector it's gonna do the same thing let me show you guys what it does yeah some on here good I'll listen I have my and I'm gonna show you this night temperature I don't know if it shows you but it's at 595 97 it's definitely not too hot let's get it on alright it's still smoking cuz it has stuff in it so that being said I'm showing you there's still stuff in it burning off and earlier all right here we go listen what in the actual [ __ ] was that did you hear the sizzle it's like bacon grease by the way if you're new to my channel um I do have a new adapter to my rig this is called key bucket I also have the flower pot this is all by new vape you guys go check out their website the links down below and save yourself five percent by using code Meucci 69 okay so hmm and I actually wanted to do this review because somebody requested that I do more wax and that's what I was up to man I was like I'm gonna go I'm gonna I hunted it down and I got some more so that being said I you know was in a couple groups and they're like yeah you need to call this so I called them and they told me to bring the video down to cetera I brought the video down and I showed the management and he was like what the [ __ ] hi yes editing michelle here from the future the video in question is the video that i made with its sizzling in the bucket like that that i posted on a few groups so i believe i posted it on my Instagram check it out if you want to see it oh I think this by the way I think this was clocking in at like 69 percent convenient I did like the taste I like the takes I like the effects but that to me there is either like some butane in it or some ethanol or something that wasn't cooked off or water and that they told me that they thought there was just water in the product so they did actually give me store credit again kudos to them for backing up their product I definitely will say that picked up some I picked up some LA Confidential and some something cush it's something cush whatever I'll review those for you so I don't know if you guys have already had any problems with products like that like that [ __ ] was like bacon like [ __ ] that is terrifying so any out yeah what do you guys you know what do you think have you so if you guys are having that have then with your products just know that is not oh it's supposed to be and I'll do a quality control real quick I'm going to show you guys the quality control just so you know that it was not that banger okay so let's do this doing a comparison I'm almost done because I eat a heart that says old I'm gonna show him that it's it just is I don't know why all right for shits and giggles there's the 9 pound hammer shatter they made a little the beginning because there was still some on the end of that but there is no more now as you can see temperature for the same put two different products it and they did tell me it was not supposed to make this myself you guys are getting wax and it's making that noise in your rig please go return it that is not how it's supposed to sound I'm throwing that out there because that's not that's not that's not cool but like I said luckily they had no problems they corrected the situation but the [ __ ] flour I got was low THC go figure at least I'm glad that I got it so it is what it is so keep your eyes on your meds if you're unhappy with something do a little research call him up take it back I mean that that again kudos to them for rectifying luck to find situation that was awesome Oh quarry teams making me go [ __ ] nuts I hope you guys are doing okay and I think that's it we have made it to the end of the video so if you've made it all the way to the end of this video you are awesome go ahead and drop a like you can be a [ __ ] and drop a Dick's Lake and hit the bell to get notified when I post later [ __ ] but but but by qivana that she needs to go I'm just saying okay bye", "W9u75ioILrk": "what up y'all this is wax thanks to everybody who voted for us in the high-time

Meredith if you haven't seen the collaboration video I did with them peep the description page [ __ ] is tight sorry from the lack of videos I've been real busy my life's been crazy a lot of good ships happening a lot of bad [ __ ] is happening but I promise to change to change my ways and put up more YouTube videos the main reason I'm making this video is because we do have something real good coming out it's a video for a song off the album liquid courage the song is called music and liquor and we spent a long time making like a pro as video shout-out to my boy Jay who directed the whole left lane six crew we spent a really long time on this video and we're having a premiere party for the video here in LA at our place called citizen Smith in Hollywood that's on Wednesday June 10th and 8:30 p.m. but details up about that in the description section too but anybody in the LA areas to come out to that this we're going to show the video I'm gonna do performance and all that jazz and the next day on the 11th it'll be out on this on this YouTube page and it's gonna be crazy in the whole world just gonna feel it you know I mean what else I'm not gonna say and that's pretty much it we got another video it's like a professional video to that we already shot but that's just gonna be [ __ ] crazy and uh anyway since I haven't put any any like rap videos or whatever up in a while I just kind of found this on my camera the last day of shooting for the music and liquor video we're kind of happy and we had a party at my house and then this is just a freestyle I was freestyling my board Morgan Jenkins was playing guitar and Yellen was beatboxing and it's not that great or whatever I'm not that proud of it but I think it's entertaining maybe somewhat of entertained by it or if you're not you could like at least spend your [ __ ] time putting hateful comments off about it and I started cuts off in the middle that's just the way it was film and there might have been some heat that's missing I don't know or some wax I don't know but here it is this was a couple weeks ago at my house [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "GEhgkBbwAB8": "hey hi hello if you're new to my channel welcome and if you're not new welcome back glad to see you today i'm going to teach you how to play mr lover man by ricky montgomery it is a song that i discovered recently on you guessed it tick tock this song is going to be one of the easiest songs i've ever taught for the ukulele so that's the good news the bad news is i'm new to this song so this might be rough we'll see okay first off strumming pattern there's exactly one for the whole song unless otherwise stated which will happen rarely so it goes down up down up down up down up down down down down the only thing that's difficult complicated about this is it can be a little hard to keep a steady tempo when you have those like because if for whatever reason you're having trouble with the with the up thing up strum if you're having trouble with the up strum um it can slow down your tempo a little bit it took me several takes of my cover to have anything remotely approaching a steady tempo so that is a little bit difficult but the actual motion of like down down down down down isn't too difficult um just maybe practice that before you go into the song alright now we're gonna do chords the verse and the chorus have the same chords which is awesome starting at the beginning it goes f c c maj c g that is like three quarters of this entire song so i'm going to sing it through the verse one thing i wanna know which is just a little strumming thing um is at the end of pretty much every stanza in the lyrics um we're not gonna complete the we're instead gonna go i'm gonna play that for you real quick so you know what i'm talking about it's just because it's how ricky montgomery plays it on his guitar so um going from the second half of whatever that stanza is it's the f [Music] and that's going into the next verse pay attention to when i play that when i play through this verse and play along if you want if you feel ready if you don't feel ready you can go back to the top of this tutorial here i'll be waiting for you you ready okay i'm headed straight for the and it's heading straight for my skin and leaving me tapped [Music] shaking these thoughts from my head [Music] you put these waves in the door my mom is calling me hi mom going from i've got the shake of my legs sorry i've got this shake in my legs shaking these knots from my head you put these waves in the door i'm cracking out i [Music] [Music] these chords are exactly the same going into the chorus uh strumming is exactly the same i just realized i totally watched the melody of the first verse sorry i said i was new to this song but i played the ukulele part writing that is what matters okay going into the chorus i'm [Music] and i miss my lover and this is the one part where you don't go you're actually going to continue that strumming pattern into the third first whatever the verse after the first chorus is so the end of that goes i'm mr lover man and i miss my lover going into the second verse same strumming pattern same chords they're up here if i'm moving too fast i totally understand here's back to the beginning of the song if you need more practice go back here as many times as you need to it's totally okay i will be the wiser all right going into that verse the way in which you talk to me as me wishing i were gone [Music] but you're cracking up you're cracking up [Music] bye mister i just played a whole lot so i'm gonna take a brief break you may notice um there are sort of two sections to that verse that are distinctly different but i didn't do that in between them because that's going from i've got me running on and on oh i'm cramping and there's something about not having the silence for oh i'm cramping up that is kind of nice going into the second chorus which is the same the same as the first one um from the end of that third fourth first i don't even know at this point but you're [Music] cracking [Music] man and the way that we end this first chorus i don't know what i'm saying is we instead of doing because i've been i've been strumming with my fingernails we're gonna go to the inside of your thumb and go [Music] because the bridge is fairly quiet and subdued so the way that that sounds is [Music] like and it makes it muted and pretty and soft okay if you need clarification on any of that because the bridge chords are a little different this is definitely its own distinct section here is back to the top of the song again i will be giving you this several times um so that you can go over that but those are all the same chords through there so bridge time the first part of the bridge goes d minor g c e minor a minor i know i went through that really quickly i'm gonna break it down so the line i'm shattered now is a d minor i'm shattered and then i'm spilling out is a g i'm spilling out next line is upon this linoleum ground upon this is a c upon this e minor nullium and then ground is an a minor depending on how fast you're going that may be a sort of difficult switch from the c e minor to the a minor um just take some practice that whole part song through goes i'm shattered now i'm still [Music] the next line exactly the same chords and strumming wise um so it goes i'm really in my brain again before it can get back to you and then the last line of the bridge which is oh what am i supposed to do without you is a d minor and then an f minor that's a new chord take note of that and then c that line sun sounds like oh what am i supposed to do without you all right from here on out it's all stuff you know because we're just playing the chorus twice again we're just gonna do some stylistic things so i will walk you through that so that last line oh what am i supposed to do without you we're gonna do something similar um as when we went into the bridge which is we're gonna get quieter because if you know anything about the end of this song it's like the it's like the 15 seconds that's always chosen for the tick tock it like starts out quiet and gets loud so we're gonna go 0-1 mi supposed to do without you going into that c major seventh i'm mr loverman and then we get loud [Music] you may notice what i did there was the down down down down strumming pattern i just like that because it gives that transition a little more power so [Music] yeah that's the only thing that's remotely complicated about about this lost chorus so i'm gonna sing through it just so you know it repeats um so be prepared for that play along if you want and uh yeah here we go someone's cutting grass outside i'm so sorry [Music] and i miss my lover i'm mr loverman and i miss my lover [Music] i forgot to sing that line the line goes mr lover man [Music] cool you just learned the whole thing

you don't need to use it but if you want to sing lower key you don't need to use the cable and if you want to sing in a hierarchy just like i did you can use the cable on whichever you want to put on here this song is divided into four parts which are intro verse pre chorus and for each part just go ahead and click the description down below so you can skip to whichever you want to see and learn first but i'm gonna teach you in order just as usual and yeah in this video i am not going to use my cable just in case you don't have one yeah let's get started basically in this song you just need to use only four chords which just only four chords from the top until the end you never change the order of the chord just stick to this f g a minus c yeah when you play the intro part it's not like a strumming but it's more like a arpeggio arpeggio like finger style [Music] like this so basically you need to place your fingers on first second third and fourth strings at the same time like this thumbs index middle ring fingers here like this and then when you play the f chord it's going to be like this [Music] step one plug your first and fourth strings at the same time so you need to use thumbs and ring finger at the same time like this and step two after you plug these two strings you need to use your index finger and plug the second strings like this [Music] and when you mix the step one and step two it's gonna be yeah step three plug first and third and fourth strings at the same time so you're gonna use thumbs and middle and rings finger at the same time let's mix up the step one step two step three together [Music] again again last time [Music] last step which is step four after you've finished this step one step to step three you're gonna use your index finger again and pluck the second string like this and i'm gonna mix up all the steps into one [Music] let's play together from the top so let's try this arpeggio repeatedly until i said stop one two three four one two three four yep i think now you're getting used to this finger style so let's change the chord into another one i mean like this yeah let's practice together one two three four [Music] so yeah now we can sing along with this finger style let's do it one two three four [Music] oh let's play again one two three four [Music] [Music] first part [Music] is a little bit busy it's gonna be like this let's play together using f chords only one two [Music] again one two [Music] okay let's play this pattern of strumming repeatedly one two three four down [Music] up i'll go more s'more slowly one two three four down up touch up down [Music] assume that you already understood how to play this strumming pattern and now next step change the cord like this [Music] let's play like this together with me i'll go play more slower than this don't worry up one two three four [Music] oh [Music] today i go more slowly let's play together one two three four down up [Music] no [Music] oh [Music] is

had done it so i thought you know what why not people learn easily from youtube than they do from other places so sure the song is really easy it's just four chords and a very easy strumming pattern the first chord is a major then it's a b then it's d major and then d minor [Music] so the first chord a major um i'm going to explain it from this is the first string this is the second the third and the fourth so it's two one zero zero right so the first tab is one the second is two so it's two one zero zero for the first uh [Music] the first scored no cable oh and also i apologize for um buzzing sound i didn't cut my nails so a major and then a b is two one zero two so you add the third finger right here on this [Music] and then d minor d major is 2 2 2 0. right and then the minor is two two one zero [Music] and you basically just switch with these so it's and the strumming pattern that i use is just [Music] that's you do this for the first verse the second verse if you want to do an intro and then before the third verse you strum twice and then stop with your hand so it's and then you go into the strumming so it's like there's a reason the line puts barriers on the tube blind um am i missing something you start on the second chord with um the singing so it's so the first chord is empty and then you start on the second chord and then the fourth chord is uh empty as well and that's basically it it's it's really really a simple song um you can do a cover uh not a cover a solo after the second verse and before the third and that's it thank you for watching", "4FnzfmSAaLQ":

to work on a solo rendition of you've got a friend by james taylor and carol king this was voted on over at my patreon page where each month we do a different tutorial based on suggestions of the patrons so check that out in the link down below where you can also find a download of this tab but let's go ahead and dive into you've got a friend to start here we want to make sure that we're going to play the notes with lyrics associated louder because those are going to be the melody notes as far as a technique i like to use my thumb throughout this whole song just to get good articulation on the melody now to start we're going to play when you're down we're going to play open on the c string then two on the c string and you can use your middle finger there and then we're going to play the word down and for down here we're just going to move our middle finger up to two on the g play our g c and e strings and you can actually stop your thumb on the a string don't play it but have it collide with it to stop it and that gives us now just a moment ago i mentioned play the lyrics louder these all have lyrics with it then the next chord here 2 0 0 0 which is an a minor which we're already playing you want to strum softly so i like to use sort of the side of my thumb and the reason we're doing this softly is because there's no lyric associated to it so it's a little filler then we're going to play and trouble and to play this we're going to play open on the e string one on the e string with the index and then we're going to jump that one on the e string with the index up to one on the g string with the index and our middle finger is going to cross down to two on the c string we apply the g c and e strings again stopping on the a string so a quick tip is it works really well as you're strumming through to have that finger actually go into the e and then just stop so that it doesn't ring because the melody notes here on the e string but then we'll notice right after that we're going to play through the full chord so add your ring finger on two of the a nice and quiet because it's a filler no lyrics then we're going to play and you need a helping hand and to play this we're going to play open on the a then we're going to play 2 on the a and i like to use my ring finger here the reason for that is the next chord for the word knead i'm going to slide that ring finger up to 3 on the a i'm going to add the index finger here to 2 on the g strum through all four strings then i'm going to play the 3 on the a again for the word uh and now these two fingers in their location all that they have to do is both slide down one fret so the index goes to one on the g the ring goes to two on the a and just add my middle finger here to two on the c and strum through all four strings and that gives us the word help and then ing for helping hand is going to be ring finger off for open a and then for the word hand all that i do is take my middle finger off and slide my index finger up one fret to two on the g string i'm going to strum my g c and e strings stopping on the a now the next thing after this is we're going to be doing what's called a harmonic now if you haven't played a harmonic before i actually have a tutorial down in the description below but we're going to use a harmonic on the 12th fret on the c e and a strings for a nice little fill quick tip with harmonics make sure that you're just touching the string not compressing it just touching it right over the fret wire so not in between but actually over the wire itself and as you feel the string start to vibrate you remove your finger and then the last word there is going to be the word and for the end of that bar so let's go ahead and hear all of this the first four measures including the pickup bar and i'm going to say the words as we're playing it so it should be something like this when you're down [Music] now we go on to the next set here which is going to be nothing we're going to play a d minor chord and to play this chord we can take our middle finger place on two of the g ring finger on two of the c and index on one of the e string alternatively if you're comfortable with it we can also do the middle finger bar on the g and the c index on one of the e this one's a little bit more challenging but both work for now i'll play the slightly easier one that's going to be enough so i stop on the a string and i'm going to play the one on the e again for the word in nothing then i strum through the whole chord all four strings with my thumb nice and soft no lyric i'm going to play the word whoa open on the a then for measure six to start here i'm going to play this really cool interesting chord and all that i have to do is take my ring finger off and move my middle finger to two on the c so i have zero on the g two on the c with the middle finger one on the e with the index and open on the a strum through all four strings and that's enough and then for in i'm going to play three on the e and then open on the e taking my middle and excuse me my ring and index finger is off open on the a three on the e and then we'll play two on the c i'm going to slide it up to four on the c so i'm going to maintain pressure with that middle finger and slide it up and that's for the word right so it goes nothing is going right now here on measure seven we have a little fill that's supposed to be sort of like a guitar solo only on the ukulele and the way that we're going to play this is take your index and barred across three on the e and the a strings we're going to play the three on the e hammer on to five on the e remember to get a good hammer on sound make sure you're getting right up next to that fret wire and making sure that your finger's really perpendicular to the string so that you can get a good sound for more on hammer ons i've got a link down below let me do a hammer on and then we'll play three on the a and then five on the a with the ring and then three on the a again you see we use that little bar there with the index so that it's ready to go on both the three on the e and the a so it goes hammer on three on the a five three then in measure eight we're going to strum through all four strings that are already there zero zero three three then we're gonna do five on the a pull off to three so pull offs opposite of hammer ons going to start with the finger on and when you do a pull-off to get a good sound the trick is to not just take the finger off but to physically pluck the string as it goes and that's going to get you the good pull-off sound and immediately after we do that pull-off we're going to cross the ring finger to 5 on the e string and then 3 on the e 3 on the a 3 on the e and open on the a take our hand off so that's probably the hardest part of the song if you're really struggling with it it's okay to just kind of hold the chord the zero zero three three that whole time but if you want to get it sounding you know really nice just practice that riff nice and slow but here we go measures five six seven eight all together should sound something like this goes [Music] that's very slow with it but so you can start to hear it then we go on now to measure nine and measure nine is going to be just two on the g and two on the c so we're going to take our ring and our middle fingers place the middle finger here on two of the g ring here on two of the c strum through the g c and e strings open e again and again and that's close your eyes or close your eyes rather and then go and think and to do that we're going to play open on the e again for the word and and then for think we just add our index finger here to three of the e string and then we switch to our e7 chord index finger on one of the g middle finger here on two of the c and we're going to then play the g c and e string stopping on the a of me then we're going to stream through the full e7 so i have that ring finger on two of the a nice and soft no words there then we're going to play the words and soon i will be there now here's what's cool soon soon i will be there measures 11 and 12 are exactly the same as measures three and four going need a helping hand they are exactly the same so once you have three and four down 11 and 12 are the same so let's go in here 9 10 11 and 12 all together should be something like this close your eyes and think of me and soon i will be there two and then we go on to measure 13 now we're going to be playing brighten up play a d minor chord pretty straightforward we're going to be fretting the d minor the same way we did before middle finger on two of the g ring on two of the c index on one of the e or the other d minor mentioned earlier we're going to play the g c and e strings for bright just the e string for n and then the g c and e for up so it goes brighten up no a string in that whole sequence and then the very last chord all through nice and soft because there's no lyric and then we're going to play this interesting little chord we're going to play two on the c with our middle finger open on the e and the a and we're not going to strum the g string so we're just going to strum two zero zero and that's going to be e and then in add ring finger on three of the e and then open on the e and then two on the c for the notes and the words rather even your dark guest night then from here it's going to do a bunch of filler and for this filler we're going to leave our middle finger where it is here add our index on one of the e string and our ring finger on three of the a strum through all four strings and then we're going to pluck our g c and a strings then we're going to go to a g7 chord which all that we have to do there is take our ring finger slide it down one fret [Music] and then to finish this we're going to play open on the e u and then the word just is one on the e so here's all of measures 13 14 15 and 16 should sound something like this should go brighten up even your darkest night [Music] you just now here we go on to measure 17 which is kind of you know the main melody of the song you just call out my name and you know wherever i am i'll come we're going into the uh running eventually you've got a friend but here on measure 17 to start we're going to play just three on the e string to do this we just take our ring finger place it on the third fret of the e string we're going to strum our g c and e strings the word call and then we're going to play out my now to do this we're going to play open on the e then take your index play one on the e and then pull off to open on the e a little tip it's really hard to do pull offs on fret one it's the hardest place to do hammer ons and pull offs i think is fret one so you want to make sure when you play it to get a good uh pull off you want to actually physically pluck the string as you go through have that finger pluck and then we go on to 18 this is a really pretty little c major seven chord to play this we take our middle finger place it on the fourth fret of the g string and our index place on the third fret of the e and we just don't play the a string and this is basically just an f chord moved up two frets so as far as way to think about playing it it's not that complicated so we have now we've played call out my name then what we do is we just take this f chord shape that i just mentioned it's a c major seven chord but it's an f shape and we slide it down to the f and we play one and three one on the e with the index three with the ring finger and that's and u and we go on to the word no we add that middle finger back on for an f chord and that's the word no and then when we play wherever i am we're going to play one on the a with the index where open a f three on the e with the ring one on the e with the index i and then to go to m we go to a d minor chord same chord we've been playing throughout the song two two one zero middle finger on two of the g ring finger on two of the c index on one of the e and so just to look at that little run here with the words uh name and you know wherever i am it should be something like this name see that's like the f chord shape and then we slide it down and you know wherever i am the last two notes now this are and to play that we're going to play zero two one zero middle finger on two of the c string index on one of the e string open on the a word aisle and then for the word come i'm going to play three on the a string and that finishes that whole stanza so it should sound something like this [Music] and then we go run and we're right into this next section here on measure 21. this is my favorite little part of the song i just love slides they're something that i really enjoy doing in this case we're going to play three on the e we're going to strum our g c and e strings with our thumb and immediately after we play the three on the e we're going to slide it up to five on the e and then we're going to slide it back down to three on the e string a trick to do a really good slide with this is maintain the pressure and actually increase it just a tad as you're doing the slide so you start the slide kind of increase the pressure up to five and increase the pressure just a little bit more back down to three not a lot but just enough to keep that note ringing and that's run uh run in then we're going to play zero on the e twice for oh yeah and then baby is going to be two on the c with our middle finger and then e is going to be open on the c so we have run in oh yeah baby and then we're going to play to see you again pretty straightforward little bar we're going to play open on the c for two open on the e for c one on the e for u and then open on the e for uh and then for again we're just going to take our middle finger place it here on two of the c reflect just our g and our c strings stopping on our e string for the word get so we have again and then from here we're going to do some filler and that filler is going to be played off of this chord here with our middle finger still on 2c add the index on one of the e ring finger goes to 3 on the a we're going to stream through our g then our c then our e then our a then our g then our c nice and softly because there are no lyrics associated with it and then we're going to play a g7 chord just take your ring finger move it down one fret and then open on the g and two on the c all of that is filler so we want to play it nice and soft so let's go in here measure 21 22 23 and 24 should sound something like this [Music] now we go on to the next bar here which is winter spring summer or fall all you got to do is call and and to start here we're going to play open on our gc and e strings omitting the a string win and then tur is going to be three on the e string adding our ring finger and we're gonna play that again and we're gonna play it one more time and that's for the words winter spring sum and then we're going to take it off er and put it back on for four but when we put it back on for the word or we want to look ahead to the word fall which you can see is that same little c major seven that four zero three chord we played before it's like an f chord moved up so for the word or we're going to play that three on the e with our index finger so it goes winter spring summer or so you see how i kind of switch fingers there to set up now for the word fall to be right there and then for filler there i'm gonna play open on the c and three on the e and then i move down to our f chord all you got two now this is a little tricky we're gonna play the f chord and then we add the three on the a open on the a again and we have to depart here to do this little embellishment run for the words do is call to play this we're going to start on 7 on the a take your ring finger play it on 7 and we're going to do a pull off down to 5 which our index finger should be on so remember good pull off make sure that you're actually plucking the string to get that sound and then we're going to slide down to three sounds so good such a fun little line i love these type of lines makes it a little challenging though and what you do is when you do the slide increase the pressure a bit slide just to the adjacency of the fret wire you don't want to overshoot it and after you've done that for the do is we're going to go to this really pretty chord ring finger added on the five of the e and middle finger adian for the c notice how our index is still here on three of the a it's an a minor seven chord we're gonna stream through all four strings so just so that you can hear that all you got to do is call it's something like all you've got to do is do is then we got a little filler chord here it's almost the same but we need to be playing three on the e instead of five on the e so what we do is we take our ring finger off and we move our index finger to bar across the three on both the e and the a strings and strum that nice and softly and we're going to play the word and [Music] so that whole part on measure 25 is winter spring summer or fall all you got to do is call all oh and and excuse me the word is and at the end there now we move on to the last set of measures here which is going to be i'll be there and to start this line we're going to play the f chord then we're going to go all the way up to 7 on the a we can just use our pinky finger there and then we're going to go back to that chord we just played that little a minor seven so middle finger on four of the c ring finger on five of the e and index here on three of the a strum through all four strings and then we're going to go slide down and move a little bit so our middle finger stays on the c string goes to two index finger comes up to one on the e and the ring finger goes to three on the a for that chord there it's called a g7 sus4 if you're wondering and then we've got the main part we've got you've got and so to play this we're gonna play open on the c and two on the c with the middle finger open on the c again and then we're going to play this little line to end the song take our middle finger place it on four of the c index here on three of the e strum our g c and e strings for the word friend and then there's a little fill at the end to play this fill you're going to take your middle finger slide it up to five on the e or excuse me five on the c you're gonna add your ring finger to five on the e you strum your g c and e strings then you go back to that previous chord so middle finger down to four index here on three of the e slide it down two frets to zero two one add three on the a with the ring and finish it with a c chord so here's all of measure 29 30 and 31 and 32 so you can hear it goes there you've got a friend at the end there it's still phil but you can play the last few notes a little bit louder just because it's the end and there you have it there is the full arrangement of you've got a friend again if you'd like to download a pdf of this tab be sure to check out my patreon page link down below it's really thanks to my patrons i'm able to

strumming pattern with that chord progression one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight also note for this chord progression when you reach the sixth beat of the C major chord you're just gonna choke the down strum so it should sound something like this [Music] five six seven eight now that we know the chords the chord progressions and the strum pattern let's put it all together with alerts and play through senorita there's some things that never change you say we're just friends but friends some know you secret cuz you know it's been a long time coming

a full mustache I'll give you a closer look you can see like all those little black hairs on either side mostly on this side actually yeah and normally I don't care about it but I'm getting pictures taken tomorrow there's gal I used to babysit for as a photographer and offered to do graduation pictures for me I graduated last December never got pictures done so I'm pretty excited I got the Sally Hansen starting engine out relief wax strips so I think I've used these before in high school like seven years ago I've used these they come in two different sizes a big size and a little size all oh yeah I'll be using the little size for today and then it also comes with these numbing wipes so you can numb the area if you so choose to and then this finishing oil to just replenish all the skin you just ripped off your face along with the hair so I'm going to get started I've taken the liberty of reading the directions and it says the first step is to wash and dry your face which I did about an hour ago so I'm not going to do it again and then it says to rub one of these out relief numbing wipes on your face which I'm going to forego because I don't think it's going to be that painful and they only give you three and I think if I use this on my bikini area I definitely you want to save these because that will hurt so the next step is to take your wax strip sorry I'm also still reading back over you're supposed to take your wax strip and rub it between your hands to warm the wax so like get some friction going after rubbing this for like two solid minutes it's not peeling off like it's supposed to and it's like very hard so I think I'm going to try to get a candle light a candle and then like hold it over the flame to warm it up so I'll be right back with those materials just kidding okay so I got this candle from downstairs and I'm going to hold this above here to try and get it to melt a little bit wow that like instantly worked easily pull it apart that would have never worked on my using my hands by the way and then you're supposed to determine the direction of growth which is this way you mustaches go down and then press on and the direction of hair growth on the direction over here goes on three huh you're supposed to pull that the opposite way in which you press it on something we're ripping it this way got that one two one two three not feeling Oh move this burning candle away from my arm I'm not feeling like that got a whole bunch you can see like one hair there but I'm definitely sure I have a bunch left so I'm gonna try again with the second strip and try to see if I can get it a little hotter because I don't think that that was as hot as it could have been for the maximum results okay so this is pretty hot no pretty dang hot okay Google this is working it's definitely working alright let's try it around to holding the skin tight ripping on three one two three oh heck yes check that out that just got like all the freaking black hairs that's what I wanted to see complete mustache gone let's see it's a red oh no there's still something there dang you facial hair but I think I'm just gonna go in and get those few stragglers with tweezers just because I think that that might be easier at this point I've already ripped off two wax strips so ding I am impressed with that one I'm gonna try to do this one on one time so I've heated up I pressed it down I'm gonna let it cool for a little bit does it say to let it cool but I feel like cooling it does help so okay here we go I'm gonna hold it tight over here and pull it with this hand now on three one two three okay on three this time one two three let's see oh yeah it definitely got a lot of hair I don't know if anybody can see that it got a lot a lot of hair up here if I hold it this way you might be able to see although oh yeah you can definitely see all the little wispies right here definitely won't like rubbing your hands together will not warm up this wax this instruction manual is a liar oh yeah good job Sally Hansen you pulled out all my facial hair anyway thanks for watching I'll be posting another video very very soon so be on the lookout for that one as well I hope everybody has a great weekend see you in my next video bye", "HzPZHpdLwtA": "what is up you guys welcome back to my channel this is carrots your friend carrots and today we're back again for

[Music] so let's start with the chord that's leo so let's that's the layout again so let's start from the basic which is the chord and then for the song we're gonna learn just four chords okay so first is the chord p all you need to do is to place your index finger or any of your finger on the second third frets first string and it should sound like this [Music] that's the chord of c next is a minor it's another single string board and you need to place any of your finger on the second fret fourth string just like this and this is how it should sound like okay now next is the d minor all you need to do is to place your index finger on the first fret second string middle finger on the second fret's fourth string and ring finger on the second fret third string making it sound like this [Music] that's d minor and the last chord is the chord all you need to do is to place your index finger on the second fret's third string middle finger on the second fret first string and ring finger on the third fret second string making it sound like this and that's the chord progression as well starts with c and a and g [Music] see now that we are already done with the chords and let's move on to the strumming pattern so destroying pattern um i'm going to divide it into two so one is going to be like a very beginner and chill kind of way the other one we're gonna use some tabs and we're gonna use some choking and everything so let's start with the basic first with the easiest one okay so if you're um like super beginner and you don't wanna stress yourself in a strumming then you can have this trimming pattern down down up up down up down okay again down down up up down up down and it should sound like this so that's it and you can use that kind of shrimp pattern from the start from the very beginning of the song until the song fades away now we're done with the easiest strumming pattern so let's move back to the easy one well i'm not sure if there's a difference with that word but anyway so this is going to be the strumming pattern so that's down chalk or hold down um hold down down hold down up pull down down hold down hold down down hold and down [Music] okay i don't want to sound cute now anyway so that's it so that will be this another kind of strumming pattern that you can use for this song and let's have the tabs okay so for the intro of the song was like which is really cute so so let's start basically for the tabs guys what's good about that it's going to be a very easy tab we're just going to use the a string or the first string all throughout this tabs okay so we're gonna snug the three other strings so let's start three and then five and then move back to three and then three two three two zero two three five five eight seven three two so that's it i'm gonna paste it here and it should sound like this [Applause] [Music] okay i'm not really good about this kind of thing but yeah that should be it so you can use this tab from the intro or the instrumental part of the song that's it so i think you're already ready so let's go ahead and sing the song together i'm gonna play some lyrics in the chords on the screen so you can sing with me and it's also on the description box below so you don't need to worry much [Music] can you call me baby [Music] i'll be there [Music] i knew [Music] downwards [Music] you stay forever [Music] i'll be [Music] i need somebody [Music] girl i swear [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] yes and that's the song imagine how easy and sweet the song is and i hope that you've learned something from our

way yeah and then so we're working on this section right now correct okay grab as much as you can okay [Music] inside ninety degrees and we're going straight down 12 so why am I getting so much at the top like that you had to hesitate at the beginning go ahead and scrape it um scrapes away yeah okay drop the stick and move on okay so do you but the spreading is good it's really thin it just at the beginning your hesitated a little hesitation okay you put it down yeah that's okay it will take time once you put it down you you keep moving you pause for a second okay it's thicker sticking to you then you need to throw the stick away and then oil your gloves you can remove that wax that you said because now you won't not be able to put the glove back on why your hands muddy oh my goodness so many little things yeah it's the only thing about it and then you'd understand their being frustrated is that medium or small is the media I'm just okay okay take it off just wipe wipe yourself I'll put the hand right where the fan is turn it on you've done it away get a new one make sure your hand is completely dry and there was one minute on the glass we know not stick away 12 you always 12 everything oh yeah oh okay I'm gonna got enough cuz this is that's okay now go ahead and scrape all that thick wax I'm talking yeah alright throwing it away now remove something written sorry business go ahead the hand watch your hand to em if you should you use these earlier that okay use your thumb to stretch the skin okay okay keep moving on stretch the skin thumbs pulling everything this is a entry now fold it he's cleaning up the whole thing so you don't have to stress Chang just this you're holding it wrong awesome it's so like you know guess which good it's this part but go ahead and use a new one okay remember one hand it's gonna hold on to just this yes yes there's a press harder one one go use your body weight suppressed so I'm not pressing hard enough still correct okay so you wanted to like and how many views you just do like one like or to the two let's make sure you cover the area so you're gonna do one pull two three four done okay okay okay all right now we're doing pick a side why don't you put the pot on the side of the cart so you can tilt it like yeah hey glad more wax later okay it can't leave because when you scrape you're gonna tilt the stick up yeah scraping yeah and then go wow yeah let's do it is that too thin no there's no such things too thin okay go all the way down seeing you missing oh yeah they're all the way down a lot of people have paint all the way down there what you could do is scrape the scrape the lash like this nut no okay I'll send this video to you so you can watch the purple dude no boom you're not doing horrible you're fine take a side all right give it all you got when you pull okay [Music] [Music] you know leaving yourself enough room at the beginning hmm so don't know apply way too high maybe like a little lower okay yeah it's okay for a little bit the time you fill my pony's charm mm-hmm you can tell right yeah I can hear and I can feel the resistance a little bit more yeah seiniger head a media yeah so that mean you're not pulling it high enough okay now fold is just because there isn't much left so go ahead and fold it because it's really thick now [Music] okay so then continue using it just like yeah there you go yeah how you want will dictate how the hand will grow okay when people come in to me if if someone else broke the hand I can tell this is shaving you see hair sticking up huh if you don't of like not sort of straight yes if you wax right right everything good everything goes just should be smooth and every single strand of the hair should not be wavy it should lay flat interesting okay yeah you be able to-- that's what i see what hard wax but i think is because they break the hair instead of pulling it off you know like if people get come on baby like a regular hard whacks upon my hard wax yeah it just that i think is the way they do it is they a lot of time people have grown like this right yes so then we'll just apply straight down and then pull up you break the ham i can guarantee you one hum per side okay all right I know you do this it's we're doing just the cleanup go ahead and get a new strip yes since you're then used on the thumb of the pie away just to avoid accident harder use your body weight do use your palm or your fingers when you do it your palm did you lower the bed as well up to you just like how you know massage therapist they don't really use that arms and shoulder it's their body weight really okay you can't go through the day using I just wondered how they don't just like arms because I mean I can't actually having to do that all day so remember here yes you made this thick so you're gonna dip wax like this right you're not gonna apply like this you're gonna apply like this you see the difference not this okay why dripping soldier oh yeah so you apply like this okay new stick prepared sure you didn't scrape it enough okay yeah straight down straight down the food yes never start a new line you just always try to finish the rest okay I think yeah but now you got a lot of wax on both sides you can sprays yeah you don't want to scrape too much because sometimes it pulls on the skin when you scrape it you know all right let's go ahead and yeah now there isn't much left so do a small line from here", "dNHryJ1beI8": "[Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "IMrIWYlkTjw": "why hello there today i'm going to teach you how to play fujinhanishi in the ukulele and did you know that food energy is a japanese word which means winter talk maybe so let's get started okay so first thing that you need to know is the chords so the chords for this song is kind of many but you'll really get used to it soon so you need 10 chords in order to play this song versus b flat [Music] and then next to c next is a d minor f g g minor a minor e flat nine eb9 so i realized palad that i should tell the strumming pattern along with the intro the the chorus the verse and then the bridge so first is the inter part so the intro part you need nine chords and the chords are b flat c a d minor g g minor a minor e flat nine and then c um so for the strumming pattern in the intro let's focus on the b flat in the b flat you need down up then switch chord which is c down down up up down up then switch [Music] chord [Music] then one more time okay [Music] up [Music] and next we're going to the verse so the first part they have 11 chords so you have f a d minor a minor [Music] so for the strumming pattern let's focus first on f a and d minor for the f you need four down strums so one two four and then a three downs and then chalk and then d minor down [Music] and then for a minor you know it doesn't matter what strum you wanted to do it with this part so for me okay [Music] so the strumming pattern for your next chords it's like [Music] that [Music] um [Music] so we are down to the first one now we're going to the chorus part and the chorus part needs 11 chords yeah so b flat a minor d minor g minor c f and then b flat again a minor a7 which i forgot to mention [Music] earlier and then d minor g minor c m so the strumming pattern for this one is actually the same in the verse one it's down down up up down up yeah and then switch chord down down up up down up you know tinkerers right play true [Music] okay [Music] so is so now let's go down to the bridge part for the rich part you need at around eight to nine chords i mean seven chords only we need b flat [Music] and then for the strumming pattern for this one is actually just down strokes you know it doesn't matter it's okay if it's one two you know to feel if you wanted to feel the part this part because it's like kind of sad [Music] foreign [Music] so i almost forgot after the course after the chorus number two there is like on that part where you need six chords and then the strumming pattern is just the same down down up up down up so you need a flat a minority minor g minor c f so and then of course part which is just the same and we're finished yes and see you again next time goodbye", "TxTYcHHpQQo": "folks guess what we're doing today we are going to learn how to play Havana by coming Kamilah caballo caballo caballo come I li kamul oh all right step one get your ukulele you all have it make sure that your ukulele is ready to go make sure it is also tuned so if you go sweet little and yeah tune or like I do you can use it it's flat there alright then once this is tuned turn your tuner off and there we go by the way um this isn't any I ukulele I can put a link in the description down below where you can purchase your own the one I got comes with this tuner which is really handy it comes with this strap it also comes with a pick a finger shaker a wipey cloth a capo a lot of other things and it also comes with a case I did a review video it goes a little more in-depth I'm like the features that this ukulele has and everything I can put that in description down below as well and you can buy this ukulele and all of the goodies and all that on Amazon and it comes all the way from China so are you ready folks let's do it this song is very simple it's the same three chords over and over so this should be very easy especially if you're beginner for ukulele the first chord is going to be AG minor and it looks like this you got this this and this okay so I put my ring finger here middle finger here on the second fret and then first finger over here now does the g minor chord folks that's your first chord second chord is gonna be C minor which is really easy I just take my whole finger and I put it on those first three strings on that third fret and C minor and then we have a D which is the first three sorry you can't see this top three strings on the second fret that's a deep okay so we got G minor C minor and D and sometimes a d7 which is just a D and the little pinky on the third fret so here's the strumming pattern so it's it's kind of what I do you can do a little Chuck in between I love Chuck's either the best so Chuck and what a truck is is really it's just you just kind of stop the strings like with your palm I know it looks like my like nails early but my nails aren't even really touching the strings I just like curled down cuz like they're like so you mute it with your palm so that's a Chuck anyway that's the strumming pattern and then sometimes in my video my Havana video which I'll put in this description also sometimes I do a little plucky thing and so I'll do this and what that is is it's just so this one that's all it is and your fingers are just staying in the same chord pattern that they already were in but I'm just plucking little to add a little pizzazz so it's this one okay so the g7 chord [Music] good so once you have that plucking part down that's the my entire song that's the whole song now sometimes you don't have to do this but at the pre-chorus when it's instead of going up to that C minor for that second chord you're gonna go to e-flat if you want both of them will work but e flat is like e if you know what that is in the second fret and it's just moving down the front so it's gonna be these three strings all with these fingers and then this pointer finger is gonna come up here so and then you would just go back to the G minor you can watch my Havana video which is that two million views right now holy crap thank you very much side note seriously guys I did not expect that video to explode that much my Spanish students just requested the song and then I did it and I didn't know it was gonna get that popular so thank you so much also other side note this song was featured in who sang it better this is a YouTube channel they picked me like my cover to represent the USA and what this channel does is it takes covers of pop songs so this one specifically is for Havana and they took it from a cover from someone in Indonesia Germany Republic of Korea France I think yeah and all that so mine represented USA I'll put that in the description too crazy I didn't know that happened but yeah anyway let's go through [Music] he took the back half of my heart is in my heart isn't moving no mana you can walk over there how you doing Santa girls I so it's literally just three minor C minor d7 the whole time that's the whole song so now you know how to play your vana", "WCZ0iWXb2sI": "welcome to JB lessons I'm JB and in

description box below to download the music for today's lesson if you're not sure to read tab have a look at this lesson and also if you're enjoying the content that I'm making please do consider subscribing okay to play Hedwig's theme most of the song is actually just on two strings that each string and the a string we sometimes venture to the C string as well but mainly just E and a it's gonna start with two open strings each string first then a string this song is in 3/4 which means it's got a waltz feel to it 1 2 3 1 2 3 and the first beat comes in first a note comes in on beat 3 of the bus it goes 1 2 3 that's where we're gonna start so open string open string stay on the a320 now go up to fret 7 5 and then slide down to fret 2 so I would do the 7 with finger three the five with finger one and then just keep it sliding to open string three two prep for on the e-string this time I would use finger three for this one fret one on the a string then an open E string then it's very similar to the beginning open E string open a string stand the a string 3 to 0 this time we're gonna go up to fret 7 but I want to use finger 1 this time instead of 3 so we use finger 1 which if you've got the dot same as meets the second dot quick way to find 7 7 then use your little finger on fret 10 which will be your third dot and we go 10 just walk your fingers down 9 8 now we've got finger 1 free so that we can grab for and use your little finger again to go back up to eight and keep that run going down eight seven six so we run over that bit again open string open string three two zero finger one on fret 7 little finger on 10 walk it down to notes 9 8 finger one fret 4 then jump back up to 8 with your little finger and walk it down to more notes 7 6 this is when we need that C string we do 3 on the C string throw in the a string then an open a string next we've got alternating from the E string to the a string we want fret 8 on the E string fret 7 on the a string and we're gonna go 8 7 8 7 8 and now with this second finger just rock it so that you can cover that 8 on the a string so we've got this 8 7 8 7 8 Rock that finger 8 keep it going down 7 6 back to the e-string seven eight back to the a-string seven six three undersea string again three open E string seven on the a string then a very similar little thing we go to that eight and seven again eight on the e seven on the eight eight seven eight seven but this time we're gonna go eight ten with your little finger on the a string and it's just like we did before ten nine eight grab fret 4 with finger 1 or back up to 8 with your little finger 8 7 6 3 on the C string 3 on the a string and open a string if you've enjoyed the video please do consider subscribing and clicking the bell so they don't

to be honest\nbut after listening to it for like five or six times then I go\nit's so good now this song can be quite\ntricky for beginners because we will have a bar chord later\nbut it's okay all of us can learn okay there's always a pause and rewind button\nif you feel like missing out okay these are the main chords that\nwe need to know to play the song just skip ahead if you already\nknow the fingering position to play Dm take our index finger and\nplace it on the first fret second string our middle finger goes to the\nsecond fret fourth string and our ring finger just below the middle finger\nDm next is C take our tiny finger and place it on the\nthird fret first string and then we go F take our index finger\nand place it on the first fret second string and our middle finger on\nthe second fret fourth string now this is the tricky chord I get it guys\nyou hate bar chord I hate bar chord even more but we gotta do this so might better learn now okay so to play Bb\nbar everything close everything here on the first fret and then our middle finger goes to\nthe second fret third string and our ring finger goes to the\nthird fret fourth string Bb we can actually just close the first and\nthe second string like this but I'm used to doing it like this to sound like the original we need\nto put a capo on fret one here okay but in this tutorial I'm gonna explain\nwithout capo okay so everyone can learn to play the intro we need to do it like this one and two and three and four and so with the lyrics lovesick girls lovesick girls okay then we go straight to the verse in the verse it goes like this one two three four one two three four\nfive six seven eight again five six seven eight\nokay so we play Bb longer let's play the verse slowly with the lyrics now yeongwonhan bam changmun eomneun bange uril gadun love love\nwhat can we say maebeon apado oechineun love\nlove dachigo manggajyeodo na mwol mitgo beotineun geoya eochapi tteonamyeon

and then F in the first part of the pre-chorus\nwe only need to strum once each chord after that we're going to do the down\ndown down down thing again okay so let's play along with the lyrics slowly ama da jamkkaniljido molla urin mueol chajaseo hemaeneun geolkka but I don't care\nI'll do it over and over nae sesang sogen neoman isseumyeon dwae the chord progression in the chorus and\nthe post

looking for love I know how you must be feeling your\nindex finger must be hurting like crazy right I get it I get it if it hurts please take a break first and then continue later okay\nyou can always learn it after you take a break in the second verse we need to do some muting so we have to use our right hand\nto block it okay and then it also helps if we use our\nleft fingers and we just kind of lift them up a bit slightly you see how I did it yeah\nlook so it's like the combination of my left hand and my right hand but if you don't want to mute it's okay\nwe can just strum once later in the song and it's gonna sound great anyway okay\nthe pattern becomes this one two three four okay so with the lyrics but why we still looking for love no love letters\nno X and O's no love never\nmy exes know no diamond rings that set in stone to the left\nbetter left alone didn't wanna be a princess\nI'm priceless a prince not even on my list love is a drug that i quit no doctor could help when I'm

started this channel and we are now a family of thousand subscribers really helping you out so once again thank you for your support now let's talk about what we have in today's lesson today's lesson is a song request you must have seen one of my other lesson 10 hindi songs where I've taught you 10 amazing in the hits now one of those songs was look at shippi and there was a common request by many of you to bring a detailed lesson on it so here I am today I'm giving you a detailed lesson on Luca cheapy so take out your yucks [Music] and let's start learning look at your base so guys let's talk about what all chords we need in this song now to play this song you need three chords and these cards are called C called F and chord G now these chords are fairly simple if you want to play called C you just need to put your ring finger on 3rd fret 4th string and called C will sound like this to play chord F you just need to play your index finger on 1st fret 2nd string and a middle finger on 2nd fret 4th string and called F this sounds like this to play chord G you need to place your index finger on 2nd fret 3rd string your middle finger on 2nd fret 4th string and your ring finger on 3rd fret second string and god G will sound like this [Music] now once you know these cards now our next plan is to understand the strumming now strumming is the main key of this song so let's learn the strumming so guys the common strumming pattern what we are using in this song is [Music] now let me break this pattern for you so that you can understand it in much better way I'm trying to keep it as simple as I can so that even if you're a beginner you can understand it clearly now whenever you are playing Godsey and chord G you have to make sure that you'll play this particular part of this pattern that is down down now whenever you'll play called F then you'll play the same pattern but you just need to add a Down stroke after this pattern so down up down down so as you can see when you're playing chord F you're using additional down stroke now this down stroke will be played with a stronger force than the other three strokes of this pattern now you will be repeating this pattern all over the song and you have to be extra careful while switching the chords because this song is pretty quick and you have to change chords pretty rapidly so be extra careful while switching the chords so guys I will be using a capo in this song and placing it on second fret like this now if you do not have a capo then you can play all these chords normally and I am just using this capital scale of my voice so let's start playing the song [Music] look I can't be bought [Music] dr. J okay help pity I just saw injury majide' difficult on the log I make me neither I just saw [Music] ow [Music] yahooo Dinkelman [Music] come on Vinick is so Jessica so Lorne or Johanna herself know

supporting yogi guide and if you have a song request do let me know in the comment section below or connect me on Instagram or Facebook so until next time do take care and bye bye", "AE5sGdOpwCI": "hi and welcome back to my channel today I would be paying that you can let it fire you I'm kidding okay what am I doing with my life okay so today we're gonna be playing Rainbow Connection on the ukulele and I'm gonna teach you how to do this so before we get a little too far I want to show you a neat little trick I found for the ukulele that kind of makes it sound cool it kind of makes it sound like muted but like like it makes it sound like a telephone if you want to make it sound like that all you need is a rubber band just a simple rubber band just like this doesn't matter how stretchy or loose it is but just kind of think I guess like this [Music] [Applause] so today we're going to be playing Rainbow Connection Rainbow Connection so if you already know these chords you can just take a look at these are you sure you've got this down so anyway let's do this and I kind of teach you some chords first and then we're gonna start on the song the first chord we're gonna do is a so a super easy take your first finger place it on the third string first fret and take your second finger place it on the fourth string second fret and it should sound like this the next chord is G E minor I think that's how you say it but I don't know so correct me if I'm wrong okay anyway so our next chord is we're talking about is I'm going to be like this so it's literally just going to be the same thing as a and all you're gonna do is take your third finger put it on the second string and 2nd fret so it's literally just gonna be having your hand here and then placing one there like that's all you have to do a G B minor C it sound pretty similar the next one is D here's how to do that what I do just to make it a little bit easier is I just take my first finger and place it across the whole thing but that's kind of you can choose to do whatever so not not them it's hard to see not this first strength but just the last three strings so next is 87 should the next one is B - what you're gonna do is take your first finger just place it on these three here a three kind of bar chord on the second fret and then you're gonna take your third finger just because it's easier to stretch over rather than like trying to reach over so just take your third finger and reach over like that great that looks that's pretty cray cray cray - a cray cray cray so the next last one is DB minor seven I don't know I don't know somebody explain that to me so that one is pretty simple so you're gonna take your first finger put it on the fourth string first fret and you're gonna take your second finger put it on the third string first fret take your third finger put it on the first string second fret to finish it sound like this so now I'm gonna teach you how to do it the first first is going to start with a GMB I'm just gonna say that a GMB de7 and then you're gonna do that four times so you start with a and then GMB d and e seven I'll just repeat it a couple of times for you guys a GM B D I'm gonna get four times and then after that it's going to go D to D be M and then you go to your Rainbow Connection part you're gonna do B minor C seven a and g mb b minor someday and then you seven will find it and then a the rainbow and then Gee Gee Gee Bee tion and then and then after that it's going to be back to B minor then you go to seven and then back to a so pretty simple hopefully you could figure that out and follow along but it's not okay so now I'm just gonna play the whole thing over so you know what it sounds like [Music] well I hope you enjoyed my they do if you have any

being one of the most popular requests that I've been receiving and it's probably just because it's such a love show in such a hugely watched TV show I actually think the theme is quite a lot of fun and it adapted pretty well to the uke it's just such a interesting sounding song it's so catchy with that bad data and that theme that builds throughout it it's just was a lot of fun to put on you so this is going to be part one of a lesson and in part one we're going to be learning the complete intro and the verse if you guys want to learn the rest of the tune you can do so in part two of the lesson at rock class 101 so the second part of the video lesson will cover the verse variation it's going to cover the chorus the chorus variation and the outro so the complete rest of the tune plus you can also get the complete tabs to print off as a PDF format and get access to that on-screen tab here which literally you can hit play with this performance slow it down to whatever speed you want and you watch the tab scroll across in real time just a great asset and learning this song that much quicker so all that's at rock class 101.com so let's go ahead and kick into this lesson so we're going to kick off with the intro and our intro sounds like this okay you can notice that it's looping the same thing four times in a row and then it does another variation on that four times in a row so it's not very very hard what we're actually playing does involve a hammer-on technique so we're going to talk about that basically for the first set of four what I'm going to do is I'm going to play completely with my thumb on my right hand and I'm going to hit string four open and then string three and then we have our hammer on so it's going to be our first finger on the third fret of the third string and we're going to play that note again with our thumb and hammer on the five on string three so hammer on is basically you pick the note once and then use that finger to hammer on with enough force to create the volume on its own without using another pick alright so I pick once and I hammer on so if you haven't done hammer ons before just give it a shot and just practice it the goal of a hammer on is to create the same volume in between this note and this one that you hammer on but what it does is it cuts back on the work for the right hand plus it gives it a more interesting sound to switch it up so again we have open for open three and then three to five on string three pick one time so it sounds like that again we have one two three and one two one two so that's our rhythm that we're gonna be playing you can also think of it as da da da bobba really really simple and catchy rhythm so looping that again four times without me calling it okay now the next set of four is basically like a variation on this we're going to do the same beginning open for open three but this time around we're going to hit the second string open and hammer onto the first fret of string 2 so 0 to 1 on string 2 and for my right hand I'm going to go thumb thumb and then second finger to pluck string to right so same rhythm and you can see when I hammer on I'm just going to leave that finger down so that it just sustains into those opens that following right it just gives it a nice sustaining sound so you have four of those in a row so now we know the whole intro so if I play the intro all the way throughout it sounds like this okay and that's what we get for the first part of this arrangement so now we're going to move into the verse so we're going to play a few of these bars at a time and then break it down so here's what the first part of this sounds like okay so our first chord is going to be a c5 to do this we're going to take our pinkie put it on the tenth fret up string one and then your middle finger on eighth on string to the other strings above it are going to be open so open three open for I'm gonna go ahead and strum this first chord and then I'm going to pick out of it I'm going to hit string four and then string to remember keep those two fingers planted for right now so we're gonna go shoot um for two right and these are all quarter notes or even three okay after that bar two for the verse I'm gonna go so I'm going to strum three and two together or you could plug them every one doesn't matter hit both of those together string three in two and then hit string four and then string two again so I have three and two together string four string two all quarter notes all the same like the time so if I put bar one and two together I have 44 to write all even quarter notes again okay and if I call the rhythm one two three okay the next two bars are going to sound like this okay so you can see that I'm still out of that c5 chord shape but we've got quite a bit more going on with our third finger being added to the mix now so what we're going to do is we're going to take our index finger and we're going to put it on the sixth fret up string one right so what I'm going to get for the first one is I'm going to lift my pinky up from that c5 right we had c5 which was second finger and fourth finger lift that pinky up we don't need it for right now put the index finger on six on string one keep the middle on eight on two so we're going to pluck string three open and hit string one which is the 6th fret together then we're going to take that ring and we're going to hammer on to 8th on string one so you pluck three and one together and then hammer on pluck hammer on pluck hammer on after that your pinky is going to go to 10 on string 1 play that and then hit the open for so again we have 3 and 1 hammer on to eight with the ring go back to 10 on one with the pinky and then play open for so our rhythm is gone into so you have a eighth note followed by two quarters that add that right one and two three so get that stuck in your head okay the next bar bar for for the verse is going to go so it's like a variation so we're going to again strum three and two only open for after that and then hammer on six to eight so you've noticed that that middle finger stays anchored four bar three and four of the verse the entire time doesn't go anywhere again bar four strums three and two open four and six to eight on string one same hammer on we did before so if we put bars three and four together for the verse we have okay now if we put bars one through four together for the verse we have okay so that's basically what our first four bars for the very sound like let's go ahead and look at the next set of four and it's going to be all out of a G minor so a lot of these bars actually are the same so it's going to make this next section quite easy learn because it repeats so here's what the next four sound like we're going to loop all these together this number okay so our chord shape is an E minor right just that staircase that stock staircase a minor we make we're going to move it up the neck so you're going to take that ring put it on seven on string three your middle finger on six on string to add your index finger on five on string one string four is going to be played open so the first hit is just going to be strumming all four and then hitting open four and then where you go six to eight on string 2 so that middle finger is going to hammer on with the pinky six to eight on string to our rhythm is one two three end so we have quarter quarter eighth note so again some four six eight on string to hammer on okay now here's where the section repeats these next two bars are going to double so the second bar for G minor you're going to be playing string three and one together and then open four and then again the same hammer on six to eight so we have three and one open four and then six eight so same rhythm one two if I play without calling okay so the first three bars put together have shrub for your clock for your clock for head and without calling okay the last bar for this g-minor is gonna go show four and add your pinkie to eight on string to again it's shrub or eight on two and those are all quarter nuts okay so this G minor section again put together that's what we get all right let's move on to the second half of this verse okay so our next four bars go into B flat chord so let's learn that shape real quick and then I'll play it throughout and we can see how these four bars are based out of that chord shape so chord shape looks like this and basically we're going to put our first finger on five on string three our middle finger on six on string 2 and our pinky on 8 on string three okay and we're ignoring string four so only strum three down so here's what that section sounds like so like I said most of this is just staying straight out of that B flat 5 chord and then we're moving a couple fingers to do that little pull-off lick that happens so basically we're just arpeggiating out of the chord so the first one is going to start with a strum and then playing three and two and these are all quarters one two three right so all even notes okay the second bar is going to go strum three and two kind of like we did before right and then again three two so the first one we have strum three two one three two the second one strum three two two three okay put together slow down okay the next bar here's where it gets a little tricky it's going to do a quick little pull off and then stretch to pinky and then play the octave of that so what happens is that I'm going to lift my pinky up from that B flat five I'm going to drop my middle finger to six on string one but my index is going to bar so you're going to bar five down only strings one two and three right remember we're ignoring string four for this whole section so I'm barring five down and I'm pulling six two five off so it would be a pull off right there right the pull off is the opposite of a hammer on so hammer on was hammer on right a pull off is the opposite pulling up right but it's not directly up when you pull off you want to tug down a little bit on it right in the same goal applies we want both notes to do the same volume okay so I pull off and then reach with my pinky to eighth on string one and then play string three which remember is barred so it's the fifth fret okay I rhythm is one and two three so we have eighth notes one and quarter quarter right one and two three so I played again sounds like this okay slow off eight five okay here's what the first three bars sound like together okay so the fourth bar to finish this section it will sound like this so basically it's just hitting string two and then playing string three and two together and then string three right so we have two three and two together and then three and these are all quarter notes point three right so same rhythm for this our same duration of note for this section so that completes those four bars guys all together we sound like this okay now the next part these next four bars are going to start one quick hit with that six to five before it goes to this F minor chord right for that last section so you're going to do a quick six to five again right same finger so you got to bar that six two five two pulls off to the index bar and then you're going to move this bar down to the third fret but what happens in this last section is that instead of covering from three down you're going to cover from two down and with two down covered we're going to play string three and string one together so three is open now and then it's going to do four to six on string 2 right so it's a hammer-on I use my middle and pinky just like that so I pluck four to six so that first bar for the last four for F minor is going to go okay so again our rhythm is one and two and right so we have 1 & 2 3 n right so little tricky now the next two bars are identical they sound like this okay so we're going to plug 3 & 1 3 again is open one is barred on strings 1 & 2 on the third fret open for after that and then again 4 to 6 middle and pinky we have that same rhythm s throughout this arrangement 1 2 3 & 1 2 3 now the last bar is going to sound like this all quarter nuts so plucking three and one open for and string one one two three so again three and one open for and then the third fret of string one so that gives us the complete verse guys so let's go ahead just play those last four bars and we're after that we're going to put all the verse together okay so let's go ahead and play that verse all the way throughout now so here we go alright guys I hope you enjoyed this

"dJ4HUboHxL0": "hey hello it's Jen it's been a while but I'm gonna be showing you how to play see you again bye time to crater this is inspired by the cover that I did so I'm gonna link that down below if you would like to check it out but let's get to it so right here I have an acoustic-electric concert ukulele and it's a Mitchell ukulele if you'd like to find this ukulele online or any of the other ones that I own I always list them down below in the description so check that out if you want to but let's get to it so first off I use no capo so you don't need to worry about that second off the chords are actually pretty easy in my opinion yeah they're not too bad there are lemony there are only four and I'm gonna listen down below right now and if you already know how to play these chords feel free to skip ahead to the time stamp I'm gonna have below right now but if you don't know how to play these chords there's no need to fret I got you I want to show you how to figure them so to start off with being able to know how to play F so f let's start off on the second fret and then put your middle finger on the top string right there that's the G and then put another finger down your pointer finger second from the bottom string the E right there and it's just sound like this [Music] next you need to know how to play ad minor so for D minor let's start off with the first fret put a finger down on that same string second from the bottom and then put a finger down on the top string right there and then put another finger down on the second or the top string on the second fret and it should sound like this next you need to know how to play D minor red G minor put a finger down on the bottom string on the first fret the a then put a finger down on the second fret the second top string that's the C and then put a finger down on the third fret on the second from the bottom string the E and it kind of creates this triangle shape and it sounds like this [Music] and lastly you need to know how to play c7 c7 it's really easy I'm gonna show you it's on the first fret put a finger down on that bottom string right there the a and it sounds like this so to play this song I start off with that verse and I do this really interesting strumming pattern I'll show you it it's really easy but I'm going to show you what it sounds like first and then I'll break it down so I go so it doesn't it's not hard at all I'm gonna show you exactly what I was doing so the chords you're always going to be playing those same four chords in order throughout the whole song so so if it's the F it's C minor G minor and c7 so to start off you're gonna be strumming and then you you study strong this is an F you strum and then you kind of knock like unequally that's what I did you don't have to do that you can just strum down tunes but I thought it was kind of fun so let's do it together and F so and strong knock-knock strong knock back stop knock-knock and I don't really knock on that last woman you can't if you want so now let's do it singing together so one two ready go F knock knock knock knock you live in a dream state and that's how I started it off moving on from that that second part of that verse is when I start off the strumming pattern that I use for the tire like the rest of the whole song I did Chuck I know sometimes some of you guys get a little frustrated because it is very difficult to chuck when you're starting to play the ukulele so I'm gonna show you that Cermak pattern the one I did with checking but I'm also going to include an alternative one that you can like use instead so this is the one that I did with the chucking and it is I'm gonna be playing the F and something to remember is that you're only doing that strumming pattern once for each chord so for example I'm gonna go in the order again it's F D minor G minor and c7 so [Music] something like that last time just kind of down strum instead but it's personal preference so that's the strumming pattern that I did rewatch that excuse me I'm a little sick but rewatch that if you are still a little confused I understand it'll be a little bit confusing at first but here's an alternative strumming pattern in case you want to not chuck at all so it's gonna be the same chord so something to keep in mind with this strumming pattern is that you're actually doing it twice per chord instead of once which is what you did with the other strumming pattern so I'm going to show you so let's do an F and it is hope this is making sense so let's do the whole chord progression out so start off with that and switch switch [Music] don't strong for that last one so again let's do it in it f so I forgot that residency seven so those are the serving patterns I'm going to continue on with the checking one because that's the one that I did in my cover but feel free to continue on with the other one if it's better for you learn from the top [Music] you live in my dream state and any time that's the only time makeup you exist so let's do that second part again together slower that's the only time makeup you exist [Music] I hope this is making sense remember you can always use the other storming pattern if it's easier for you so just kind of letting that putting that out there and the rest of the song is the same honestly it is it's the entire same chord progression same chords but we're gonna go through it together pre chorus so 20/20 vision I'm gonna take it slower sound strong and that was that we're moving out to the chorus I'm just gonna keep going since this is like the same thing over and over again just obviously different lyrics but going into the chorus then you go can I get it can you make it [Music] and I'm not doing the alternative strumming pattern right now for any of these guys that are doing that rule [Music] [Applause] so it like it sounds good unless he does it's just a little bit different but remember with that one you have to do the strumming pattern twice for each chord instead of once like the chucking one that I'm doing so I hope that makes sense continuing on we're just gonna do the second verse and then I'm gonna end this video because again we're doing the same thing over and over again I don't want to keep you here for too long but this is the rapping verse I love this verse so much take it slow for all of you that want to sing it I promise I don't really rap I kind of sing it as you know but yeah just take it slow honestly if you are like really looking forward to doing it so let's do it starting off with the F I said okay okay okay okay my maturation is leading to another but you Mollett love oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah let you happen sorry I've been looking stop the way sugary nasty bumble bee on the seat yeah I'd give up my baby to have a piece of it bloody and that's the whole song basically you do the I'm sorry I'm sick again but use you the pre-chorus and then after that you do the chorus again and the song kind of just ends that's how I played it I hope this was helpful can I get a kiss and you make it last forever", "YsdAM58xBhg": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

I'm going to teach you how to play Sweden on the ukulele from minecraft so what you're going to do is you're going to put your pointer finger on 3rd fret E string and your middle finger on 4th fret g string you're gonna plug them both at the same time then you're gonna go 6th fret g string then you could do 5th fret you can a string then we're gonna go 2nd fret a string then security string and open a string alright then we are going to do 3rd fret E string then 7th fret a string and ninth fret E string so all together it's just not like this then what we're gonna do is we're gonna strum and E minor all right then on the 8th anybody to go open 2 and strum a D major all right then on the a string we're gonna go 5 7 and strum and F sharp minor then what we're gonna do is gonna go 2nd fret E string 2nd fret E string open a string and then strum and a major all right and you pretty much do that part four times then after you do that we're gonna strum a D major then second fret a string then open a string then for this next chord we're going to take what we think of D major but two frets up then after that we're gonna go for two on the C string then that chord is what we think of as the G major but two frets up then we're gonna go to four on the C strength and strum G major then we are gonna play a d5 then what we're gonna do next we're going to go 2nd fret a string then open a string again then do that D major two frets up again then for two on the C string then that major two frets up then 2 4 on the C string then we're gonna strum a B minor alright and that part should sound like this [Music] all right and that's how you play Sweden on the ukulele so thank you guys so much for watching this video if you liked it please like and subscribe I make tutorials every Friday and leave a comment suggesting anything where there are tutorials or covers or any other style of video related to the ukulele I'm down to do it other than that have a great day", "tkQV2EzGjT4": "I'm excited dudu hi everyone today I'm making do-it-yourself ear candles my first time doing this but it's gonna be fine we can do this together I've got a pair so the things you will need they're made out of cotton and then they're soaked in beeswax on both sides so these little sheets I bought online and then the things that I got myself a chopstick which is about the right dimension for my ear long enough to fit the beeswax paper in got a little bit of cotton fabric and I've just chosen an organic olive oil you keep reapplying between ear candles so I hope that makes sense let's get going I'm excited first up oil your fabric then you need to slightly heat the beeswax cotton that one is hotter I can feel this it's it's more flexible before the heat it's kind of yeah it moves more doesn't it curl up the paper I should go your fingers and roll away apply pressure as you roll so when it cools down and hardens it stays in place so let's slide it off oh that was easy I've got very small ear holes that's good this little test feels a bit horrible but I think that's gonna work when I have my person helping me burn the ear candles I'm not gonna do it on my own and you shouldn't do that it's not safe so now I'm gonna do a couple more maybe a hundred let's see how I go the oil on the chopstick or blast concentration oh yes I feel that it's a little bit tighter I'm gonna get a pot to put them in so that what I've got like 20 done they're not flying all over the place so the next couple I'll do speed it up for a bit of fun here we go he goes let's see how fast I can do 50 you the speed I just heated one side I think it's still going to work well", "JKtPE3HfL5c": "hello hi everyone today we have a tutorial on how to strum clearly you want your strum to be clear articulated where you hear every note and you have control of the strum so we'll go over some techniques right now to help you achieve that I like to start with my thumb now some people strum with their thumbs forever you want to eventually move up to strumming with the index and actually more advanced players you see that they strum with all of their fingers at once so we're going to start with the thumb mostly to show us how much power we should have in the strum so if you take your thumb I want to get it right under your string like it's cutting into your thumb yeah pluck it out you're not going to break the string I just want you to get used to how much power you have all right you should be able to do like that string out so let's flick each of them we got G C yep these strings are strong use your strengths and really pluck them out so that now we're going to pluck from this one string down into the next and stop on the next string you can grab your uke under here if you need ya same amount of power you see how my thumb is really getting cut into by that string you're going to pluck it down and stop on the next string you might want to push your thumb into the fretboard okay gives you a little bit more control if you push your thumb into the fretboard alright so you're pulling G down to C stop on that next string now you're going to pull down to the E string be able to stop on that string you're getting as much power as if you were plucking out but now you're plucking down pushing in that fretboard yeah your thumb moves back into the fretboard e to a and then a down so then when you play them slowly together each string is nice and clear now you can start going a little bit faster okay each you can hear each note clearly that's the goal if you feel that your strum is muddy that you can't hear the notes then start here nice and slow that's what a strum should sound like we'll try it on C right with your thumb if you find that once you play chords it's not strong anymore then you need to press harder with your cording fingers to make sure that those strings are all the way down on the fret okay now after you feel confident with your thumb then you can move to your index so I like to put my thumb and index together if you see from the side the index is sticking out a little bit so I'm using my thumb for power but I'm using my index for grip so strumming this way is going to give you more control as you learn more advanced strums using your thumb actually you can hurt your thumb you have more chance of hurting your thumb it's different people teach different strumming and different people like strumming in different ways so find what works for you but this is what I like to do is put the thumb and index together have the the index sticking out a little bit then you're going to do the same exercise get that index finger underneath the string like halfway down your nail okay so you're not picking with the top of the nail you're really using this for power and now you're gonna pluck out okay so for some people if you're not if you don't put enough pressure on it then your fingernail is going to slip off you got to put a lot of pressure on it and then also use your thumb behind here to push on that string like I'm not can you guys see how how much I'm pulling that string up here there you get the eye really pulling in sir yeah gee okay now see get your index under there try not to let the fingernail slip it's like if you're skating on ice you got to step harder on it and then a okay so when you can do that with your nail now you're going to do the same thing where you push one down into the next and stop so I'll move a little bit closer so that you can see I'm stopping I'm pushing my nail into the fretboard there yeah it'll be easier if you really put pressure into that fretboard it can take it that's our G to C C to E try to build a control where you could stop on this string I'm stopping on this string right so some people they're like they flick off and then they can't control where their finger lands if you don't have that control yet go slower press into the fretboard okay also sometimes people put too much pressure and they happen to skip past that that second string try to build a control where you're put the power into just that string and you're able to stop it's all fine motor control so that's also all muscle memories so it's just a matter of practice so let's go from the top make sure you're stopping on each string now we move a little bit faster that's how you get your nice clear strum so yeah it's keeping this this thumb and index position you don't necessarily need the thumb but if it's just hanging out not doing anything it might as well support your index finger okay now let's try the island strum right if we're on C we're gonna go down you want those downs to sound nice and and sweeping like a harp now let's go over up strum okay so it because you want the up to be just as clear as the down so if you have the same finger position and you go from the bottom string you want to get that same amount of grip as you come back up right so pluck up alright now you're going to pluck up and stop on the next string right if you don't if you lose the grip of it then you don't have control of the strum so you want to make sure you have grip on each string and you are using the fleshy tip of your index so when people say do you need nails to strum and ukulele you don't need nails at all because you're using the middle of the nail as you go down and you are using the fleshy tip of the finger as you come up okay so our island strum again see right the down and up are nice and clear okay so take your time and practice slowly see if that helps you get a little bit of a clearer strum and let me know if any interesting issues crop up and I will try to tackle those in the next video okay happy practicing see you guys 1 2 3 when this guy",

and i saw that a few of you asked for the tutorial so i thought why not to start my tutorial videos with this song all right so let me start off there are five chords in this they are i'm mentioning them here so they are c major f major g major a minor and d minor which is five chords i'll quickly show you how do we play these cards and then i'll move to the strumming pattern and then i'll play a bit of the song and that's it it's as simple as that the first card is c major how do we play that is place your third finger on the third fret first string as simple as that third finger she i'm sorry third exactly third finger was the right thing to say third finger on the third fret first string that is c major next is f major five major use your first two fingers place your first finger on the second string first fret and second finger on the second finger on the fourth string second fret as simple as that and play that is your f major c major f major the next one is g major g major again i mean g major involves your three fingers and the first three strings first finger goes on the first string second fret the second finger goes on second string third fret and the third finger goes on i mean this the first thing it's almost like a triangle here here you just make a triangle with the first three fingers how you place the fingers left to your comfort just play make a triangle here with the three fingers as simple as this involves the second and third fret this is your g major fine a next two chords are a minor and d minor how do we play a minor is very simple place your first finger on the fourth string second fret that is a minor very very simple chord i love it because so simple to play the last card involved in this song is d minor again for d minor we use three fingers and the and the second third and fourth string i place my first finger on the second string first fret the next two fingers on the second fret itself was but the last two strings it's like next to each other this is d minor we're done with all the chords we'll revise them once c major f major g major a minor d minor so for this song it's just these five chords since we're done with the chords we'll move to strumming patterns so here i have used three strumming patterns actually it's more simple to learn here because the third strumming pattern here is a uh is almost like a combination of the first and second so we just need to learn how to play the first and second strumming pattern the first drawing pattern with which i start the intro of the song is down up down up down up down it might look a little complicated but it is not let me mute the strings and show you slowly down up down and up down up down sorry that would be down down up down up down up simple as that down down up down up down up and play it with the chords and show you so so for the initial part it is c f c and g right so [Music] that is your first strumming pattern the second one is very very very simple so this is just for the intro part for the the second starting pattern is when the song starts for the line [Music] in [Music] down down but it's up is very or do i say very very soft so if you can also just split down down down or that small up also you can mention so i mean we'll just keep it as down down down will not make it complicated so the strumming pattern will be down down down down down down down down as simple as that so i'll sing those lines and show you [Music] very very simple the first one was what down turn up down up down up second one is down down down both the strumming patterns and patterns are done this is for the intro and this is for the starting part of the song the third strumming pattern comes into picture in the main lines of the song that is uh comes for that part as i told you it's just both these strumming patterns are played simultaneously so if i consider the first strumming pattern as strumming pattern one and the second one to be strumming pattern two the third styling pattern will be nothing but two followed by one as simple as it as simple as what i'm saying so the third strumming pattern is two followed strumming pattern two followed by strumming pattern one so what was strumming pattern two down down down what was one down turn up down up down up so what is three down down down down turn up down up down up as simple as just just play two and one back to back so i'll just play it with the song and show you [Music] foreign simple as that so we are done that's all the song i mean that's all is involved in this cover so it has five cards and three strumming patterns and it's ready so i'll just play the starting part so that it would be like a conclusion to this tutorial video [Music] a [Music] so i really hope that this video has helped all those who ask for the tutorial uh please give me your feedback since i told you that this is my first tutorial video so there might be a few things that i can change in the way i've explained or either i've gone too fast or slow or anything with that sort please give me your feedback in the comments and it's really valuable that's that's how i can know how i can improve with the other tutorial videos that are going to come up please let me know if you want me to make more tutorials for any other covers that i've made also please give me your requests for any other songs that you want me to cover and yeah that's about it bye", "wEyhgfQEbUI": "what if everybody said today we're going to be learning Zelda's Lullaby on the ukulele so let's get started so first you're going to hit the first string on the second fret and you're going to play strings and then you're going up to the first string on the fifth fret and then you're going to play all the strings with your fourth fret on the second I mean your fourth string on the second fret okay so the first three notes will go okay and then from there we have second string on the third fret and then open on the first string and then play all the strings and for a string second fret so okay so then all together it'll be [Music] okay now from here you're going to jump up to five again and then back to the two on the fourth you strum all of them and then jump to the opposite side of the ukelele and you're going to play two on the first string all of them all the strings and then up to the five then up to the 12 and then you're going to buy the tenth fret on the first second and third string and play those other strings okay the tenth fret on the first second and third string is all your it is that and then you're going to jump down to the fifth fret and play all the games fifth fret on the first string of his and then jump down to three to open okay so let's try that all together okay and then the last part is going to be third fret on the first string mister almost all of them all the strings and then staying on the first string you're going to go down to very do and open on the second and then fret first string again here and then you're just going to repeat and on the last time you play it instead of this no result for the very last note you're going to jump up to the fifth fret on the first string okay so all together without the repeats it's going to sound like this [Music] okay and that is it everybody now you know how to play Zelda's Lullaby on these alele and that's awesome so if you like to see if it helped you at all please give it a thumbs up and subscribe for more videos like this fun and make new ukulele tutorials every Sunday and I hope you guys have a great week bye", "jKwr0iNbb_E": "it's been hey everyone welcome back to the 20 hour ukulele challenge and today I'm gonna teach you see you again bye charlie puth so this is a song that starts with the three main chords I really like to start with on ukulele it starts with a minor F and C I'll show you how to play those real quick and then I'll kind of show you how to Heather rhythmic feel of the song ghost will break it up into parts so we start with in the middle finger on our left hand where our fretting hand if you're switching on the second fret of your fourth string so we're counting up from the bottom one two three four second fret we've got a nice arch under our finger so we can hear all four strings really clearly so make sure you got that then we're gonna add keep this finger down and add the index finger to the first fret of the second string don't you get that see what I'm doing here so make sure you've got that guy and make sure you can switch between a minor and F shake it out when you're ready the last chord is C we're gonna use our ring finger on the third fret or a first string so those the chords we use and one thing I'm really going to stress is try to keep your other all your fingers right over the frets where they're gonna play C when you're really experienced you'll be able to keep them about a centimeter away you might not get that right away that's okay to start working towards that so what we want to do is not have to work very hard to move between these chords so you see I'm gonna go right from a minor to C and just kind of switch the fingers and I have to do is left up the ring and put these two down they're already pretty much right there I'll switch back to C see it's really easy to change that way I call this making a shadow of a chord so I'm gonna leave my fingers in the shadow of the other chords that I'm playing so that we can move easily so there are the the the progression of the song basically has four different changes and where you just go a minor you go to see and then you go to F then you go to C and you can really play just the whole song with just those four chords I'll show you what I mean it's been a long day without you my friend and I'll tell you all about it when I see you again we've come a long way where we begin when I see you see that's really all there is the entire song it just loops that chord progression again and again so take a second make sure you can do this four chords in order and hear all four chords clear they'll let you I'll let you pause the video and work that out and come back when you're ready all right awesome so now that you're able to kind of switch between those comfortably what we're gonna do is we're gonna do the counting in this song we're going to feel a rhythm called three three two which is a really important rhythm it shows up in tons of styles of music so it's we're gonna start to learn how to feel that what you do is you count to three and then you count to three again and then count to two and that's kind of your rhythmic pattern it kind of feels like this you go one two one two three one two one two three one two three count with me 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 so that's the kind of the underlying idea even though you don't hear it stated and everything it's definitely it's the feel that's underneath everything so what happens is the first two times we say that the number one when we start those groups of three that's when we change chords so on the a minor we play one two three one two three one two so when we say the group of two we don't change we will be change on the three on the two groups of three so again will be like one two three one two three then one two three [Music] - so you see on the two groups of three from all four of the courts that's when we move so I'm gonna do that really really slowly a couple times and you're gonna try to play along try to count with out loud because that really helps your brain wake up the part that's counting and stay with me so let's try it all together and then I'm gonna show you just a little variation he uses with the two sometimes so here we go one two three one two three here we go so again you can practice that as many times as you need to you can use the YouTube app to slow it down or speed it up if you need to and I'll wait until you're ready and then I'll show you the the variations okay awesome sick party here we go so sometimes on the - he'll throw a G chord in there if you haven't done a G chord yet an easy variation you can do is just with two fingers as you can kind of do just the second fret and the 3rd fret of these kind of middle strings like this but generally what I'm gonna have people do is try to get three fingers in there and try to get the index finger on the second fret of the first string the ring finger on the third fret of the second string and middle finger on the second fret of the third time look at my hand really carefully try to find that so notice I'm kind of like I'm kind of twisting my arm a little bit this way what that does is that makes it easy for me to kind of fit all my fingers into a little pocket I'm kind of curving this a nice high curve on all of them they're all very rounded and let my wrist be pretty straight and they roll forward out of the tips of the fingers and just this little turn lets everything get really close to the frets because that should work really nicely [Music] so that's your G chord and every now and then he'll throw that g chord on that - I'm that sort of empty - there's a couple places where he does it in different parts of the song generally speaking it'll look kind of like this to see how he throws on the second group of three threw two throws the G one two three one two it's kind of a turnaround kind of it's a way of like adding a little bit of extra energy before you go back to the beginning of this cycle so let's try that a little bit slowly and then I'll sing the whole course and then you can you can play it with me so here we go with the variation one two three one two three [Music] one two two three one two three one two yeah so that's your variation and so one other little thing he does is when you play the chorus of the song sometimes he repeats the FC at the end when he goes mana when I see you again call it a tag where we take a little part at the end and we just kind of tag it on again so when he finishes the course he kind of tags that FC to finish it up so I'll do that here I'm gonna play it at speed again you can slow it down with the YouTube app if you want to play along and need more time to practice or you can play the speed with me it's totally up to you but here you'll see when I see you [Music] yeah great hope you dug that hope you take the 20 hour ukulele challenge it's a great way to get better at the instrument and yeah hope to see you in another lesson soon catch you later bye bye", "YesOZWQCn6U": "hey what's up guys welcome to another video today's song is boys at love and it's on the cloud so let's get started this song is the easy song to learn I'm gonna teach you guys our chords and then to strum patterns that you guys can use for the song so the first one is a G to a B minor 7 [Music] didn't a sharpener so these are the chords we're going to be using for the entire song all right so the beginning of the song you're gonna hear the bass line which sounds like this so it's gonna be to dance chums for each chord so let's try it out and in this next room pattern you can use it for like the verse or right after the chorus so it goes like this that shown pattern is gonna be down up down up and on that second down up you're gonna hold the down just a little longer than the first down okay so we're gonna start off on the G and I won't try to play it all the way [Music] so that's basically the chords champagne that yes and use I also forgot to mention the tap in the to me the string

sheets at patreon.com that will make this much easier okay so the chords were going to start out with playing is C the third fret of the a string a minor the second fret of the g string and E minor which is the second fret of the a string the third fret of this east ring and the fourth fret of the C string like that first middle ring finger the strum pattern you're going to use is down up scratch up up scratch up so it's going to sound something like this [Music] and repeat so you're gonna play the strum pattern twice on the C twice on the a minor and four times on the E minor that will repeat itself through the entire song so if you're playing with saw one of your friends your friend doesn't know the fingerstyle version of this song you can teach them this basic strumming pattern and these three simple chords and then you can play along on top of that and really impress your friends okay so this song is broken down into three different sections I'm gonna play them and then I'm going to describe them to you the first is the intro so it sounds something like this [Music] easy right and you're just gonna repeat that a number of different times throughout the song so I start with the middle finger on the 3rd fret of the a-string pinky for the fifth and then I like to just step down right from 3 to 2 with that middle finger I bring my thumb over to catch the 2nd fret of the g string so I can play an a minor there and then I play with a hammer on my first finger open and then you play it you pluck it again then I play the 3rd fret of the E string with my middle and I released that and I at the same time putting my ring finger on the 4th fret of the g string and playing both the open E and 4th fret C which are the same note they're both an e note and that's the intro so nice right and then rain keeps falling I call that the first verse you're going to start I'm gonna play it for you [Music] you're gonna repeat that twice so I play with my middle finger on the third fret of the e-string and I play three open open and don't play the a string on this note play pluck the third fret again and I put my first finger down on the second fret of the a string here I smash my first finger on the second fret of the a and E and I bring my ring finger over to play the fourth fret of the g string [Music] then I left off my first finger so I can play the open E and the fourth fret of the C ok the second verse just follows that portion and to play it it goes something like this [Music] so you think about it going into it you're here with your ring finger on the fourth string and that's why and you just take your first finger and tuck it under the third fret and you're gonna just play that the third fret of the a and the C string slide the first finger down to the second fret and I bring my thumb over middle finger plays the third fret of the E string and then I just played this simple a minor with my first middle and ring and I can strum down on that and then just catch it up with my first finger and that's the second verse so the whole song is consists of those three sections the intro verse one and verse two that I call it go grab the tab sheet it lists it out right there for you hope you guys enjoy this one this one's short it's nice and easy straightforward and it's awesome it's an amazing song a great place to start okay guys we

gonna be all right so enough of my excitement about my new filming room in this video I'm gonna be talking about whether I personally think that waxing is worth it and more specifically down there it's a bit of an awkward and personal topic but whatever I'm just gonna jump straight in and give you guys the information that I know and my experiences with waxing versus shaving okay so I have a really sensitive skin when I shave my skin it doesn't like it it irritates it it's like off leave me alone what the hell are you doing with that me my body like no so I shave under my arms and in winter I shaved my legs just because it doesn't need to be shaved all the time you know a girl's got to keep warm with all that hair whatever um in summer I do like to wax my legs just because a lease of that little bit longer and I don't get those itchy red bumps and rashes from shaving I don't know it just doesn't agree with me under my arms I will just always shave I'm absolutely petrified of having that wax I don't know why down there in the nether regions I shaved for a very very long time it was my skin was irritated it was red it was like what she not blotchy but like bumpy my hair is very thick it's very very dark I have like black hey not on my head that's just like a brown my eyebrow is a quite dark but not black everywhere else black thick not nice about maybe three months ago I started going to get Brazilians and that was the best decision I've ever made I love it yeah it was scary I think the scariest part was actually just stripping down in front of someone and like open your legs sit like this like that it's like she's looking but I went back I did it again and again and again because it's amazing yeah it did hurt it hurt a little bit but not as much as I thought it would and I'm telling me it was so soft and this may be a bit awkward but when it grew back it it was like patchy I guess half the hairs didn't grow back like ever like that but that is gone and I don't know if that's just me or if that's just what happens like I know when you wax apparently has Athena I'm not actually sure if that's truth or a myth but I think when you shave you're literally just cutting the top off so when it grows back up it's prickly but when you wax you actually ripping like it out of the skin so when I go is back it's so soft I was like where is this being my whole life why haven't I done this I had to have quite sensitive skin which I mentioned earlier and I thought that waxing would irritate it but you didn't really it was about one day when it was still red and a little tender because obviously all my  hairs it getting ripped out of my body I think if you have thick dark hair I would definitely recommend waxing um I know that when I shave it you can like still see the hairs under the skin because my hair is so dark like it's look like I had hair but really there was no hair above skin like coming out and it always frustrated me so I don't know like it looked like my leg was still area like you shave then look hairy still wasn't her point I think you should give it a go no matter what kind of hair you have I think you should just give it a go it's easy it's not painless but it's not excruciating um and the more you get it done the less it hurts like first time I got it on I was like oh my god second time it it didn't really hurt much it is a bit embarrassing like stripping down from someone but how many vaginas have they seen a hell of a lot yours is no different I've seen a million vaginas and that's what I was trying to like get through my head when I was going in there seen it before they've seen everything yeah I think you should give it a go um you know if you're happy shaving that's fine go ahead and shave if you want to try something new try some waxing if you don't want the pain and maybe if you get like me that you're hated scheming shaving um maybe just try some hair removal cream that didn't really work for me like well like I just thought it was a waste of time shaving was just so much easier but there's all sorts of options so that's pretty much what I wanted to talk - you guys about explore your options definitely try waxing yeah because it's not as bad as people make it out to be unless I'm just like a freakin superhero or something I don't know yeah so I hope you find this video a little helpful um definitely give it a go you might regret it you might not I don't know but what else oh so that's how I'm going to leave it I hope you guys have an awesome day don't be scared to get a wax I would love it if you could like this video and subscribe to my channel and it would help me out a lot alright guys see", "FwouqrJPIQs": "what up everybody today I'm going to be learning giant woman by

tutorial video of synthesis a girl from attack on Titan and we are going to use nine chords in the song the G C sharp C minor D sharp and the last chord G sharp that's it this song consists of intro verse pre-chorus and chorus part we are going to start from first one and then after that pre-chorus and then after that chorus and the last part is going to be intro because the intro is really difficult even me so we are going to start from verse 1 in the first part we are going to use F sharp minor D G C sharp and then a minor D minor a sharp e the strumming pattern of this song is going to be down don't look down all the time until the end from the start to the end so let's play along with this course with our F sharp minor D G C sharp E minor F in Oh No a minor E minor a job e ok and down down down start from F sharp minor and it's going to be like this [Music] [Music] in this part the code is going to be it's not gonna be a and again F sharp minor D from until [Music] [Music] which I know he does naca oh the heat ominous aura to your meta the order of the coal it's going to be a minor F G C and then after a minor SG e you know cold it won't be F G C a minor D yeah and it's gonna be like this [Music] okay let's box this together I'll go more floor than this [Music] let's sing along with these course all for the sake of you know the song when you sing you spot the chord you need or F G C F G C it's like this [Music] [Music] quality nominee FG c SG e [Music] [Music] [Music] we know you sold an Akita here ok ok this part it's the core it's going to be C - C sharp G sharp d sharp and then right after that C - D sharp G sharp C my example [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] let's eat ro intro is going to be like this how can I play the intro part I tried many ways but I think this is the best way to do the intro part yeah and but this is not easy as you can see I practiced a lot like so many times like more than 100 or even maybe 1000 but even now I cannot play better so you just need to practice Oh every day every day this yes in the first place you need to place your index finger on the 5th fret and then place your ring finger on 7th fret in here in here any place will ring na na pinky finger on 8th fret which is the next to the ring finger here and this is the basic form of your health in the intro so the first step you need to put your index finger on 3rd strings on the 5th fret and pluck your 3rd strings only one third strings right after you plug your plug the third strings on the 5th fret you need to place your ring finger on 4th strings on the 7th fret in here here here and then plug the fourth strings so at this point you're placing your fingers on fifth fret on the 3rd strings with your index finger and four strings on the seventh fret with your ring finger like this and you need to plug the strings on 3rd and both strings like this and right after you plug the 4th strings you need to play so pinky finger on the next fret which is eighth fret which is next to the ring finger on the fourth fret fourth string like here here here yes so right now you are placing your 3 fingers on 5th fret 7th fret 8th fret like this and all you need to plug it's just 3rd and 4th fret here so it's gonna be like this and after you pluck the 4th string on the eighth fret you need to move your index finger under the third string in here from the top yeah let's play again yes ok and then the last melody place your finger place your ring finger again and the 4th string 7th fret in here yeah from the top [Music] so let's play this fingerstyle repeat it be until I say stop 1 2 3 4 the right after you have finished your finger style you need to move your hand in here and from your hand on a minor you need to put your pinky finger on 4th fret 2nd strings in here here just put here and strum again when you place a pinky finger on 2nd strings 4 thread you can skip stay your middle finger on the 2nd fret 1st string so you don't need to move this finger just put the pinky finger on both strings no no 2nd strings [Music] after you place your pinky finger on the second string or thread you need to form your hand into F chord you need to form your hand into it's really difficult part but you have to practice again and again over and over again I practice a lot but even though it's not perfect so I need to practice again

chords that we need to\u00a0\nknow to play the song feel free to skip ahead if\u00a0you\nalready know the fingering position to play Cmaj7 take our middle finger and place it on\u00a0the second fret first string next we go Dsus4 so index finger on\nthe second fret third string\u00a0\u00a0 ring finger on the third fret second string next\u00a0is Bm7 so we need to use our index\u00a0finger\nclose everything on the second fret like\u00a0this yeah we can actually do it like this just put\u00a0\u00a0 all of our fingers here on the second fret but the\u00a0\noriginal song is actually at capo fret one right so we need to put a capo here if\u00a0\nwe want to play like the original and to make Bm7 in that kind of shape it's\u00a0\nkinda hard it's really awkward you see my tiny finger can't even reach here because of the\u00a0\ncapo here so it's better that we just play Bm7 using our index finger like this\u00a0and if\nwe're not strong enough we can just put our\u00a0 middle finger on top of our index finger like this\u00a0\nyeah I'm not sure if it's allowed but I always do it so\nit helps so like I said just now if we want\u00a0\nto play like the original song we have to put a capo and place it on fret one right but in this\u00a0\ntutorial i'm not going to use capo okay\u00a0 the chord progression in this song is Cmaj7 Dsus4 Bm7 and then back to Cmaj7 so make sure that we can do the chord transition\u00a0smoothly okay now in the intro we're going to\u00a0do some plucking but if we don't want to pluck we\u00a0can actually play it like this one two three four over and over until the end of the\u00a0song yeah so that's the simple version okay but in\u00a0\u00a0 this tutorial I'm going to teach you how to pluck\u00a0\nso we need to pluck in the intro until Jungkook's part okay I'm gonna show you how so our left\u00a0\nfingers will be playing the chords right the first\u00a0\u00a0 chord is Cmaj7 let's play it Cmaj7 okay\nnow for our right fingers we need to put our\u00a0\u00a0 ring finger on the first string middle finger on\u00a0\nthe second string pluck them together okay after\u00a0\u00a0 we pluck these two strings together\nuse our index\u00a0finger pluck the third string so it goes like this okay we need to do it twice so change chord change chord and then strum once okay\none\u00a0more time okay let's do it quicker this time okay now let's start playing from\u00a0\nthe intro until Jungkook's part okay where is my angel\nharuui kkeuteul deuriun someone come and save me please\njichin haruui hansumppun saramdeureun da haengbokanga bwa can

waxes podcast you go waxes podcast go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go yeah yeah yes what's up y'all this is wax come to you live not really live as I used to say in the first couple podcast it's not really live it's being recorded right now so as I speak it's kind of live because I'm just saying whatever the [ __ ] comes off the top of my dome here and the reason that I started the podcast off with such a such a burst of cheerleader cheerleader type of rhetoric there was one task I'm doing right now this is gonna [ __ ] something up by me telling you this it's gonna [ __ ] up the secrecy of this task but let me start by explaining to you that a music video I did last year called feels good if you were to watch that music video feels good wax featuring eat featuring Anderson PAC produced by eom if you were to watch that video on YouTube the music video for that song there's many times in that video not many times but some times where I used some footage from like like family home movie footage from my family from back in the day and in order to make that happen my mother was nice enough my mom was one of the nice person you know people she's one of the nicest people you'll ever meet and she loves to uh to help me she loves doing things to help me and one of the things she did to help me was she packed up all these old tapes I believe there are eight millimeter tapes yeah they're either 8 millimeter or 9 millimeter one of the two but their tapes from an old school type of video camera they're like they're not VHS tapes are smaller they're like the same size as old cassette tapes but in in in height and in length and height but not in width they're wider than that they're the same size as they're the same size as like a box of playing cards but but if the playing cards had like maybe 150 percent of the actual amount of cards so you know if if there was 78 cards in every deck then a box of playing cards would be approximately the same size as one of these old 8 millimeter tapes let's put it that way hold on and uh we had a bunch of those it was cool - it was cool she said she sent me a box of them and in order for me to get the footage from from these tapes into some kind of onto some kind of digital format you know I did research out here in Hollywood there's there's tons of places out here we you know we're not tons but a lot of places out here because this is kind of like the movie industry you never know what kind of footage people are digging up where you can just find random film reels old beta tapes VHS tapes whatever you name it and there's places that digitize the footage that's like a business out here and uh I looked into how much it would be to digitize all this footage to make my music video and I realized that it's really expensive to do if you get something to do it especially considering I have a I had like a pretty big box full of tapes and you know you do the math for a music video especially for that music video what I needed I probably only needed you know 30 seconds if that worth of footage but the task was going through these hours and hours and hours of footage and deciding which footage finding like the needles in the haystack to use for the video cuz you know a lot of the a lot of the stuff that's on these videos is not actually usable for a music video like it was supposed to be like you know clips of me as a kid kind of starting to be into music and kind of like starting to do things that actually have to do with my musical career whereas a vast vast majority of the home footage that we have doesn't have anything to do with that but um everything that I've said so far has just been explained to you that I have this box of tapes and after and after figuring out that it was too expensive I mean I'm still sidetracking really just let me stop even mention the fact that I'm side track and let me just keep talking about this story I have this box of tapes and in order to get them from get the footage off the tape and get them into some kind of digital format I found out through research they're probably the best thing for me to do would just be to kind of do it myself and go through the footage here and the best way to do that was to find something that played the tapes and find something to record them onto a digital format and the most realistic way to do it was to find a camera an old-school camera and a DVD burner both technologies that at one point were awesome and new and only the richest people in the land can even afford to think about these [ __ ] items much less own them and now what did I do I bought both of them at the same time for like a hundred bucks from some weirdo in Craig Craigslist so that goes to show you how I got that dude was really a weirdo to eom was with me he was such a weirdo on the phone that I was like you know what I'm not gonna even go down to this dude's house by myself he lived in some town like it wasn't a rough town but just it was like a town I'd never heard of you know somewhere in the South Bay area of LA and the dude on the phone just like wouldn't stop [ __ ] talking so I was like man I'm gonna bring my friend a friend with me just in case this dude tries to rape me or something so uh so so I brought him with me as my rape protector and I I didn't up buying this DVD burner and and you know and that that the camera that has it's the original kind of camera that you know you record thing on these tapes because you can't really get like a VCR that plays the tapes the people the things that people would play the tape on was just the camera so if you just hook the camera right up to your TV so in order to get the footage for the music video I watched all the footage and when I found little clips that I liked I'd record them onto a DVD and take that DVD and use that to get the footage onto a computer so my mom had asked me you know right around Christmastime maybe something like that you know it's almost so it's like summer now it's just becoming summer and around Christmastime or something great rate when I was on I think I was on tour or something I don't even know what what happened but my mom was like you know what you could do for me is you could you could give me that footage in a digital manner basically and she went basically she wanted to see if she could get DVDs of all the footage that she gave me and that's what I'm going through now what I'm one of the tasks that I'm doing right now since my mom listens to this podcast usually it's now not a surprise because I'm going back there I'm going I'm going to visit with my mom and dad next week and I was gonna surprise them but I know my mom would be surprised because I usually don't actually do things that are nice and caring and loving for them you know they would assume that I would just forget to do it but I'm gonna come down there with a stack of DVDs I mean there's like there's probably twenty five of these tapes and you can't it's not like you know nowadays where people just kind of hit a button in things record you got to sit through it and uh and just let it record in real time hold on one second so we're probably talking about somewhere in the area of 50 hours worth of footage something like that probably that I'm gonna end up giving to them and if you the amount first of all the amount of footage on this that's not entertaining to watch is ridiculous my dad was probably the worst family camera man of all time and it was only a close second to if he well he was a close second he was actually a distant second to if he ever gave my mom the camera cuz she was even worse and then if he gave it to me and my brother and my sister we'd all be bad so our family vacation footage wasn't the best like we had a family vacation we're from Maryland and one time I guess I was probably about 10 or 11 and we drove to Cooperstown New York and the reason we drove to Cooperstown New York is for those of you that don't know Cooperstown New York is the home of the Baseball Hall of Fame so you know we're gonna go we'll go look at the Baseball Hall of Fame I had baseball cards I was into baseball we went to games I liked I had the stats all that stuff I was never a good player of baseball but you know I guess when I was 10 or 11 definitely good enough to want to go and and take a family vacation to see the Hall of Fame of baseball so we went up there and first of all there's at least an hours where the footage of us where my I think we just we must have just gotten this video camera at the time cuz my dad just holds the video camera out the window of the car when we're on the highway and he just does that for like an hour like as if it's like oh look here's the side of the house here's the side of the highway you know everyone so why he like looks in the car and like points the camera to like I sleeping in the back and they might say what's up to my mom driving and then just points it right back out the window and he never hit stop he just records for like an hour then we get up to Cooperstown and when we go into the Hall of Fame my dad actually like brings the camera in there and like you know there's parts of there's parts of the Hall of Fame where if you can picture it picture like a plaque like when you go into a museum and there's a plaque with some somebody a legendary face you know what I mean like that might not even be a real photo it might just be like an engraving it looks almost like an award like a trophy like a merit plaque like you know as if you got a Lifetime Achievement Award for baseball and they'll have your face like engraved in some kind of gold and then they'll have your story which is like a short paragraph that's it's on a placard underneath the picture of you which is all on some piece of wood that just looks like one big plaque so if you were to look at it and say like Ty Cobb Ty Cobb played for the blah blah blah in 1907 I think he played for the Detroit Tigers in 1907 he was one of the leading players at that time with a batting average of blah blah blah and blah blah blah he died in 1946 of colon cancer like that's about how long it would be you know I don't know if he died of colon cancer I have no idea how I Cobb died but I think he was the one that had the really valuable playing card but but anyway my dad won't my dad would do is if you saw a placard like that which there was a lot of them he would hold the family home video camera on that and like give it enough time so you could read the whole thing and then he'd slowly move the video camera onto another one and then he'd leave it on there give you enough time so you can read the whole thing as if as if sometime in the distant future you know the people from the Cooperstown museum we're gonna be like you know what let's see let's use the Jones family footage for for our promotional DVD that we're gonna put out in case anybody wants to just see this you know for the virtual reality tour the virtual tour of our our establishment here let's use the Jones family footage or if it or if any of our relatives when when my dad shows in the footage on on the day after Christmas or whatever whenever work together as a family and my dad shows the family home movies like that's what they want to see they won't actually see and read every single player in the Hall of Fame I don't know you know maybe I'm being hard on my dad's footage but it was kind of funny to me looking at it and that's that that's only there but it but you know if you watch it you'll see like it's it's really weird to watch that own footage like it's freaky you know it's you know you see people that aren't alive anymore in the footage but even more so than that it's just to me it's just weird to see these these recorded days from from a long time ago that it just looks like it's it's like at this that these things happen but it almost it's hard to give them it's hard to tell you - it's like an emotional thing when you watch it it's just like it's almost like you're watching ghosts or something and I'm not just talking about because some people aren't alive anymore I'm talking about just just in general you know even watching yourself as a kid or watching your parents or just it's just weird seeing these old these old times that now seems so far away that you almost don't remember them and there's like the little things are weird I could like you know the footage one of my dad's shooting in the car and you hear the radio guy you know and like even that sounds older and like cars look a little older and people's clothing looks a little older so it's kind of freaky to watch but I said all of that to tell you that I was the last thing that I was digitizing this was actually probably the worst thing that he shot was um me and my brother I guess when we were in middle school were on the school soccer team and uh you know we we were playing a game and my dad sat on the sidelines and one in in one area and film the entire middle school soccer game and maybe that doesn't even sound as bad as it is but it's it's you know it's very far from watching the [ __ ] world couple in television let's put it that way it's very much less exciting than that especially considering every few minutes whoever's taping and I think was at my dad and my sister we're kind of trading every five minutes somebody kind of gives up for a couple seconds then just like they switch hands and it gets shaky and then I even really on the ball following the ball and you know it's a solid hour and a half maybe maybe maybe an hour of just an entire soccer game but I you know now my parents are gonna have that digitized I actually fat i actually straight fast forwarded some of it because I was like there's no way they're gonna watch this but what I did watch a tiny bit of I mean I watched a lot of the game actually I started I started watching after a while when uh the the angles were right but I couldn't even tell like you know it's old school footage so I couldn't even tell what the [ __ ] I was on the field but the the most interesting part in the part that kind of made me laugh was the cheerleaders first of all it's funny in general that a middle school soccer team has has full-blown cheerleaders that do cheers and at halftime they they go out and do straight-up cheers but uh what made me laugh about it is if you're from Maryland especially either Baltimore or maybe southern really anywhere in [ __ ] Maryland or really even if you're from the Philadelphia area cuz they have the same [ __ ] going on with their O's have you ever seen Bam Margera talk he's a good example but um you know people from Maryland I've lost it a little bit but if you you meet someone that's really born and raised in Southern Maryland or really born and raised in a suburb of Philadelphia or Baltimore when they say things they say him and give I'm gonna go down the road go him and I talk like that a lot more when I was a kid and I mean when I see myself as a kid on the tape I'm actually shocked about how much of a Maryland accent I had but it was just so [ __ ] funny these little there's like 15 middle school girls and they're doing a cheer and they just [ __ ] like goo goo go go go doot doot yeah like if you can hear they're all their accents at the same time and two sounded funniest [ __ ] to me so that's why I started off my podcast episode 61 with a little bit of a throwback go northern that's the middle school I went to go [ __ ] it northern go northern game northern game northern bobcats you care northern share that share the hit share the road team that the home team is boss but uh yeah so that's what's going on with my life one thing that's going on with that there's a million things that are actually going on with it one thing that's going on with it is that I'm digitizing those tapes for my mom I got a lot of it done and by the time I get home I will I will have a lot more and I hopefully will have all them digitized for you so mom if you're listening I'm not slacking at least too hard on that the very least even if I gave you the footage already had you'd have a solid amount and not saying it's entertaining you know you're not gonna win any Oscars anytime soon for Best Best Screenplay about a trip to Cooperstown New York you're not gonna be winning the Oscar soon but um what else is going on doing that big stories in my life big stories I am making music I know a lot a lot of people been hitting me up and I [ __ ] deserve it cuz you know I'm that's what I do for a living I make music and I'm lucky enough that I fans and I'm lucky enough that I have people that listen to my music and buy my music and buy tickets to see me perform so I don't have to have a regular job look at me I'm over here I don't have to work I go in this establishments and I say hello I can I can use can you help me can you [ __ ] help me they say can I help you I'm getting paid to be here to [ __ ] help you I don't want to be here I don't I want to be with my family I want to be with my family right now I don't want to be serving you I went to the dentist this morning I walk in then there somebody can I help you I'm the receptionist here at the dentist office I don't necessarily want to be here but I have to make a living for my family to be able to survive can i [ __ ] help you you entitled piece of [ __ ] that sits around all day and thinks of words that rhyme like a expert crossword puzzle player you [ __ ] she didn't actually say that but my point is I I'm not entitled to what I'm to what I have I'm not entitled to be able to live this life that I live I gotta [ __ ] do things I got to work I got to make songs if I'm gonna if I'm gonna be a musician I got to make music and what I've been doing recently is making a [ __ ] lot of it so for all the people out there have been hitting me up like yo I want some new [ __ ] coming out what are you doing why aren't you making any new [ __ ] I got some new [ __ ] coming I don't know when it's gonna come out I don't know exactly how I'm gonna how I'm gonna do this I'm more I guess I guess I guess I'm just I'm working on an album I guess that's probably the best way to put it I'm working on some kind of album and I got a bunch of [ __ ] I'm working on it's sounding good and feeling super inspired and hopefully that I don't I don't know when it's gonna come out because I I'm afraid about to go on tour for the summer so putting a little bit of a wrench into that plan but hopefully the tour since the tour is kind of a luxury tour more the more a more luxury luxurious tour than I'm used to maybe I can use some of the free time to really write a lot of music and when I say that it's a luxurious tour I don't mean that the Warped Tour is a luxurious tour I mean the way that we're right the way that we're doing the tour is uh on the next level of anything I've done before and when this is what I mean I've been doing this for a long time I've toured I've toured my old band used to tour and you know we didn't we didn't [ __ ] with hotels we didn't make money we were happy to just get free beer and we would drink as much of it as we could at the venue offered us free beer they probably wouldn't even have us back the next time because we had six people in the band and one person selling merch and we would drink as much as we possibly could because we probably weren't making any money and then we pass out on some random fans floor and we didn't really even have fans so if that would even be a lucky thing so who newswoman who knew where you're gonna sleep who knew out wherever you're gonna get there we might take random people's cars some person might take a train then eventually we had of a van that I actually bought that of course ran it through I bought the band now I had it for a second while the band was together but as soon as I got our website really big on the side of the van the band broke up of course and you know we never made any money we tore we slept on people's floors then you know me and my brother we did the low budget wax novelty tour we have my Sentra we made a tiny tiny bit of money but not enough to really stay in hotels we did a couple night but it was just one of those tours where we're getting drunk too much we didn't eat properly we got sick the whole entire time usually sleep on the floors lost a bunch of money for the [ __ ] tour that's another thing about the earlier tours like you know we weren't making money touring we had to save money in order to tour you know you spent money to try to be able to get your name out and all that [ __ ] and is this [ __ ] thing working sorry about that but uh you know and then after well you know I've been doing this for a long time I've been touring for a long time making music for a long time and eventually you know in the past couple years I've got to the point where we can rent and a big van and trailer and go out I have a full band everybody in the bank and stay in a hotel if we got if we got it the first shows far away I pay for people to fly out there cetera et cetera still not making much money I mean in some cases not making much at all but you know I'm making a living through all this all this stuff and but one thing I've never done is I've never had a tour bus never been on a bus I've literally literally I don't even think I've ever been on been on a tour bus at all in my life but this Warped Tour me and the homie watski and our in our band that were that we're splitting all of all mutual friends everybody's mutual friends I mean watch he pretty much have the same band with the exception of he has a singer that joins him and I have a om that joins me but we're all going to be in a [ __ ] bus so what that means is that we all have a place to sleep we all have a bunk on the bus and overnight when the bus is driving because we have an actual driver none of us have to drive the bus you know we can be asleep and then during the day the bus will pretty much be stationary usually during the day even if even if it's not we're not like you know even when we had the van with with with the band as big as we had it there's usually three people on each bench seat of the van maybe there's two on one but usually you're sitting in the you're sitting on a seat where like you know there's dude next to he's got his laptop his [ __ ] phone chargers hanging over and in between your legs and somebody's elbow is hitting you on the other side then your feet are kind of raised because there's two backpacks underneath you you know like it's not I'm not complaining by any means but I'm just I'm only pointing out that the next level up that we're about to be on is much a much much different type of thing you know like when you can get up walk around you can go sleep in your bunk if you want you can sit on various different type of seats in the back there's like practically like a theater there's like picture like a small booth like a booth for that's a big booth for - a small booth for for in a restaurant there's like a seat or two that I think there might be two of those kind of booths so you could like sit there and put your laptop up on the computer and like you know when you hear about people being a bit like recording and getting [ __ ] done on the road it's usually because they have a bus like this it's they're not usually in a shitty year situation and uh that's also an excuse for me not really doing that too much before but uh yeah so Headley at least at least when it comes to writing what I'm hoping to do is have most of the tracks and [ __ ] ready by the time I go on tour and I can spend a lot of my off time which I'll have a lot of I'll have a lot of off time on them on the road y'all should check that out man vans if you just Google Vans Warped Tour dates you know you can find to find out if I'm playing next next to where you live if you live in the United States unfortunately I will not make the Canada shows [ __ ] sucks but I'm not gonna be able to make there's two shows in Canada one in Toronto and one in Montreal and I will not be at those shows so hopefully you guys can make it to the US shows if you live in another country hopefully I'll be there later but you know it's gonna be a fun summer and hopefully I'll get some of this work done I'll be with a om the whole time so maybe him me and him we're talking about even making just trying to like really knock out some [ __ ] while we're on the road too because there's a lot there's a lot of free time on this tour it's not like most tours like you know you got you got a lot of time where you're sitting around and it's and there's room and there's a little bit more comfort and you want to get stuff done so maybe maybe this tour I'll be able to get some [ __ ] done but I am working on music and hopefully I'll have some stuff out soon hopefully I'll have a [ __ ] barrage of stuff out soon and what else is going on in my life that write anything down write down all right then I am making music MattyB in Baltimore who emailed me wanted me to tell a story from when I was in college but I didn't think of a good one and then I have a tire flat one leg guy oh this is an interesting story that's how one more story before I get to questions and stuff so last week last week I was in Los Angeles and I was driving through Hollywood and bam my tire popped my back my back passenger side tire was flat and it was black popped flat like not like oh I can drive somewhere flat like it was like this really shouldn't be driven on so I just pulled over to the side of the road like it like you could feel like oh oh oh you notice I pulled over the side of the road and I got really really lucky there was an autozone like three blocks away from where where I was where you know where I'm where my tire blew right there on a venison LaBrea so I guess the [ __ ] I guess that yes that was Pico and really close to La Brea that the Auto Zone was at so if you've ever been to that autozone know that I was there last week and the reason I had to go to the Auto Zone you're thinking so cuz some of you guys are thinking wait a second why'd you have to go to the shouldn't you have all the X all the parts needed all the accessories / equipment needed within your vehicle to change a tire if not you should because that's the safe way to be a [ __ ] where they caught motorists there's another word for motorists that I wanted to use right there anyway I didn't for some reason this is the first time I've had a flat tire like it was the it was literally the first time that I've had to pull the little donut out from under my trunk in my Nissan Sentra the first time with this car I'm pretty sure it was at least I think the last time I had a flat tire was with my old car which was also a Nissan sensor so I could be getting them confused but the [ __ ] looked brand new it looked like it was been sitting there and it still had like the little foam over top of it and I know myself if I had removed that I probably would have [ __ ] it up or damaged it somehow so it looked like it had never been removed but for some reason and I looked everywhere I looked all over the trunk all over the car I even look even looked in the users manual to see where it should where it was supposed to be and the place where I was supposed to be it wasn't I was missing that like the wrench like the lug wrench that you used for you know a - you have to use it to [ __ ] get the tires off you know - to get the [ __ ] whatever the [ __ ] they're called I'm not real good with like cars and [ __ ] like that but to get the you know - to get the [ __ ] lug nuts off of the off of the tire so you can take the old tire off and put the spare tire on to get that off you need this wrench but even just as importantly is that to Jack your car up to get the tire off the wrench actually always doubles as a part where you [ __ ] crank the jack up to Jack your car up and for whatever reason that piece was missing from my car so luckily luckily enough I was able to go into autozone and get that piece so it wasn't it wasn't a tragedy and I walked over to autozone right there labret in Venice and I walked in I got that got the piece I needed I actually almost got the got some other dumb [ __ ] but I got I got the thing that I needed when I got to the when I got to the cash register there was a god there was I got to the cash register and then the guy behind the cash register couldn't use the cash register he was at you know picture picture you're looking at the cash register right and there's a long and some of you have been to autozone so you can picture it there's a long row there's a long like it's like it's like being at a bar you know if you look to your left it's just a long counter that goes left and right and you know if you're if if you were looking at it like there's one line he it's a one long line but when you get to the front of it just like you would at the post office you know it's like a bar but there's different stations for cashiers so when I got to when I got to the front I wasn't it wasn't there was no line at all I just walked right to the where the guy was weird where that no I walked right worth this is like such a stupid part of the story to even get stuck on I walked up to the counter there was nobody there the guy comes out and I like put my thing on the counter and he's like oh no we can't use this register so we walk over the other register and the problem with the other register was there was a [ __ ] guy leaning on the leaning on the the bar slash table slash calendar he was leaning on the counter right where that station was and this guy had one leg he had one leg and he had those kind of crutches that were like kind of like almost connected to your arm you know like they actually go up your arm and there's like kind of like a loop that you put your arms through right about the elbow and he had one [ __ ] leg table you know he was two crutches in one leg and he was leaning he was waiting for his friend to get whatever he had to get and he was leaning on the [ __ ] counter and you really he was a big dude he looked like he looked like he probably lost that leg in the war he was proud that he was probably pushing 60 big dude look like a dude that probably lost his leg in the war that could be wrong I don't know but he was he was a pretty big dude and he was definitely like making like when he was sitting on it he was making the counter creak like goes Pig let's think about like a not too strong piece of wood if you put a lot of weight on it that noise and if he was made any movement it would creak further and he was standing right there in front of the [ __ ] the thing where you swipe your credit card like really like you couldn't swipe your car because he was there and when we went to this area the guy behind the counter was like look buddy they talk like that he said look buddy you can't you cannot stand there you got to break it you're gonna break it and the guy [ __ ] look behind him look behind himself because he was facing the other way he wasn't no picture his ass is on the counter the counter you know I'm saying so the guy [ __ ] rose up he had some buttons in the cashier and he goes look look buddy you gonna break this can I sit there you gonna break this and the guy [ __ ] turns around real slowly he looked like he ever seen happy gilmore not as big as that do but remember the dude from happy gilmore that ended up with a [ __ ] nail in his head if that dude was black in fact if that dude was a black dude this dude looked like him with one leg but it's not as quite as big as intimidating as him but his face the expression of his face and the grizzled nature of his face was like the black version of the guy from happy gilmore they had a nail in his head and he turns around really slowly and he just shakes his head and he goes I got one leg man and I was just like goddamn so any that's that's that happened and then he [ __ ] rang up my little [ __ ] lug nut wrench and I didn't have any cash on me I had to swipe my [ __ ] and the guy goes go ahead go ahead like like pointed like like pointed towards the cat the credit card thing that this dude was clearly covering up and like like he put the effort it almost was like in that cent second he put the ethical dilemma onto my shoulders you know like he couldn't get the good guy to move and you know when he said he had one leg I was in my head I'm like I cannot [ __ ] argue with you there I looked down and I said he absolutely you do and in my [ __ ] opinion that kind of entitles you to take a little rest take a load off on just about any counter you want especially considering he was in there cuz he had a friend that was like in there buying some [ __ ] and he was just waiting for his friend and he had one [ __ ] leg like he'd like you said and uh and you know it was my it was my job now to to [ __ ] make this and I looked at the [ __ ] dude behind the counter and I said yo I'm not telling this guy to move I said it just like that and the dude kind of looked at me that the the one-leg dude kind of looked at me and he didn't look at me like oh that's cool that's cool man I understand I appreciate you like kind of thinking that way you know he just looked at me when hmm like that and just [ __ ] left he went he did anyway he like just got up off the counter you could almost see the counter lift up when he got up you know like as if it was like as if the counter was a [ __ ] Springs had shocks on the bottom of it when he got up you could almost see it lift up here at creak maybe you could even hear the dude the one-legged dudes body and crutches creak and at the same time and it just sounded like this it sounded like the [ __ ] if the if if the counter could say aah as if he had just you know given a [ __ ] fat girl piggyback ride if he could say that he would have if he was a person so the guy what but the guy the guy with one leg like he you know he walked out it as we walked his why he's not generally walk but you know he walked like with his crutches and his one leg out of the store and I swiped my card and then I got my I got my [ __ ] lug nut wrench walked my three blocks and then another interesting thing even even happened while I was changing my tire I was changing my tire and I was I you know I was getting I was getting the [ __ ] off I had already jacked up the car and I had already just taken the this flat tire off and I was putting the doughnut on and this other dude another black dude came walked by and this dude was kind of like he was kind of like guy now I feel like I got to make movie references for all the black dudes I mean during this tire tire experience but this dude was kind of he was kind of he was kind of like he had a lot of pep in his step you know he looked like a professional like a business business professional like that was kind of headed to workers it was like a Wednesday at noon or something so like most people it was like working hours and he had a lot of pep in his step I can't think I can't unfortunately I can't they a movie reference especially because I already killed it with the happy gilmore one but he had a lot of pep in step right and I'm there and he goes ah no donut huh like if you guys don't know most you do but like a spare tire on a car especially for your people or don't speak English as their first language just spare tire on a car and the United States is often referred to as a donut because it's like it's just a small version of a tire that you only drive for a little while well you're only supposed to drive it for a little while before you get a new tire it's really you know they call it a donut and the guy comes by and he goes donuts huh yeah he goes man I hate them [ __ ] and I had looked at I was like yeah man this thing just ruined my day and he stopped for a second and he looks at me and he kind of gets like real serious kind of like he's about to say some real [ __ ] and he goes well you know what brother you can start your day over whatever you want and I [ __ ] looked at him because I was feeling I'd like you know I didn't this this spare tire incident this flat tire incident had actually [ __ ] my day up a little bit like that's why I told him it ruined my day because you know that feeling when you get a flat tire and just like [ __ ] this I don't feel like getting out of my car and changing a tire right now especially if you're me and you're lazy by nature and like I'm not really into cars like I'm always worried I'm gonna [ __ ] something up anyway and you know this really did [ __ ] up my day I was on my way to somewhere actually and I had to cancel some [ __ ] I was doing and I told him that it ruined my dad and he looked at me and said you know our brother you can start your day over whenever you want to and I [ __ ] looked at him and I was like man thank you for saying that and he was like no problem and if I can walked away so interesting it was an interesting experience interesting enough for me to write it down and interesting enough for me to say it on waxes podcast podcast but now it was cool it was cool like because it you know he's right you can't like one you once you get moving and I had it tonight because you know then you get the doughnut on then you have to go to the tire place and then you got drop money you didn't really want to drop that day and it's the classic yeah a flat tire is the classic like thinking about some other [ __ ] because this is what was going on that day I was thinking about some other [ __ ] and thinking about you know I was already I was already a little stressed out and having some other problems and then that flat a flat tire is just one of those things man that's like the [ __ ] cherry on top you know like the thing that didn't have to go wrong the thing that you didn't foresee the thing that just comes out of left field I mean car problems in general or like that goddamn especially when you're broke if when you're broke but you know just just not broke enough to own a car and then something happens to your car and especially because a lot of times you know your car without your car especially if you're you know it's a little it's a little different in major cities but to most of us who live in suburbia and [ __ ] like that you know without your car you kind of can't get to work you know it's a big problem to not have your car if something goes wrong with it all the money you plan to paying on paying your rent you all your little budget you had going on BAM something happens to your car and it's just everything gets [ __ ] up so the car car problems are generally the cherry on top when it comes to stressing you out and there's something for about this dude saying that I could start my day over at any time because that's it that's really something that you can use for anything you know it doesn't have to be your day can be your life like your day kid you can just start over whenever you want it can be your life it can be your love life it can be your year it can be your music career it can be anything you know you can always start over it doesn't matter you can always just [ __ ] scrap what you got and start over there's no need of stress over it why cry over spilled milk and maybe even be used in that situation I suppose but uh that was some of my stories for this week let me get to some shout out some questions alright shoutouts for this week Dwight G from Toronto or known as the infamous rapper degrease that's funny I used to know I had no idea who goes by degreaser as his rap name miracle from

s CJ r Aaron the violinist sup Aaron will Oh Fernando P B Willis Nathan si speaking of Aaron the violinist who did once did a podcast jingle shout out once again to Lucas from Ohio for the acoustic jingle then I once again played the beginning this show I love that [ __ ] where am i Fernando P B Willis when IB Willis Nathan C Pierre L from Canada Thomas aka Steve T Spencer Scobie Marco from Canada TJ l John P from spot so bent Spotsylvania Virginia who loves Dale Firebird I had a little email convo with John P about Dale Firebird Dale Firebird is actually one of my least successful things that I've done on YouTube it's one of my favorite things to do and one of the least successful and often I think with artists yeah [ __ ] artists man like the [ __ ] that you really like to do isn't necessarily what people like to respond to the most and I think with Dale Firebird it's just like you know people don't not everybody knows that character you know that the whole redneck I talked about this on the podcast before but like they're like the redneck character is lost on most people not most people but a lot of people because you kind of have to grow up with people like that to really understand it like if you just see it on TV you just you just have like the wrong idea of what a redneck is you know if you're from my area you know what I would I like to use the example of is if you're from where I'm from there's a lot of rednecks and like what do they have like yeah like you know out in in Los Angeles there's a lot of Mexicans and there's a lot of cholos for example Joe this is a good comparison will be understood like if you're from where I'm from like you're the only thing you really know about cholos is what you've seen on TV and what you've like heard from [ __ ] maybe rap music and and just mostly movies and [ __ ] and uh you can't necessarily really relate to the characters because you didn't grow up with those types of people so people in LA often don't give a [ __ ] about Dale Firebird or if they or does not really understand like the humanity behind Dale Firebird if that makes sense it's not just like this stereotype there's real real people behind these rednecks you know I'm saying and and you know a lot of in a lot of ways I'm a redneck myself you know and I think a lot of us are at heart you know we like you know if you listen to country music lyrics [ __ ] there's there's a lot of things that I agree with what they say you know like this the simple things like there's that song by the Zac Brown Band where he's like for the first half of the course he's talking about just a little chicken-fried cold beer on Friday night pair of jeans fit just right yeah my radio when the second verse he goes into some [ __ ] about like like mothers chop the love of a precious child he's talking about how just like the good the good things in life are the simple things like drinking beer tea and chicken and the love he has for his kids and [ __ ] and you know I for one I can I can appreciate those things you know if I now if I go to a bar in areas around my hometown and you happen to run into one of those guys and he might say some of that stuff you can appreciate it but then if he follows that up by calling barack obama the n-word you know you might not be able to appreciate that so much so just because somebody thinks one thing that you agree with they might think something else that you heavily disagree with i remember an experience i had where I was in a bar and people were [ __ ] saying some crazy racist [ __ ] about Barack Obama and I was I couldn't even [ __ ] believe it but uh yeah that's a redneck for you yeah I'm not saying I agree with everything that everybody says and I'm not saying that all rednecks a racist but you know even a claw even what is it even o'clock broken clocks right twice a day yeah Alfons el from Canada mando from LA MattyB from Baltimore Nathan C and of course Joanna s in Dublin one of my favorite listeners always making me smile let's see what do I got okay let's start with Hasan ka ka Saddam and saying keep in mind this is this is a little this is a little bit maybe a month old but this is it's a Saddam insane very frequent listener frequent emailer and he was the person who originally said that I would use the word Pacific instead of specific so here he goes what up Mike been a while since I emailed but just had to respond to that damn spooby Raul s for calling me out last week spooby is a reference to a t-rex joke I'm sorry I'm gonna be having t-rex on the podcast real soon y'all he was supposed to be on this week but a probably on next week for those people have been asking for t-rex to come back first off I'd like to publicly semi apologize to you in the podcast listeners oh yeah I was so infuriated by Raul's chest Raul's challenge that I said [ __ ] it and thought I'd finally go back and drown myself and your beautiful voice for a week after listening to about 16 podcasts I've had a hit my ears are literally now full of Wax insert punchline drumroll but I'm dumb I've had enough of your god-awful voice and given up just playing your voices right but seriously whilst on the quest to find the infamous wack specific instead of specific slip-up I became deeply immersed in the pleasures of the podcast and forgot about the task at hand after hours of listening it is deeply saddening that I have to inform you and the podcast listeners that in fact I may have been wrong and you didn't actually say Pacific instead of specific you don't know how good this makes me feel Saddam and saying I was sure at the time that you said said it and I may have just missed it this time around but it looks like I may have just looks like I may have just told myself as Raul let's put it alas it wasn't a waste at 16 hours plus of my life I know one of your podcasts you mentioned a song called scrub life that you played to LA Reed when you met him at the Beverly Hills Hotel the scrub life mixtape was one of my personal favorites of your cat out of your catalogue and I was wondering have we heard that song under a different title or is it still unreleased I would love to hear it in fact its unreleased and if in fact its unreleased and again sorry to anyone who actually went back and tried to find the Pacific thing that teaches you for not believing for everything that you hear you damned spoo bees anyway thanks as always listening back to all those podcasts remind me just how dope it is that you interact with us your supporters on such a personal level level and can't wait for more music and more podcasts stay safe my friend you boy Hasan kay and Hasan k aka Saddam insane by the way low five blow dryer sounding tight yo well thank you very much Hasan it was good to hear from you Hasan is somebody I've met several times he's an English boy it was terrible but he's I've seen him in Philadelphia mm-hmm I believe I saw him in London but I definitely saw him in [ __ ] Amsterdam and uh yeah that's the homie I've also seen that fool in Paris man Hassan kay man Saddam insane he gets around a good friend good friend of the podcast and just good friend in general and also a good photographer by the way and he makes me feel good today by letting me know you and anybody that's been listening to the podcast for a long time know that I was a little bit upset because some so he said that I said pacifically instead of specifically and he said I said especially instead of a especially which I do i do say especially but I know that I don't say let me be Pacific about that I know that I don't say that so turns out I was right and as far as that song you're talking about scrub life I never did put that song that song yeah that's kind of funny that it was the ended up being the title of the mixtape and the title of the track I never got put out let me see if I can I can probably play a little bit of that for you here hold up [Music] [Music] that's right [Music] I don't need the clinseq lerigot I keep my spirit my standard swallow mine don'tyou don't call me so why [Music] right [Music] [ __ ] on the budget [Music] [Music] [Music] why [Music] stay home when is club night happily [Music] I try to fit Simon speaking for myself when I say the snow do we but I'm [ __ ] on myself I'm crying about my luggage give away to rubbish I own a bunch of rubbish in the do a bunch of is my last [ __ ] shrimpers real surprise sitting on the strip clubs in the still reserved I looked up into the sky and the lights feeling [Music] don't call me [Music] I said what is columbidae Napoli [Music] yeah so that's that that is that and now that was a rough mix of that song I never really like professionally got that mixed or even trying to professionally mix it myself but uh that was a rough mix sounds even a little corny to me right now honestly that's you know keep in mind it's like I guess that that album came out in 2011 so it's at least three years old that songs probably almost four years old and it sounds a little corny to me now I'm kind of kind of over that whole like trying to trying to be cool broke guy I don't think I was trying to be that but I think that that was naturally where I was at that time you know yeah I mean like if you're artists you kind of like just talk about you know and you like your music reflect on when your life is at the time you know and that's what I was doing at the time and it does have like a cool like rock Ozzie kind of vibe to it and I don't think I ever put there might be a live version of that song on YouTube I don't think I ever officially put that song out so thanks to the Saddam insane hasan k for asking about that i don't really know what else to say about it interesting all right this is from Louis B hey wax listening to your podcast with herbs listening to your podcast with herbs you mentioned doing ayahuasca and I've been researching it a lot and it seems interesting by researching I mean I watched a podcast and while your research is pretty much the same kind of research that I do although I did watch the the DMT documentary the Joe Rogan DMT documentary and I'm sure that if we're discussing ayahuasca the podcast and I remember you sent me the email with a link to it it was a Joe Rogan podcast he's one of those dudes that is very into like psychedelic drugs and he actually is the host of a whole documentary about the drug DMT which I just find that [ __ ] [ __ ] fascinating man like to me like the way that people talk about that it seems like more than a drug and you know I'm a I'm a believer in and true and not doubting everything you know there's people to think that might think he's crazy there's people that might think that doing ayahuasca this natural thing that you find in a tree and if you ingested supposedly according to people kind of takes you and shows you what God is and shows you where love comes from and shows you all these beings and [ __ ] like that and some people might think that's crazy but you know I think a virgin having God's baby is crazy as well so what can you say I think everybody's a little bit crazy and I do think that there's a I do think that there's merit in drugs I think there's merit in drugs especially the psychedelic drugs and I don't think that I don't judge people for participating in the experimentation of them or with them or whatever the [ __ ] if you ever have spare time peep it do you think you would actually make a trip to the Amazon rainforest if you were to try it all so completely random but what do you think of the Palmer Squares lyricism I think they both have amazing talent but I don't know [ __ ] about rapping so I'm curious what you think let me start by saying I think the Palmer squares are awesome I love them I love their [ __ ] and I think I think that they just got a cool vibe as far as ayahuasca I don't know that I want I don't know that I would make a trip to the rainforest to do that [ __ ] because to me that would freak me out even just to be down there would freak me out a little bit you know I'd be a little bit uncomfortable with my surroundings maybe and I might not know where I matter people might speak a different language I mean I know they had they have like weird kind of trips you can go on where you kind of like do ayahuasca with a shaman and [ __ ] like that I don't want to do it that bad and I don't think I'm that interested in it but you know if the shaman was here if he was like you know what how about instead of the rainforest would go to Malibu I'd do it like the rich white guy way although speaking of rich white guys I've heard that uh that the famous musician sting who is a rich white guy and you would think that he would he would being being with his going with his rich whiteness think that he would do ayahuasca in Malibu but maybe another aspect of being rich is you can kind of do whatever the [ __ ] you want and he wanted to go the Amazon rainforest and do that [ __ ] with a shaman and supposedly he's done that several times sting is a valid not valid avid sting is an avid drug like you know psychedelic drug user who supposedly does a lot of crazy drugs like him and his wife do [ __ ] Molly together and [ __ ] like that but I think his one of his big things is ayahuasca and I think several times he's been to the Amazon rainforest and done that [ __ ] with shamans and whatnot so uh you know it works for sting maybe that's where he got the name sting maybe that's like you know when he got out of it when he got out of the she got out of there you know there was some kind of naming the shaman caught him sting who knows but he's somebody that does that [ __ ] supposedly I don't think that I would make a trip to the Amazon rainforest to do ayahuasca no because I'd be too worried about something weird happening to me all right this next one this next question I remember getting this question this is kind of a weird question but uh read it anyway hey this is from Rachel hey wax big fan from New Zealand my [ __ ] stop for one second Oh what up alright sorry about that that's gonna Rachel big fan from New Zealand my name is Rachel I'm 16 and I'm a huge fan of everything you do your music your videos and podcasts I try to rap along do all your songs when they come on my phone I especially love new crack because it's so [ __ ] clever well I appreciate all that that you said Rachel that's awesome especially that you're so young and you're from New Zealand and you listen to all this stuff that's great my question for you is would you be weirded out or grossed out if you were hooking up with a girl and she took her clothes off and she had self harm scars on her body I have self harm scars on my stomach legs and hips and I get worried that when I eventually do end up having sex with someone and they see me naked that they'll be scared of the scars should I tell them about the scars before I get naked with them or should I not worry I don't actually want to have sex with anyone for a long time but I still think about what I should do a lot so yeah would that put you off the girl or would you really not care again huge fan of all your work and I don't mind if you read this out loud on the podcast since you said that that's why I decided to do it especially considering you're young and I don't know if this is [ __ ] illegal to even talk about this since you're a minor but I'm just trying to help and this is what I would say to you if somebody cares about that they will probably only care unless they're just a [ __ ] dick that you know and a lot of men are a lot of men just really you know you know what a lot of men want and that is sex and some of them might even tell you anything in order to get in bed with you but I think that ultimately first of all I'd be interested to see how [ __ ] how crazy the scars look because that's gonna make a big difference if you're if your stomach and legs and hips you know if it looks it's about to make a Kunta Kinte reference but I mean since I said I was about to I might as well have but if you if you're if it looks really bad then that might be a little bit different than the first a couple cuts there but I think that you're ultimately best off telling somebody ahead of time and maybe really not only telling somebody that you had the scars but explaining to them why you know you don't really explain in this letter why you have this these self harm scars or I think more importantly if that's something you still engage in and you still do still cut yourself that's not something that I ever did you know I've been I've had some depression in my life but I've never had I've never had that urge that's kind of something that I never did I never really got you know that's not really some something that I can understand - well that being said that makes me a perfect candidate to think about what I would say if I was the guy that was in the position you're talking about I think that I would just ask you I would just be honest with you and ask you you know what made you do that do you still and I just try to understand it with you and you know to be dead honest with you like most that's not gonna stop most guys from having sex with you if anything some of some of them might might even like it but uh I don't know you I don't know like I guess you gotta ask yourself how you feel about them you know I don't think that uh it's anything to be ashamed of I think that you should just just be honest and say that you had some had some issues and that's and that's what you did you know I think anybody that you want to be with especially if you're a virgin you've never had sex with the person the first person you had sex with should be somebody that you're able to be honest with you know I think I really do believe that I'm not just saying that to be nice to you I I really do believe that uh like I like I've said I talked about losing my virginity on the podcast to like I said was two weeks ago and I really am glad that it was with uh with with somebody that I at least you know you we were cool when I cared about you know and I wasn't just some strange one-night stand thing that I just want I just did to try to lose my virginity no I think it worked it works I think it's good to be with somebody who can be honest about and comfortable with and then if there is a weird experience it won't be so uncomfortable like you know like when I I mean this isn't the same as view but like I was I was uncomfortable in general and I was sweating my balls off and you know it wasn't as bad because the girl that the girl that I was with I wasn't worried about her judging me or anything like that it was just uh we were able to be honest with each other and I think the first person you have sex with you should be able to be able to do that too I think I think it I think another interesting thing about that if it's on your stomach legs and hips you know like if you're ever wear anything in the future especially if you're you know you're a girl that you kind of puts you out of the category of wearing anything revealing especially like a bikini or something like that and I'd be interested to see and they don't please please please sixteen-year-old girl do not send me pictures of your stomach legs and hips please don't do that but I would be interested to to know how bad it is or how you know if there if there's any potential for healing later in your life it's that's interesting but I wouldn't I don't think it's something I definitely see don't see there being any point in worrying about it you know I mean there's no really there's not really any point in worrying about it until you actually have that person that you might want to have sex with and then in that case I think I have a feeling that before you even have sex with them they'll they'll find out about the scars you know what I mean they might be doing a little something else you know I mean and or even if you're just talking to them and if you if you really get to know somebody and you get to the point where you're comfortable enough with somebody to let them have sex with you I think that you'll probably already be comfortable enough to let them know about that so that's what I got to say about that Rachel thanks for the email and thanks for listening to the podcast and the music alright this is from Harry 14 from NYC what's good Mike your music is generally tolerable to terrible and of course this is why I listen to your music and podcast well I appreciate that anyway in some of your songs you talk about God even though have you you have made it clear to us all that you were strongly opinion a strongly opinionated atheist and by the way I'm on your side the first thing that comes to mind is new and new crack where you say and the feeling in his wrist make you nod your fist make you realize God exists and then you go on to explain how splitting time up into such perfect increments as evidence for God's existence I don't know if I'm missing something or just that this just hasn't been explained yet but these questions need to be answered wax this little contradiction has been making me think for a while so I'm hoping your godliness can shed some light on the subject PS I'm sure all podcast listeners are very proud of your putting out a podcast on Wednesday for two consecutive weeks just thought that because your intros are often littered with apologies on how late you are with the podcast that you deserve credit where it is due have a great day and keep making music well I appreciate that Harry that that email was probably another email from about a month ago so since then I think I might have missed one but I know that this this podcast would yeah it should come out on a Wednesday if not it would be a Thursday morning but I did it will be at least the third consecutive week that I put out one so hey you know but as far as as far as the thing about god and new crack first the first of all let's start let's start with this it's you say you made it clear that you're a strongly opinionated atheist now going back to the pacifically verse specifically I think that if you were go back if you were to go back and listen to all my podcasts I don't think there'd be a time where I ever called myself an atheist I wouldn't call myself that I'm what they call a agnostic I think is what it is called I believe it's called an agnostic where if you ask me I don't know you know I don't know this is that my this is this is my belief as far as God goes summed up I think that I think I had to have set this on the podcast before but it's bait it can be summed up like this if you [ __ ] go if you look at an anthill an ant colony and then imagine those ants discussing the most recent NAFTA free trade agreement that Barack Obama made with the [ __ ] President of Mexico or whatever like if you just think about that think about the ability of those ants to have that knowledge that's what I think is is above us I don't know I don't know if there's God or whatever but I can I can tell you that I don't know you know I'm not perfect I'm not a politician I can flip-flop you know I don't know I don't know everything but there's something that happens with the music that makes everything change you know my opinions change when you have that there's there's a feeling that you get when you listen to music and a feeling you get especially insert certain times when it hits you in the right way that makes you know that that there's some kind of other [ __ ] going on and I think that maybe people feel that same feeling when they take ayahuasca and things like that but or you know it's the same the same reason people believe in God and they feel that in church and there's some kind of like unexplained thing that we might maybe we think it's God and maybe I thought maybe when I wrote those lyrics I was kind of thinking it was God and describing it as God but I really do think that there's something above us that makes it so we're able to split time into perfect increments like that there's some there's some kind of way that the world works in this perfect synchronized harmonious order you know it's the same reason there's 300 like there's 365 days in the year but that's divided up into seconds you know so there's blah blah blah seconds in a year and who the [ __ ] thought of that I don't know but you know there's some kind of way that we're able to just feel this division of time and what I mean by that is when you have you know if you let's say you have a B don't beat plan at 70 beats per minute you're not like thinking like okay well I have to clap 70 times for a minute you can just feel that exact rhythm and I don't know where that comes from maybe it comes from the fact that you have a heartbeat that's somewhat regular you know what I mean but at the time when I wrote that lyrics I I did those lyrics I was just thinking about that I guess and that that's the only the only way I can really explain it is there something above us that something higher than us that keeps everything moving in a in a specific pattern I don't know how to explain it but I definitely don't consider myself an atheist man I don't I don't I I I don't I don't go by the whole there's a [ __ ] dude in the clouds that looks down upon us and and knows about everything we do and he's just like us and I definitely don't think that he's good you know I think if anything I like to explain it all another ant metaphor is like imagine if imagine if you there was just a random kindergarten class and you can you made all of them take care of an ant farm you know it's just a random kindergarten class and in Wichita and you know we weird we're one of the we're one earth is one of those ant farms like why why couldn't that be true I mean have you seen how small and big things get you know like if the if it's true that the earth could be like you know if the universe is infinite if you've ever been on a beach and looked at one grain of sand you know if if that's earth I don't see why we couldn't it's unexplainable and we're too small to possibly imagine what's the what's real and what's above us but I reject the notion generally I definitely reject the notion that did any of the books explain it that's that to me is all is all nonsense I mean you know if you believe in it that's fine it's and I'm not I'm not gonna [ __ ] you know I'm not gonna I'm not gonna judge you I mean I might kind of judge you I'm not let's be honest here I might kind of judge you for believing in these things wholeheartedly but I think I think the you know the reason that people do that is because you get to us you get to a certain point in your life you're like what the [ __ ] this is all this is all absurd this whole existence there's no meaning in life you know that's that's my that's my thing you know there was like a you know like what's-his-name cam you there was an old desert I think it was a French philosopher named Albert Camus hey learning something and his theory was absurd ISM and this really whenever everyone philosophers usually are trying to kind of figure out the meaning of life and that's what religion is trying to really point to as well and his main thing was there is no meaning of life essentially either you have to make your own meaning but if you really try to think of a meaning it's absolutely ridiculous like if you look at the world around you and the way we operate and what we're doing like to find a real meaning in it is ridiculous so I kind of go by that which which kind of makes me you know take it then it's it's it's a fun way to live your life if you think about it that way because it'll make you do more ridiculous things maybe and it makes you appreciate more ridiculous things and uh I don't know it's I don't I don't deny the existence of quote-unquote God but I definitely don't I definitely my point is I don't consider myself an atheist I do think that there's some kind of [ __ ] going on with the fact that we can make rhythm like that and there's a there's a feeling that you getting in music that I I can't explain it but there's like certain emotions explai it and when you connect with people I don't know that if there's some kind of connection we all have on this earth and I think ayahuasca probably brings that to the table you know there's all these little weird feelings I mean you can get even even like being in nature you know can give you can give you weird feelings about God in the meaning of life and all that [ __ ] so I don't know if I really answered anything through that but uh alright this is a pretty long email how much time do I got here I've been I've been talking for a while now but I told Trevor in Sacramento that I would read his email so I will sup big whacks I was just listening to podcast 53 where you gave advice to Eden or Enoch Young Eden or Young Enoch I don't remember who that was but sorry I forgot the name but the Jewish kid from Israel the guy that got all ran T about existentialism and religion I just wanted to tell you that I know what you were going through brace yourself for an excessive back story I'm a bit younger than you when the economy hit the atoh the toilet when the economy and when the economy hit the toilet I had just gotten on with the state of California working in Corrections and my girlfriend at the time I just graduated college and gotten a good job in accounting so we bought a house when they were cheap and I moved in solo because my girlfriend had old school Mexican parents who didn't want her leaving the house until she was married in that time I started passing time watching Netflix not shows mind you because those I had to save to watch with the lady so I started watching all the documentaries all right he said he would he wrote this at the time when I was watching all the documentaries and probably a lot of the podcast [ __ ] had to do with how depressing everything is pretty much the ones that you mentioned watching now I already knew the country was [ __ ] I knew it was big business buying politicians due to a family that always used to sit around and debate politics after dinners but those documentaries got me [ __ ] depressed being able to already realize how apathetic and Willey willfully ignorant our younger generations are when I started seeing just how bad it was made me realize that stuff is going to get bad hopefully after our life I [ __ ] couldn't agree with you more but I'm mentally ready to abandon ship the moment I feel the iceberg touched the boat and it makes me depressed because of the beauty that exists in how this country was created but not in the abomination that it has become I've dealt with the whole what's the point of life thing for a while mmm this actually led to in well from the previous question while I'm certain that there is no God as in some I'm nipa 10th dude picking Super Bowl winners as do it as I it's weird how this is and that this came after the other one I didn't plan this I don't discount that we could have a creator or creators they could be aliens I know it gets the lol's but I find alien intervention and shaping life on this planet far more likely than the aforementioned old guy on a cloud I must have got that from reading this or anything else so I think I bit your theory Trevor but I get the alien thing is actually kind of kind of goes along with what I said about the kids with the ant farm you know maybe maybe these [ __ ] maybe a maybe aliens are actually decide like one alien life-form is actually the size of 7 billion earths and of the earth to him is the size of a [ __ ] grain of sand or whatever you know you never know anyways my philosophy on what the meaning of life is and why I'm here is to be a good person you know be someone that makes existence better for other people rather than worse not to be selfish and just try to be happy and I will say that your music and the music of everyone I found through you dfd herbs intuition breezy Jose Rios zom all that great stuff that came through Knox Teddy is a big part of my staying happy and I thank you guys for that I've always loved music and always wanted to make music but unfortunately other than a moderately good singing voice I was not quote blessed with any abilities on that arena recommendation not sure exactly what to recommend because you usually oh you're using my recommendation to people but if you haven't listened their stuff slaughterhouse there's some of the best lyricist in the traditional rap game don't get too depressed man and if you need to stop watching those gloom and doom documentaries oh if you need to stop watching them and as far as the meaning of life just know that through your music you have made the lives of multiples of thousands of people better and take comfort in that for that long-ass boring email Trevor in Sacramento ah yeah I wanted to read that just because I [ __ ] I guess that I kind of wanted to read that because I as demonstrated by my answer to the previous question I kind of feel a lot of the same ways about things that Trevor does don't believe it not don't believe in the old guy on a cloud thing I don't that's that's funny I'm nipa tint dude picking Super Bowl winners that's funny [ __ ] cuz people think that they're like almost be [ __ ] uh God must bus think you know though they'll find anything to to bring God into and [Music] yeah I think that like like I said about life being kind of a kind of [ __ ] absurd you know music is one of the most absurd things there is you know and it doesn't make any any sense necessarily and it's totally subjective and it's just beats and rhythms and whatever you want to do but somehow it makes people happy and that's just you know when Trevor saying that my stuff makes him happy that's yeah I take comfort in that as well and that makes me want to make more of it and like I said in the beginning of the podcasts or the middle of podcast whatever that was I am making more of it and I'm gonna attempt to make even more and

often just commenting liking viewing just giving me so much support for the following for you video I just didn't think that video would get as much get as much response as she guys been giving it so I'm really thankful peachie comma did on the video the guy who made the song commented on the video I just never really imagined that happening so I really want to thank you guys for that and I think the video is that like I mean at least 4,000 views which is like and thank you for 100 my subscribers as well I need to thank you for that too and thank you for all of your support on all my other videos as well I said meeting to do a tutorial like this for a long and I haven't been able to get it to you because I've just been so wound up with college apps and free screenings but no story so I finally have the time to make this tutorial for you so excited because I know that you guys are going to enjoy it and you know I just want to show you what I did when I was coming up with because they know that with a lot of covers on YouTube some of them use different sermon patters some of them use different poured some of them use like you know like a completely different like texture altogether and so I just want to show you what I do hopefully you can send me all of your thoughts as to how offer you not further ado let's just get into this tutorial let's go firstly you want to tune your ukulele down one half step because that's how you get it in short major you can do a lot of different things which is just using like the same chords this an F sharp major you know so you know yeah let me think B major our major all you're like one force five is like in F sharp major or you can just tune the ukulele down a half step which is just the easiest thing because if you keep it in its original tuning it's gonna be in G major and you can do that if it's more comfortable for you vocally but it's not the original key of the song so I would recommend going down a half step if you want to be authentic the right words but [Music] that's better C G and those are really the only chords you need technically but if you want to have fun with it you can also use C minor g7 G major 7 and then g7 first just figure out how to play those opening chords and rhythm so you have [Music] remember throughout this song you can really just use C and C minor interchangeably in G & G major 7 originally I think I like using C minor in places where you express the major because it makes it a little jazzy yeah so yeah so the tablature [Music] [Music] - so you just think of the same tablet or you just put the chords on to it that's probably the easiest way to get so you have to remember on this chord when you're doing the G major 7 or the GA your cord you lift up the cord before you play the open string because then it's gonna sound like the two and you don't want that so you have five then let's go into the race strum strum strum strum strum look lap strum strum strum strum and that's basically it and so and then you can do another strum up clap if you so desire I just did a lot because I it something is a happen at you so you know apart from that let's get into sorry I'm checking the time okay kissing you then we start switching it up to see how we went from like that strum strum just strum clap some you can just do that what you really to you can do strum strum strum strum then you go to strum that strum strum clap really simple then you have the I'm scared part so I'm scared part you're really just repeating the intro scared of telling you how I feel about the injury maybe just shine you can see you don't you and then you just go back into the original price oh yeah any verse or at the part after that I'm scared you just want to go to C C minor G that's probably the best thing to do because they think like it's kind of glow his przemek is probably kind of good to go back to the originally the original integrity of the song yeah and then you just end with the intro so you have how I did it was actually a mistake I didn't mean to do that but I accidentally like lifted my finger too late so this is how you do like the iconic ending [Music] and then before you get to two you want to have your pointer finger right here you just play the two strings so you're playing to second fret of the third string and you're playing blaster and that's about it I'm gonna tag my original video here so that you guys can go check that out once you're done figuring out all the technical the technical stuff of it and then yeah and tell me what you think this is my first tutorial obviously it was a little shaky I'll try to take my time a little bit more and I'll also try to do like more explenation or chords later but let me know what content you guys want because usually I used to buy YouTube video just to post stuff that I really want to do but if you guys want to do stuff or if you guys want to hear stuff or if you guys want to send me stuff just

flowers and by love but never to come back I see people turn their heads and quickly love away like a newborn baby it just happens every day I look inside myself and see my heart is black I see my red door and I want it painted black maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts it's not easy facing up when your whole world is life no more will my green see go turn deeper blue I could not foresee this thing that bend into you if I look hard enough and do the said and tongue my love will laugh at me before the morning comes I see your breath Dorian that I wanted painted no colors anymore I wanted to turn black I see the room for my breasts in there some clothes I have to turn my head until my doggies go [Music] wanna see it painted painted painted painted black wanna see the Sun blotted out by the sky [Music] [Music] the strumming pattern it's a Chuck and then an upstroke check up check up check up so what's a Chuck a Chuck is when you strike the strings and continue through until the fleshy part of your hand mutes the strings that's a Chuck so that's what we're playing in the verse do you have two chords to remember there it goes from the D minor to the a you have two bars of D minor two bars of a and then say this with me d C f/c that's what we're going to play for the chorus we go to downstrokes there a simple way to do it would be like this d c FC d minor of course thing c v sin and then the first time you go to the D minor for two bars that's a simple way to do it I do stuff like this sometimes I lift up my fingers like so so that's down down down up up up down down up down down down up up up down down up the second time we do the D CFC to beat six we go to a jean get into the IE so you've got you D C f/c and I've made up a little riff I'm not sure if this really happens in the Stein's version but I like to go you could bite with your thumb to get a nicer tone I'm kind of making it a bit you know angsty so that's C D E I ham up on if e d c so all together and then you want to come down on the next section playing D C if C all together ready here we go the chorus [Music] and on the I I like to do a bit of a buildup you could do downstrokes like that or you could go there's no rules of course to playing a song you just feel it and these are just suggestions the easy way to do it of course is just by keeping it simple and just doing down strokes let's have a look at that riff a are you learning something please go ahead and like that video now if you know the C major scale this is going to be a lot easier for you and if you haven't looked at the C major scale check out this video linked here and I'll put it in the description as well C major scale is like this now we're using notes in that scale but we're actually playing a D minor scale so we're starting on the second degree which is C D so now we're on D d e f g one two three four and then back so if we break the riff into two paths we have this that's part one part two guys like this hit the D again down the second time back up and then open e back today finish on the D flat now the riff begins on beat two one two three four one two three four one two three four one two three four one two three four one two three four one two three four one two if you really want to impress your friends you add what I'm calling a drone note so you just pluck the open a string on the upbeats like so one two three four one two and three and four and one and two and three and four and one and two and three four and one and two [Music] in the beginning the riff is played like so it stops there and does this so that is open string C 0 1 2 talking about the frets and you hit the B string and then on the way back you reverse that so you go to 1 0 and end up on the D flat [Music] I'll play the intro riff one time through with the Hemery beat [Music] [Music] bit faster and then I do a drumbeat so I'm doing that by tapping the bottom of the ukulele and then using my thumb I can - and three and four [Music] thanks for hanging out with me all the way to the end of the video I really appreciate that thank you I'll see you in the next one [Music]", "zsVvdEE6EOA": "[Music] hello welcome in this video you will learn how to play hallelujah make sure that your uh Khalil is tonight and also make sure that the nails on your court hand are really short this will make it so that you have really good form and the strings will bring nicely if you would like to see more song tutorials like this one learn how to play ukulele from scratch and see product reviews and subscribe to this channel for this song we will need chords e please play chords e with your ring finger please don't cheat and use the index finger middle finger we need those for other courts so please do see with your ring finger have you been a finger hover over not touching but hover over so that when you switch to a minor there's very little effort so see to a minor make sure you do a minor with your middle finger because later you will need F and all you have to do is put down the index finger it happens to me and almost every video will have my people say like why can't I play as smoothly as you do and part of the reason is that some students don't want to let go of the index finger being the dominant finger but if you play with your ring finger that opens up the middle finger for a minor so really when I tell you to use these fingers I mean well this is for your own code ok so we were at F with your peace fingers then we will need G or G you're going to pivot the hand inwards think about the fingers coming down from the top this one's not easy it does take time to build but once you've brought it many other chords are much easier so work on G a little bit at a time if you haven't mastered it and finally we will need a 7/8 on also requires the hem to become like completely pivoted inwards this is a really cool chord I think I like that it's a little weird okay let's get started there are three parts to this song the intro the verse and the chorus the rest of the song is just all a repetition of one of those so for the intro all we need is C and a minor two beads on each now you have some options on how to execute these two beats you can just keep it simple and do down strums to switch to or you can do the finger style I highly recommend the finger style because it sounds more like the arpeggios that you hear the piano doing if you listen to the song so we're going to assign one finger for each of the strings and that finger will only pick on that string so the thumb is on G index on C middle on E and ring on a and all I'm doing is picking from the top to the bottom and back up watch me do it first and then we'll do it together it helps if you have nails but it's not like absolutely necessary without nails it'll just be a little softer [Music] try it with me one two ready go each one of these sink winces is two beats so let's go to C chord one two ready go one two now switch to a minor ready go one two so let's do both those chords from C to a minor one two ready go switch if any part of this tutorial is too fast or too slow for you then use the gears either up here or down here depending on what device you're on and you can change the speed of the video too much like you're learning so let's try that again see one two ready go okay see a mine if you would like to strung through this one but they clearly didn't real quick so this song is in a triple feel so if you say one two three one two three one two three one two three that is the feel of the song and you would strum on one and three so let's say it and clap it ready go one two three one two three one two three one two three try again baby go one two three one two three one two three one two three so what you just clapped try the strum that so it'll be one two three one two three one two three one for the purpose of this tutorial I'm going to keep it simple and just do down strum speeds you can use the technique that you like best okay let's take it at the first part of the verse and the reason is that all of the courts here have to beat so you don't have to really like think too hard all you have to do is just switch to the next chord in the right timing so here we go see a minor C a minor one two verse go [Music] this second part of the verse is the more tricky one because you have some chords that only last for one beat so what you need to do is always think a chord ahead don't think about the chord that you're on think of a chord ahead so we go from C for two beats then then V and then move to a minor so let's try that one to see two beats see see see a Mike let's try that again one two ready go try again one two and keep going [Music] okay so let's do the homework I want you to always think one chord ahead okay want to burst go and now we're at the last part of the song because the song is so repetitive once you learn this you've learned all of the parts so the last part of the song into the chorus so watch me do it first and then we'll do it together [Music] so now let's try the chords together one two ready go [Music] [Laughter] [Music] so now just for fun let's piece it together intro verse and chorus okay one two ready go [Music] you [Music] I hope that you enjoyed this tutorial for hallelujah thank you so much for watching and hope to see you in the next one [Music] [Music]", "2fbZvGlq0cg": "hey guys what's up it's brian back here again with a ukulele tutorial for uh juice world's lucid dreams uh one of my favorite songs of all time and i've been waiting a while to do this one just to because i just didn't have the time but uh now that you know uh my rugrats are back in school uh i've got a little bit more time so i'll be be bringing more ukulele tutorials to you just let me know uh in the comments below what uh tutorials you want done and uh make sure to like and subscribe while you're doing that all right lucid dreams is uh is a great song um to kind of either do as a picking kind of thing you can go like a little no [Music] you can do something like that um but i'm gonna show you kind of both ways that i would do it um so we're gonna we're gonna first go over each chord that you need uh and then i'll go over strumming and or picking patterns so your first chord here 6654 [Music] uh and i believe that's an f sharp minor okay six six five four so two fingers on this the first two strings are on the sixth fret and then fifth fret fourth fret right uh and then next we're gonna go six four four four so you're just basically going to bar that fourth fret and put a finger on the sixth fret g string [Music] okay then you're just gonna slide that down two frets [Music] to four four four two two two sorry and then your last chord for this little piece is one one one four basically a c sharp right so you put your bar in that first fret and then you're gonna put a finger on that fourth fret uh what is that a string okay so if we were to do just this part so starting back at 6654 i'm gonna go for strumming i'm gonna go down up up and then switch chords down up up and then for the third chord i'm going to go down up up up and then that last chord just down all right so again six six five four down up up then six four four four down up up then four two two two down up up okay or you can go down up up up down and then down right so i'll do it without talking this time down right if you wanted to pick that part i would i would really focus on the the c e and a strings so you can plug c and a together and then c e a and then do it again and then do it again you know so cna are really going to be your drivers for this [Music] okay so that's your main that's your meat and potatoes of the song right so it's the i still see the shadows in my room can take back the love that i gave you right so uh when you get to the easier said than done it's gonna change a little bit we're going to go to d easier said than done right so 2 2 2 0 easier said than done we're going to go 4 4 4 2 which is an e set then done i thought you were the one a were the one um listening to my heart in stead of my head so this last chord is very similar to the beginning chord but it's different right it's six five four four instead of six six five four okay so this part here you're going d easier e7 [Music] uh then that's gonna be uh f sharp instead of my head and i go back to d easier e said then and then you could uh for this last part you could go back up here just to six four four four and then and then you're going to go back into the beginning part i still see the shadows in my room right so um so the court you know the course part or that i guess the change part it's gonna be d down up up e down up up a down up up and then uh f sharp down and you could stay on a if you wanted to or you can come back up here again okay super duper easy song um if you're still doing the picking part in the chorus you're still doing the you're still doing c c a c and a together and then c e a so so c so c c and c and a together okay sorry c and a together c e a and that'll be that'll be your your picking pattern for pretty much the whole song all right uh cool hopefully this video helped you out give it a like down below and comment on what you want to learn

your middle finger and your ring finger you're going to set your middle finger on the third fret of the third string ring finger third fret of the second string now i'm doing uh just assigning my fingers to the string so i'm assigning my thumb to the fourth string index to third string middle finger to second string and ring finger to first string although we don't use the first string at all in this song so we're going to do is take your index and your middle finger over here and you're going to pluck those strings twice and you're going to set your index finger back here ring finger comes off index finger comes back to first fret of the second string so you've got all right now the next chord what we're gonna do is see where your middle finger is there on that third fret of the third string hop it up to third fret of the fourth string and then add your ring finger to third fret of the second string all right and now i'm going to use my thumb and my middle finger all right so you just pluck each of those simultaneously then drop your index finger back to first fret uh ring finger comes off again uh drop your index finger back to first fret of the second string now are you going to pluck with your thumb and middle again those are the signed strings fingers to those strings so you're going to pluck those then you're going to set your pinky down here on the fifth fret of the fourth string pluck that singularly then you're going to pluck again and slide up to seven so [Music] all right and then the final chord index finger first fret of second string middle finger
