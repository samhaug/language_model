your weed pipes because hi friends welcome to that high couple where we explore and discuss our passion for cannabis today on the channel we are coming to you with a tutorial on how to use a nectar collector yes nectar collector tends to be a favorite tool for concentrate lovers out there and we honestly think that freeze pipe might have invented the best version of it we're very excited to check out what upgrades they've given to a classic nectar collector to give it that special freeze pipe twist let's quickly explain what exactly is a nectar collector because i think this is honestly such a fun tool for turning yourself into a hummingbird for dabs because it is a smaller more compact size you really get a lot of flavor out of your dabs there's less air traveling around there so less of a chance for any of the smoke to actually get stale we also love how portable it is it easily breaks down and can be put back together for travel dabs i mean just this sitting on your table like what a show piece love that it has a couple of feet down here so you can set it like level and the water isn't going to spill out so nice the guys they really thought about a lot of things with this design which is why this feels like it's the flippin cadillac of nectar collectors let's quickly get into how to actually set up this nectar collector it's really simple you're going to take the main unit here you're going to add a little bit of water to it it's so great that it's got that water filtration we are going to take the nail portion of it the little straw end and just insert that in it fits right in no problem yeah freeze pipe has again outdone themselves by creating the smallest glycerin chamber that they've ever offered like right look at how cute this is so we love freeze pipe because they do come with these really cool glycerin chamber add-ons that you can keep in the freezer they never freeze solid you add it in there and it's basically like putting ice cubes in your bong how that just cools down the smoke will just go through that spiral and yeah give you a nice cool hit i know right and it's like other pieces if you're using ice the water melts it like messes up the whole water level like this is basically just non-stop ice cold dabs they offer another nectar collector like full kit that is this entire contraption with a spare glycerin chamber that's actually just a straight through tube so if you're doing like longer like dab seshes and stuff and you need to have a backup ready in the freezer that is so nice to have as well as a little koozie that you can like wrap around right right just a little so that way it keeps it how many of you out there really have a koozie for your weed pipes because normal yeah that's next level uh okay so now that we have this like ready to go the only thing that you have to do to like get this started is take your blow torch get it hot enough that you can tell that it's hot you know hot enough to vaporize which gonna open up our dabs here we've got some raw garden like i said it doesn't you know like instead of just taking a dab out of this we're just take the whole thing oh my goodness all right uh cheers everyone i can hear it like my god oh okay wow and the flavor on that wait dude could i left bro let's see let's see yeah yes look at that wow okay so that stays hot for for a minute you can easily share that between two people oh flavor on that too right wow you're right so good and so pure i love it love it let's just see little bubbles that's such a smooth hit oh my goodness oh wait okay let me get another one right let it help you out there bam i love too the holidays are coming up i do feel like this would be a fun christmas present for anyone out there that is really into concentrates even if they've tried nectar collectors before this is like the big daddy upgrade i was about to say for every dabber in your life get him this wizard staff i think they're they're not going to be disappointed right if you would like to see more fun tutorials and reviews like this subscribe to this channel by clicking right over here in the corner hey exclusive videos waiting for you by clicking this button right in the middle right there and more videos from us right here either the thumbnails off to the side there you go thank you so much for watching everyone spending good vibes", "TXCL58cs7eg": "turn on the torch light up the flame time to melt some glass my friends there you are Here I am to explain to teach and create again okay what we got going on here simple hacks things will make your life a little easier instead of using some of the stuff that everybody uses I use a few other things when I got the welding torch I got one of those sparker striker things and you know what never even put it together probably even broken nose I didn't even check it out but what I do instead of using one of those I use one of these now you say oh no it's gonna explode not if it's empty that's all you need you can you can use them on your grill until the gas is gone or ask your friends to save one for you whatever all you need is let me see if I can get it at the right angle so you can see inside there is that little spark you can see it from time to time that's all that's all it matters that's all you need that electronics it's an electronic spark you don't have to worry about ever changing a flint it's it's always gonna be there it's what I'd use it crystal you strike it it causes an electric spark okay now that's number one number two things that you need to do basic torch work set of tweezers wouldn't hurt graphite graphite pad wouldn't hurt they've got them on eBay you can buy them down into small chunks if you have to they come in handy you can use the tools around you I use cutting a wire cutting torches a wire cutters like this to snip off pieces of glass just like that boom and it does a very good job also if you ever get a scoring knife this is a wonderful thing to have in your repertoire II basically you'll listen let me see if I can get it close enough so you can hear that that scratch noise and you can see the scratch wet it snap it away from you sweet as and it does it well with tubing same idea right there you can hear it crunch you can see the scratch you wet it and thumbs at six o'clock scratch it at 12 o'clock and push away from you always push away you don't want to push towards you shattering towards you don't know never mind that's what happens if you don't put the thumb at 6 o'clock and your finger or your thumbs at 6 o'clock and the scratch at 12 o'clock I think I had a little bit off and it shattered and nevermind different story scoring nice tweezers very important some people have wet colored cans I myself have a dry collet cam that way I can sort to it later and say hey I like that little piece I can make it into a little tiny something or so on and so forth now lighting the torch let's get it on and and the reason I'm using how it's gonna do this to me again his name okay the reason I'm using the simple torque is I want you guys to know and you saw that all it took with that little spark the gas comes from the flame itself okay now when you're working glass you're heating up a piece like so you always want to make sure that when you put down a piece of glass you don't put it down with the hot end towards you know your new hot in the what do you usually do subconsciously you'll pick up in that's closest to you always put the hot end away hot in that way away from you it will make a big difference in the long run otherwise you do it like this and it's never mind now another thing that you're going to need and it does help to have is and this is my special pair you'll love it talk about a budget pair of die gimmie UM's I bought the lenses on eBay and they were about 30 bucks instead of buying the 40 or $50 pairs but you can you can get them sometimes for deeper decent price what I did was I took the lenses and then went to the dollar store and got a pair of sunglasses and made them to fit and that's my pair of d\u00edgame iam lenses at the moment I do have another pair that I used but this is my preferred care at the moment I do like it also I put from one end to the other so it doesn't slide off the end of my nose all the time is just a little bit of surgical tubing you can use string if you have to whatever but that sort of keeps it on the head okay now next thing simple basic things about melting glass you've got to realize that you got to get it hot enough and work it to your advantage not your disadvantage now what I'm gonna do on this simple basic hack is I'm gonna make a heart it's close to Valentine's Day it's in the middle of February well it's going on the 8th of February here so you got about six more days or so alright eight but who's counting no six well eight no six excuse me I'm awake now the heart I'm gonna use the tweezers to make this heart okay simple basic and what I'm doing when I'm mayor you know you could just spin this that way but I want this ball to be a little bit bigger so I'm tilting it downward and as I tilt it downward it draws into a ball for you sweet now what you can do at the very end tilted adil just a little bit it makes a teardrop shape now that comes in handy now I'm going to go ahead and just flatten it like this there you go now next thing to have in your repertoire high expensive piece of equipment is that old butter knife go to the dollars you know go to the years your thrift store and get one or two of them big deal play with them you'll find out they come in real handy all I did was heat and press right at the middle of that top of the heart and now I'll go ahead and press out again sweet as you can please simple heart loop here we go loop to move another thing to have in your repertoire this is a little bit thick for loop but it'll do the job because I can take any type of glass any size of glass and make it to what I want but what you do touch it to one side and send it out a little bit as you're pulling make a question mark see there question mark all right okay question Mike now let it gravity work for you and let it draw back and just press it into itself another simple thing to have that will help you in your glass works is and I'm trying to look for it and you think I could find it if there it is way over here I have a nice rack of things I've Reese organized a little bit and easier to find I just forgot about it I second now what I this is a graphite rod you can get these on eBay you can you know just they're worth their weight to make little loops like this possible okay simple hack simple stuff simple heart Y complex your life if you don't have to now I'm going to go ahead and heat up and just pull off the bottom of this heart and there you go and the best thing about making clear hearts is no matter what color the person's wearing it will compliment the color because the color will come through the piece okay simple hearts any questions any other ideas that you have or would like to see in up in coming videos with my budget torch or my Carlisle torch or I also have a new Bethlehem champion which I'm really excited about having into my repertoire because it helps me to melt bigger pieces of glass even with my concentrators I've also done a video with it just well showing the difference between a concentrator and an oxygen oxygen tank which I borrowed from a friend which is really really good to have now I'm going to do something a little bit different on this one I'm sitting here still talking to you so I'm gonna go ahead and do it anyway this one's adding a little color to that same scheme same here okay nice round ball press it in love they pop a lollipop don't lick this sucker it's really hot lollipop lollipop don't lick this sucker it's really hot okay I'm going crazy give me a chance now I'll cross-reference this to another video that I did recently Oh where is it when you want it I guess you can just grab another piece of it this is when you want it this will work oh well come on this will work okay turbo cobalt encased on top of well there's turbo cobalt in the center core and then above that I put what I'm doing is basically drawing this on there just as a quick layer turbo cobalt um and then I double encased it and put heavy blue star dust on top of that and you talk about sparkle glitter shine really really nice to have all the glitters people will pay the gold for this is a simple way of using your colors just as a backup color or back and again I'll do another heart here same idea but this heart the color is coming through from the other side from the colors that I put in there and you can't see quite yet but you should be able to see it shortly and this time I flattened it on this you can see it came out more of a lollipop shape than tweezer dinner but that's okay if you don't have you don't have if you do have great to have in your repertoire okay simple tools and it does make a difference sometimes but you got to realize who is in control of this glass who has to be in control of this glass question answer is you sometimes it may seem to get the better of you take a deep breath walk away sometimes if that's what it takes don't let it get the better view you've got to realize persistence will pay off I've been at this since 1982 and I have gotten really good at some things and I'm not the best at what I do I'll admit that but I feel like I've got a lot to offer and I want to share click like click subscribe share it if you like to if you have questions write them down email me my email address is there my facebook name is there so if you want to become a facebook friend make sure that you have at least a place where you live people are trying to be friends with me on Facebook and there's not even a place that they live or where they're at and they only have one picture which is them and come on I know you've got to start somewhere but at least put some of the info down and if you have a mutual friend of mine that helps a little but I still look to see if you are from somewhere if you're not you don't make my list okay coining it a little bit and pulling it off whoa there went spin let it cool a little bit I am gonna put this in the that one in the oven but I'm gonna let it cool a little bit and let you see that's Barclays literally come out in this thing and let's see if I can rock it back and forth until see if I can all right first of all that's the hard part about this the reflection is screwed up on this I can see it anyway it is there I will show it to you as the cover Oh interesting very interesting okay thank you for watching as always carpe vitro and enjoy your day", "S3Qw_8LqZeg": "[Music] you", "0Y10ppK3CnM": "Good day guys, Matt from VapeFuse Australia\nhere. Back again with another video for our Vaping 101 Webinar Series, teaching Aussies\nabout herb vaping. Now, I've touched on a bunch of different vaping topics, now,\nlooking at portable and desktop vapes, the different types of portables, different\ntypes of desktops and one trend that sort of starting to see, is usability is\nsomething though all users need in a vape. Some vape that has a low level of\nusability that's really difficult to learn and operate, no one's really\ninto that, that much. The devices have pretty much do everything for you and the ones\nthat we've found that really sell. So with these vaporizers today, I'm going to be\ngoing over a water bubbler, which is an element to vaping, that's pretty new. So,\nportable vaping has taken off recently in the past couple of years. It was only 10\nyears ago that you needed a backpack or a little wagon to lug around your\nportable vape. These days, we've got models you can slide into your back\npocket and forget about and have your session on you at all times. With these\ndevices in front of me, that you're seeing, they're all equipped with some\ntype of aqua bubbler to help improve functionality, cool the vapor and\nultimately allow you to take much larger draws. So, from right to left I've got the\nFocusVape Pro portable vape, the X Vape Fog and the Hydrology9. So, obviously\nthey've got very different styles of aqua bubblers. The FocusVape is in the more\ntraditional version, it's just got this external aqua bubbler, it's got an\ninterior percolator and it's also got air lock, so that none of that water\ninside is gonna drip out. So, basically this one, you just fill it from the tap\nor from filtered water, while you inhale a little bit in the bottom and then\nyou'll just make sure all that water is just staying in there around the percolator. So,\nthis aqua bubbler, just slides directly onto the top of the device and it works very\nwell. For anyone that's used to water pipe before or is that sort of like their\nfavorite style, this is gonna be an awesome adjustment for you, from\nswitching from smoking to vaping. It allows you to keep that element, that your'e familiar with.\nSo, the FocusVape Bubbler is awesome only little downside, is if you push the\nmouthpiece in too far, you can hit the perk underneath and obviously this\ndevice wasn't manufactured for used with an aqua bubbler. So, traditionally it was\njust the herb vape when the aqua bubbler was brought in to enhance its productivity a\nlittle bit. The X Vape Fog's aqua bubbler, I found works a little better. It helps\nto cool the vapor a lot more, because it's got this extended silicon vapor\npath and then a little external aqua bubbler on the end and so it's way easier to clean\ntoo. You just fill this with a little bit of Isopropyl alcohol, remove it from the\nsilicon hub and just leave it to soak for a day or two. So, the FocusVape is a\nlot more like a water pipe, very difficult to clean, you're gonna keep it soaked up\nwith some Isopropyl and some salt and stuff like that and you can take it the\nbest part of 10-15 minutes, because with this device, anywhere up to you just\nleave it and let it do its thing. So, the X Vape Fog's aqua bubbler, is actually\ncompatible with a whole number of devices, the Storz and Bickel Mighty and\nCrafty, the Flowermate Swift Pro, of course, the X Max\nStarry,  bunch of different vapes. So, if you've got any of those vapes and\nlooking for an aqua bubbler to increase functionality,\ncheck out the X Max Bubbler in the VapeFuse store. The third device, takes aqua\nfiltration to a whole new level. Now, as I mentioned before, neither of these devices\nwere manufactured specifically for use with an aqua bubbler. The Hydrology9 has\nan included aqua bubbler, that's built into the device. So, it's whole\nvaporization and heating method and stuff like that is built around the aqua\nfiltration, so it can run a little harder, it can really sort of extract those\ninitial plant oils and stuff like that, a little bit better, than these other two\ndevices and the aqua filtration helps to cool down the vapor and deliver\nbeautifully tasty hits of herb vapor. So, this device took out, our Best Herb Vape\nin the Flavor Category for 2018. So, I'm not lying when I say that this thing\nreally --- it's a beautiful device, the Hydrology9. So, all of these devices,\ncan be used with water, but when paired with our Natural Piece Water Solution,\nyou can maintain a cleanly piece, for a lot longer. So, instead of just general water,\nwhich picks up any sort of grime or whatever that's a resin, that's coming\nfrom the plant material, this Piece Water has enriched minerals and vitamins and\nplant extracts that helps like a bit of citric acid,\nthat helps sort of maintain a bit of fluidity in the chamber and I ultimately keep it\nclean for a lot longer. So, thanks guys. Thanks for hearing about aqua bubblers\nand make sure to check out the rest of our videos, in this Vaping 101 Webinar\nSeries.

questions she'll be screening my calls today oh yeah let me just adjust that we gotta just you grabbed it by the side of the screen there and move it in and then you move the whole thing over there and do that again adjust all right thumbs up from mrs. beard oh yeah baby so there we go get to work it's time to blow some glass I'm feeling pretty good today hey rough morning you know some mornings are up for the mothers but now I'm feeling the spark let's take a look at what's in the kill this Caden kill bottle 90169 super awesome super easy to use nope the single fingered or use stays up in any position no more crashing down doors just love it here's a big base if you dig in two weeks ago in the bubblers episode this was a piece of fifty by five we made the bottom I think this will be a triple bubbler high I think so and we've also got a second or third can ready so this is what I'm going to show you how to do today we'll just do another clear one what we're seeing in here is the down spout with four or five percolator holes and the ball on the top I've already popped this one out so without further ado let's get me one of these shall we now if you missed last episode if we have time I'll do another bubbler the first initial bubbler can because pushing that bowl in is is pretty crucial knowledge I'm trying to pass on the bubbler torch here all you have newbies and veterans ice blowers out there I've made enough bumpers y'all got y'all gotta picked up the slack here the imported glass just love making those bubbler scores okay so the first thing we'll do is you know maybe what I'll do is I just take that step back I think I will make just a really quick clear bulgur can and we can always turn that into a quick double bummer let's turn on some ventilation I love you miss the beer they don't want it gas yeah there we go and the lighting all right she knows so was everyone doing it there in the internet world almost curious to know where you're from while you're watching the show feel free to chime in on the chat now I also want to know what are you smoking flowers shatter oil what strain Chloe's in the chatroom around 4:30 so there's pulling a point heating up that bit of glass pulled it out into the neck handle that I'll use and I might as well just last thing I want to do here is palpable alright thirsty work thirsty work this is a delicious beer I'm not usually into the fruity beers but it's not really that fruity we're talking about just a hint of pineapple a grapefruit really nice hot snake chose here's here's a homemade beer glass always good to drink at your own work all right so got some tasty shatters this smoke today too some beer brothers screen cracked also godson blueberry whacks tasty tasty shower I would think man in the blueberry alright so I just punch it up nothing fancy here now I'm going to heat up just to the slightly left of center this side I'm going to juice that's the side where you would make the hourglass shape the narrow part you don't have to make that you don't have to heat up that part we can simply just skip over to the vault so now I'm heating up the base of the prep it's going to gather up an inch or two and glue a little ball up at the top pop the hole and drop it down Spode so any responses I'm always curious Ontario I'm sorry please bro just joking that's where I'm from awesome jeez I'm that cheese a little while alright so we got ourselves a little gather blow it's going to rip off my fun team will do a little puff up top there excuse that I like this hourglass shape feel free to pick your own shape of the pan of the vessel lungs it's got a down scope going down dipped into the water all right that's enough feet using clear glass probably need to get there we go that's all I need it's palpable in the end I've got a downspout ready in the film we'll have to make another one later in the show so crapped up one so we just need to clearly see if it's got any it's not a little bit of a high so I'll just take a second just like alright nothing basically the pan right there just a clear vessel ready for the downs both here's the important part this but I'm only enough to pay attention now jamming spell which has a flared end on it and we're going to drop that right no it's about that deep right now after I push the ball to the nouveau fatty so that's built the nest make sure your downspout is the right place it's too short it won't skip into the water and it won't work all right now as I mentioned on the last step so it's a really great idea to break this down spell especially while you're learning you just shove up to middle brace all good median see I'm gonna skip that step just feet up there's a wait at the connection where I put that down spell and what a beautiful the whole slowly shrink here goes damn right at that boy woman I'm gonna push that Boulder the last thing you need to do is just double-check that your ball hole is the right size you want it to be about um between two and three three millimeters by the little art so I'm doing this in the bottom of the bowl curb the string get your dreamer ready but number two are really important those wires here we go back so now we've got an SEO Butler boom another thing that's an important to have your full flush the right shape this one's blocked a bit worn but not-it's tapered into into a point at the end not such a snubnose as some of these guys that actually is pretty good that way you can it comes to a nice point when the last thing you can do is pre-warm a little tungsten pick in case you got the wall and it will be ready for the next camp or if you were making a symbol hmm oh yeah you ready so oh I didn't bulge it with my car I usually hear that before I pop that hole then you can always do it after know that inside there so let's get that in the gym that's my board and when it does need an adjustment because it's brand new there's simply just four bolts right here or nuts that you tighten and they're a lock lock nut so there's the slugs little to okay do that later so uh safe to pray I don't have a little job here see what I got let's see what I got I've got some extraction samples yet to try a couple of really good ones in there and go to say and not it will also say a couple of really shitty ones but the one was a rosin yeah it was a great district oh nice thank you candidates come on April 18 so let's have a little bit some wildberry shatter big thanks to kind selections if you're a registered Canadian patient for medical marijuana you can order this as well you do have options you don't have to go to the licensed producers I love great all right hold it my fingers too long No Yuni I thought I saw a pair of my dad 20 sometimes the air is just a piece of is like piece of resin like when you snap it sometimes so uh just got my work in red here here's a little bit of a reducing plain I don't bury shattered I also broke my dome so I just scratch and snapped a piece of tubing here it doesn't even eat them female joint really works just perfectly shop bubbler that's tasty you gotta love it when you do things right the first time all right what's next well we wanna make the second can for that double bubbler so let's get started that's pretty straightforward we're just gonna need a small blank for the base of the hand think I'll cut it right about there we'll just lower into the plan oh ho hey bump that time at that pre-roll great great since week two strain this pullouts I could you still get a green light for so long disappear yeah urban streaming so I'm just gonna chat I'm a big boy so I'm sure you can hear me hey I wanted to talk to you all about the great comedian boss gathering and we're

always lots of fun prizes giveaways I hate them there's one last year okay so these double bubblers are actually really easy let me show you how easy right now I just opened up the end of this breath this plan just make sure it's a nice round hole use one of your roofers to make sure that I didn't change the shape of it all again that's it it's all I'm gonna do right now now I'm going to take piece of that 12 mil blow to toe and I guess I need another small ball of I usually like to use the ends of my tubing's for that I put these on right here I've got a couple you see that I'm gonna attach the 12 mil blowpipe to this little blank welded on the end around fall maybe I'll use that now if the end is all jagged on this song just quickly swipe go to you know it even you took off the extra yeah super well Ilana this too take this handle off it so sure it's a knuckle burner get rid of that [ __ ] up a little better and look all right so now what we want to do is will this feel that rounder and a twelve by twelve mill handle all I need is my ground ball on the end of this is there a what Oh No it's very lag on the screen maybe the chat can tell me if we've been lying and we've got a yellow light it's been funny in slow you can scroll along the bottom of the laptop to see if any of those and the other thing you would be run upstairs and tell those kids so what is the chat say are we lagging oh good so I just our little poultry and which could take the tiniest bit off the end of this table so called too large that's a loud bang different hand already all right so this

a second right now I gotta be Dennis the people's right here in the percolator so here's where maybe it's good idea to grab this piece we need to measure Oh need to be or you can just go what I usually do is blow the smallest Maria just the work now I'll pop a few holes right there [Music] it's too long then they go put four around it oh yeah I forgot to tell y'all what I'm doing with this piece and the bubbler from the last piece I'm going to slap a coalition logo on it I'm going to auction it off to the highest bidder donate every single penny of that to the coalition and oh in Smith's cookie case because ready to so if you're interested in it classic bubbler triple or double bubbler main logo [ __ ] stay tuned we'll have that auction coming up in just a week or two I think about a week today so they just popped that eye ball kind of using the we call that the cherry bomb technique for picking now we've got several little holes our and I've got a hole in the end and now we are ready slide this right into there and now but I also see I think all open this whole up that can be a little wider God will let this go a little deeper at first so this bigger PSB then also got a sweet little location thank you hey goober check it out all gravy all right Ruby : ow nice Blair and now slide this in and now I'm gonna keep that right where it means there it's gonna get soft and in there that's we're gonna weld it right there [Music] I can increase my plan seal now I'm just going to work in this well so I get it smooth keep pouring the heat into it until it is smooth now that downspout is going to get a little bit floppy here Motors I just keep turning fairly regularly regular as I can to be just fine so far that's barely even hit the side in that little cup the last thing we got to do is just make sure that that downspout sits straight so just pause there there we go that is second-hand my party bapak whole weekend they break it's time for safety way so okay your seatbacks there that didn't make it it's kind of not like them to know yeah I've got I see Oh Pinto in fact we can get candies they let me go behind the counter Hondo each month look at these women you know the year okay so I just got a buckle here that's where it'll connect when I'm in production mode making the same thing over and over again I whipped went full jump the other hole opposite there because I know where it's gonna go or this model I'm not going to do that yet because this is a one-off maybe and the mouthpiece and never spot never know we're live on about to be sterilized it is great one down all right so here the counts ago now I've gone and that's one we will stack all these up like that you made the triple Butler of course do that we weren't on Quadra Island it's on shout out to my boys at Gibson's crew hope you guys doing well in Roger Ireland if you guys aren't familiar with Gibson's Glass Works you still it'd be we took over Facebook's who's doing a spring cleaning recently an accident sick sick brought some of it that's what we do versus all right so see what else we got well very shatter dee-licious my blueberry quacks we'll try that next got some white rhino and some green crap I was going for the green crack green crack is a strong push Oh a smoke this is courtesy of beard brothers concentrate these guys know what they're doing Award winners that's George it looks like a butterfly or a bowtie oh yeah the driver it's a beautiful neighborhood you can work it on the bus pretty much non-stop for the last couple weeks and let's do it I brought home another glass yes very just gave me she loves it at midday you love the new class it's such a rare bird pretty sir we'll keep it fix it up there really make love it but I'll tell you where I our International Harvester what a fact you'll twin coat body on top super [ __ ] rare Hey oh so we got some green crash beard brothers brothers of the beard oh wow that's it it could soup in my mouth that's so good not too hot well the nails completely dry whoo nothing like a big blob of 98 percent THC do okay so where were we who talked about their brothers so I just get Oh huh how does pigley this big camp let's set it down in front of me let's see which way is the red beard lean there's always a little bit red beard lean and Mark that spot with my thumb travel up and mark that spot with my eye law right there for three seconds and now it's still hot and glowing if you double-check it looks good that's where the top this amazing kills the cover net now between 1050 I know I'm good to go straight into the heat take one of my octet go beavers here and it's gonna open that switches phonetic carbon reamer yeah well there is no time like the present so let's stick this one to there now I made a smaller one on purpose so it would fit right in here the longer one I thought it's pretty long it kind of hits the camera here and I can't get I like it when the downspouts are parallel to each other that's why I made a shorter one it will fit right in there nicer we'll start with that a lot of dust on this piece wait that now he knew a good weld has been both sides the same temperature and that temperature is [ __ ] hot exactly [ __ ] on [ __ ] hot degrees stick it with sauna to the little pulling away is hungry right there from every angle what I'm gonna do is heat up here at the base of this can taking a nice simple clear bridge right there would be perfect so I'm going to take this little bit of that ain't no rod I don't know why it's like and I'm going to make a bridge from the can of the big the nerve to flash a little heat up here not so much to liquefy it but just enough to keep that previous World War the big pan [Music] inside that first small pan holiday I'll just take a second and heat this bridge up so it looks neat and tidy heating it up so it's a nice even race again it seemed a little bit of heat up here just a flash making sure it won't crack when we get back to it the network in the bottom of this there we go all right so see what I did there I got myself a phrase so now well that's slowly cooling off a bit of pinpointed I'll slowly work my way around this well what I'm working on right after I work on it I'm gonna hang it so it's downward event using gravity to pull this off glass we did a slightly larger way around I know that bridge is nice and solid now so not too worried about going too fast oh well take every direction north south east west thunder thing get the glass the SAG in every direction the other way [Music] below me here because I am on a glass on glass handle years done pretty rough one to start with the lumpy well to start but but okay eat it up enough all right so now this before we send it in the till I reach in over here 31 and see where I want to put it just off to the side like this like and not too long it will dip pass at the bottom of it right there on the side of it tough clothes but go out here the fun is just gonna get like kind of awkward go ahead pop that hole before this is clear glass so not to worry about it I was just working an inch away another reason go ahead do this spot prep for the world they kill I really I do four minutes or so that's a good time for another state so we should we try next so I'm gonna go right through the that green crack was delicious I'm gonna try the white rhino spectacular ready double dad got a runny nose from the first day is fun well medicated sore I like my good man Opeth you can teach your Mondays on potty [Music] I just love this one Coolio but always use say the left side of my bank is recreational the right side of the missile and it really sums it up like I don't know how I can't add anything to that see that last one was man great big one I know I know you should be a warning light luckily oh and then he blows is torture Hey yeah you're sick tucked into that core well I won't translate you on the way it's very sick but it's it safety is definitely up there here is your glass I won't post the first safety first but it definitely is pretty top five top five the large injuries yet you want to hear about the one of the craziest things that ever happen in my shop viewers you want to hear about one of the no well I'm gonna tell you anyway just so you don't make this same mistake does like I've said before on the show this is a lesson about chaining up your oxygen tank I'll be right back so tiny my Dale wasn't too hot still smokin and a little bit wet okay so you always chain up your oxygen tanks this isn't a story about oxygen exactly it's a story about propane so the messages that really watch your where you put your propane you'll have to get tanked and blow up their oxygen tank anchor that fell over it could have been that or something heavy like this titanium grinder right so the tech fell over and at the time I had a propane tank with this regulator in the shop next to the opportunity which I have seen almost every glassblower do that I've ever been saying so please store your propane outside by dynamite over there outside nicely the tank fell over hit this regulator on the and knock the regulator clean off broke the bell and I looked over I heard the crash and there they white Wow through pain about this big and in the shop with torches lit and kills on so we I know Cobain everyone turn of Georgians of Ladakh and others just the other charges and I casted sit outside who lives here propane outside you're good you learn from mistakes and now you can learn yeah you don't want it woman across the glass tea legislation so it just it did exactly what ventilation let's do it just kind of went on its way there and luckily I don't even think we turn to kill so we all I'll say the same shot where those craziest things about you thought I was in math left and they and instead of making fights holy [ __ ] The ministers look around for bags of wheat because there's like you know more than 12 cops company my back and they came into the door and it looks so confused here like this isn't about life at this thing no just blowing glass and then we turned off stuff whatever Tom nice my yet all the neighbors complained on so they didn't like my odor they call the cops I think we're safe now thanks for that was when my shop was in Kerrisdale in Vancouver wrong neighborhood put a heavy I learned my lesson their medicine you gotta learn these lessons carousels are really so we have to care now we make three cats double turbo bubbler status oh this Miami will just speed it up both sides of this well at the same time again this hole is a bit bigger so I'll give it more meat and allow it to shrink this one here do that let's get more of the heat was on its way down one hot massage a little an upload super I want to kind of kept in close here and you can always give them I'm gonna give that well just a little more heat just give myself a bit more action action meeting I'm gonna take and over this way in closer oh yeah triple bubbler okay so it's straight but it all lined up now let's take off this low dude so you see some of these complex pieces is no more than a bunch of simple pieces all attached together truly I mean this piece is now approaching difficult and complex but each component is not in my opinion so let that be a lesson to you as well if you're making simple pieces right now as a glassblower well try sticking four of those together or something the shapes of them know what different directions get creative get organic in the world so here's the second bridge whoo I think so and now just pinpoint this for a sec let's flash just a little eat up here again focus on my bridge these will be auctioned off for the coalition and Owens hopefully raise it good money this is a Hyneman alright that looks pretty good [Music] even bridge there yeah as well in this blog and start there pointed up I just adjusted to a nice have to do an episode about that what all these their dogs do that's what I call it triple offs you know so now I know that bridge is hard but now I can really heat up this well and only the well going to be careful about the backlash of my this is where our little hands are you feel awesome look at my club dinner now I had a pinhole oh the tips are already tipped at what and I saw spectator came up and heater blast tip me off for this myth mom Oh they come well the old tables my dream beer hands down on balance a lot you know the shop back this week that's a good program maintenance tip every year or so more often if you're in here the vibration but good hit the shop back your inline fan work maintenance and you're circulating fans watch this ground Daioh from wall fans there we gotta trip off bubbler so now the smoke the next stems don't come off the bottom of this one while the lower half of this one so I might just tuck it into the side here and come up like that might be nice pretty good we're back if I want to try the like Cole Harbour brewing company kings of websites then a lot of awesome food we go games night karaoke night it's Saturday is mighty karaoke night and I've got a buddy that's comedy gold right there my guy I can't ever accent there's a one fella particular he's good but at the same time you just can't help it has point Oh leader yeah so let's talk no Jim Columbus fundraising work case Court case has gone to deliberation or closing arguments are done we are now go back we're going to do with our Gardens No Wow and then whatever happens 400 or leave so he proves you if you're able you're watching this show you guys the vents to stack throw it through the pool this throw the old Smith's case it causes real good medicine who needs real good so we thanks to the legal team all right so just gonna make the top here straight away all that Pizza well I'm sorry is black I just got to get this off on Oh eight-point oh boy we're listening I am NOT going to a cover band to the upper class the fun thing about dojin the glass guys for that reggae beat funky bin to a five-piece bluegrass band crazy mountain ranges and we've got the tall brothers through a trio or quartet this here the kind of jam along side and the grass side will rocks is really good crippled guy all right so for the top but that will do a similar talk like that for expediency I think I might even just skip the old but you know what is upon the beginner this handle student well bill at the very end yeah all right Cole Harbour all right so I'm going to heat up the middle of this bleh I'm just gonna stretch it out and give myself a bit of a nest shape or of a seat shape but yes it doesn't need to be a massively long talk I like about data so further adue the top [Music] they don't need you to get a real gentle curve just look that eats it her too soon and it doesn't hold itself on that curve to soften it so it doesn't have to be crazy angle okay perfect so let's take off this handle we don't need it anymore the punty what's heaping on you know the bottom of this just a round it off I made enough I think I'll be putting a brace there or in fact the brace might be off of this now let's pull this out we're a palpable right hand side this all right so we got the whole maid on the right-hand side bring this one out at all side have it yeah I just think it was the last time I made a triple Butler no long time and note the direct inject folks so you boil hexton and not the triple bubbler okay well let's go for it there is no tomorrow get to work Wow I am shot right through the piece enough about Peter so we get that side on this side on this side is bigger give it more heat out funny shot at this I'm a slow learner did it's nice all right here we go yeah lining it up with this piece too all right looks good let's get a brace on this we're grace I just wanted now tangent to and on my left hand you're going to be pretty quick about this like a lot of things in glass the whole piece is slowly we're gonna get a glass you eat into this rats I'm so good whoo okay as heavy well for the arm and the way of the camera all right we got her here that's the last you can just see this little lion it's a ridge inside the glass that's what with well since I've got it on this handle what I can do is just remove this doesn't need a car because it just so I heat it up the weld the brace and the mouth get brave of that grace moisture in this [ __ ] scared man Kurt but it's cracking tense moments your books I can actually pop through this this voila Tiffany that's French for it's done and I'm done there we have a triple bubbler on the handle here Oh better get that into the field this first pretty much yeah pretty much cool to the touch so the ESPYs in power awesome tune in now let's just finish the Beast ESB yeah we're auctioning this one off for the coalition and Owen Smith we're gonna split it down the middle I hope we raise a lot of money put some blood sweat cago blood sweat on this one oh dear yeah we're not done yet Haley I didn't we are actually done the show Oh and to this PSB did they give away the seats at 4:30 do they want to do it down do they want to just wait till next week I await your instructions Oh VSB sometimes Oh Lord DSP takes moments to speak to me so so just await his instructions because we're pretty much done here I'll pull up the piece again here and because it's on a handy handle and before I do blueberry whacks I heard that very mountainous house got some flowers in the mail thank you very much I've got a case of chili upstairs from remember that I'm not exactly scared but yeah I am approaching with caution it's very strong back certain prescription so this is blueberry wax now they always have from fine selections they always label it and leave key whether it's wax or shatter this is oven perch and it's kind of crumbly so it's a little difficult to show of the camera we'll just kind of hold it up there but that's just it the texture is kind of crumbly it's a beautiful color it's like a honey and it smells lovely it smells like blueberries so well this is our part is down today my sponsors again without your help I wouldn't be where now that's for sure maybe outside sitting inside I really enjoy the sponsorships I really enjoy the show it's kind of the highlight of my week it's an upward not today so

that sponsors thank you to the viewers Thank You Paula TV world I'll see you next week big red button I love the next step", "LRzG13CoTRA": "you guys my name is Joey I'm here at discount vape pen and today we're gonna show you different methods to clean your wax coils [Music] so guys this is actually one of my favorite things to do is rejuvenate old coils so I got pretty gunky super gunky pretty gunky and another super gunky so i'm gonna show you two methods today one is going to be using with alcohol and salt and the other better is gonna be using formula for 20 which is a formula like liquid it's meant to be cleaned clean use these types of devices so the reason why we're doing this is these things do get expensive and you don't want to keep paying for them so doing this does long jet make the life long to last longer honestly so we're gonna use this little ghetto cup that we have today and I'm gonna show you how to do this so he's gonna toss them right inside we're gonna put this inside over here pour your alcohol inside the cup and then we're gonna do is you won't pour salt right into it as well okay so I poured in the alcohol and now we're gonna pour in this salt and I like to do it almost like an equal amount this sauce times that used up a bit but yeah let's go around like maybe like a 60/40 40 on the sauce 60 on the alcohol and all you're gonna do now is you're just basically gonna swish it around to make sure it gets in there right right up in there and this is the slow method but I believe it's obviously clean this method there is but you want to let it sit overnight once the lettuce sit overnight take a paper towel you know dry out the spots they need to dry up and that's about it and they'll become ill come out like new so guys spend 15 minutes since I let it soak up and now I actually tile dry a little bit dab it up and you notice it is cleaner than it was before and no it still pretty yellow but that's after only 15 minutes best thing to do is I should leave it overnight but if you don't have some time you know in your hands you can do it like it within 15 minutes and get a good you know clean enough coil for your wax product now this is my favorite method because it is instant what you're gonna use this formula for 20 which we actually do have here at the shop amazing product you definitely know about it you knows little baggy pivot towel and you two dirty old coils which we're gonna clean up so take a good look at them because in a few minutes they all look clean so these two cords they do come out of the Reg edition from this thing this thing rips things is amazing I love that device there's the lava quartz coil and there's a ceramic rod coil both great flavor beautiful hit but it's also slightly expensive so that's why are we gonna do this instead of buying more coils you can you know make it last a bit longer by cleaning them but you will eventually have to buy new coils so you want wrap both heads right in there and then uncap your phone for 20 beats brand new and take off the little seal give it a good shake and then square it right in there if you notice this actually has some type of crystals inside the water itself that's one's gonna help it to clean so zip it up and I just do is I like to give it like a good fold hold like that and shake guys remember to check wait shake weight let's call the vape weight this will get messy hence the paper towel alright guys so we give it a good shake if you notice on the bottle it does says only one minute but of course I'm not gonna believe them because you know stay woke so I did two minutes soak with a little bit of scrubbing and it's gonna come out great so all I need right now is some water thank you my kind of assistant so we're gonna do is go and take this I'm gonna take them out remember you guys this is a bit dirty let me look inside there you know notice all the blue crystal and the liquid still in there so that's why you need the water just shake it clean now I'm an advocate I always like to let things sit for overnight just because I want the extra cleaning this especially on a ceramic oil because it is porous the quartz I'm not wearing much about that but from that we solved from before you go retail right there you want to zoom and you're gonna notice the whiteness and the bras are actually getting whiter and cleaner it is still pretty some salt in there still now I'm doing the next core of the lava quartz a lot of course is actually quite amazing because is the instant ramp up good flavor but the ceramic I feel like it is a bit more efficient as in ill not use up all your actual product give it like a little mini mini review on the coils while I'm cleaning them so dry them up real quick and he knows this was kind of hard to see because it is lava it's like painted red in there but that one is much cleaner than it was before and all you got you can see some shininess in there but this is how you rejuvenate your coils so guys today I show you a couple of different methods on how I clean your old dirty coils I gave you the tools it's up to you to build a house with it now like this was a quick you know video but like I said earlier I do like to let these soak and of course you always could take the extra step take get a q-tip get some rags getting those little nooks and crannies get like every single thing clean and I'll me personally I like to get my card detail so I might as well get my vape detail hopefully you enjoyed the video today it was fun it's you know very hands-on like felt like you know Bill Nye the Science Guy but we answer all your questions and we didn't drop it down instruction comment section below and remember we do have all these coils in our store and our website which is discount vape n calm [Music] [Applause] you", "ytMWKV2RDZY": "yo what's going on everyone it is your boy max Sergio and today people today what I have for you guys is we're finally going to be doing another product review I'm sorry I didn't mean to keep you waiting I've been busy work gotta get that money you know it feels great to be able to say that and just say that I am back be expecting a lot more videos I've been both recording a lot of videos as of lately just got to get them all edited down and whatnot today what we are going to review is I have or wax made they sent me this cool silicone bong I got it all broken up right now these are all the pieces that it came with and then they also did send me two bowls which I really like I got this one packed up already the thing that I really like about this bowl let me show you on camera is like it is a little bit hard to get out but I'll show you guys as soon as I take a rip of this but it's like a waffle cone bowl if you guys don't know what that is it's pretty much just like there's little slits in the bottom of the bowl just so that I mean when you snap it I mean your guess you're really not pulling it all the way through but you're burning all your weed and or your smoky product whatever you're putting in there not smoking any weed right now taking a tea break you know your boy needs to take a break I did come back a little bit I did a live stream which was super super lit we smoked and had a great time and then you know of course on snapchat but I'm taking a little break from that just smoking on this little smoke blend let's see it's literally all just herbal flowers you know and stuff like that that's all in this my sister actually got me this when she was in Hawaii so thank you so much and this stuff works so incredibly well enough of that enough of that let's get some ribs and let's see how this works so this is my first impressions I mean I haven't used it at all the most I've done with it is just filled it up with water and see how it chugs so what I'm just gonna do right now is just fill it past the slits on the little down stem that it has here which is also removable gonna pour on the slits as well yeah that looks good that looks good super excited to be ripping on this guy's like it's so cool easy to clean you guys can just throw this in the dishwasher so I'll have the wax made link to where you guys can get these in the description below I also came with ice like this little titanium piece right here I mean I don't I don't think you can do dads off of it but I really don't know what this is for but it's cool-looking so maybe it's just like an extender you know or something like that I don't know and then we got the top piece and it just easily easily easily fits on right there so let's take a rip guys I definitely hope you're smoking along with me and let's see how this thing shows let's just see how the function works of warmers oh yeah yeah we got it choking we got it choking all right cheers guys one more look at it yeah that looks so badass all right let's get it Cheers [Music] oh-hoo you boy drooling [Music] yeah this thing hits I love that smell blend [ __ ] but goddamn it tastes like ass it tastes so damn bad I'll make a video about it going into depth about it I've really really enjoyed the smoke blend stuff while I'm on my tea breaks but anyway back to the bong so I really enjoy it one thing that I really don't like is how you really can't pull it out and then clear it all because of all these like slits there that just like four knots list but all these like grooves or whatever they're that really keep it packed in tight but I mean I guess that's why they sent me this other one so that I mean I can pull it in ripping and stuff this doesn't have the waffle cone you know it's just a slit going straight through yeah there we go see that let me get this one loaded up and just kind of see what one I like better really really do enjoy this bong it's super cool I really like it my kind of concerns about it is just gonna be like cleaning cuz I know you can at least throw this piece you know the bottom piece that comes apart into like the dishwasher you don't get it clean but what about this glass piece you guys let me know I mean do you think I can just throw it in the dishwasher as well or do I have to go with like the salt and the alcohol wait there's really no way on how to put salt and alcohol in there let me just take it apart real quick I need to show you guys this and then so let me dump the water out I love how I poured like no water out all right anyway I'm gonna just put my hand here so as you can see I mean you really can't put alcohol or salt in there there's just like a little slip for this thing to go in it so that's kind of a Kong in my eyes just because I really don't know how clean this but guys definitely let me know in the comment section below or on how I can clean this because this is like my first silicone bong and I ever used definitely bad X and I really really like it and enjoy it but I mean that's just kind of my main concern about it I really liked it that the detachable pieces as well you know that's super cool all right rip number two let's get it I'm not gonna put it in there super tight because I want to pull it so I think that looks good you know y'all like my shirt check out the Tokyo Google first season best season cheers guys let's get the second rip [Music] all right definitely needed more water facts this thing chugs it rips I really really do enjoy it once again wax made and thank you so much for sending me this piece I really do appreciate it so guys make sure to go check it out in the link what am I saying make sure to go check it out in the description below the link is going to be there thank you so much for tuning in I really do appreciate that [ __ ] stay in the clouds guys I'm out", "VlZVexqAtdY": "it's like our job any dessert it's this the way you teach the children not teaching them how to grow reaching nuclear missile a severe go on the we s of muscle [Music] ha [Music]", "lmBerNKeF8E": "hey what's up all you do it yourselfers my name is Dylan and this is Dylan's DIY workshop and today I'm gonna be showing you how to make a wooden smoking pipe you know about five minutes time depending on what tools you have now I'm gonna show you how to make this with a handsaw and a hand power drill you could I suppose do this with a crank drill where you're just using it all by hand and a coping saw like this so you could do it all with hand tools or you could do this with just power tools like this drill that I'm using or even a drill press and a power saw however I'm doing this in my basement where I only have these small hand tools it's all I'll be showing you how to do it there I have this one inch by one inch piece of walnut that is song on two sides and rough on the others it's not neatly sawn on any side but that's not really the point we're not making anything glamorous here we're only making something functional you need a very short amount of time so I'm just going to take my little tiny seat clamp here and I'm gonna clamp this to the tables so that it doesn't move around while we're working on it I'm explaining this as I go so it might take more than five minutes if I was just going ham I could probably get it done faster we're gonna find the center of this piece right here and to do that I'm just using the whole trick where you just mark the center like this I'm even going to carry that down to the end of the wood so that we know where to drill our hole then I'm gonna go ahead and make the bull hole and I want to make sure that I don't drill all the way down so what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to mark the drill bit with a piece of masking tape so we want to go to about there so we just put it at that point right there that's where we want it to stop is right there so now we've got it on the center and make sure it's a drill bit that's not way too big you want it to actually be functional [Music] and then we switch over to this bit right here which is a quarter-inch Brad point bit that's what I use for most of the Airways is a quarter I use a quarter-inch bit for most of the airways it just seems to work the best again you don't want to drill right through the bottom of the piece of wood so you might want to check that break it out to make sure that you didn't and we didn't see how there's that little tiny hole in the middle hopefully it's not too dark then we're gonna drill a hole down the length of it right here from the end into this hole following this center line that we already drew on here is really rough and faint but make sure that the bit that you're using is long enough to actually accomplish this you know what I'm saying like from the end of the piece of wood to actual Bowl and if it's not you could either get a longer bit where you could just figure something else out so to do this I'm actually gonna cut the pipe out first so that I can get the piece the right length right now this piece of walnut is just way too long so I'm using this coping saw and putting it right about here [Applause] so here we have the rough pipe and I should have done into this piece of wood I feel stupid now it's gonna make a walking stick out of this now it's there - no the right height for walking stick I can use that perfect future video just for anyone who actually okay so from this point what we need to do is drill that hole so I'm going to clamp it with the little baby C clamp this way now that I've got it clamped that way I'm going to clamp this clamp to the table yo and making sure that this is dead straight [Music] so there you go goes in that hole and you can see the light coming through the top there so I kind of messed this one up a bit if you look down in the bowl the passage that goes through this way doesn't entirely line up with the hole down there and that's all just part of taking your time with this the longer you take obviously it'll work out I was trying to explain what I was doing while I was doing it so that happened now you can have a square flat bottom hole like that that you'd get from a Forstner bit or a spade bit but I've been told that whatever you're smoking ends up getting stuck in those corners which is not what you want apparently you can either use a cove bit or a cove router bit I've used a cold router bit in my drill before or the easiest thing you can do is get these pipe screens right here you can buy them from convenience stores anywhere that sells paraphernalia and look at this watch you put it in just like this and voila now the bottom of the bowl is rounded and whatever you're smoking is going to stay on there instead of going right into your lungs especially because of how short this pipe is now another thing you want is an air hole to clear this pathway right here and you can drill that right into the bottom of the bowl by going right in to the side right here now again you might want a smaller drill bit for that okay and now that you have it like this air flows freely through both ways you're perfectly good and done you can leave it rough that just depends on what kind of piece of wood you have actually I only have this piece of walnut with me you can do this with any kind of wood or even a tree branch if you really wanted to just gotta find a way to clamp it all I'm doing is getting rid of the harsh edges right here with a rasp file and the corners there is a wooden smoking pipe done right there to perfection what more could you ask for okay so this is a bonus step 100% this is only for style points and the way I'm gonna do this is I'm just going to take my razor tip wood burner with this bit that I call a shoe shaped bit just because it's round like that and I'm gonna put a pattern all the way along this okay so that is how you do it right there I think this is actually a pretty cool project to be completely honest I really do like things like this just small quick projects that you can make look cool I don't know I just kind of like little objects that's why I like I don't know that's why I have a little table over there all the small things that I made I just think it's really cool to say you know I made this and that's kind of the purpose behind this you guys can say that you made this so right here that is a pipe that you can make in five minutes it only took me about three minutes to actually would burn this on here so maybe I could have made the pipe in five minutes maybe not the base pipe 100% I could make that in five minutes but wood burning that's a little bit extra but you know like it sometimes it just takes that little bit extra to make it your own alright guys thank you so much for watching this video if you enjoyed it and want to see more pipe videos there is a pipe video playlist in the description of this video you could check that out I've made all kinds of other pipes and water pipes and whatnot if that's not your thing I view all kinds of wood-burning tutorial videos and different kinds of videos where I've made lamps I've made a guitar just anything that I really want to make I will make and that's why I'm not really rough ain't refraining from putting pipes on this page too because I'm just making it it's not like I'm doing anything with that I honestly I honestly don't smoke I don't like the idea of smoking I don't I don't condone smoking I just love making things and I love teaching

today we'll be reviewing the PAX 3 stay tuned in the box we have the charging dock the actual PAX unit the cable for the dock you have your maintenance kit which includes a couple of bristles some cleaners you have your packing tool which is handy for packing unpacking what-have-you you have three replacement screens and you have three chamber caps two of which are for her full use one is for concentrates we'll get more into that in a bit let's take a closer look in the box guys now here you've got your actual magnetic charging dock has micro USB in the back I would utilize the cable that was included in the box you have your maintenance kit which includes a bristle a couple of pipe cleaners and a couple of replacement filters but let's get to the things that really matter okay guys let's get into it so here we have the actual unit up here you have the interchangeable mouthpiece you change it by doing so pop you right in and you got the new mouthpiece in at the bottom you have your chamber nice spacious a nice little filter in there ready to go now there's a couple of new chamber caps here we've got the half full chamber cap okay that's when you want to utilize a little less material but you still want to get that good airflow this one is a concentrated cap this one you utilize when you want to get your concentrates wax oil any of that stuff you pop it open up there and right in the middle is where you put your concentrate now let's get to using before we load this up with any halves let's take the time to get it to the right setting at the top of the unit you press ever so slightly and the unit will vibrate to indicate it's on now you're going to push down the power button to get at the temperature mode you got low medium high and super high to choose your temperature you're going to hold down the power button and the lights will start flashing purple indicating it's heating when it's green it's good to go let's turn it off for now and let's get to loading alright guys this is where the real fun starts I got my finally grown herbs here got my multi-tool and of course the tax three let's get it gonna pop open your chamber I have the cap cap gonna grab your hers finely-ground just kind of stuff them in there such tiny fingers you can't believe grab that stuff now keep in mind you have the half cap going so you don't really need to utilize that much material grab your multi-tool and just get the packing on and I'm gonna keep it at the highest temperature now that it's set to the highest setting let's take a rip I will say that's incredibly smooth you can barely feel it but it does have a nice after kick to it I can tell this is gonna hit alright guys I took a couple of hits had to take a bit of a water break if you will but let's empty this out and hit it again I'm using the tool it's kind of scraping these bad boys out now you can't really see cuz you're kind of far but every bit of material has been used up no smell no odor just Joey hey guys it's been about 35 minutes bottom line this thing's a great investment it's worth every penny it started to kick in at about seven minutes there's no smell no odor it's not even hot it's great if you ever get a chance pass by the shop pick one up from shop all day", "MQncqrdXCvg": "I'm very fine day to you folks I'm mcfinn from scientific inhalations the creator of mcfinn triple filter water pipe this water pipe brings you a cool cleaner tastier smoother inhalation let me explain why first of all we have a virgin coconut carbon filter tube virgin coconut carbon is a carbon that's developed from virgin coconut shells those shells are processed by being crushed then baked then put through a 2,000 degree steam activation process that process creates millions of microscopic spaces in each of the coconut carbon particles as the smoke passes through the coconut carbon the impurities and tars are captured in the microscopic air spaces from the coconut carbon the smoke then enters the water chamber the water chamber has four glass tubes in it with slits cut in them for creating hundreds of little bubbles that will cool and clean your smoke as it passes through the water chamber next your smoke will pass through our organic cotton glass filter organic is a very important word conventional cotton is processed with synthetic fertilizers and pesticides organic cotton is governed by the organic Association which inspects fields every three years to make sure that there are no chemicals being processed through those fields into your cotton that is organic cotton you would only want to breathe through organic cotton and si pipes we sell organic cotton and we sell virgin coconut carbon remember your health is your wealth that's our lead in life our health your

show y'all a couple things I made real quick first this is the reversed field move thing that a me and Jesse [ __ ] James we tend to use couple times but uh I got my new downstem diffuser in there and got a whole rose mall little slits that's in there because the little spirals that water will travel go ahead and rip it up for the first time I put this at a 90 degree so I can see the bow a little bit better at least still needs to be a little longer but oh well Wow hello thing packs a punch my other thing kind of get you a little bit this one really grabs you by the booboo but I'm gonna end up putting I don't perk in this so it'll smooth it out actually I'm going to put a don't park but you can see them slits right there in a faygo cap I'm going to have the smoke still come out of that autumn slits in the circle so I'm going to call it a a waffle circle perk or whatever yeah that was that's a little close I guess but couldn't rip this up camera got moved on me that's why I seven little bit of trouble that really grabs you by the booboo when you're smoking some of that og cush with strawberry cough I got just a couple little pinches left of it and bowed out of rags but if so i'll be having to get some more now go ahead and put a little more pinch and there hit it again hopefully don't let it grabbed me about a boo-boo too bad yeah I need to find a test tube so I can put a dome perk in this it's kind of funny because sometimes which right now the bows a little clogged you know I got a little bit of a too thick of a stem and there's my my screen as I've shown in a few videos but sometimes when my water splashes up its flashes all the way up here but it'll it'll set up air for a few minutes I've had it set up air flake 10 minutes or whatever and not come down and took out the bow thinking maybe that was because of some airflow my boat was clogged it wouldn't allow air to come out or something and what dream but I don't know I like using that big glass 24 plastic tube because I can see that smoke shoot up yeah my bows a little clogged up but I'll clean it get it working better hopefully end up getting some more but a diss comment rate subscribe let me know what you guys think and go check some of my guys out all the homemade heroes just things that i'm subscribed to go check them out see what you think but i'm gonna go grab something to eat and

to look at the differences between growing in soil and growing hydroponically we'll have the two systems set up beside each other and we'll be running through a full grow of chili plants from seed to harvest and looking at the setup the commissioning the running it right through the grow and the costs at the end though we got little seedlings here our chili seeds we've got Tokyo hot f1 and basket of fire and a sample of two of each of those is going to go into our grow tents and we're going to grow them all the way through to harvest and we're gonna run through as I said the pluses and minuses of each of the system first off is looking at the unboxing and particularly the or DWC system we got it in from alien it's the alien pro system so let's unbox it and have a look [Music] [Music] [Music] so starting off we have our optional reservoir so you can hold reserve water here which you can have a height and gravity feed using the green tube down into our mixing tank here and this has a float valve so we'll maintain the top an adjustable float valve as well so it'll maintain the top level of water in line with our other putts we'll keep that filled from a reservoir tank and we also have our pump and our pump actually sucks water through the main pipe down from the filter here so if we look from a high level damn it you'll see that there is a line coming from here in the center these pipes sucking it back into our header tank and that pulls the flow rate through the four inch pipes through the two sets of Tanks and back through the middle so just looking at that foreign system did so from a feed tank the water will flow through the four inch pipe to the tee and then go through these two sets here this is a large screw fitting so this goes through the tank and this clamps over to provide a seal so that comes right through around to the other side the pipes join together now we have this suction pipe sucking the flow of the liquid back to the mixed tank and you can isolate this filter if you need to change the filter you can do with that empty empty nester the only potentially tricky bit really were putting these two these systems together is you have to measure size up and cut your hoses the air hose side in order to fish the air stones for the four pots and to feed our line into the reservoir where we have the air infuser you start off with your air pump here and you got simple little connectors here that's a rubber hose fits on and these are the clips fit over the hose over the thing it's connected to and that just keeps them in place we've then got a tee piece here you know if you wet these when you're connecting the loop they will go on easier and form a better connection so in this case we're just gonna connect them up lightly one side of this tee piece is going to go into the reservoir tank and I'll show you two mixer tank and that's going to feed the air diffuser and then this section we are going to use to connect up our air stones which will go into each of these tanks so we've got a tee piece here now just connect up the larger pipe all the way to the end here and we put a stopper on the end so the what air doesn't fly at the end Mike and now we have four small connections along the length of the pipe for our four pipes and we need to feed or put our air stone into the tank first feed the wire our sorry feed the tube out of the tank and then fix onto here to make our connections so we'll show you those in the in situ and the tanks news and so we've got the air pump here I'll connect it up it's connected up to the green tube which has a t-piece hunge here we go into the mixing tank with the air diffuser inside so the area is going to feed in here and bubble up through the nutrient solution on the x-ray thank you you're the part of the T line comes down here and we have two small hoses connect as four of them and these come in through the pre-drilled holes and down into the Booker to the air stones and there's one of those in each time we set up the airline hose so now we've got to set up the incoming line we're going to look at the reservoir tank connection into the mixing tank and the connections then in and out of the mixing tank so the reservoir we haven't filled but for demonstration purposes we just have it there built up standing it would usually be obviously higher than your mixing tank so they can gravity feed it's got an isolation and Bob outlet so you can switch it off if you want to so medium sized hose comes down and connects up here we put a float valve which will control the flour flow in here when the water gets too high this will lift and shut that water supply off over here we have two pipes which were not going to be using in this setup they're chilling pipes you need to keep your nutrient solution around 18 to 20 degrees and in order to do that during the summer months you may need to chill them in certain environments we're not going to use these so they just stay over there redundant down in here we have the pump is fat by a bloke outside and sucks through here and will will the outlet from the pump will just back into the main chamber will be back up through here this is the large 4 inch outlet going it this way to go with Jill carrier nutrients out to your your growth your grow buckets pots and again we have the air diffuser which is connected up to our air pump so that's it for our mixing tank it's got a cover on it there put the cover on us instead of a mesh posh as a little cover lid here so that's it we've got the alien Pro system into a 5 by 5 grown tent now we're using the we're lighting it up with wo 600 here on the time frame we've got a 4-inch extractor fan running off a thermostat we've got a chip on fan here just to circulate the air and planet canopy that doesn't be primarily powered with the lights then we've got the you can see the lights here connected upon a timer or three drive drivers and for the or WC system we have tightened all the pipes up with our Andy - we have connected electrically our air pump which is going to be on permanently and our recirculate pump which is submersible in this header tank and that's going to be on permanently as well so no timers that's all ready to go this is our soil cell you see it's a lot simpler than or DWC so you cut here for pops for 18 liter puff system no soil in there yet obviously we've got a micro 400 grow light hanging above each the pot stand is being fed by a drip feeder and that drip feeder those individual lines are coming off our main line which is being fed from our header tank with a submersible pump finish that submersible pump is going to be connected up to a timer of the pulsing water feed to the to the pups are extractor fans going to be on the thermostatic control so we'll switch on when the temperature gets too high or an increased speed when the temperature gets too high now we've got our lights there our two drivers for my go 400 sitting there and they'll be on a lighting timer - well you can you can see it's a hella lot more simpler than the or dwc system certainty - to set up to buy it's going to be really interesting to see the advantages and disadvantages are comparing the pretty much the most basic system you can have in terms of this soil system with one of the best sort of most high-end hydroponic systems available today with the alien or DW sisa so please stay tuned we're gonna have commissioning coming up in our next video and we'll be looking at mixing your nutrients and our soil and getting both sides set up thanks again for watching please subscribe take care", "i3-9u-HtFG8": "Hi guys, this is Kevin from xPonics\nhere with a deep water culture tutorial. I wanted to make this video to describe\none of my favorite ways to grow hydroponically and also just happens to\nbe the simplest, cheapest way to do it. So if you're a beginner, you're\nkind of curious about hydroponics, you want to know what's up with it.\nThis is a good way to get started. So let's take a look at\nwhat we're going to need. The first thing we need is a nutrient\nreservoir, which houses our nutrients, houses the water, and also has the\nplants' roots suspended in that water. I tend to get mine from Home Depot or\nLowe's because you can get sizes ranging from 15 quarts up to around 20 gallons, which is more than enough for almost\nanything that you need at home. I would recommend probably the Rubbermaid\nbrand or the Sterilite brand as your best bets for durability. Now the next thing we need is\nour nutrients and our water. Let's just assume for time sake\nthat we've properly pHed the water. We have added the correct\namount of nutrients and\neverything's good to go as far as our nutrient solution, and I\nwill cover that in another tutorial. But for now, let's just assume that\nthis is already complete. All right, so if we were to place a plant\nin this right now, it'd do okay, but as time went on, it would start to suck oxygen out of the\nwater because the roots need oxygen to survive. In time, it would run the water\ncompletely out or sorry, it would suck up all the oxygen and the\nwater would not be suitable for plant life anymore. So what we need to do is\nadd an air pump and you can buy these at Petco, an aquarium store\nor anything like that. They're very cheap and I'd recommend\njust buying the cheapest one you can find because even the cheapest one is more\nthan enough for what we need it for. Now the next thing you're going to\nneed is something to spread that air throughout your nutrient solution. And\nwhat we use for that is an air stone. They again are found at your\nPetco or your aquarium store. And they come in either 12 inch long\nlines or these three inch diameter disks. And you can buy either, it doesn't really matter what you buy\nas long as it's spreading enough oxygen and air throughout your nutrient solution. Now the last part of that equation is\ngoing to be the line that connects the two and it seems simple, but there's a\ncouple things to think about here. The first thing you want to think about\nis getting one eighth inch airline tubing. Make sure it's airline because\nthen it's bendable enough to have to, so it can navigate through\nyour little system. Now the next thing to think\nabout is that it is opaque. It needs to be opaque because if\na light is hitting a clear tube, you're going to get some algae growth in\nthere and it's just really going to be a hassle to clean out. And just avoid\nit altogether by getting an opaque tube. Okay, so we have our growing media\nas our next thing to consider. Now I would say for anyone\nstarting out to buy Hydroton, and what Hydroton is, is\nit's an expanded clay pellet. It's kind of brown and it\nhas some black specks on it. It is by far the best growing media\nto start out with because it's inert, meaning it's pH neutral, so it won't\nmess your nutrient solution up at all. It is reusable and it's inexpensive. So if you can't find that locally, you can always order it off Amazon or any\nhydroponic store online will have that for you. The next thing you have to think about\nis what you're putting your Hydroton into. And for that, I recommend\nsomething called net pots. Net pots basically look\nlike a cup that has, excuse me, a bunch of\nholes kind of cut into it. It creates a mesh. And what that mesh allows your plant\nto do is have a strong and robust root system. If you were to have a normal cup, which has some holes\ndrilled in the bottom, there'd only be one direction for your\nplants' roots to grow. But with net pots, you can actually have roots spreading\nout from all different areas of your net pot, which is really great, and it\npromotes a vigorous root system. So now that we have our entire system\nbuilt, we have our growing media selected, the next thing we need to think about\nis how to get our plants in this system. So for that we'll take a top\ndown look at this system. These two black holes that you're seeing\nare drilled in or cut in to the surface of your tote. I tend to\nuse a hole saw for this, but you can just cut it out with scissors\nif you don't feel like buying that bit because it is kind of expensive. The next thing you're going to have to\ndo is drop the Hydroton into the net pots, put your little seedling in as well, and then plop that into your system.\nAnd when it's all said and done, it looks something like this. Now this is the beauty\nof deep water culture. All you have to do is grab a couple\ningredients from Home Depot and Petco and you can have this system\nthat produces really healthy, really vibrant plants for a long, long time and it doesn't really\neven take too much effort. The only thing you need to worry about\nis changing the water every month or so. And in the meantime, making sure\nthat the water level stays constant. So you just have some mixed nutrients\nwaiting and as you see it drop, the best thing to do is just pour a\nlittle bit extra in and you're good to go. So that's the basics of deep water\nculture. If you want a cost breakdown, I've put a rough one here and you know\nthis is going to change depending on what kind of materials you decide to use. If you want to use party cups\nand cut some slits in them, you can substitute that out for net pots. If you want to use a\ndifferent grow medium, you might save some money and you might\nalready have a reservoir at your house. But that's the basics of deep water\nculture. If you have any questions, leave them in the comments.\nAnd in the video description, I've also linked to a more in depth\ntutorial on how to build your very own hydroponic herb garden. So\ncheck that out if you want to. And also subscribe and Like the video\nif you liked it. And if you didn't, leave a comment and maybe I can help\nyou out. This is Kevin from xPonics.

checked everywhere and this is the best piece that I've found for my budget I have many pieces but so far one of my favorites double chambers for arms each check that out nice Bowl 14 millimeter 18 and fifth and that as well I took a few hits from this and honestly I could I could say that this is really smooth one of the best ice chambers as well I haven't used those but for this price and free shipping I would definitely buy from then again I give them a plus this is a great it's about 15 inches tall but it rips I was like that", "F7WiolAV6Mg": "[Music]", "cEMlv8lhl6w": "how's it going sitting here in my kitchen getting ready to clean out my double fretted bong it's actually kind of a complicated one because it's got a couple of fretted discs if you don't know what fretted discs are they're actually these this that are compiled with small fragments of glass that they call frits this allows for just a minimum allow the minimum allowance of smoke or air to travel through those frits causes a really good pure percolation so it's kind of hard to clean just because those frits get clogged up with resins so that's going to be our biggest challenge but anyways we're gonna be using my basic kit which is consistent of rubbing alcohol over 90% latex gloves q-tips always have to have q-tips bobby pin paper towels and of course scissors and iodized salt prefer sea salt it works better but iodized salt works just fine but this is my baby this is the fretted disc I went ahead and priest submerged her and that the rubbing alcohol filled up all the way to that extent and we're gonna go ahead and give a little bit more time to soak in there and penetrate into the resins and then we'll go ahead and see if we can't clean her out real good all right we're back now with the fretted this I went ahead and let it sit for an hour you can see it's really murky looking in there all that alcohol you can tell is just sitting there breaking down all the resins that are making this thing hard to hit I'm gonna go ahead and add some salt in here really good abrasive and kind of lucrative with it I always recommend putting as much as you can there's really cheap and I mean it's not hard to get more salt so I'll be sparing with it be sharing alright and the same goes with this is any bubbly we're just gonna go and shake it around get this salt up here mixed in with alcohol good add a little bit more at the top just shake it up real good and I already see a lot of that residue is gone you know it just it works so fast real simple man shaking it up shake it up baby shake it up real simple process super effective look at that just look at it just stripping it down I mean these things are really complicated to clean and to maintain but man as if well worth it the stuff percolates fretted this percolates it it almost doesn't look like it's percolating it looks more like it's foaming the water up it's so percolated it's it's impressive actually didn't take too much having it sit and see majority of that stuff gone but I'm gonna sit here and shake it up for a good few minutes and then we'll be back with the next step alright I'd say I'm satisfied with the amount of cleanse that's we got this so we're gonna go ahead and work on the next piece the downstem again this is where all the q-tips are really coming to play are the most useful tools you can use I'm gonna do is well the alcohol would actually sit in this down stem just because of the design it's an inline down stem built with the bong you know so this is the technique that I have integrated to use for this particular style it's really uh going around and again scrubbing on all the residue using the alcohol to help strip it down I need to be real careful around here and then get it to care not too meticulous just because now if you can see if there's a crack that runs right here over to this side over here and I don't feel like breaking that that's happens to be a very useful piece very functional makes everything just hit so smooth so so this is on the outside some on the inside but you get the point it's pretty clean already so then move on to the next step of the process I'm going to shake it up one more time going right through the top there really just process or renting it out get it nice and clean and the biggest thing putting the pressure through the top here actually allows for more filtration through the Brits of their it actually helps cleanse that up and rinse it off with it see it kind of forces the water through those Fritz downwards not so quickly as if you were with a straight shooter but you can see the the water level is coming up out of this down stance so this rinsing process for fruited this guy recommend taking your time more than a difficult piece typical straight shooter doesn't have those Brits or you know such delicate circulation points as Freddie discharge you know but this I actually recommend sitting here and just rinsing is very good ten minutes I'm just let it ruin just like that and we'll be back whenever I feel about its ready to start the next day alright so it's been a good I'd say about five eight minutes somewhere around there you can see the majority of the way clean I would have to say it's definitely sufficient for operation so then go ahead and fill their up with some water all right just a little shy on the water level that's how it functions when she's nice and clean thanks for joining me on cleaning this fretted bong I'm Dani Koosh we'll see you next time when you have a dirty piece

"3V_EIBk_MwY": "What's up guys, Matt from VapeFuse here. Back\nagain and helping to keep you up-to-date with the latest and greatest in herb\nvaping news and technology. Now, we recently copped a bunch of awesome new\nwax products from Airis Tech and I've had a heap of fun testing them out and\nfinding out what they're all about. Now, wax vapes are a phenomenon that has\ntaken off in recent years. I mean it was only 10 years ago that we were hitting\nvapes of concentrates through hot knives and even more modern contraptions\nlike quartz bangers, are only a pretty recent invention. Now in the past 3 to 5\nyears, I've seen a bunch of new wax products hit the market, but little have\nimpressed me as much as this new Head banger from Airis Tech. Now the Head\nbanger is the second release in their line of quartz cell atomizer vaporizers\nand this one in particular is impressive, because it comes with two vaping\nfunctions. So aside from the traditional sort of a chamber little atomizer coil\nsolution to vaping your dabs, it's also got this little necklace thick on the\nbottom which is encased in a ceramic casing but some quartz crystal sort of\nlike a dusting on the outside and so you use that just like you would a\ntraditional nectar collector. You just pop off this little cap, make sure that\nit's screwed into the battery, press down the button for a couple of seconds to\nget the heat, you just sort of pipe it across your sheet of concentrate. Now, the\ndual functionality, means that you can't use both of atomizers at the same time,\nif you're going to be looking to sort of get the most out of your battery and at\nthe device. So, if we're using the nectar collector atomizer, you have him screwed\ninto the bottom and you got to take out this little cap atomizer in the middle.\nSo, I'll break down the device a little bit first before we try it out and hit\nsome dabs. So, in the bottom of the device, just where the nectar collector would\nusually be stored, it's actually got this little glass cap with a silicone lid, so\nwith that you can store your dabs, just up to a gram of dabs in there and as\nusing the nectar collector, you just pop the little silicon cap off, dip it in so\nvape to the extent that you want and then just pop them away again. So it\ncomes with a second one of those little caps. So even if you want you can load up\na couple concentrates at a time, hit the road, don't have to worry about\nbringing your whole dabbing kit and silicone mat with you now. If I was going\nto use just the regular dab pen function and click up this little aqua bubbler\nhere, which is spilled proof and can be filled from the top and unscrew my\nlittle cell atomizer in the middle or you can also load and screw them, I\nprefer to take it off, it's a little bit easier to load dabs. So, it looks pretty\nmuch just like a traditional sort of cup atomizer, it's got a quartz wall and then\nit's got these quartz crystals, on the inside. So that's already gloved up a\nlittle bit, but the quartz is a lot more effective I find and atomizing the\nconcentrates and say titanium or ceramic and it doesn't affect the flavor\nanywhere near as much. We've seen a few of these quartz atomizers come in\nrecently and I'm sort of really enjoying the, the way that they atomized the\nconcentrates. So, if I'm going to use it, just in like the general wax pen\nfunction, I load up a little bit of concentrate like I have, screw it back\ninto the device, so that the threading is just linked in with the battery and I\npop this little atomizer.... little aqua bubbler back on top and you\ncan either hit it, one or two ways, if you want to just use it sort of like a\ncompact vaporizer, you can hit it as it is or if you want to restrict that air\nflow a little bit, you just pop the magnetic cap on the bottom, so turn\nthe device on, it's five clicks, as with any traditional sort of\ndisposable wax pen or concentrate vape and this one comes with three voltage\nsettings, so you just tap it three times to choose your voltage, so it's got green\nwhich is the lowest and then blue, which is sort of the mid-range and if you like\nto hit it hard, like me, you can just bump it up to red. So, the quartz coil in this\nmeans that, even though you hitting it at a higher temperature, you're not really\nlosing any of the terpenes or flavor or anything like that, it's just the\nextremely pure vaping experience. So, now that I've loaded this one up, I'm\ngoing to hit it, I'll just hold the button on the side down for a few\nseconds while inhaling... So, the vapors get a very pure flavor to it,\nit's not hot at all, even though you're only about five or six centimeters from\nthe atomizer, when you're hitting it and the Aqua Bubbler, would really help with\ncooling down that vapor. That's easily one of the most pleasant concentrate\nexperiences I've ever had with a handheld vape and I'm just gonna have a\ntry with the nectar collector now and see if that has any difference with the\nflavor. Now, one important note, I'm gonna tell you to take when you're dealing\nwith vaporizers like this and especially with wax vapes, you would want to\nmake sure, that in between sessions or before your first use, you should burning off\nthe atomizer. Now, burning off the atomizer can get rid of any oils or\npotential impurities that in got involved during manufacturing process\nand it just makes for a cleaner sort of vapor. So, now that I'm going to use the\nnectar collector function, just open up my little jar of concentrate, after removing\nthis atomizer, so if this, it's going to be easy if you sort of collect a tiny\nbit of concentrate in the lid of your chamber or if you're using like a sheet\nof dab, something like that, you pretty much just run a line across the top, but\nfor this, it's silicone heat resistant, I can hit it straight out of the tub,\nso I'm going to want to get the nectar collector atomizer and just screw it\ninto the bottom of the device like this and just pop your Aqua Bubbler back on\ntop and I find it's a little bit easier to hit as I have to collect, if you just\npreheat it for a few seconds first, so if I'm just holding on this button for a\nfew seconds... oh wow, so the nectar collector runs a\nlittle bit hotter than the interior atomizer, I have to say. So definitely a\nlittle bit less pronounced terpene flavor, but a fantastic cloud, nonetheless\nand ultimately a very pure vaping experience.\nNow, I'm gonna bust down the kit, a little bit, so you can see what comes inside the\nHeadbanger, I really like what they've gone with it, reminds me of some sort of\nCalifornia dispensary packaging or something like that. The Silver and\nBlack blue parts on some Oakland Raiders style one thing, I'm really\nliking how it's turned up. So it's a magnetic flip top, let's open into the\nfront, it shows you the little user guide, it's very user friendly, little Quick\nStart Guide to get you vaping. Inside as well, it comes with this little carry\npouch, I flip them open, so it's just a branded black little carry pouch, just\nmake sure you're not getting any dust or anything in your device. It'll protect it\na bit as well, adds a bit to a bit of a discrete element to it, if you look in to\nconsume your cluster trade on the go also in the kit ,we've got another one of\nthese little glass concentrate containers. So as I said before, if you\nliked as long as you haven't got the nectar collector and you can have both\nof these class concentrate tubs in the device at once, so I sort of just\nconcealed in the bottom like that, so you can really be on the go, with up to 2\ngrams of concentrate loading up and the battery on these things are fantastic,\nyou can hit at least 100 dabs and more I've been using it for a couple of days and I\nhaven't even had any indication that it's getting low on battery. So, these\nconcentrate vapes, because they're not sort of generating hot air like a herb vape would, so a general convection vaporizer, just the conduction technology\nrequires a lot less battery. I mean you can take this bad boy on the road for\ndays at a time without even having to worry about bringing a charging cable. So\nI'm now going to separate little wax jar back inside the box here, put that back together. So, also included\nis just the general sort of cleaning kit and packing kit, that comes with most\ndevices, this little nylon brush that comes with it I wouldn't necessarily\nrecommend using it for the atomizers, because I think that it will sort of\ndevelop a bit of a viscous coating on it but as long as you've got like a little\nalcohol wipes, an acid propyl or something like that just wrap it around\nthe outside, you can give the Aqua Bubbler and atomizer, a nice little clean\nand then it's just got a generic little packing tool, so you can take that slip\nit into your pocket just load up your concentrates on the go.

cons of dab rigs and nails dab pins vaporizers emails and nectar collectors you can find all these products and more at the wizard puff com online head shop and you can save money with the code roughhouse I'd like to thank wizard puffs for sponsoring this video perhaps the og of ways to do dabs is the trusty dab or oil rig fitted with the titanium nail or quartz banger and is truly one of the most effective ways to do a dab you'll get a huge hit instantly and usually get the most out of your wax - as it's fully vaporized in seconds dab rigs might be one of the most effective ways of doing dabs but there are drawbacks such as needing a torch and gas to heat the nails and also a recovery time to reheat it now for the next tab also when you introduce open flame and exposed high heat into the process you also sacrifice safety to some degree dad pens on the other hand are probably one of the safest ways to do dabs these types of pens usually use quartz ceramic or metal coils to heat the wax enclosed inside of a sealed glass or metal cap these types of pens can be effective and give big hits but usually will take several puffs to smoke the same amount of wax as doing a single dab off of a nail another common drawbacks to wax pans is that the unvailed wax builds up and they require constant cleaning to keep functioning properly some vaporizers that are made for dry herb can also be used to vaporize wax to these devices usually provide a cup or pod that inserts into the dry herb heating chamber to vaporize the wax these types of devices can be very convenient but the cons are that they often do a mediocre job of vaporizing wax as they lack the heat that's required and the small pods can be cumbersome and leaky so it can be hard to keep the heating chamber clean for dry herb nectar collectors or vacuum systems could be considered the Dark Horse of DAB methods these types of devices use a heated tip on the end of a handheld device that you dip directly into the wax there are both electric collectors as well as those requiring external heat sources such as a torch one big advantage of the collector type rig is that you can get huge hits when you're dipping the tip directly into the wax but they can have a bit of a learning curve and a little bit awkward to use perhaps the biggest favourite among divers is the email emails are very similar to the standard titanium nail on an oil rig with one key difference the emails have an electronic control center to set a precise temperature and a heating element that will keep the nail continuously heated and ready for a dab the pros of emails are that it's ready for a DAB any time that it's on and you can set to precise temperatures and you also you can do back-to-back dabs without having to reheat the nail they may also arguably be safer than using open flames and are clearly more convenient than needing a secondary heating torch cons are that they usually require a power source to operate so it may not be as portable as the other methods and it's also very convenient to use so you might find yourself smoking through your wax very quickly and passing out on the couch very early whichever method you choose dabbing wax or rosin so long as it's free of impurities is actually healthier than smoking cannabis flowers by not smoking or vaporizing the plant materials you are clearly putting less unnecessary chemicals into your body and by taking concentrated doses you're required to smoke less frequently not to mention that the time it takes to do it to have is far quicker than the time it takes to smoke a joint bulb or especially a blunt but if you're an everyday diver like myself a nice email setup likely be the way to go but if you only occasionally dabber prefer to vaporize then a three-in-one vape pen that does wax too might be satisfactory or any or an inexpensive wax pen might be even better or perfect for the beginner just looking to dabble in wax shatters and rosin

to to figure it out to try to learn from what people had done online and and it was there's not a lot of information out there about high-pressure aeroponics so I thought I would make just a quick overview until I can make a more detailed DIY video but high-pressure aeroponics is um is the idea is to pressurize water so that when you send it through a mist head the mist is really fine like a 40 micron particle real small particle cloud that yeah that the roots on the inside are taking up the they can um they can absorb it more readily and then you give them time to kind of dry or most so they're in the air and then you spray them again so that's the general you know idea of high-pressure aeroponics NASA kind of developed the it for space plank rolling and and then in and there's some great places online that that are doing stuff and they they don't necessarily show us you know the components and the park so let me show you some of the components on the parts here okay so here we go we got the reservoir sending out water to this skimmer filter that protects the pump from getting too much junk or small particles in it that it can't handle and preserves the life of the pump we're using this aquatic 8,800 pump this is controlling the pressure in the system it tells the pump when to turn on and when to turn off and we're keeping pressurized water in the system by using this actuator tank so we put the actuator tank in line we're also we also have a pressure release valve that I'll show you in a sec but we put the actuator tank in mind and the switch will keep the pump running until this tank gets to the pressure we want it to be it so once the system gets up to like a hundred and twenty psi right now it shuts off and once it drops to about ninety five it turns back on and brings it to 120 so that's how the pressure is controlled right now by this switch then it has an adjuster you buy it factory preset I got this one at 80 it was seems to be a little more stable than the one that was at 40 and then I adjusted up so this one comes at ad I adjusted it others so that's how we hold a high pressure so that the missed heads can always miss that fine mist by having high pressure what tells them when to spring in how long to spray this this is a little timer that is connected to the solenoid switch done timer is set for about 15 seconds of spray time on it maybe five minutes straight I'm offering that's what I'm trying this physically lets the water flow to the spray heads so that's going out before that I did had this pressure release valve hooked up so this is going to protect expansion tank handle 150 pounds of pressure so this is about a I think 140 um it will it will release so that this will never get to 150 so that's our safety measure and then let me just hit the reset on this so let the Head Start screen and then we're going out I'm into the spray heads and these are the barrels they have 57 gallons whoo great plastic barrels I have them plugged dreams on here I got an issue on this one but they're all coming back to the their I do I do have one one more of these before the first spray head one more of the skimmer filter and I'm going to eventually put put them on each one just to lighten the load but I think I should be good only been cleaning it once a week as it is I know this isn't a very clean setup and in that but I am going to tighten it up and make it a little prettier okay let me show you some of my parts so I've been using these John guest on fittings John guest fitting is anybody that's not into plumbing wouldn't know I wouldn't think I didn't know anything about them they almost work like one of those Chinese finger puzzle and your kids you put your fingers in and the more you pull away you can't get it off you have to resist you know you have to kind of push in to slide it out um so that's that's how these what these things make me think of you push it in and it will not come out when you're pulling away but if you hold the edge of the fitting it slides right out so that this piece doesn't pull and these have been axial at all over so I'm using those I got you got tease I got a 90 straight through 's and so I've been using those these bulkheads are are what you use in between on the like caps when you're entering or leaving the the barrels so this the barrel would be in between you screw it in tight and then and then I put a little caulk if I need it I'm going to start putting these on the bottom and these on the bottom in the center and exiting that one I think all you need are these quarter inch because you're only Springs I'm only spraying like every five minutes for 15 seconds so you're not putting a lot of water into the tanks and so you don't need a big a large volume to return it and you'll save a lot of money using the smaller size then I originally used 1/2 inch and there's no need for it and I had problems I'm putting this on the side with this one's leaking the other ones I haven't had any real issue with but still there's no there's no real reasons that they use the half inch it's overkill so I'm using these John guest fitting I'm using this quarter inch hose the black tubing the black tubing and this this bubble of insulation reflective insulation the reason behind that is we want to keep the lights out of the barrels out of the loop out of any place where the water is so I actually use some clear half inch tubing initially and I immediately got algae growing this I have not had any algae growth with using all black um the here's one of those steps skimmer um burl and open it up here savings the skimmer filter this is beautiful it's a reusable filter so you can just rinse this off you can see the last time I just swapped it out I didn't rinse it off yet so you just take it out under a hose or the sink and rinse it off pop it pop it back in close it up and put it right back in mine really nice this mist head it comes apart in case they're just clogging you can case your clogging and clean it out sorry if I'm not doing great camera work here but and I didn't have a tripod I used this instead of the soft metal stuff to hold down the accumulator tank stretched a little bit and then I redid it with some good sense I'm using I used 2 inch PVC using these 2 inch net cups with the neck collars they're nice because they very easily so you can adjust pull pull a piece off this and make them bigger smaller as you move them I am I drilled holes in in the barrels and then I cut these at 45 screwed them on use some food grade caulk that I was able to find to make sure I didn't have any leaks Nets worked really well it was way cheaper than using the 45 or the 90 degree elbows that fit in there nice and tight and the o-ring which some places are using and that's great if you can afford it it just adds a lot of money to each barrel I have I have about 40 holes in each barrel I started a month about seven inches from the bottom and I got them separated seven inches and I also am using the same 7 inch from from column to column so this one starts off to stagger on starts off at 10 and a half up the half of seven right three three and a half added to seven gets you to a ten and a half and then same thing every four or four on each column goes around there's there's ten so I got 40 the very last columns a little bit bigger it's like maybe eight inches but um but that worked pretty well I think that's the general gist of it that would get you going and at least get you an idea of how to how to do it and and give you the names and the parts of what I got you may be able to source better things you may come up with some much better ideas let me know and I may try them because I'm I'm building them I built this this greenhouse and I have room for four more so I'm going to I'm building five more right now to fill this thing up so that's how I'm doing the the video or the DIY video I'm trying - but good luck",

the bottom you can see i did a bunch of slits so it's gonna this is a my dome perk i'm gonna have it like this so them slits will be in water too so you're not really gonna be seeing that so i figured i'd show that real quick and i'm gonna put some slits right there and just drop this whole thing have it in there like that [ __ ] some cool little bottles i found imma put a couple slits right there in that middle part because it tapers so when my ice melts hopefully it sits there and don't pour in but just like that it's airtight so i'm gonna glue this up and i'll get back with you all right back again i just want to show this is what ended up turning out this is before i turn this let's figure it out show it sorry forgot my lighter cheers guys but uh happy smoking guy go get a [ __ ] laugh out of a part i gotta use to make it fit because it's going on top of this well see y'all in a minute all right everybody back again it's done a little hard to pull down but i ended up putting a baby bottle nipple on there i mean this is the lid that goes on it i mean it it fits in and it's nice and snug but i mean it slightly wobbled now i can i can put it in and i can actually just hold this and hold the whole piece so it does pretty good i didn't cut this yet wasn't worried about it but check this out i've hit it a couple of times and it is it's smooth i don't have no ice in it right now but oh well it's whatever cheers pretty much catch the boat do another quick hit for you but yeah check it out no call [ __ ] it's good can't wait to put some water in it try that slim [ __ ] ah always happens say it's hella smooth then i end up talking but i didn't pull it quick enough all right decided to go ahead and put some ice in it [ __ ] it works really good [ __ ] that top's been pretty [ __ ] big so the ice goes in nice nice bottle cheers everybody [ __ ] yeah tastes good how's the last meet okay i won a bad car works hella good [ __ ] this park works hello good it's ice chambered so i'm gonna go put this up put this in the freezer and got some stay up stay toasty", "ZgQ3kA4AkbE": "[Music] [Music]", "eXm_rFLO468": "let's have a look at the utili in five this hard-hitting easy to use wax pen is the first wax pen from util Ian inside the box you'll find one utility in five one USB charging cable one dual twisted Kanthal black ceramic coil 1 triple titanium

first is to point two volts then 2.4 2.6 and finally to point 8 once you have selected your desired voltage setting press and hold the button on the front to begin heating the coil to wrap this up I'd like to tell you about some of the key features of the utili and five which make it a fantastic wax pen the first is the vapor quality of the utility in five both the Kanthal and the titanium coils provide amazing flavor and a smooth draw that can be customized by adjusting the airflow at the bottom of the chamber under lower two voltages the flavor is especially exquisite and at the higher the clouds are enormous the second is the 5s ease abuse it only has one button which is always great for anyone just starting out or switching over to concentrates the mouthpiece is very easy to remove which makes loading a breeze the chamber and atomizer also come off the unit easily which helps with cleaning as well it really just is a straightforward wax device third is the utili and 5s design it is sturdily built with a hefty feel and a slick outer finish the 1050 milliamp hour battery will keep you charged all day long and the four voltage settings have you covered for however you like your

this travel case that is made out of hemp and inside we have a 14 millimeter male glass attachment the tank that houses the ceramic heating element the magnetic battery with three variable voltage settings and there's also space for concentrates and on this side we have everything that you need to charge it plus a few extra o-rings so when it comes to assembling your connect we're going to twist the glass stem into the housing also make sure that the tank is screwed tightly onto the housing before inserting it into the rig next we're going to open up our magnetic tank cap and load in our dab this product works great for all types of concentrates on our site we will also have 10 14 and 18 both male and female glass attachments that are available for purchase make sure your battery is fully charged before you use it green means good to go next we're going to connect our battery to the heating chamber you'll notice that it's magnetic we're going to press the battery five times to turn it on and then three times to change the heat setting blue is the lowest and then green and then red for the hottest once you've decided your temperature click the button two more times to activate it you'll see that the G on the screen is going to be blinking while it heats up but as soon as that G turns to a solid color you are good to take a hit use the spring-loaded release button

another bomb today and this is my homemade while percolator bong it's only got one chamber see hope would you see there's holes that's a pill bottom the pill bottle pull the stem cut a point P is the bullet again bring these and boil it a lot here guys polish big one it's just so much easier than having universe piece you just got in pop or bullet in there now what I use for them the downstem is on just a movable will not Bowl but where the hoes is plugged into for hookah I just put it inside of Margaret so that way the bull wasn't just bringing the class sleep if it sucks up through and then I don't know it's took a lot of time guys giggles a lot of time I save all night making its and crashed it like ten o'clock today while i was waiting for it to dry but uh it works great it really does really proud of myself but it quite a good job surprisingly a good job i should say i got a small leak here in the back but uh it's not to be okay not really going to worry about it probably take the water out reseal it what can I do there's um this couple Kings I still got work ality but uh would you do you know its end its I loaded it with stems so it's like a butt up it's a card in the back so clear guys forgot to say that but uh here it is guys let me know what you think in the comments", "K7Jr3ig5DU4": "hi this is Jake from lifeline pet supplies calm today we're gonna cover hooking up a bubbler cup or bubble humidifier to an oxygen concentrator if you want to use that as a source of humidity pretty simple to do first thing you're gonna do is unpackage it you're going to see a tube like this with a threaded end goes into the top of the bubbler cup and you're going to see a cup like that I'm gonna fill this thing up with water and be back here in just a second so before I filled it up with water I thought I would just show you real quick that's the black top unscrews from the cup here and you've got two lines a minimum and maximum you want to use distilled water in the cup so it prevents any lime or calcium buildup that can affect the operation of the bubbler cup and I'm gonna fill this up here and be back or at least put some water above the minimum line be back in here just a second to show you how to hook it up to your concentrating okay so I'm back and I've got that filled to the maximum line there with distilled water and the next thing we're gonna want to do is go ahead and put this back together screw the lid top back on there pretty snug once you've got that snugged up what you want to do is thread this into the top that short connector and it just threads in until this goes snug and then we're gonna be ready to hook it up to the concentrator okay so here we are at the oxygen concentrator and most of them will have some form of lip whether it be on the front some concentrators actually have a piece in the front allows you to hook the bubbler Cup in here this is a never flow cue OPI and it's got a little spot back here with a strap that you actually can just attach that will hold the bubbler cup and this end once we threaded that onto the bubbler cup is actually going to go to the output of the concentrator so I'm gonna disconnect the standard oxygen line and hook this into there I'll be back here in just a second okay so one important thing to note is make sure your concentrators turned off before you try to do this and the little short tube that you're seeing running from the humidifier is gonna hook into the output of your oxygen concentrator make sure you push that on there so now ugly okay so this is what it's going to look like and you can already see it starting to push some pressure into the bubble basically what this is going to do as the pressure output comes from the concentrator it's going to run up the tube down in through the bubbler cup and bubble the water therefore evaporating humidifying it then it's going to come back out this little side nozzle right here that is where you want to hook your standard oxygen tubing that came with the nebulizer no 2-pack that runs connected to the incubator so I've now got that pushed on firmly you want to make sure your oxygen tubing is running into your oxygen adapter for your incubator and we are going to turn this thing on we begin to see it bubble here means everything's working should be at about three to four liters a minute we recommend three liters a minute for puppies here for newborns and what that's gonna do is humidify basically humidify the air as it goes in runs through the bubbler cup picks it up this humid air rises to the top feeds it down in through the oxygen line and into the incubator so it'll actually begin to raise the humidity level inside the incubator you'll be able to see that once you've got your small hygrometer mounted to the back of here the range we recommend for newborn puppies is 50% for a target what I tell people is puppies are comfortable where we're comfortable at so between 40 and 60 percent successful and we shoot for a target of 50 you're gonna begin to see the levels rise it can take a little while to fill up the incubator with humidity so you know I usually tell people give it at least an hour to start to see some change it has that whole area to humidify and fill up and you can already see it starting to come up a little bit here it's already come from about twenty six point two or three up to about 27 and hopefully that'll get up into the nominal range if that still isn't enough you also can use a use the mounted cup holder inside the unit there in the back that little square box that you see back there folds down holds a small cup of water with a sponge or a rag most areas will be able to maintain the humidity with this method if not then you may need to purchase the digital humidity system thank you", "qvFWv2TPhBc": "this glass water pipe is real air Hine comport the base is very sturdy and see if the Jones is female don't 40-millimeter the glass tube is well crafted all

great little bub like I said it's pretty much my daily driver right now got a whole lot on YouTube about the Sheldon blacks so I figured I'd put up one of our Bub's pretty much have the full line of Sheldon blacks as well as the tubes and the they also make a steamroller all right which is pretty cool I'm more into the water filtration wheel but pretty cool design with a diffused [Music] diffused

"bCHSBly0ppI": "oh my name's mike i'm from access irrigation limited today we're looking at pipes and specifically coiling of pipes and undoing the straps on them which can cause problems if you're not careful now I have a small 16 mil diameter coil of pipe in front of me here and you'll notice it's quite tightly strapped now when you undo the straps on any size of pipe even a small one like this be very careful it doesn't spring back into your face and cause damage useful things to have with you when you're cooling pipes is obviously the pipe itself some pegs to holding it down and a set of pipe cutters now the pipe cutters are useful for not only cutting the pipe but also the straps that secure it now when you're undoing the pipes all pipes have an inner and outer tail this is the outside tail you can see obviously it runs around the outside and there's an inside one they're always coil it from the outside tail first for obvious reasons so when you're undoing it when you remove the straps you're very careful that you don't cause it come back on yourself I just and also be very careful when you're cutting you don't actually cut through the pipe itself and cause yourself some more work okay so there's our outside coil don't pull it like that or else it'll be like a coiled wat spring and it will know the fact the place if you do that it will tend to kink the pipe so be do it in a cartwheel fashion okay - now start coil or uncoiling the pipe always take the outside tail as I said it's always a good idea to put some tape on the ends of the pipe itself stop any debris or any grit like we've got down here going into the pipe and blocking any valves etc so always good rule put a bit of tape over you can trap the end with the soil stakes like I showed you previous or you can use a bit of convenient masonry and all you've got to do is just stop that pipe from swinging back then grab hold of the coil and then just wind it back along the line line that when you come to the end if you put the coil back down on on the pipe itself trapping the pipe then it won't spring back then and then you can walk up and do whatever fittings or any thick sings you need to on the pipe so points to bear in mind always seal the ends of the pipe make sure no debris or dirt gets into them and always undo the coil carefully when you undo the straps to make sure it doesn't spring back on you and finally make sure you coiling the outside tail first and not the inside tail all right", "MBXP_3Zlq_E": "[Music] hello everyone it's me canvas reviewer it is an exciting week for growing the 20/20 grouse season and it's the summer 2020 grouse season got a lot going on this week you want to talk about it I want to stay you have it make this too long of a video but a lot has happened first of all this is now the first week of the flower cycle for the granddaddy black and it is the fifth week of the veg cycle for this girdle's glue I've been doing work to the to the box in preparation of the flip because as I as I've said in the previous videos that I have to Swit I have to convert him from being one single box into two separate boxes and that was a whole point of putting together and having a man set up as a modular design so I could put panels in and do that so I have a video I made just a little clip of me putting in the the light trap and sealing up the two chambers I want to show you that at least on one side I'll show you that and how it how it actually works and how good it looks hello everyone it's me the cannabis weed viewer I'm back I wanted to show you guys I put the panel in because I'm gonna be switching the Grandaddy black to flower today I'm done with the scrog and I'm sorry about the lighting but the reason for this is I wanted to show you that there are no there is no light escaping around it the panel I do have stuff here it makes it look like it is but it really ain't downside so I did have a one negative that I will fix net before the next season but for now I'm gonna run with it because I need to get it done and I don't want to spend a lot of time one of the things I ended up doing and I'm sorry for the grainy video but it is you know it is dark in here and but I'd put in four of those all the way around and so that made it so this you can't really remove this panel that easily but out to it once yeah once I starts crawling on it's gonna be a bit difficult for me to remove that panel but I can remove the top one just stop in here I can be back that's it you can't see I can only remove this top one I can remove this top and so I can get airflow I don't know this really matters because we'll have both lights on anyway and I found I have this top I can open I can always run the wires back over I don't have my Arduino working yet got it written I haven't had a test it I just haven't had the time every a lot of shits been going on so haven't had the time to do that just yet but I will soon try to finish that up so right now we're gonna just use the mechanical good old-fashioned mechanical timer right there to run it so you I don't want to show you the other side because it's Sunday and in a couple days I'm going to show you my grow but when you see it it's gonna you'll find that it looks really good it's it's basically it's it's right in this cavity right here so it doesn't impede any of the scrog screen on this side or this side so that's pretty cool and like I said next season I'll probably put posts in with holes and maybe with some wing nuts or something I've decided exactly what I'll do some people say use velcro but velcro sometimes don't work so well on this wood cause it's too porous but I'll see what I'm gonna do I'll find right now it works it seems to be working I haven't tested it of course I'll have to turn the air conditioner on the exhaust on you know turn that on first see how it affects this chamber you know see if I have turned the exhaust on I also may end up closing the intake on this side just to make it force it to pull from this this chamber over I'm still working on it still work in progress right now though I want to get my my beautiful baby back in in here and get the lights and fans on her so she's not getting stunted any and then I can start working on the other side and then do the testing that I need to do I'm not sure where I'll put this in in my video some one of these videos I'll post it maybe it'll be the one on Wednesday but we'll see anyway thanks for watching guys this is the cannabis reviewer and I [ __ ] up on it I was before we even get there I [ __ ] up and I had the but it [ __ ] works out man I didn't remember exactly where that panel set up against the other box and I didn't I didn't measure in the right spot but it turns out so what happened was when I put the panel in the right trap stuck out so far that it was really impeding into the gross space of the right chamber and also wouldn't allow me to put the scroll again ah that not gonna happen I gotta have scroll on that side too but I was able to luckily turn it around flip it around and put it towards the put the light trap on the left side pointing in the left side chamber and it works awesome that way it fits perfectly the scrog works I'm really happy with what's happened and how it turned out even though I kind of screwed up the top panel is completely removable easy just pull right off unfortunately the bottom panel because I put the light trap in and I just said this in the video but because I put that light trap in and and narrowed the what the in this middle because of the hole the rectangle it made it weak and now it flex so I had to put a put four screws in there to hold it down but they're easy to remove right when I have to remove them it's not into the [ __ ] world and it seals it and it works and so I did some testing turned on the air conditioner had the boxes closed up I did testing and first I didn't have nothing on that thing got up to almost 90 degrees I had to back off like 85 86 I'm like okay stop that that was with nothing on turned on the exhaust fan only and it got down a little bit more closed up the right vent or sorry the left vent light trap that comes in on the left side I filled that up so I was forcing all of the air to come through where the air conditioner is on the right side and that lowered it down a little bit more and then I turned the air conditioning on with the VIN on and I got it down to 75 77 so with the air with the vent off it'll stay around 80 give or take the end well the right one does a better job than the left one because that exhaust fan has to pull it if you don't have the exhaust fan on then the air kind of has to float its way through the light trap into the grow box whereas if you have the exhaust fan on then it's gonna suck that cold air right on through and I'm telling you what there's quite a bit more suction now that I've using the the grow the air conditioner as a input than the my light trap I think I made my original light trap probably a little too narrow in terms of the the curves of the ass I was more concerned about light than I was there right so I told you it's gonna be jam-packed a lot of information so second week of watering on the Grandaddy black and then next week we're gonna flush with I bought some flawless finished by advance nutrients didn't I get the sledgehammer check out my spreadsheet video it's my spreadsheet I'm sorry not my spreadsheet check out my video where I put together the flesh solution if you want to know more about that and why I did it but I'm ready for that I've been irrigating with the with water and nutrients when needed on the left side for the skittles glue I'm sorry for the granddaddy black [ __ ] [ __ ] up ain't I and I'm telling you what it's been working really good I've been really really really happy downside of closing the chambers though is I don't have my Arduino working yet so I had to go to a mechanical timer which is fine for now and I don't have any measurement of moisture in the soil or temperature no measurements inside that side of the box because I can't get the I don't have enough sensors and the soil sensor that I was using I can't get easily through the panel without exposing light and that wasn't the original ten anyway original intent was have two separate systems I just haven't had the time to do it been working on all this stuff trying to get this ready okay what else have I done we're gonna trust me guys I'm gonna show you this this the weed in just a minute so bear with me what else have we done well I put together go back and look at my previous videos I've been throwing out videos left and right I was worried about when you flip the weed it stretches and it can it can stretch one-and-a-half times a lot more than it was so as it develops buds so you have to be a page special attention to that last year my tangerine your last groceries and my tangerine Dream's got so tall look at the videos you'll see that I had to actually tie it up so it wouldn't fall over and also move it away from the light because it grew too tall for the light because it's a sativa and Steve was blue tall so to avoid that this year and since I'm scrubbing I decided to make a skort screen for the buds this sits on top the scrog that's adjustable and if you look at the last video with the video I should say I don't know the last one but the video that I made that shows me making it you can see how cheap it I made it but it's gonna be just fine so what else I guess that's it that's a lot isn't it brought an extra fan because the chambers are separate and I need to make sure I get plenty of air so two fans in each side man I think that's pretty much it so I guess let's show you what we got and then we can go from there I know you guys been waiting long enough right I'm really happy with the scar that I've had so far I just hope that I don't overwater it now I don't mean like drown it I actually mean like have no nutrients at all and it it starves it so you know what we'll go ahead and start with this one for sure so far been lucky no bugs I ended up spraying my outside yard around the shed and in the yard with bug spray cuz I was concerned about all the damn little tiny gnats and bugs straighten that up a little bit there we go all right so there she is in all her glory and if you notice if I don't drop the camera so I'll zoom in here so this is adjustable so I can remove that top piece have it there I can add another coupler I can go as high as they want it's not perfectly straight I know or square or whatever you want to call it kind of crooked a little bit that I don't care you know do exactly what I want and I've been moving them trying to get them to stretch out we will get close you will get a chance to look at those close up the screens kind of in the way ain't it and I did another pruning but I've been trying to be patient with the pruning and I go overboard and either's mine you see there's my irrigation I did buy a next couple of pieces now so I can hook the irrigation up basically arisen house gonna have them tied together thinking oh that would be great but actually it's better if they're separate because there might be times where one gets water and one gets newts and so obviously it's are together that's gonna be a problem so I just made us another one for the I just took the other piece disassembled it from that and then bought another piece that I can screw on top of the pump and then I have two separate pieces I'll be putting that in soon as well so the next video that you see of the plants you'll see it in there because I'm going to start that too okay so that is the glue first the granddaddy's black I don't know why I keep calling the [ __ ] skittle glue having an issue in it there's the skills glue she seems to be leaning to one side of the [ __ ] plant so I'm gonna have to check that out after I get done talking to y'all and showing the video I haven't actually checked it out yet I just come home from work just come on come work and said I need to get this out got a lot of [ __ ] to do today so she's beautiful as you can see and we're gonna definitely get up there now and get much closer think that's that's our next step is to get closer so that's what we'll do that's what I'll do I'll get up real close like I always do show you the video of it sideways on top and everything so I guess why not usually I have to put [ __ ] on but I decided just to go ahead and put everything on now that way I can just take it and go alright I'm not gonna shut all the fans off as I said because I need to be careful about overheating everything I will take pictures but for now it's not quite all the way filled in you know if you can tell like right here it's not quite bits getting there see the new ones popping up it's looking [ __ ] good right now definitely better than I've ever grown I know I keep saying that but it continues to be the case that continues to be the case and you see I got some leaves at the bottom that are probably going to be trimmed again I just haven't been really aggressive doing that and obviously if they get yellowed or discolored then yeah they're off but if they haven't and I'm not gonna bother a man just let it go for now man you imagine how this is gonna look I'm so excited man it's definitely my best grow this works out as well as I think it's gonna I'll probably be struggling from now on you don't need this much light or as much room we'll see alright you see how this is let me actually slide it this way which I can't do with once I straw get so it's leaning a little bit to one side it's actually it's not like a lean it's just kind of the way it grew it's hard to tell hard to see see there's the top and a split that this side is grown more than that side but they're seem they're popping around I'm I am you know what I'll be sprouting is super soon it's not gonna be much longer that I'll be scrubbing this because it's just about ready for Mike for me anyway that's just for me everyone everyone's different I suppose on how they want to do it they're beautiful though they are beautiful I have no problems with any of the leaves I just wish I had a different lens I can get even closer but they're nice and beautiful they're not crunchy they feel healthy but if you touch them they feel real healthy but yeah I'll be I'll definitely be putting on the irrigation to that and putting scrog in real soon real real soon so that's the plan he's right now when I'm irrigating I also put a bubbler in the end so it's right actually show you it's right here and took it out this is what I use now and it's [ __ ] great man I got markings on it so I know where the bottles are at 1 2 3 4 5 and then I just fill it up with whatever I need and I know how many bottles I've added by putting it on the line it's not exact there's still a little in the bottom that's just straight water have to finish getting it out this is watered yesterday and I just haven't had time then trying to work work on all of the other videos and get this ready so I don't have to worry about flipping and giving me any problems oh [ __ ] light trap I didn't even show you that thanks for reminding me look at this bad boy look how she sits in there it's just [ __ ] like I don't know how and say perfect but pretty damn good alright see that the now this is at an angle so that's that throwing you off but it's because it's not being really used I just set it up there for the to show you how what I did so yeah man that turned out okay because originally that was going to be on this side and that [ __ ] was way out here way out here you know really going far because it's uh what is it three half inches four inches deep something like that three and a half I think I tried to make it the width of the two by four which isn't really four inches it's more like three and a half or three and four three quarters so that's what we we did instead okay put that back it's been a [ __ ] great growing season so far guys thank you for watching my channel I enjoy seeing those subscription numbers go up thanks for posting comments and [ __ ] tell your buddies tell a friend and go through what I normally say here get my my graphics in here please like subscribe click the bell as I said tell a friend bookmark it come back I enjoy growing obviously you know at this point to be honest with y'all I'm not saving money right now but I'm learning a lot and eventually once I get my yield up I should be able to start saving money on this but every every good thing takes time and I obviously I feel like anyway I'm learning every every grow season I get better so that's a good thing um what else I think that's pretty much it so keep on watching I'll be putting out more and more videos about every four days or like this case since it was July 4th weekend two or three right bang bang bang just to get him knocked out plus I picked this time this was the time to flip you know I had had the extra day I could do it so worked out great alright enough talking enough babbling medicines working great and I'm excited and I'm in a good mood and I hope you guys are too this is the cannabis reviewer I'll see you all in the next video and as I always say happy smoking", "dFZhcl98RRg": "life this is a very large water pipe it has a 42 centimeter and it has a film orange with 80 millimeter with very sleek and a sturdy base make it very stable and on desk it has three layer hein comfort and by a smoky it very smooth all right here we see what it has on this video very smooth and without a splash of water", "c9Htu6aOBU8": "hello everybody how's it going I got a Spartan Sox playing today it's gonna be a fun one now we're gonna be working on multiple kicking off of a singular chamber with that being said we're going that I have cleaned a class that revolves around one of my favorite days chair kicks chair kicks chair kicks chair kicks so if you have a chair or not sits around the side go in and go ahead and grab it now you don't have to put it in the main floor where you're kicking off detective that later but grab it and put it by you Kurt okay go do it right now well you're grabbing it I just want to mention that chair can see one of my favorite things but don't turn off the screen yet if you don't like chair kicks I think you may like today's class because we're gonna be going through a lot of different ways that we can do it and bud different ways not just hey put your leg out there and hold it for 30 seconds so chair kicks today multiple kicking we're gonna have a fun time now one comment I got recently on some of my graduate classes Liz fascinate I love your class but it's just a little bit too long for a warm up typically I do make it that long to make sure that people are stretch at we're good to go but also get time for people to come in and train with us if you watch the class usually you may see somebody come in at 10 or 15 minutes saying I'm here I'm late but I'm good to go now I do that so it gives metric time I feel like at this point that most people actually have figured out their technology and they know to come to class stretch so I can loosen that warm up with it that is all well that's true for all classes except for this one sparring class I'm always gonna do good stretch out I'm always gonna do a good warm-up it's gonna be 15 minutes but that's part of the class part of scoring great needs making sure that we're good and we can do those kicks improving their flexibility so with that two-minute long speech out of the way let's get started and though let's discern the way I always desert he's a pop switching back and forth one two knots also I'll let me know if you can hear me quite well my microphone has messed up once or twice some of these days so I want to just make sure you're not hearing fuzzy noises all right back and forth really make sure you're marching delayed we will speed this up eventually and tail kickers Nath's back and forth I'm gonna be honest to you I'm my body is sore when my body gets the Thursday and Friday it is just dead you know I do classes probably for about four to five hours a day five days a week and that's just teaching that's up extra hours on top of that in terms of working out and teaching in person and just doing other things that a normal person does and yeah I when I get to Friday my body is just dead which is actually a good thing but especially when it comes to work out with an instructor one of the biggest flaws most beginning instructors have an even older instructors have is they start off class they'll always do a good stretcher they'll always do good work out because they need it they need it bounine gets to the last day of class already stretched and already warmed up so they just jump right into these heavy kicks and I don't think we can do this is something that I've always tried to address in my teaching and that's why I always do good stretch you more about even if I feel good cuz I don't know who's out there who needs it now in Cyprus AIDS in the same sense right I want to make sure that I don't go today I'm extremely not stretched out so I know I'm good to go that you're probably good to go - all right and freeze now hop up and down for me take a deep breath in deep breath out we're gonna keep this hop up no matter what we do here okay no matter what we do we're gonna keep this hop up to get started all I'm gonna have you do is 30 seconds of whatever warm-up you want to do to get your body going more specifically your legs going so today I decided to do jumping jacks that's a good one something decide to do squat that's a fine one too something email something did some high knees here that's fine too you just need 30 seconds something that gets your body temperature up and going when you're done with it you don't just stand flat waiting hop up and down stick are you ready and go 30 seconds get your body warmed up a bit you're going and keep it consistent pace too sometimes you see kids or even adults go really fast at the start and then at the end go very slowly sculpt the same pace get tired going up that piece you feel like kind of target keep going up their necks you can speed it up and can't slow it down almost there three two one and hop all right all right now I'm gonna do some punches some punches these punches aren't gonna have you do 20 of them the absolute finish before me you pop in the states here's how it works I'm gonna put your hands up you're gonna go one two keep hopping one two keep hopping try to put one to two seconds between each one of your punches ready go one do twenty two three four five six seven eight 9 10 11 I'm gonna speed it up now 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 nights now you may have finished a while ago and you've been hopping that's fine now I'm gonna do rice and kicks right so I'm gonna go rise keep hop we're gonna switch our legs this time we're gonna go on my count boy I do tend to go do them without it ready oh yeah one notch to notice how I'm not bringing it about my hip I don't want that bubbler head yeah buddy I got three oh yeah four high five uh uh six uh uh seven io8 io9 iaat ten led you ten more of these way to go a bit faster cool reason with it you can't don't worry is it too hot ready oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah I uh I uh I uh perfect now thirty seconds of whatever exercise you want to do whatever exercise you want to do do the same one that you did at the start you ready and go yeah 30 seconds of this keep your pics and speed up not so down my suggestion is always search alone if you want to go faster if you start Pass you're gonna be dead but yet not trying to make Tiger your own try to get your bottom line going 10 seconds left 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and relax deep breath in deep breath out straighten your legs straight out relax your body you want to put slightly separate you can - and drop your body down don't come back up relax relax go to where your body naturally hangs hold it hold it hold it all right now separate your body just a little bit same thing go to where your body naturally hangs now one doing this Ian ask the chat how will I guess this class it's gonna be 30 to 45 minutes here we're to go over the things that we need to go right our chair kicks and multiple kicks most of the time this is a 45 minute long class but since I close to me to your topic we may end a bit early today the reason being is I have a couple other zoom things that I need to do today I don't want to make sure that I have time for them this boring class is a little bit of a passion project mix with what some people want so I'm going to give you guys a great sparring class first and foremost the left and hold go to the right go to the left alright so now I want you to draw up one knee and bring your body down so you can do this two ways either go into your flying side kick or you can twist your heel up and relax you this is where I'm gonna go cuz I need a more of a hamstring stretch I hold it hold it switch to the other side now Ian your toe tempo right so you need some counts this will be 15 counts no matter what trust me they're gonna earn it you can earn it alright now come back up put your feet back together and relax relax now stand on up yes sir take a deep breath in deep breath out I'm gonna give you one more thing at this point you're probably a little bit tired you're feeling a little bit more warmth we're gonna do 10 more rise and kicks not gonna be hopping when I do them slowly now I want you to go to the point where you feel slightly uncomfortable if you go past that that's where you're gonna start to struggle that's when you're gonna snap something right so just go a little bit up you're like this doesn't feel amazing forward a bit if you're like okay this feels about right I feel a little bit off but it's fine that's where you want to be starting seeing items ready go one go two go three go boy go by go six go seven go ain't go nine go tap your feet ready go one go two go three go four go five go six seven go eight doe nine go ten sure yet kun yang I would like you to go grab your chair now something that you can kick over as a reminder it is hip height if your chairs up here it is too big you can flip it around so you can kick over the sitting part and not the back of the chair but if the back of the chairs at your hip that's where you want it to be it's a little bit bigger than the hip that's fine but anywhere up to your abdomen ribs it's gonna be too hot they're not black we're not there yet okay thanks alright so I got this little bag here today what's great about the bad guys I can adjust it I can go all the way up here I'm gonna keep it down here today so I can really demonstrate some of the kicks so here's our progression today our progression is to go from standing or holding on to something to holding on to nothing to kicking over so holding on to something to holding nothing to kicking over so our three kicks that we're really going to emphasize today are our front kick round kicking hook kick now with our front kick this is the one we're gonna get started we're gonna hold onto the thing behind us now if you need to put a few side battle to the round kick you don't want to really put it to our side for the mass I'm gonna keep it here but for front kick it's fine if it's on your side put your other hand up this is important our goal is to do ten front kicks without putting our foot down if you put your foot down you reset when you're done with that we're gonna go to the other side of your head hold your chamber so do you see me dropping my chamber down here to kick no I keep it here and snap so tan each leg tan each leg then once you're done with those ten see how many can get without putting your foot down tuck it in check let me know how many gets will say if anybody can get above sixty after they're done doing their ten on each they get one point that point will come back later to help are you ready good so ten cakes one two three four five six seven eight nine now if you need to move your chair around and do this that's fine just make sure it doesn't take up too much of your time ready go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and touch your foot you have to reset only ask attack it's not too two months you guys are sparring you're probably already burnt purple it above you should be able to do 10 once you get past the tank choose your favourite leg as many as you can without setting your foot down notice how I'm pulling my toes back I'm not doing this or this those are bad front kicks keep going I'm gonna give you another two minutes to do this two minutes that's it that's what am I saying give you another minute if you don't finish your ten fronts on each side you're gonna have to give me some push-ups grace I see your inch at your bar gave me some push-ups today Jean I think you've escaped without push-ups I think you've escaped without push-ups no maybe I'll get you something today in Keerthana sauna you didn't get push-ups in our eyes in class today but uh I'll hand them out if you're not doing the right thing you know one of the students at you max not during classes afterwards he confided in me and said master Nick do you know what me my dad call you sometimes master pushup because I give a lot of push-ups and I like push-ups good Cal senex all right so now we're gonna move on to our psychic or started our cupcakes our cupcakes we're gonna do the same motion now our hook cakes we're going to do it in two separate ways we're gonna do one chamber where we chamber for our front kick then shift to our hook kick we'll also do one where are we already or outer chamber for a hook kick and then bring it in so let me show you the difference you're gonna have the footboard here i chained before my front kick I adjust hook kick that's one I reset I do this again two three four five now if you didn't do that with me I want you to do five real fast chamber for a front kick shipped to your hookie chamber kick five of those without putting your foot down you can use your bag to help ease your friends now I'm gonna make five regularly I just keep my chamber ready go what to see how I kind of bring it back round three ooh four five you need some time to do here five B's go for it different needs more time to finish these go for it if you're done with both of those your chair to the other side if you can't get ready to go so now let go to our left side same thing by the way Greece got sixty ain't got 100 they both get a point so I put my hand I rest I'm gonna do five regular or a chambering for a front kick switching to my hook kits ready go one I don't put my foot down too three or five I relax now I'm going to do five hook kicks where I keep my eclectic chamber remember my cookie chamber is the same as my psychic chamber it's very very similar ready five cooks from a hooker chamber wide to three four five now if you're done with all of it you've stuck with me this entire time keep and see how many whole kick you can do from either the chambers either you're from kicker regular cryptic chamber choose your favorite side if you get above 20 I'll give you a point give you a point so I see that Sam and Ryan are here and I see that a miss bunny set that I have been missing today I have I've done five or six zoom classes five or six tune classes and then also a couple zoom classes after this yeah it's like oppa Taekwondo marshallers downbeats honestly I prefer Friday's over the Thursdays because in Thursday's and Mondays and Wednesdays tend to be actually longer hours for me this one I'm teaching it a little bit less and I'm going for a little bit less time - it's only like six or seven hours or not I don't know thinking all my Mondays I usually work 10 to 12 so okay let's get going now I'm gonna move on to our final one final one our round kick feel free to reset your back our round kick is gonna be one of my favorites the round kick works like this my back toe is back I raise my leg I expect before we do our 10 on each side right we're actually going to do 10 of the chambers of how we did the hook kicks and our regular round kick chambers so we're gonna do 20 on one leg and 20 on the other there's something that I want to mention this round kick works the best when you have power behind your kick if you just throw these I do that sometimes just kind of word away people it's great until somebody figures out oh this isn't gonna hurt if I step in and they'll just keep charging but if somebody tries to step in and you BAM pop em then they such a question I bet you don't need to cause injury but enough forces for them to go okay if I don't keep my hands up I'm gonna get scored on so put your hand up we're gonna do a tenth from a front kick chamber so I'm gonna go front kick switch to a round kick remember with the switch of my feet so my foot is either sideways or forwards and then as I change for this round kick I shift my leg kicked that's how I get powerful one are you ready ten of these go one two three four five six seven eight 910 perfect okay so now we're gonna do 10 regular round kicks we're just gonna chamber from here and kick I'm gonna go a little bit faster round these ready hand up go keep your chamber here don't keep your chain with low and kick high that's not powerful one two three four five six seven eight nine ten reset pull to the other side that's this one leg right that's just one leg let's do this again back one leg up we're going to start from our front kick chamber switch to a round kick chamber stretch ten innings when we go a little bit sassy on this leg are you ready go one two three four five six seven eight nine ten all right ten regular round kicks ready go one two three four five six seven eight nine ten all right let me give you some time we're gonna give you about a minute if you're not gone through the things I told you to do finish it you are gone choose your favorite leg keep round kicking from here as many as you can do I'll give you a minute starting now if you get above 40 I'll give you a point I'll give you a point so I see a couple of points here remember how many points you got because you may think two points is in a lot trust me two points it's a lot because I'm gonna make you work at the end of class here it's gonna make you work and those points will save you a little bit of energy might Road Rambo candidates you can choose to ignore that syndrome get more counts all right all right so in just a second here we're gonna lose my chair for the time being we're gonna practice doing these things forward and actually the things that we're gonna practice for it aren't the singular kicks we just worked on it's multiple kicks we're gonna practice front kick into round kick and a plastic hook kick into round kick now if you guys practice those chambers properly this is gonna seem rather easy if you just went like Oh time around kicks from up front kick chamber okay this is gonna seem very difficult alright your minute is up so we are gonna do 10 multiple kicks with each leg we're gonna do three sets of these multiple kicks the first set being I would say the easiest front kick to around our second set is going to be a hook kick into a round kick and the final one is this is gonna be the hardest of front kick into a hook kick now we'll get there but let's start with our easiest one brought kicking the round kick now put your hands behind your back yeah I want you to watch this first I'm gonna show with multiple times I'm not gonna hold on to anything I'm gonna do my front kick like I did write a regular front kick but the second I read chamber now we do this Branca chamber into a round kick so I'm going one two now look at my feet as I do this my front kick comes in you can twist this or you can keep it forward up to you one then I say kick it rotates that's one I am NOT gonna have you do ah I won't have you do ten multiples if you are torn in bow or a black belt don't put your foot down between kids go one two one two work on that if you're a purple Bellamy like massive Nick this is difficult go crunchy brown cap it sets out reset ten each side are you ready guarding stance hyah and begin that's 120 through 10 of these go to we're gonna speed it up each time let's go three go four go five go six now on these last four I want you to kind of almost fake a front kick don't do a full front kick kind of bring your leg up up you're going to then it would chamber fast and kick ready go what go to go three final one let's go boy okay other leg other leg you have your choice you can either use your front leg or you can use your back lift your left leg or your right leg depending on which one you've been using it needs a kick so your other leg has to pick but you can put this leg either in front or you can put it in back back's gonna be easier to practice your front legs gonna be a little bit more realistic ready go that's one let's go again ready go that's two go three go board go five go six go wait wait would preach you did one that's perfect you didn't do one here's what I want you to try fake front kick bring your leg out it maybe extend it a little bit but more kind of feign it twister if you want you can start doing a front kick and then halfway through the kick twist either once fine ready go one go two go three let's go four perfect now I know I said head-on into these let me speed it up because I have to get ready for my next sued class here so the next thing we're going to do is a hook round hook round now we're not gonna want me to worry about that front kick chamber anymore right because all I'm gonna do is go hook kick round well do you know since it's a slightly harder one we'll do six of these each like okay are you ready my suggestion use your front leg both times you'll use both legs and put it in front if you try to do a back leg hook round it's gonna be a lot harder to control your balance especially if you have actors are you ready guarding stance oh yeah go round one go to go three a little bit faster now go for go bye go final one I have perfect other leg on your leg now look what I was doing with my feet on this I'm starting to get backwards now if you want to start it sideways that's fine but that first hook kick is made to miss you're hooking there you're not trying to score a point the score point because they're being lazy great your whole goal on that hook is to get them to duck so when they duck you're hooking so feel free to duck when I do this don't let me hit you they duck then you slam your foot down on that it's very sneaky and it's very easy to pull off if you know what you're doing ready hands up 60 this this leg so maybe your right or left go why go to go three go boy go by go 6x1 go relax deep breath in deeper that so those are our kicks front round hook round but the final one is probably gonna be the hardest and I say those are your kicks what I mean by that is those are your kicks that you can apply those since barwick their kicks that you can probably hit most of the time if you practice them especially at your guys's belt rink at Blackbaud it gets harder you're gonna have to slide while kicking but you'll see those kicks in the Olympic Olympics front into round kick you'll see people dragging their put forward here right and then switch to a round last minute however this next one you will see but it's harder to pull off this is our final one and we're only gonna do four of these remember what I'm talking we're not sitting on the couch even if we're tired we're standing in relaxed position to our attention I'm gonna do a front kick into a hop kick front kick so I change it for my friend here then as a reaching bert i  hook although this is the hardest one between advanced and experts far as this is the one night you are most likely to hit if you can do with that now once people start to be good they're gonna start to pick up on it but in your guys's level this is gonna be your sneakiest kick no Reese's of comfort so for each leg gonna do it slow real fast before we do it look at my feet I point my heel towards my opponent ready you can do this with back leg or front leg it doesn't matter go what back so to back let's go three final one for feel free to fake this right kick Faina just kind of put it out there and then throw your hooks go for other leg ready go what go two go three Gus for go take a deep breath in deep breath that deep breath in deep breath that all right then remember I told you you're gonna earn your 15 spine graphs now the time everybody's been dreading like I said at the start of class or doing chair takes but in a different style of way I like to say there's three different ways you can train your kicks when it comes to using a smaller object there's more than three but these aren't this kind of three categories I put a make first is kicking without reach aim bridge Shh just keep our started kicking while ready and bring down putting your foot down second is kicking while using the object that's balanced and the final the most painful one is holding your leg out above it here I said 50 not 50 that's half your attacks there so holding your leg over and practice holding that chamber so I'm gonna give you a challenge on each one of these combos you're gonna practice holding to kick over and all you can do is you can choose your confidence you can do psychic ground you can do front kick round you can do hook kick round you can do look it's a hard one front kick hook kick what you're gonna do is you're gonna choose the kicking you're gonna hold it over there in a holder for as many seconds as you can I'm gonna count up to 60 then the second you can't handle it anymore you're gonna reach a merc and throw your second kick the number of seconds will determine your number of points so if you get 20 seconds you get two points 30 seconds three points forty seconds four points if you get forty nine point nine nine seconds it's still four points your goal is to hold as long as you can there is an exception though if you're holding your leg over and you touch your chair one two you throw your second kick can you hit it that's another one or three you put your leg down without fire at your last kick you get zero points so if you touch your chair if you kick it if you don't throw your last kick and you fall backwards you have to fill your elastic above let me clarify you don't throw your lastic maybe you go here and you're like that doesn't count you get zero points so what's better is if you can't hold it longer than ten seconds hold it for 10 seconds the second you get to tap throw your second kick put it down it looks like count choose your combo you can get up to six points here if you get the sixty side to ground you can go front kick hold class personally I think the easiest one to sidekick sidekick get ready to hold get ready to hold are we give you 30 seconds to choose your combo and then put your foot up and I say go I'm gonna put your foot up and I'm gonna cat when I count I'm just gonna give you over 10 seconds okay 15 more seconds get ready to get started so 10 seconds I'll say 10 you get one point between now say 20 seconds you get two points you don't throw your second k can you hit the bag you put your foot down on it you get zero points no matter what even if you make it to 60 3 2 1 and hold hold it if you fire your kick before 10 seconds I'll give you half a point I'll give you half a point by the way it has now been 10 seconds 10 seconds so if you do you fire second cake now you put that you get one point you have one point you don't fight your kick and you hit the back you get zero points it's 20 seconds you can get two points now see those points were good at the beginning you got three points earlier that really helps you out so you can you snap in 30 seconds you can get a third point in the third point all right keep going keep going I'm keeping track stop in 40 seconds - if you put do your tick you can get four points you want to gamble for five gonna gamble for five reasons and risk it all to get zero if you don't fire that second kick controlled you're falling backwards if you throw that kick it it's a count five seconds 50 seconds you can get five points five seconds left until you can get sixty four three two one and time if you were able to do that and then fire your controlled kick at the end you get six points so so if you didn't get a point Center I'm gonna let you get one more point real easily real easy you only need to clear one combo for me if you can land this combo once in 30 seconds you get your final point so you go side sorry hook round side rap if you can throw that one comp over your chair 30 seconds starting now you get your point so remember hook round side wrap just throw that hook round side back I can do that you get your point you have 20 seconds left if you hit the bag it doesn't count you have one point if you can do this 15 seconds left 14 13 12 remember hook round side round hook sighs crap almost there almost there but 4 3 2 1 if you did not do it you did not get a point if you're able to do a lunch you've got a point great job you had a maximum of 10 points you can earned in today's class realistically not very many people probably got 10 points so for every point that counts for 10 seconds for every points got for 10 seconds we're gonna do a hundred seconds of kicks a hundred seconds of kicks if if if if if if you got all 10 points during this 10 seconds you just have to pop if you want but if you've got anything less you're gonna have to do kicks you got six kicks what's ten minus six for forty seconds of kicks these kicks you must constantly kick during this time I cannot stop kicking you have to go as fast as you can are you ready so Janine got seven points chili has to do 30 seconds of kicks once you're done with your seconds hop up and down starting right now I'll get tell you every 10 seconds your goal is to keep kicking keep hitting a hundred succulence right now it feels easy right it gets hard so it's a ten seconds so if you got seven points you got seven points then you have to do 30 seconds of this that's easy 30 seconds is easy all right 20 seconds you got eight points you're done now keep kicking keep kicking 30 seconds 30 seconds you got seven points you're done keep going keep going you're almost there you got six points you are done now Thank You Donna switch legs you can spend 40 seconds keep kicking keep kicking keep kicking all right 50 seconds you got five points you're done let's top get you snacks as you can for points you're done now you know most there you didn't get any points or still kick him at this point nice three points you've done now you're almost there can you kick in two points you're done now feel free to keep picking if you'd like keep it if you're done you got a lot of points all right ten more seconds left everybody feel free to join in for the final ten seconds four five we're sorry haha four three two one and time deep breath in deep breath deep breath in deep breath at now today we worked on a lot of things that we use our trusty friend the chair or the bag depending on what you use we work done front kick round kicks in hook kick and how to combo kicks after this class my suggestion is this stretch your legs and kill you the next morning if you don't do some stretches now especially if your name is Ian and you got like a candy sea class this class is a leg killer if you're not used to doing these sorts of things they're gonna hurt if you're used to doing these sorts of things they're still gonna probably hurt a little bit Jared kick serve killer ones well that being said class is over if you have any questions feel free to leave in the comments thank you guys for being here today this chat has been amazing amazingly active and feel free if you're watching this at a later date Chris on last week we have for people watching live which is fairly low but then 30 people watched it afterwards so if you're watching this later I want you to type into the comments and let me know how many points you got you know I gave everybody a chance to get ten points but I wanna see what you did baby if somebody got all ten let me know and I'll give you a little congratulations when I see your comment otherwise thank you guys for being here I will see you next time chariot come yet pulsar you", "6AE3TyY1PvA": "Let's have a look at the Puffco+ wax\npen, a smartly-designed wax pen featuring a coil-less ceramic

"[Music] hey everyone and welcome I'm Lexie with tools 4:20 and today I'll be reviewing the light by vapium it's their newest vaporizer since they released the summit a few years back it's a dry herb conduction vaporizer that has a ceramic chamber and it's definitely perfect for somebody who's never had a vaporizer before as its ease of use is so easy for everyone that's new to the vape world it's it's selling for around a hundred Canadian so it's definitely a good bang for your buck and what the accessories included you'll see why so let's check out what comes in the box so you get one vaporizer unit the light it contains the hidden stirrer tool under here one USB C charging cable Ones stir brush cleaning brush to clean the unit one extra clean air intake drawer there's already one in the unit but this is just an extra in case as you change it it kind of breaks apart on you okay one water pipe adapter so this replaces the mouthpiece and you can attach this to the vaporizer and use a fir water device also known as a bong it also has the silicone gasket that can be removed for cleaning and of course an instruction booklet basically walks you step-by-step it's available in two languages English and French everything you need to know about the vaporizer is in this booklet okay guys so let's talk about some cool features that come with this device so it has the haptic feedback which is viber alert so when you turn it on it'll vibrate when it reaches the temperature it will vibrate it also has a stir tool hit it inside right here at the bottom which is great it also comes with the water peace adapter which is also amazing you can add this to a bong if you're looking for more filtration the chamber size is a ceramic chamber and it holds about 0.33 of a gram it also has the air intake drawer which is removable you can clean out any residue left over from your herb you can also take it out to see if you'll get a little bit more airflow in there and also another very cool feature is that it actually has the USBC charger which allows you to charge while using it so that's amazing because most of the vaporizers out there on the market right now you cannot charge them while using so this is actually pretty cool that this little device you can actually just take a charger with you if you ever run out of juice plug it in use a wall you're charging and you're good to go okay so now for my favorite part showing you guys how to use the vapium light unlike most vaporizers where you turn it on you press the button five times the light you simply have to press and hold the on button like this for three seconds l vibrate it automatically goes to the last temperature used so add the blue setting it's a 172 Celsius 342 Fahrenheit and if you increase it just a little bit for a darker blue it goes to 180 Celsius 356 Fahrenheit the next temperature setting is 188 Celsius 370 Fahrenheit one and then one more press it will darken that yellow to make it 196 Celsius 385 Fahrenheit the orange comes in at 2:04 Celsius 392 Fahrenheit and then if you head it one more time to book to the highest in that range its 212 Celsius to 414 Fahrenheit then up to the top is 220 degrees Celsius to 428 Fahrenheit and one more press to get the at the complete highest temperature which is 228 Celsius 442 Fahrenheit and as it's reaching vibrates now you see your battery light over at green green indicates that it's about 60% 100% fully charged which right now this thing is ready to go now to turn off this device the exact same thing just hold down the on/off button vibrates as it turns off and you can take a look at the ceramic chamber in here very decent chamber size 0.33 of a grand it holds and honestly guys it takes about 30 seconds to 45 seconds to heat up 45 seconds being at the highest temperature which isn't bad for this sized vaporizer here we go with how to clean the light it's very simple all you have to do remove your mouthpiece you can use the brush that comes with it give the chamber a quick brush just like that in between use also for a quick clean after each session just give the silicon interior piece a quick brush as well then for your stirrer tool stir tools right here remove the air intake chore and clean out any crumbs I left a little bit in there to show you guys that this actually does work and it does collect some crumbs so you just got to give that a quick wipe in there you can also insert the rush clean that out as well so just slop that back in there also with the stirrer tool it also can help you give it a quick clean in between just to get out your extra if you don't have your brush on you now the mouth this silicone piece inside removes from the actual mouthpiece and I'll show you guys how to do that so you just use your star tool fit it right in here pull out the silicone gasket and give all of this equipped clean you can take a q-tip with rubbing alcohol just clean it and brush it in there same thing with in here and also the inside part of the chamber you can also clean that completely with the rubbing alcohol as well just make sure in between use after you are done cleaning it just to run it through a cycle just to burn off any extra residue of the rubbing alcohol before use again mouthpiece just goes right back in there like this very easy to pop right back in touch it back on then reinsert your stirrer tool right here which is very handy for a couple of things not just stirring your herb what else into help out with the cleaning process just like that so guys overall I think the light by vapium is a great portable vaporizer to be honest with you for a hundred bucks it's it's a great price point it's a great starter leap for somebody that's never used a vaporizer before or even somebody that's looking for a second vaporizer if you're one of those that might have one of the higher-end vaporizers or a desktop this will be a great addition to your collection and vaporizers the vapor quality produced is pretty nice it does the taste the taste is there even though it does have the math the plastic mouthpiece it does have it does come with a silicone inside that adds to a little bit of the smoothness and the taste so I would say it's pretty decent so let's check out the vapor clouds that the light produces the battery life the battery life is decent it's about 45 minutes which isn't too bad for a vaporizer this size the great feature about that having an only having only 45 minutes of battery life is that the USBC charger you can just charge this so that's also another great feature that even though it's only 45 minutes of battery life you have your charger that you can charge well use so that takes care of that issue there so the portability with this guy is great it literally almost just about hides in your hand it's only three point nine inches in height so it's just under four inches it virtually doesn't weight much at all I think it's about 88 grams which is not too much definitely something with this size that you fit into your back pocket it can fit into a gym bag it is it has a mat the plastic mouthpiece so there's not too much to worry about if you accidentally drop this guy you're not going to be you know running back to the store trying to get a piece to replace it because it is pretty sturdy so the ease of use and portability is amazing I would definitely recommend this to anybody that's never used a vaporizer before so Lexie's tip of the day so guys with my only main tip with this would definitely be to always carry your charger with you because it's not a microUSB it's actually the USBC so that's not a standard charger but it allows you to charge while using which is great also another tip would be to try the water peace adapter so this little guy here is the water peace adapter it goes on switches out from your regular mouthpiece and then just put it into your mom turn it on for some extra filtration so definitely guys give that tip a try try it make some comments give me your feedback tell me what you think about the water peace of doctor if that went any better for you if you like using that instead of the regular mouthpiece or oh sorry or even without using it right so to give that a try guys and see how you go with that thanks so much for watching this review guys I really do hope that you enjoyed the review of the light by vapium if you have this vaporizer we would love to hear from you comment in the comment section let us know you think what's your favorite feature on this device if you're looking for more information check out the description section below there is links to purchase there's links to find out more information also don't be shy subscribe to the channel we have a lot more reviews coming out that will be released as we go along and I do these reviews for you and we'd love to hear your comments and your feedback on them thanks again so much for watching and enjoy your vaping and light you [Music]", "G4qL1OoEFY4": "[Music]", "zVdvBbXoD5U": "how's it go on YouTube this is Alex coming at you for TV TV in the studio with a very special tutorial review of the utili him to look guys it's not my fault these things keep wrapping okay you Tilian with their excellently reviewed you Tilian 5 dip their toes into the world of wax and have decided that they liked it that sounded gross I did not mean for that to sound gross and now they're back with a utility into a price conscious option for the extra consumer we're gonna dive down deep and let you know if this unit is worth your hard-earned dollars but first if at any point you like this video throw some thumbs up would you if you're gonna go scrubbing your way through it at least leave us a like before you bounce and if you'd like to pick up the U Chilean 2 by the time I'm done links will be in the description below without further ado let's get into it inside the box you'll find this schmancy little case which contains you Tilian to the USB charging attachment and a wax tool the Italian 2 is a straightforward device that features a one-button operation similar to most wax pens on the market five clicks will turn it on and two will change between the four voltage settings the easy loading magnetic mouthpiece is simple to pop on and off load a rice great amount of your favorite wax or concentrate into the chamber and then press and hold the button to start heating the atomizer it takes about 10 seconds to heat up to temperature then inhale and enjoy the utility to has four temperature settings that cover your bases in terms of extraction they're indicated by the light on the button and the bottom of the device Green is 3.0 blue is 3.4 purple is 3.8 and red is 4.2 volts at the price point for voltages covering that range is not bad at all this allows you the flexibility to find the type of vapor you're looking for and I found for all intents and purposes it gets the job done the vapor quality of the utili into was surprisingly impressive don't get me wrong we've come to expect this from you Tilian after the utility in five but for such a budget-friendly device the vapor was great the dual quartz coil is good for flavor and you get a decent amount of cloud production of course as you increase voltages you'll get a little bit more cloud production and a little bit less flavor but again I found the cloud production on the utili and - especially at lower voltages to be acceptable and the flavour to be surprisingly good glass mouthpiece is the icing on the cake and does a great job of cooling down the vapor at least a little bit before it hits your lips obviously we're talking in the price point here and it's not going to compete with units like the utility at five or any of the earrings that we've covered the focus vCard of the puff co peak the pulsar rock but again in the price point it does a really good job it's clear that a lot of thought was put into the vapor quality on this device I love a simple design and the utility and - does not disappoint when you pick it up it has a little bit of heft to it which I like it feels nice in the hand and the stainless steel body is sturdy I wouldn't throw it against the wall or anything like that just because of the glass mouthpiece but the device feels well built and solid the utility - comes in black and gunmetal gray I have the black one here I'll be using the gunmetal gray up in the corner both finishes look great personally I prefer the black as it matches the rest of my electronics but the gunmetal gray one is pretty sleek too my favorite part of most small wax bends like this is the included carrying case which makes taking this thing around super easy and the case can just slip right into your pocket the utili into has an internal 650 million power battery pretty standard in the wax pen world and that will usually last you about a day's worth of sessions of course depending on usage for all practical purposes I found this to be adequate I'm like I've said before not a huge wax guy but this is a great travel buddy if you just want to hit it once or twice over the course of an evening if you're looking for something that you want to hit constantly over the course of the night I might choose something with a little bit bigger battery but if you're looking for something that just gets the job done quick and dirty the utility in two does not disappoint the size of the utility in two makes it a great travel partner the battery isn't huge but bring a backup battery and you should be alright preload this little guy and carry them around with you and you can take a quick discreet hit on the go the utility too is pretty simple to use five tabs to turn it on three to change between temperatures like we've seen a thousand times before and that magnetic mouthpiece makes loading super easy I honestly found everything about this unit to be simple and I didn't even need to pick up the manual cleaning on the utility too is pretty easy as well really the only thing you have to worry about is the atomizer and I feel like a q-tip with a little bit of isopropyl alcohol or a Zeus grime stick if you're lazy like me we'll get the job done especially if you do it right after a session when the chamber is still a little bit hot the utility too is a very budget-friendly wax pen with some great features with easy loading one-button operation for voltage settings and a convenient carrying case there is a lot to love about this device and that's it for this one guys thank you so much for watching this video if you enjoyed it if you learned something please slap that like button if you really enjoyed it hit subscribe in that little belt to stay

topic we'd rather not think about where does last night's dinner go what you may already be grossed out just thinking about it this question leads way to a significant subset of civil engineering and a massive amount of public funding just like all dogs go to heaven all drains in the city lead to a wastewater treatment plant where that wastewater gets turned back into water that we can drink now you may be thinking that you'd rather just let bygones be bygones and not think about this nasty part of real life but here's the thing chances are you've drunk water that was waste at some point so you might want to take some time to understand this engineering process that makes dirty water clean here's where it starts the toilet once you're done doing your business and flush that magical handle your waste ends up at the inlet of one pretty interesting place a wastewater treatment plant why is this place so interesting because it takes arguably one of the most disgusting substances in the world and turns it back into something that is essential to all life flushing just until 8:00 at halftime may not seem like a big deal but when you couple it with thousands if not millions of others doing the same it can result in some pretty high sewage flow rates New York City has an array of 14 wastewater treatment plants that handle a combined 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater daily that's enough waste water to fill the dead sea with pure sewage in just 8 years and that's just New York City there are an estimated 14,000 748 treatment plants in the US alone that 76 percent of the USA's population relies on according to the American Society of Civil Engineers understanding wastewater is crucial to understanding the critical infrastructure needed to support modern life that brings us to the first step of the process that handles larger items in sewage things like flushable wipes two-by-fours toys or even guns you name it and it's probably been caught in a bar screen our screens are exactly what you would think they are large vertical bars that stand at the inlet of nearly every waste treatment plant designed to stop larger items from getting to the plant in hurting machinery like pumps this first process where bar screens are used is commonly referred to as pretreatment the sole intention of pretreatment is to remove the outliers in the sewage and make the whole mixture a little more homogenous or slightly less chunky our screens are typically mechanically raked at certain intervals depending upon the flow rates of the water treatment plant although some older plants will still have more manual removal processes whatever is removed from the bar screens is then sent off to your average landfill or solid waste handling facility or in the case of unusual items such as guns that they're sent off to the evidence Locker and a police station to be investigated next up is the grit chamber grit chambers are the next steps in the pretreatment process following our screens since these bars don't catch everything larger particles called grit still need to be removed from the sewage as it is made even more homogeneous as the sewage flows into the grit chamber the velocity of the rather viscous sewage is adjusted to allow for particles of sand and rock to settle out this is needed because these particles can't be removed using chemicals and they could potentially clog or destroy palms later on in the process there are three types of these chambers horizontal grit chambers aerated grit chambers and vortex grit chambers which all accomplished the same task using slightly different methods following the grit chambers the sewage will move on to the primary treatment process which starts with a large Basin called a primary clarifier primary clarifiers and clarifiers in general function on the principle of settling velocity this term can be defined simply as the speed at which a particle settles for wastewater being pumped into clarifiers it's important that the flow rate of the water being pumped in doesn't exceed the settling velocity of the particles trying to be removed in order to accomplish this engineers will vary the size and number of primary fires in accordance with a plant's permitted sewage flow rate this ensures that at varying flow levels solids can settle out of primary clarifiers to the correct quantities at this step in the process the slightly treated wastewater which is referred to as effluent is free of solids larger than 10 micrometers and should be all organic matter which will be treated further the top layer of the clarified water flows over a weir wall and into the next basement the process called the aeration Basin now begins the process of secondary treatment the sole focus of which is to significantly degrade the biological content of the sewage in many cases this process starts with aeration basins effluent flows into the aeration basins at the bottom of which are hundreds if not thousands of tiny air blowers that create bubbles through the water the water is pumped into this tank along with something called returned and activated sludge you can think of return activated sludge is a bunch of happy little bacteria that get to eat their favorite foods all day long this introduction of significant amounts of bacteria along with the massive amounts of oxygen injected from the bubblers creates an environment perfect for the process of aerobic digestion summarized simply it's the breakdown of organic matter along with the use of excess oxygen some older plants will add in another step before aeration basins referred to as bio filters or trickling filters found in many older plants these filters essentially trickle the effluent over a medium like stone or plastic and allow for a film of bacteria to chow down on any organic matter in the water this step is largely not used in newer plants due to more efficient and effective modern processes but for plants with basins already installed many still use them because they only benefit the treatment process in most cases following aeration basins the effluent along with much of the sludge is pumped into a secondary filter or clarifier where some of the sludge is removed and pumped back into the aeration basins as the returned activated sludge further settling of larger particles is also accomplished in these basins as it is the final step of the process that will remove solids and larger biological matter water flows out of secondary clarifiers over a nearly identical Weir wall to the primary clarifiers moves on to the disinfection process at this point 85% of all organic matter is removed from the water and the effluent should be safe to drink in most cases although you probably wouldn't want to disinfection is the final step of the process and is usually accomplished in one of three ways either through chlorine ozone or ultraviolet disinfection each process has its benefits and drawbacks with each being used commonly throughout the wastewater treatment process across the world chlorine disinfects the water through chemical disinfection chlorine which you can think of as concentrated bleach is added to the effluent here to kill off any remaining bacteria and organisms still living in the water when chlorine is added to kill off the bacteria it then has to be removed before it can be discharged as to not kill off anything in the discharge location after this the water is safe enough to discharge into a stream or lake ozone disinfection is another method of disinfection that involves pumping an electrical current through the water that causes oxygen molecules o - to disassociate and combine with a free oxygen molecule forming oh three known as ozone ozone is an incredibly strong oxidant and causes microbes cell walls to leak rapid cell decomposition and overall damage to cells in other words it kills off bacteria the last common method uses ultraviolet light to scramble bacterias DNA so that they cannot multiply in UV disinfection the bacteria in the water aren't killed rather they're sterilized rendering them harmless viewer to ingest water with living microbes immediately following UV treatment any harmful bacteria would be unable to multiply or render your body damage Engineers choose between these methods based on a variety of factors such as flow rates cost and location of discharge which brings us to the final step effluent release effluent release exists in one of two forms in most cases then now treated water is released back into a stream or lake or other water source in rare cases usually in areas where water is scarce the effluent discharge from a wastewater treatment plant can be discharged into another treatment plant directly where it will be treed further for sumption this is referred to as full cycle water reuse from a chemical perspective the final drinking water is the same as normal treated water that flows through your pipes now but due to the connotation of your drinking water being sewage just days before this treatment process is normally shied away from or not heavily publicized the entire process of wastewater treatment takes on average 24 to 36 hours from when a drop of water enters to when it leaves each wastewater plant will receive a permit for flow rates chemical levels and effluent quality among other things from the epa that outlines the necessary treatment for a plant wastewater plant operators will make adjustments to a plant's operation and constantly measure levels to ensure proper discharge and proper treatment without these operators into the dirty job that they do around-the-clock our sewage would always stay sewage and sanitation in modern cities would be much much worse wastewater treatment is an essential dirty job and you can thank the 14000 748 treatment plants in the US alone for not having to worry about what happens we'll treat flush [Music] you

for a long time but part of the production process involves feeding acetylene and hydrogen gas into a sealed chamber in a red hot oven in theory you're safe because there's no oxygen in there so it can't burn but if you have a leak a pretty high pucker factor and if you seem tech ingredients recent video it could be a pretty big explosion but something changed recently that got me back into this project just a couple of months ago researchers at MIT released a paper in which they made a material that is ten times darker than vantablack and is also easier to make so I check this out right it looks really dark it looks like I've almost cut something out of the frame this is actually black velvet that you can get off Amazon for two dollars a sheet and it's about 0.4% reflective as it turns out in vantablack is only about 0.1 percent reflective so it is darker but not that much the material in this paper is supposed to be ten times better so point zero one percent reflective I haven't gotten to that level yet and that's actually where I need your help again so when we start looking through this process I'll be pointing out things that I tried and it didn't work the way I expected so I'd like to hear what you think about that all of these vantablack materials are forests of carbon nanotubes so it's basically like a carpet or like a massive hair growing out of the surface here and it's very good at trapping light because the light comes in and gets bounced around among all the fibers there and can't come out kind of like crumbs getting trapped in a carpet and it's actually very similar to the way the velvet works - right very short fibers sticking out of the surface here and it's good at trapping light just get Chris it gets trapped among all those fibers sticking out of the surface so the production process is really interesting what we do is start with something perfectly flat or doesn't have to be perfectly flat but usually it is and we coat it with a whole bunch of catalyst particles these are usually like metal particles like iron or cobalt or nickel and then we put it into a hot furnace with a whole bunch of gases that contain carbon and those catalyst particles convert the carbon in the gas stream into solid carbon nanotubes it's really interesting it grows kind of like hair coming out of a follicle so imagine that you have this chunk of metal sitting on the surface a little hair will grow out of that chunk of metal and eventually become quite long like up to a whole millimetre or so so I mentioned traditionally these materials are grown on flat surfaces like silicon wafers is a popular choice but the recent breakthrough that these researchers at MIT discovered was that if you first textured the surface at the nano scale and made it dark already by sort of tunneling into the surface then grew carbon nanotubes on top of that you'd have this compounding darkness where first the surface is already chewed up and dark and then you grow the carbon nanotubes and the surface of choice is actually aluminum it works out that you can etch aluminum in such a way not anodized it but actually etch it chemically that you end up making the aluminum pretty dark and then you do this carbon nanotube process on top now as it turns out I haven't been able to make this work it's true that mine are pretty dark I'm getting down to maybe about 0.5 percent reflectance which is actually not even as good as the flat vantablack materials but we'll get into the details of what's wrong here let me just show you what happens if you shine a flashlight on one of these if someone's trying to prove to you how great their super dark material is you'll never see them do this if you start with the flashlight far away you're like wow it's looks pretty good but if you bring the flashlight closer and closer eventually you can see the surface and if this were ten times darker you could just get the flashlight closer and also make it as bright as you want basically so this whole thing with dark materials is actually perfect for video even without video tricks I don't mean fudging it but just controlling the lighting and showing people kind of what you want to can make something appear to be very very dark or you can make it appear very very light and there's really no material in the world that could you know withstand this within reason so I just wanted to show this just to put it in context basically what this really looks like so the first step in this process is to chemically treat the aluminum to make it dark basically itch the surface in a nano sort of way that it it's light this already kind of goes against my common experience like a piece of aluminum that's corroding or etching away turns whitish powdery doesn't really turn dark normally and the simplicity of the method is also kind of surprising in the paper the researchers assert that all you have to do is just take a piece of aluminum put it into plain old salt water and use some ultrasound to basically break the surface up a little bit and then just leave it in the salt water for about a day or 10 hours or so and there's a little inset picture in the paper that shows this progression of the aluminum getting darker and darker starts off looking like normal aluminum and then after 10 hours in salt water it turns dark almost black and in one of the news articles they interviewed one of the researchers and he said well it's you know it came out looking very dark they basically asserted that all you have to do is soak it in salt water and it turns dark I have tried many many many things and cannot make a piece of aluminum turn dark by soaking it in salt water and the number of things I've tried is very high I've tried room-temperature 30 degrees C 70 degrees C 10 minutes of ultrasound an hour of ultrasound a day of soaking a week of soaking stirring no stirring iodized salt non-iodized salt DC bias applied to the two pieces of aluminum in the solution raising the pH lowering the pH adding a few drops of ferric chloride adding a few drops of hydrochloric acid adding a few drops of sodium hypochlorite soaking it in sodium hypochloride treating it first in sodium hypochlorite then the sodium chloride it just the list goes on and on and on well I've tried for different aluminum alloys which we'll talk about in a minute and I've never uh I still have not actually got this and then one day I remembered you know I actually have seen aluminum foil turned dark in the kitchen if you put something that's acidic into a container and put aluminum foil over the top and like keep it in your fridge for a while it actually does turn dark in fact I was brewing beer at one time and putting foil over this pot of sort of you know brewing grains caused the aluminum foil to turn dark so the best result I've got actually out of all this experimenting was the foil over the top of a beaker with sodium chloride solution in there and then after sitting on there for an hour or two the vapors of mostly water and I guess some sodium chloride spray turned the aluminum slightly dark but it still didn't help any and this really isn't working at all the way that they said so that's kind of the first problem it would really be nice to figure out what these researchers did actually make the aluminum turn dark and I've read the paper a number of times and still can't figure it out but anyway I really wanted to see this carbon nanotubes growing process work so I basically proceeded any way even though the aluminum wasn't that dark and the whole process still works you just don't get this 10x boost or 10x reduction in reflection due to having the surface being ya know textured like that so anyway the basic idea is after you've treated the surface in some way either an unsuccessful soaking in sodium chloride you want to apply this catalyst solution and so I mentioned that the surface needs to be coated with a whole bunch of little metal the particles iron or nickel or cobalt and when I say coated with particles don't think of like throwing sand across the surface these particles have to be of about the size that you want the carbon nanotube to be so nano these particles are going to be on the order of nanometers in diameter and you can't really sort of spray those out with a gun or anything the idea is that you dissolve the two chemicals in a solution and then soak your substrate in that solution or I actually painted it on and then when you put this whole thing in the furnace and pass hydrogen gas over it the hydrogen will reduce those dissolved metal salts back into the actual metal that they you know the Constituent metals and you end up with these little clusters like it apparently I don't understand the mechanics behind this but as it comes out of solution it will leave little clusters and then when you reduce it in this hydrogen environment it makes nano scale particles of the metal I know seems to work pretty good this was actually the easiest part of the whole process basically just dissolving iron acetate and cobalt acetate in as I found out water is actually the best and then painting it on with a brush or even dipping it in the beaker there another confusing thing in the paper is that they reference an ethanol solution so the process shows the piece being etched in the sodium chloride then rinsed in water then rinsed in ethanol then actually the catalyst solution they seem to imply is actually ethanol it's actually listed differently in two different places in the paper at one point they call it point one molar ethanol which seems to imply that it's mostly water and then in another place they just call it the ethanol solution or something which seems to imply that it's only ethanol so I tried it both ways - this one is just water and this one is ethanol the solubility of the iron acetate and cobalt acetate and ethanol is not that great it kind of makes this nasty looking peanut butter kind of soda sludge at the bottom and I tried it both ways with the same substrate the same kiln settings and everything and I found that water seems to work even better than the ethanol one if you search the literature for making carbon nanotubes forests you'll find that a really popular way of depositing the catalyst is not using a liquid solution like this but actually putting it into a sputter machine and sputtering these metal particles onto the surface I haven't tried that myself I've always just gone with the solution and I think that one of the other big breakthroughs of this sort of easy aluminum coat method is that you don't need a sputter chamber you don't really need good surface prep in general speaking of the surface and the prep let me talk about the metals that I've tried so the paper actually lists the specific aluminium alloy that the researchers used in addition to just kitchen aluminum foil now they actually specified Reynolds Wrap and this is just Safeway house brand but they did mention a specific alloy and I've searched for that alloy and it does not appear to be at all common it's a very very unusual alloy but I'd be getting the feeling that it really doesn't make that much of a difference just for the record I tried three thousand three eleven hundred sixty sixty one a 99.99% pure aluminum as well as the cheapo Safeway aluminum foil they all perform about the same I really haven't seen any difference there I also tried different surface preparation things I've tried sandblasting scratching with like an a scotch brite pad and also just leaving it fresh or as received so it has a fairly big oxide layer on there again none of this made it really any difference another slight inconsistency in the paper is the duration of this ultrasonic treatment so at one point in the paper it makes it sound like that you want to ultrasound this for like 10 hours it says the treatment time was 10 hours or something using ultrasound but then later in the paper it says actually it was 10 minutes of ultrasound at the beginning and then the soaking period lasted a whole of 10 hours so I've also tried different variations on this and I also suspect that maybe my ultrasound machine is more powerful than the one that the researchers used the reason I say this is because if you put aluminum foil into my ultrasound machine and run it for 10 minutes it comes out looking like a shotgun has blasted it which is kind of normal in my experience I'm not really sure perhaps they're using some weird kind of sonicator I don't know didn't say anything in that regard I also suspected that dissolved oxygen in the sodium chloride solution might have had a problem so I've also degassed it by boiling let it cool under you know a sealed atop and then also tried it and still didn't have any luck so while this misfortune was happening with the aluminum I was thinking I wonder if I've got another material that has this sort of dark ya know textured porous surface quality and what do you know I actually just did a video on graphite which happens to be a porous very dark carbon-based material seems perfect and actually as it turns out it is great you just have to you know what to treat the surface at all literally just grab a piece of graphite paint on the catalyst stick it in the oven and it will grow carbon nanotubes it's not that much darker unfortunately it's it's about as good as these partially successful pieces of aluminum that I've made but it is very easy it's literally just grab it paint it with the catalyst and throw it in so that I have not seen listed anywhere else I have seen carbon nanotubes grown on larger carbon fibers but I haven't really seen anyone talking about growing them on graphite which seems to work sort of automatically okay so let's say we've finished getting our unsuccessful aluminium or graphite or whatever coated with the catalyst and now it's time to grow these carbon nanotubes on the surface the idea is that we want to control the atmosphere around these parts and control the temperature at the same time and a good way to do that is to use this thing called a tube furnace for obvious reasons the idea is that there's a continuous tube of quartz going all the way through here with some heating elements in there and it can get very hot I actually built this oven myself to go up to eight or nine hundred degrees C luckily this method proposed by the MIT researchers is it operates at a much lower temperature about five hundred degrees C unfortunately that's still much higher than the ignition temperature of acetylene so you know if there's an air leak you're gonna basically be in deep trouble with this thing I made this tube furnace myself and wanted to have a really large diameter tube going through traditionally tube furnaces are on the order of just twenty or thirty millimeters in diameter but this one is actually much larger and I think that may be causing some problems with the growth as we'll see later on just because the volume in there is so much larger but I made this by getting some insulating firebrick and carving them out with one of my favorite tools the shaper and I was able to basically just draw with a pencil where I wanted the heating elements to go and then trace that out with the shaper and cut these channels for the heating element and then it's just a matter of stacking the bricks together and cutting a hole for the tube to go through one snag that I ran into is that if you search Amazon or Ebay for quartz tube you'll find lots of things that are tubes but they aren't quartz in fact they're meant for these outdoor flame lamps like these heat lamps that restaurants have and yeah it works fine in that case for Boris so look at glass but if you put this into a furnace and expect to get up to seven or eight hundred degrees C that tube is not going to survive so if the price of your quote quartz tube is only about seventy dollars you can be sure that it's actually borosilicate glass if you search for a quartz tube and it costs you know two or three hundred dollars it's a good chance that it's actually quartz to seal this up I made these aluminum end caps myself on the lathe and earlier in the video you'll see that I didn't have this sealing o-ring in here and I just relied on some Kapton tape to basically pull this thing on to the end of the tube and just seal on this flat seal that's on the end the piece here I did that maybe a few times and then was really kind of getting nervous about air leaks and stuff and so I added this o-ring so that when this thing gets pushed inside here it actually makes a really nice seal and we can be sure it's okay these other ports are for other experiments this spark plug is a high voltage passed through there was one paper that I read a long time ago that used a field an electric field to actually grow the carbon nanotubes in a specific direction because they're conductive and I guess applying a field grows them in a certain way but anyway I didn't try that and this is just a pressure sensing port the tube furnace is connected to a mixing manifold and in the manifold is supplied by all of these gas cylinders on the floor and also my big argon welding cylinder that's connected with a hose that goes across the shop so the gases that we're using here are hydrogen acetylene carbon dioxide and argon and the sequence basically applies argon and hydrogen first and the purpose of that is to reduce this catalyst back into metal and then we switch the the hydrogen off and go to acetylene and carbon dioxide which are the two gases that actually cause the carbon nanotubes to be grown so you've probably seen like an acetylene flame as pretty like there's a lot of carbon in there it's kind of the same idea we're basically putting something in there that's going to create this suit it's just that the suit is grown in a very ordered fashion because of all the conditions that are met the carbon dioxide actually serves as an etchant and so we don't want is amorphous carbon like we don't want to just grow a bunch of charcoal in there that wouldn't be very absorbed of to light what we want is this forest of highly ordered fibers and so the idea is that the carbon dioxide actually edges away any amorphous carbon that might be made and clear to clears the path for structured nanotubes to be made another funny thing about the literature on growing carbon nanotubes is that they typically don't talk about the pressure in the furnace it's absolutely true that many of the papers published in the past have been growing carbon nanotubes at reduced pressure like very low like potentially less than a tenth of atmosphere but then there's also papers that grow right at atmospheric pressure and typically they just specify the flow rate not the actual pressure in the chamber I've read entire papers where they just never talk about the pressure and it's kind of one of these bonehead things where it's like if someone's trying to replicate it how can you do it without the pressure anyway in this MIT paper I'm pretty sure we're talking atmospheric pressure and these flow gauges are actually hooked up the wrong way around if you see like the valve should actually be on the inlet so that the pressure inside the tube is atmospheric but I had this set up for a vacuum thing and didn't want to reconfigure it so what I did was I just have almost atmospheric pressure gas coming in and it's close enough where it's not going to make that big of a difference another thing is that all of these controllers are configured for air and if you want to use them with a different gas you have to use a correction factor and this is fine there's nothing weird about that we're typically flowing at it rates around 20 standard cubic centimeters of minute and the correction factor for co2 is like point eight and the correction factor for acetylene is like 1.05 or something like that the only other problem I had with this whole setup is that the only gauge I had left was this one and ideally I would want much more range here like I you know the flow of argon that we need is actually very low compared to what this gauge measures but anyway getting through this I really didn't feel that the the gas flow is much of a problem so I didn't I didn't alter this very much as I was going through and trying to make this work I assume that the gas flow is totally fine on the other end of the tube furnace I have another cap and a connection to my vacuum pump and so to reduce the chances that there's any air left in the tube what I would do is seal it up with the samples inside and then run the vacuum pump for a few minutes to pull out all of the air and then switch over to this bubbler that I have just to see if there's any gas coming out of the tube and fill it up with argon and hydrogen and all the other things that I need so this way there'll be no oxygen in the tube at any point because I've pulled it all out at the beginning of the experiment here you can see my progression getting better and better at making this stuff these first three you were made without hydrogen altogether because I was trying to avoid using that gas and as it turns out without hydrogen comes out looking pretty awful so I started using hydrogen from this point on and it does get better and better a few things that I learned positioning something near the inlet of the tube furnace is not so good so maybe the temperature isn't correct there or maybe the gases haven't really mixed or maybe the gases are cold but the substrate is hot or something but basically setting this whole thing up at the end of the tube furnace so that it has enough time for the gases to get hot and mix properly works a lot better I've looked at these samples with my scanning electron microscope and found the surfaces as you'd expect not quite as good as it should be so first of all thats aluminum edging thing doesn't work like I looked at the raw aluminum surface to and didn't find any evidence of this etching process going on but after looking at the completed carbon nanotubes the surface is actually mostly globular like there's definitely some hairiness going on it's pretty clear there are carbon nanotubes there but it's mostly gloppy like could see clearly the process is not working as well as it should these the reflectance of these samples should be more like 0.1% or even slightly better and I'm currently at about 0.4 or 5% here's how I'm measuring the reflectivity of all these samples I have my trusty IKEA gooseneck lamp here shining right on the sample and then the input fiber to the spectrometers aiming down at the sample and the incidence angle is about equal here although I don't think it's super critical and then the idea is basically just put samples in here and check how much light is coming out pretty straightforward calculation and I've looked at both the sort of raw power and found it in a specific wavelength and also looked at the whole spectrum and I've done it a few different ways and everything seems to agree for my reference I'm using a piece of white paper and assuming that this is 90% reflective so all of my data are based on the fact that the paper is 90 percent which i think is pretty close I also wanted to test some other dark stuff since I know the paper I'm stating that the paper is 90 percent reflective it's actually hard to find things that are as dark as Fanta of course and so there's no way to sort of lower bound this range of sensing but anyway I tried to find some stuff Swit from a candle is actually pretty good you can just take a piece of aluminum and put it in a candle flame coat it with soot and that ends up being about 1.7 percent reflective just standard flat black paint which of course is black I mean it's black paint that's about ten percent reflective so way more you know it's it's it's an order of magnitude more than the soot and the soot is an order of magnitude more than the phantom black so we are talking about pretty dark stuff here as I mentioned the black velvet is around 0.4% and the stuff that I'm making is about equal to that about 0.5 or 6 even percent I also have a little sample of professionally made vertically aligned nanotubes these aren't made to be super black like they're made for their the fact that they're vertically aligned as opposed to super black but anyway they were made by someone else who knows more about more about the process than what I'm doing and these also came in at about 0.5 percent reflectance so breaking this point five percent things is kind of where we are right now I'm curious to think to hear what you guys think about this whole process maybe maybe you don't more about this including maybe you're even one of the MIT researchers and you can tell me exactly how to make aluminum dark but in any case whatever you'd like to say I'm always interested to hear it so put that in the comments and I will see you next time bye", "Xrq8lhI61cs": "all right today we're gonna be showing you the Dark Knight and introducing you to it and how to operate it first off you're gonna grab your Dark Knight and then you're gonna press one of three buttons and that's gonna be the top one which is your power button you're gonna click it five times consecutively which would turn the LCD screen on and your dark knight would actually start heating up automatically but you can adjust best temperature for you before you start I like it personally at the Midway highest I like to be out like five 60 and you can actually press this button one time which would turn on this light it's optional I like it personally because it it turns from red to green the green would tell you that it's pretty much fully heated and you're ready to be vaporizing and pretty much what you would do is three options we have dry herb honey oils or ejuice when you're just using the dry herb you would just put it in the coil s-so and just put the top on like that when you're gonna be actually using any of the e juice or the honey oils you're going to be using this glass file and pretty much what you would do is place the glass file in the middle of the coil put on this rubber stopper then put on your glow and if you hit the button five more times it turns your LCD screen off and the whole device and that's the Dark Knight and how you operate it and as always you can check

be recapping those very quickly so the first TL DR episode we'll be talking about CPU coolers and how they work we talk about the materials comprising the copper cold plate or aluminum cold plate thermal conductivity heat pipe wicking vapor chambers and the fins and how it all actually works to conduct heat away from your CPU cores let's start with a bottom-up workflow of how a CPU cooler works first off there's the CPU silicon which generates all of the heat the heat is conducted by the IHS or integrated heat spreader and from that point the IHS is communicating through a thermal compound between the IHS and the copper cold plates of your CPU cooler or aluminum in some cases that thermal compound is critical because it fills microscopic imperfections in the service of the IHS and the service of the cold plate for the CPU cooler without this compound the imperfections would be filled with air which has a much lower watts per meter Kelvin rating than thermal compound in fact it's about 0.02 4 watts per meter Kelvin for air whereas thermal compound is generally between 4 and 8 or so once the heat has been transferred to the cold plate the next key item is the heat pipes the heat pipes make contact with the cold plate and within the heat pipes is contained and evaporator believe it or not the heat pipes actually contain a liquid it's effectively a coolant and that is a composition of ammonium and ethanol or sometimes distilled water the liquid is heated up by the heat generated by the CPU and that creates a phase change this is critical to the process there's a ton of energy loss in the form of heat in a phase change and when that energy is lost it's because the liquid is now turning into a gas and so this gas starts traveling up the heat pipes at which point the heat pipes make contact with the aluminum fins these have a large surface area it's another key word here and the service area spreads the heat across the entire area of each effective layer within the aluminum fins the fins are then cooled by the cooling fan which pushes the heat off of them and out of the case so that the process can continue ad infinitum at this point in the process the gas makes it all the way to the top of the heat pipe at which point it is condensed and through capillary action it trickles its way back down to the bottom and repeats the process once the gas condenses back into a liquid the liquid trickles down the sides of the heat pipe normally made either centered groove or mesh we've copper grooved wicks run cleanly down the center of the tube and sintered wicks have a more porous and foamy look to them weave looks like a basket weave design and the high end air coolers will generally use a composite heat pipe instead which means it's a compound of multiple different designs so they use a copper powder which helps with thermal transfer and also helps with these steam movements so steam moves more quickly through the heat pipes composite and centered heat pipes cost more than grooved pipes but theoretically offer better performance and this feeds into the next point which is that material matters thermal conductivity or watts per meter Kelvin dictates the efficacy of cooler materials copper has a 401 watt per meter Kelvin thermal conductivity at 25 Celsius aluminum is 205 watts per meter Kelvin and then you've got your thermal compounds in your air after that we've tested and found that alloy and copper cold plates have minimal impact on cooling performance when using liquid coolers but haven't yet tested it with air coolers conductive heat transfer is expressed through 40 A's of law which is Q equals ka DT / s where a equals heat transfer area K equals the materials thermal conductivity s equals material thickness and DT is the temperature difference across the material or Delta service area and roughness also matter in this equation and larger CPUs like the LGA 2011 chips need a larger surface area cooler to contact all potential hotspots on the IHS using a cooler built for smaller CPUs like the silverstone AR 0 1 or hyper 212 will result in a poor edge performance on larger CPUs surface roughness should also be considered as it is needed to be as close to perfectly smooth as reasonably possible indirect contact is the result of rougher surfaces and that means a loss of full potential afforded by the copper and alloy materials which have the four hundred or 200 watt per meter Kelvin thermal conductivity measurements instead we end up relying more on thermal compound to bridge the gaps which is significantly lower in its quote unquote K rating than the metals and then there are vapor chambers vapor chambers help draw heat away from vrm coolers by hanging down from a chamber design similar to a heat pipe in some ways but they are better deployed for localized heat generation by high heat large areas like the VRM and the vrm coolers this helps spread heat more evenly across the fins as well so it's not just a BRM benefit and few devices use of vapor chambers but the ones that do the erratic we should dissipate that heat better across the service area and draw heat away more effectively from other non CPU components that neighbour the CPU so that's everything you need to know about the basics of CPU air coolers and how they work we'll do another video on liquid coolers and if you're interested in learning more about this topic you can hit the link the description below from my 2012 article I wrote on the same idea and it's got a bit more depth than you'll

the first thing we want to do is we want to collect the manure off of the ground and we will be using a special rake it's called a menorah rake it picks up the manure balls and leaves the dirt and rocks behind so as I fill up a wheelbarrow full I'll be taking it over to the gas digester and I'll see you over there over at the bio guide digester I've brought over a wheelbarrow full of pony manure and as you can see I have a surplus of manure there so what we will be doing is we will be checking out of what you can see from the top most of this is underground over here is the mixing basin you see a wooden handle sticking out of the top there there's a plug at the end of that handle and I pull the plug and the water goes down into this big dome it's about five feet deep and it has a all cement and capped a dome as you can see how I was constructing it here a cement wall cement floor and we put a dome on top and then we have a pipe going out there's an overflow chamber and there's a chamber top and then the inside and outside of the dome to hold the gas and now that's what we did to hold air pressure or gas pressure so over at the mixing Basin we have basically this wooden stick there so I don't have to stick my hand into this slurry when I want to pull the plug when we fill it up the excess after the main chamber or the digester spilled will flow into this excess chamber and as you can see that there's a slurry there of a mixture of water and manure there and that's after it's been broken down and goes into that chamber and it flows out that little canal there onto the outside dirt and from there when you get a pile there that's broken down you can shovel that into your garden so I'm going to get a hose and get some water into this mixing base as you can see turn it on there and then I'll start shoveling the manure the manure that I am using is fresh manure because the old stuff it gets baked by the Sun and doesn't break down in the water the Sun kind of makes a hard coat on the outside and then the water can't penetrate the the manure ball so we use the fresh stuff freshly picked up and I put about three scoops in there and then I grab a mixing rod here basically this is something that you can get a home depot it's just a drywall mixing for mixing mud and works very well breaking it down and I'll spend about a minute just kind of pushing it around breaking down those balls and the more we break down now the less time it takes inside the chamber I will also want to make sure we don't have sticks in there and in straw as you can see some of that's in there so I pick it out once in a while now on a bigger scale you wouldn't need to do all this by hand you can automate everything having a disposal of some sort or mulch or even so as I mix that up talked about a minute and then what I'll do is I will pull that plug and this slurry will go down into the pit now the mixing Basin is at a higher level so gravity will just take this down into that pit and that pipe that goes from the mixing basin into the pit there into that digester it goes in at the bottom of that digester pit okay I think we've got it here next what we do is we will pull that plug just grab that plugs a simple plug you can get a home depot for black ABS pipe and I just pull that and down it goes and it goes into there once it's done I put the plug back in ready for another one like started pecking around of filling up this Basin just to show you what it's like when it fills up at the other end the overflow so we're going to do a second round here filling it up so I got the water on again and I'm adding that manure once again and just quickly go through the mixing again I do the mixing same thing as before and then from there I'm going to be looking at it from the other end now here's where the overflow chamber is at the opposite end of this whole system and when I pull that plug over there take the hose out I'm going to pull that plug you'll see at the end that little canal you'll see the XS go out see it pouring out there that is the absolute overflow that's already been broken down and ready for the garden there's no odor to it it's ready to be used as good compost you don't see a lot of clumps there it is broken down so there's a lot of water kind of like a septic tank how everything breaks down so it just kind of comes out as a kind of a dirty water anyway that's what we have on the opposite end so looking at the dome we got about two feet of a trapped gas at the top of that dome and then at the top you'll see there's a pipe here I've set a pipe I ran that pipe to the house and here's where we get a useful part of this thing gas to use it the house so over here at the base of the house where I have this pipe have an extra key handle or key off there and that pipe goes all the way upstairs to where the kitchen is so I run the pipe underneath the counter and as you can see under the counter here the pipes there so my beautiful wife and I have a cutoff valve there's I got three total those I've got a regulator to back off some of that pressure so we can get that stove to work and then I made a bubbler and that bubbler is to keep flashbacks from happening in case your flame goes back up the pipe you don't want it going all the way back up to the biogas digester blow that whole thing up so it'll stop here in the water so that's why we have that two safety precaution so over here I added a gas handle there to the stove disconnected the original propane on one of the burners and ran a separate line through the back of the stove and Here I am lighting it by hand but I'm turning that gas on that special valve and as you see it lights up and we can cook with that so now we turned a useless manure into good gas and now you can see the bubbler you can just see how much gas flow there is now when I'm actually using the gas and when I turn the gas off you can see how low it goes should actually totally stop I think I may still have a leak and then the only other modifications I wound up having to do is I had to change the orifice setup and the air flow that goes around into the orifice area so I made a little pipe to restrict some of the air and drilled a couple holes put a pipe in and is the like a sleeve I stuck that down into the range there and then the other thing I did was had to change the Orcas size to work with the methane instead of propane and so that's what we did for the cooking unit and that's it", "Q-vxTVU6Cjo": "saltwater aquarium care welcome to another edition of Rotter Tube Reef check out the 125 gallon aquarium all the tangs are really happy everyone is showing a lot of color. they look great the fowleri tang is a deep blue purple with the orange fins the fish are about to eat which is why they are following me today i'm going to talk about the importance of making sure your pvc tubing is clean everything with the saltwater aquarium hobby you must keep clean here is the new skimmer by go aquarium the g3000 it is doing really well and this skimmer is sitting in the 2nd sump. I have 2 sumps, each have a protein skimmer here is the go aquarium 3000 protein skimmer capable of filtering up to a 300 gallon saltwater aquarium here is my eshopps S 200 protein skimmer, which is sitting in the first sump this ehopps S 200 is capable of filtering or skimming a 200 gallon aquarium here is the issue at hand. the display tank is about to overflow onto the floor i saw the water level too high. it was touching the glass lids that means the water is not flowing fast enough from the overflow to the sump below look how high the water level is going through the teeth of the overflow the water level should be half the height on the teeth of the aquarium and it is almost to the top of the teeth i went out and bought a brush from home depot. about $7 it's a flex wire brush used to clean laundry pipes. any brush will do this one is used to clean the lint traps in your dryer i cut out all the pvc to see where the clog is. of course it wasn't in the bottom pvc pipes. i cut the pvc pipe out with a hacksaw leaving a straight drop from the overflow to the sump i removed the rotter tube since it is not glued on i turned the water flow off with the 1\" bulk head attached to the overflow pvc pipe i will clean out the pvc pipe with a brush. i thought maybe a snail was stuck in the pvc there was no snail stuck in the overflow pvc, just a lot of gunk, which was clogging the plumbing the water was sputtering out of the overflow so there was a clog. this resolved the issue", "TKdYFSd54Dk": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "NqROZsSBAAU": "mm-hmm not in my house smoking and I gets the hose again you guys going on step 4 Metairie phone and today we're going to be working on building a Stockton stand pipe for your overflow for this project you're going to need a length of PVC you're going to want to make sure it's going to fit within your overflow in this case I needed a one-inch pipe to go inside the baffle that is already installed into the overflow you're going to need a inch and a quarter coupling you're going to need a 1-inch cap and you're going to need an inch and a quarter repair coupling and these guys you don't necessarily need this piece you just need that little black gasket that's inside of I think it's like three dollars for that piece okay things you can't just buy the gasket or at least at my local hardware store I can buy it so that's all you need to build a stockman now we're going to go get some measurements or cut so I put about an inch of that pipe inside that bulkhead and I'm going to want to get over it's really hard to see because this plastic is is so - yeah so I'm looking at probably about a 4 inch you can kind of see it they see that little line across the back wall right there that's where the water is going to be coming into this back chamber and the overflow and I'm going to want my pipe to go 500 half an inch to an inch past that so we're looking at about a five inch cut so now that I have my measurement on how tall my pipe needs to be I'm going to make my cut here I am taking apart the repaired coupling so I can get the rubber washer out put it now I'm going to place together a stockman kind of like a dry run so I can get a better idea of where I need to drill the pipe that's going to be on the inside so I can make some marks okay now that I have it all together I'm grabbing my sharpie and I'm going to make a few marks so where the slip coupling actually covers on the pipe and with the space between the rubber gasket and the lines is where I'm going to drill my hole so water can actually enter into the pipe there's nothing fancy about how I went about drilling this I just pretty much peppered that space with a ovals I guess I did before nothing fancy with drilling the holes just wanted to get the job done now whether this document works is the slug coupling sits on top of that rubber gasket and it creates a space between the pipe and the coupling and the water comes up through that space and down into the pipe and what it's doing is not allowing the air to go into the pipe at the same time right here I am drilling a hole in the cap and I will show you why I'm doing that in a little bit the PC pieces that I'm putting the stockmen into is kind of a quick disconnect that I made I didn't end up using it again so now I need to fill up the tank in the overflow and get this baby rocket alright so this is why I drilled a hole in the top of that cap watch the water level as soon as I put my finger over the Dalton it actually increases the amount of water that it pulls with that pole being covered so this is where a valve comes into play what we're going to do is we're going to take any valve that you have kicking around or you can go to this one pick one up this is one that I just had laying around we don't need the second valve so I'm going to completely close that off I'm going to take some airline tubing put it in the hole we'll be able to dial in that stockman to be a a little bit faster and even a little bit more quiet please so I got the airline tubing coming out of the hole in the cap going to the valve and i justed the valve just right so I could get the most amount of water pull out of the overflow without it making any type of sucking for air sound no it's a pretty quick fix on a lot of these newer overflows that are coming out today I do have these standpipes party built into them but you know it never hurts to be able to make this stuff on your own especially if you're doing your own overflow boxes so that is the stockmen in a nutshell alright guys so I'll see you next time take care", "ZaLHF7h9rTI": "what's up guys Ebola Josh and Tyler coming at you with a new tsunami glass review check you this without ya guys taking away

this is a normal bubble and what it consists of is air on the outside a thin membrane of soapy water and then air on the inside so what would an anti bubble be well an anti bubble would mean that there's water on the outside a thin membrane of air and then there's water on the inside so a normal bubble has air on the outside air on the inside and a thin layer of soapy water but an anti bubble has water on the outside water on the inside and then a thin layer of air so obviously a normal bubble has to occur in air but an anti bubble has to occur under the water because the outside of it is water so it might seem that this would be very hard to make a thin air membrane sphere but it's actually quite easy let me show you how to do it and then after I show you how to do it we'll see what happens to this dance miracle air membrane when we put it in the vacuum chamber but before we find out what happens to the anti bubble in the vacuum chamber let me tell you a little bit about our sponsor for this video last pass so I've been using last pass for several years now last pass relieves the burden of having to remember all of your passwords with last pass you don't have to write reset or even remember your password last pass stores all of your passwords and even auto fills then when you go to any website where you have to login to it even works on your mobile device so basically anything that I need to log into whether it's on my PC or my phone I just go to it and if there's a password that I need to log in to LastPass will pop up and it will autofill the password so basically I don't even need to remember any of my password so I never get locked out of my important accounts so with LastPass you get free unlimited password storage and also you get free unlimited multi device sync and one other thing that I love about LastPass is because you don't necessarily need to remember the passwords you can make your passwords much secur so you don't have to choose your normal password of the action lab one two three but you can choose a password that looks more like this so if you want to use LastPass like I do click the link in my description below and thanks again to LastPass for sponsoring this video so you make an anti bubble the same way you make a normal bubble with soapy water but you use much less soap so I have about 400 mils of water and some ultra dawn soap here put in about this much see if that works ok now once we've made our solution let's just get a dropper here and you'll see that I can have some normal bubbles on top but watch what happens when I drop some water on it look what appears on the top for a second now these may look like normal bubbles but actually they're not it's a bubble of water on top of the water now this is almost an anti bubble but it's not completely surrounded by a membrane of air it's only on the bottom part so in order to make a full anti bubble that bubble of water has to be below the surface completely and the membrane of air has to be completely around it so in order to do that all you do is squirt a little bit harder and it should shoot a bubble down below the surface ok now watch this so now this may look like a normal air bubble but there's something different about it the first thing to notice is it's not rising to the surface very fast it's kind of just floating up very slowly and then also watch what happens when I pop it it seems like the bubble just disappeared so here's how fast a normal air bubble rises you can see how it just shoots to the top so this bubble that you see here is not an actual bubble it's not an air bubble but it's actually an anti bubble and I should mention that the way I'm keeping it down is I'm blowing a jet of water on it so that's keeping it down below the surface so in order to prove that that was a sphere of water surrounded by a thin membrane of air let me show you by putting some food coloring in this so now the water that's going to be inside of my anti bubble is now going to be red and the water outside should be clear or less red okay here we go you can see it there look at that so now you can clearly see the perfect sphere of red water on the inside and then the perfect sphere of hollow air membrane and then the water on the outside so cool try another one that's a big one look at that look how cool that is so now I'm really interested to see what would happen to that anti bubble in a vacuum chamber because it's just this thin sphere of air with water inside but in a vacuum that thin sphere of air should expand so what will happen to that sphere of water inside and then that the coolest thing you've ever seen a liquid water bubble inside a bubble an anti bubble now the hard part will be making the anti bubble and then keeping it down under the water so it's going to float up and it's going to hit the top surface of the water so hopefully once it hits there it'll just stay below the surface so let's try to make an anti bubble without it popping and then see how long it can last in the vacuum chamber okay here we go gonna make our anti bubble there's one trying to make a better one okay it's on the surface there okay is it growing seems like it might be getting bigger the bubbles above it are definitely getting bigger Oh a pot so let's try to do a red one okay there it is okay the vacuum is on [Applause] Oh apart so we got down to around 1/3 of an atmosphere but what's interesting is the size of that sphere didn't actually change that much compared to the size of the bubbles that were on the surface of the water it hardly changed at all you could see how much those bubbles on the surface starting to grow started to grow when we decrease the pressure in the vacuum chamber basically because the pressure inside the bubble was more and so that bubble just started expanding as we decrease the pressure and the vacuum chamber now I know it's not just because it's underwater because if you have just a bubble of air underwater that bubble will still expand and I know this because I've put a balloon underwater in the vacuum chamber and as the pressure decreases the balloon still expands like normal but the anti bubble did not expand like that it only changed a tiny little bit and the reason that it only changed a little bit is number one the volume of that bubble is actually really small and so there's not a lot of volume to begin with and so you don't see as drastic of a change and another reason is the surface tension of that bubble is very strong because you have to water membranes the inner and the outer and those are continually pulling on the bubble keeping it locked into that shape kind of like if I were just to stick a ping-pong ball in there the ping-pong ball is actually strong enough to not expand at all and so you don't see a big change in volume so the stronger the membrane the less change in volume you're going to see so it seems like that air membrane is actually pretty strong in there because we starred Li saw any change in volume so things to last pass again for sponsoring this video remember to go check out LastPass by clicking the link in my description so this was a really cool experiment it showed that the anti bubble doesn't expand that much when it's in the vacuum chamber nothing compared to the expansion of a normal bubble in a vacuum chamber which is really interesting basically what that means is that that air membrane is actually really strong so strong that it doesn't expand much though the pressure decreases in the water around it and thanks again for watching another episode of the action lab I hope you enjoyed it remember to click the subscribe button if you haven't subscribed yet and hit the bell to be

"[Music] welcome to hacksby shed when i adjusted the spindle bearings on my lathe i found that i had a problem with lubrication at low rpm so i made a transparent cover for the gearbox and i can watch what's going on and i can show you what the problem is this is looking down into my gearbox and the only feed to the spindle bearings is this splash channel here and it runs down there and then there's a magnetic plug and it runs past that and down into the spindle bearing but it relies entirely on oil being splashed from the gearbox onto this ledge and into this splash channel i'll set it going and show you the problem i'm going to start at 34 rpm and build up from there and i can tell you that no oil is going to get onto this ledge until we get somewhere around 200 rpm so that's 120. well we just started to get a little bit of splash at 130 rpm let's take it up a bit more [Music] well we got to 150 and still nothing going on the ledge it's just getting onto that ledge at 2 50 rpm now a number of people suggested that if i use thinner oil i might not have that problem the oil that's in the gear box now is iso 68 hydraulic oil which is the equivalent of the old shell telus 33 which is what the lathe had when it was made in about 1970 something like that it's quite thick and when the weather's cold you know it's really quite thick and gloopy now a number of people have suggested that i'd be better with atf and i did think about that for quite a long time i've kind of come to the idea that atf is meant for automatic transmission and also some versions of atf are not yellow metal friendly now there's a lot of bronze in my gearbox there are not many bowl races ball bearings taper bearings on the shafts uh quite a lot of it is hardened shafts with bronze bushing so i was quite concerned if i used an oil which wasn't yellow metal friendly and i was watching double boost john his channel he's got a harrison 140 and he was using royal purple oil so i did some research on that and i found that there were two versions of that oil that might work in this case one is called synchromax and the other one's called gear max now synchromax is intended for manual gearboxes as i understand it and they're both yellow metal friendly i went for the gear max version 75w 90. if i put the thinner oil in the lathe gearbox and it lubricates low rpm then happy days nothing else to do job done but i'm suspicious that won't be the answer so i bought myself this little gear pump from ebay which we'll take a look at in a minute which i'm powering from an old pc power supply but before we get to that i want to just test the difference in the thickness between the oils and i'll do an experiment which you've probably seen on youtube many times but i think it's worth just looking at it because these are my choices of oil rather than something just theoretical i've put 50 milliliters of iso 68 hydraulic oil in here and we'll just see how long that takes to run out go [Music] so i'm turning this on the stopwatch on my phone i'm afraid this isn't very exciting for you but it'll get better 25 26 seconds for that so now i'm going to try the atf so this is atf2364 which goes in my son's bmw zf gearbox about 18 and a half seconds for that one versus 25 for the hydraulic now let's try the royal purple so here's the royal purple guess what color it is it's 9 degrees centigrade in here 48 fahrenheit okay let's test this one there one two three go well this isn't going to solve the lubrication problem i don't think it's just made a big hole in my pocket that's all because it's about 25 quid a bottle for one u.s squad about 51 seconds whereas the iso 68 was 25 seconds i think so here's the pump and two pipes i bought this strainer i think it was about 10 pounds it's very expensive actually but it's stainless steel with a brass fitting and the idea is that that would just lay in the bottom of the gearbox and strain the oil that was being drawn up obviously it gives some resistance to flow we'll see how we get on it's my intention to set this lower down the lathe and therefore you'd get a gravity feed through this down into the pump the oil in this can is the iso 68 hydraulic oil so we'll see how we get on with that [Music] watch what you're doing i'm not going to demonstrate the other oils with the pump because i'm just getting oil everywhere and you can see that it works it strains a little bit but having this power supply from a pc in the lathe could be really useful because it gives me 12 volts 5 volts and 3.3 volts i think and my son suggested that i could install a radio with a large subwoofer but i was thinking perhaps you know air horns or something like that so next we need to look at the gearbox itself and see where we might put the paintwork by having the pump external and easy to access means that if this pump isn't really powerful enough i'll just look for another i can upgrade it any time once i prove the principle we're a day further on and i'm still trying to justify spending 50 pounds on oil which was thicker i have a plan this test that we did the viscosity test this had a very thin nozzle on it and i'm just thinking perhaps there was some boundary condition which made the oil a bit sticky you can see i'm making this up to try and justify what i've done but i've got this other which has a bigger hole in it and we'll just try that so i'll put 50 milliliters in and we'll time it into here give me a second to set it up okay original oil from the gearbox right six seconds and now the royal purple about 11 seconds so yeah about two to one these by the way in the uk for about 25 pounds when i looked at royalpurple.com online buying from the states it was 16 but i can't buy direct because they won't ship it so somebody's uh doubling the price before it arrives here it's often the case you see something in the states a hundred dollars and over here it's a hundred pounds but it's not normally double the ratio is about 1.37 to 1 i think at the moment i'd convince myself that the iso 68 oil was thick but looking at this table i can see that the 75w 90 is 1.6 times more viscous at 40 degrees c in fact atf is only about 30 percent thinner than iso 68 for the oil feed i'm thinking about making a manifold so i've got a block of brass to do that i've got these fittings and the thread is 1 8 bsp and they have an olive and they take a four millimeter pipe and if i put this block within the lid maybe this area somewhere and then all i need to do is to run pipe work that runs really just onto this ledge here and then another tube pipe going to the left hand spindle bearing and then another just going onto the clutch bearing and keep if i can keep all of that within the lid itself it minimizes interference with the main body of the gearbox now i'm going to have to think about the pickup and the pickup is probably going to have to go towards the back the oil in this gearbox is really quite shallow maybe only about that if you can see my fingers there we are only about that probably and when the lathe is running in the forward direction all the oil gets pushed to the back over here but when the lathe is in the reverse direction the opposite's not true you just see the normal oil level at the front so to be sure that the pickup would always be in oil it's going to have to go in this back corner somewhere down at the bottom of the gearbox so i've got to figure that out and then the pump itself i'll try and put as close as i can to this block so we keep the pipework short because obviously it's a lot easier to run electric cables up to this corner perhaps than it is to um you know run copper pipes everywhere which will restrict the flow cause too much drag on the floor so what i'm going to do now is take the end case off the lathe and just have a look where we might put the pump and where we might put the oil pick up 5 16 salon this pulley i made is doing all right right as i look from here i can see some of this wood so without cutting any metal away on this casing i could possibly get a couple of pipes in there you can see that wood there from the lid i could cut more of this case away if necessary without damaging anything i'd then have a couple of sharp copper pipes coming out coming into pvc tubing around here to the pump when i wanted to take the lid off i just pull the two tubes off and it would come away there's about one inch of oil in the bottom of the gearbox and when i check my strainer that needs about 20 millimeters of oil to sit in so if the strainer sits right at the bottom of the box it might be okay or if i can lay the strainer on its side i don't know yet this motor these holes they're nice brass fittings but there's the hole in there is under two millimeters and i think the pump's got more capacity than that you probably saw that the flow was a bit strained so i'm going to see if i can improve these this is what i'm talking about if i unscrew these the whole if it will focus is about two millimeters maybe but that doesn't go all the way through but if i turn it over you can see that thread there it's only about a three millimeter thread so i'm looking at making some replacements for these but i want to get the cover off the gear pump and just see how much material i've got to play with there's very little in here just this black driving gear this white driven gear a labyrinth of passages and i just want to check the size of these passages the galleries are about two millimeters wide this is a two millimeter drill the front plate on this pump is actually quite thick there's quite a bit of material to play with there and i've got some brass 2ba screws which i might be able to adapt no chance now to consult the zeus tables and look for the tapping drill for 2ba which is four millimeters 1976 metric revision i hope it still works i decided that 2ba is taking up too much real estate so i'm now threading it down to four millimeter by 0.75 mil pitch good morning this is where we got to yesterday making these replacement pipe connection fittings and i'm going to leave that for now because i'm going to take a look at the oil feed supply within the headstock for the spindle bearings and think that through and finalize the design the minimum that i need to do in fact is to run a pipe from here across here and deposit oil onto this ledge it would run along this channel and feed this spindle bearing but i'm going to take the opportunity to lubricate this bearing of the left-hand ball race for the spindle and the ball race for the input shaft which is just sitting this side of the clutch this brass block would be machined to make a manifold and it would need to sit somewhere like this it can't sit over this side because there's a screw hole here which bolts the lid down this bearing is pretty much directly under the block so perhaps just a little spout off this would be enough and the oil would just trickle down on here and trickle down into the bearing if i put a fitting here the pipe could come out and come this way and ditto the other side to take a pipe back here i could simply solder in a pipe coming from this hole out of this casing here i only need fittings really olive fittings where i think i might need to make some adjustment and my idea is that i would fit this first to the transparent case so i can see where everything lines up and then fit it to the aluminium case i could tune it with the transparent case on it may be that i need to close up the hole in the end of this pipe just to balance the flow um between the back bearing and this spindle bearing and i drilled just quite a small hole in here for the feed for this bearing that's kind of the thinking at the moment here's an idea developing this fitting here eighth bsp fitting could go in just below where it is now with the pipe coming across within the lid with a bend on here just tucking it behind where this screw hole is and then i'd put a similar fitting on the front face just to the left here and then potentially one on the end to take the input pipe right i think i'll have a go at that i'm just going to square the ends of this block off in the shaper that looks pretty good these were thread adapters that i put in for a different job i was converting from 8th bsp to quarter whitworth 20. let's see how tight they are because i don't need them for this job obviously no not bad wow that's pretty good they were locked tight and pressed in on the press clean those up with a 1 8 bsp die and i can make sure it's not cross threaded it's going okay yep that's fine this is the layout i've decided on and the feed will come in at one end like this the tapping drill for 1 8 bsp according to the zeus tables tells me 11 32 or 8.75 millimeters so it'll be 11 32 because that's what i've got just doing the third pilot hole i've set a drill depth that's three tapping holes done they look quite good i'll start tapping each hole in the drill press just to keep everything vertical that'll do i think all right get the other two done now so there's the manifold with the three fittings for the three pipes i haven't cross drilled it yet for the chamber going across i'll do that later when i know exactly what i'm doing and this will fit about there and i'll have a couple of screws to hold it i've got some counter sunk allen screws 15 millimeters long m4 by 0.7 pitch so a couple of those will secure this now because of the angle on this casting i'm just having to set this edge away from the bottom but i just need to make sure that this other edge here isn't going to be touching so i'll drill one thread it screw it up position it drill the other thread it so that's the first one tapped i'll just drill through and mark it and then i can work from that okay that's fixed on so the next thing is to figure out how the feed pipe's going to come from this side and into here and what i'm going to use for that these are each four millimeters i'd like to use something more like six internal if i can to bring the oil feed into this manifold block i've decided to use some of this eight millimeter copper pipe and i'll need to put a bend in it to bring it round here and out of this side and then i will solder a piece of this onto at the end of it to give me a pipe barb i'll have to machine down this little bit here to six mil and i'll cut it off by here just giving me that length of barb which i'll then solder into the end of this pipe so to do this i've had to buy a pipe bender for this size of pipe and of course i'm going to have to bend the four millimeter pipes so i bought another smaller pipe bender to bend these pipes anyway put this one to one side and we'll get on with this there we are and a bit of silicon around here will seal it so now i need to drill a hole in here to take this pipe when it's bent i've drawn this up and you can see it's going to be a bit tight pilot drill now an eight millimeter end mill now a six millimeter end mill to create an offset pocket to start my six millimeter drill well i got there in the end i drilled into the first two fitting sockets with a 5.5 millimeter drill and then into the last fitting socket with four millimeter the problem was that as i was breaking through it was pulling the drill off line and if i'd been a bit smarter i would have drilled this one first it's gonna be okay i think let's have a look carry on right see if i can get this bend right now i've got plenty of pipes so i can have as many goes at it as i like really needs to bend from about there i think and i guess r must be the middle one but i don't know how that's going to work let's see it's not making a lot of sense to me oh zero on that one so when zero is there it seems to be 90 degrees well that's quite close problem is the bend's really not quite fast enough but i'll work around that and get it to fit i found this pulley which might give me something a little bit tighter to bend around okay that pipe's in place not solid all i need is this barb to stick out of here so i can pretty much cut this pipe off flush and that'll make it a bit easier how i'm gonna get this lined up to solder i don't know i'll have to think about that i don't think i can do it on here i'm a bit worried about melting it some bits have just arrived for this project one inch bsp plug a quarter bsp hose tail and a quarter bsp by eight millimeter fitting with an olive and either using this one or this one i'll make the feed from the gearbox to the pump anyway back to this so i'm going to cut this here and i'm going to use this hose tail here i'm going to solder this end into my copper pipe here but i need to machine this down to six millimeters and i'm going to do it on my other lathe this is my other lathe it's a super adept and they were made as home hobby lathes i think between 1933 and 1961 by a company in sheffield england and this was given to me by my wife's grandfather in about 1979 i would guess and i barely ever use it but for the first couple of years i was making lace bobbins so here's a couple of my lace bobbins if that will focus there we go and i used to glue various woods together and use this as a wood turning lathe bobbins were quite expensive at the time so we used to buy blanks and i'd machine them up so i've got a load of blanks here and i use these chisels for wood turning and these blanks are all different woods anyway today i'm going to use it to machine a fraction off that brass barb um there's various well this is a four jaw chuck you can see that there's a steady rest there there's a three jaw chuck um there's a tool rest that i made some time ago a couple of different spindles some there's a center there it would have been driven by a belt on this pulley at one time but i connected this bit of hose here onto the end of the spindle shaft and mounted this motor up so that's about a 1953 gc six horsepower motor on a couple of rubber blocks and i made these rings to hold it down which i think are from the differential main output shafts from a mini trying to get the work centered in the four jar is a bit tricky but i think i'm there [Music] oh very naughty i left the chuck key in there we are so the next job is soldering now i've checked the melting point of the solder is about 250 the melting point of the aluminium is about 650 but i don't trust myself and i could get point heat on something if i'm out of this case it's curtains i don't think i'd ever get another one so i'm going to have to solder this on the bench we'll do this hose tail first i don't solder every day so it'll get me back into practice before i do the other end [Music] to try and get this lined up right i've put a scribe mark on the pipe but i've also put a little dot on this block and if i line up the scribe marks and the dot i should get it at the right angle place your bets well the chances of getting this right on the first attempt are not very high um i'll solder it up and we'll see where we get to well there we are first go actually but there we are so let's just try it on the gearbox see if that pokes out in the right place well it's going to need a slight relief by the look of it i'll just i'll just use a round file and just take a fraction off that corner otherwise but otherwise that looks all right yeah i file that casing away to give it plenty of clearance so it will take the diameter of the tube as well now i can move on to the oil pickup from the gearbox here's where the one inch bsp drain plug goes and i'm going to arrange a feed from that in eight millimeter copper pipe the plan now is to run an eight millimeter copper pipe from the drain plug down the back of this panel and coming out somewhere here and for the pump to be in this area now and then a pipe to run from this fitting just pvc clear pipe from this fitting down here and down to the pump and that will give me my circuit so this is the old plug but i bought this new plug just in case i mess up i don't want to be left without a plug for the lathe so i can always put this one back in any time i want and this is the fitting which will fit in there so i need to drill and tap that out now we'll start with a three millimeter pilot drill and then the tapping drill is 11.8 millimeters which i don't have but i do have a 1532 which is 11.9 so that's what i'll use [Music] [Music] now i've got a taper tap and a parallel tap i'm going to use the parallel tap because i think that will give me more freedom in terms of setting the angle that i want to take my eight millimeter pipe in the right direction i'll start it off in here for as long as it'll go which isn't very long look that'll do it's going quite smoothly that i could have used the tapping head if i could have been bothered to set it up but it didn't seem worth it for one hole okay that went well enough perfect the next question on my mind is can i incorporate this strainer somehow it certainly goes in works well enough i could solder this into this somehow i have a plan actually um maybe it means the two wouldn't come apart they would be forever in here but that doesn't matter right this is the plan to incorporate the strainer i'm going to use a short length of this eight millimeter copper pipe i did think about putting that in nice and snugly but i've realized that the oil level will be too close to the top of this mesh so i'm actually going to make this so that this pipe bends down now you might say when i finish tightening this up on the taper it could be pointing down or it could be pointing up if it's if it's a bent pipe but no because i know that i need to be down at about that angle and that's where it will finish i'll make sure it does and at that point this will be bent down just setting up nothing soldered yet but you can see that this is bent downwards and this is set at 90 degrees to this and so this should just bend down to the bottom of the box okay i'm just about ready to solder this end if you can see as i rotate it look this is orbiting up and down what i found was that there's a gear in the lathe headstock about there so i couldn't have this pipe as bent as i wanted but i've done it now so that's how it'll be and it's set so that when this is at the lowest point this is pointing off to the right because that's where i'll need it and it just gets me a few millimeters of extra oil depth above this [Music] done that's fitted in place nice and tight plenty of ptfe tape and right down in the bottom of the gearbox there is the strainer just above the bottom peeking out between those two gears good morning i've drilled myself an eight millimeter entry hole into the case where the pipe will come in and i'm starting to straighten the pipe which is on a roll it doesn't have to be perfect but straightish would be nice come on there we are right second bend i don't know about you i often end up bending my pipes the wrong way going this way instead of this way anyway this one is right and i've lined it up this way so it doesn't go like that i like that see where we get to with this that lays about flat so it's not far out maybe slightly twist not much in fact how about that that's near enough for hacksby shed so i just need to cut that short now and then machine this down on my other lathe and solder it on put a bit of flux on it do you say soldering or soldering i looked this up now don't shoot me if i get it wrong but apparently the original latin origins would have had the l like soldering but the french lost the l so that became more soldering and then the french invaded england in 1066 well and in time you know all posh people spoke french so it was dropped and became something like soldering but apparently in the uk in england in the 1500s it became fashionable to uh sound a bit more latin so the l crep back in again so that's what i read but my i'm sure my granny used to say sodaring and she was born in the late 1800s so anyway if you're a professor of languages at oxford maybe you'll let us know right that's all connected so the next thing to do is to transfer the brass manifold from the aluminium lid aluminum lid to the transparent lid so i can see what i'm doing to set the internal pipes up within the lid bit of fiddling around but got there in the end and i'm satisfied that this block is in exactly the same place as it was on the other aluminium lid so now i can fix up these feed pipes to the spindle bearing and the other bearings it's been a fair bit of work but i've managed to get the pipes in the right place one's gone into that bearing at the back there one pipe is just coming down onto the left-hand ball race on the spindle and this pipe is going across the front here and nicely dropping into that runway and because i believe that manifold block on that transparent lid is in exactly the same place as it will be on the original aluminium lid if i set all the pipes here and transfer the block across they should all go to the same places they're fitted now with a bit of loctite on so i'll just put this back together when i bought this on ebay it said it was good for water and oil and look what's happened to the o-ring luckily i've got some others that will fit all back together so we'll pick up on this tomorrow now and hopefully get it working we're getting very close now i've put this big grommet around the pump and i've used a bit of bronze welding rod so i could put a screw through there just to hold it for a test if i need to i've connected up the feed from the gearbox and put this clamp on so now it's time to put the oil into the gearbox number two get every last drop out of that it's a fraction above the line here comes the oil okay now we're going to find out if the whole thing was worth it at all so you can see this tube here it's full of the purple oil which is now priming the pump i think i've got the pump connected the right way around now because it was the wrong way and we should watch for the oil being pumped up here behind these gears around here and into the cover so three two one go [Music] now it's a bit noisy it's struggling isn't it but it works i don't think i can stand the noise for very long let's have a look in the head the oil is coming out oh yeah i can see the oil running down the pump will probably burn itself out shortly i think it's time to take stock overall i think this has gone much better than i expected it's certainly entirely feasible the oil pump is too small also it's not continuously rated but it was only about six pounds and it's proved the whole principle of the thing so you know it did its job the pipe work within the lid went better than i expected it's probably overkill to set up feeds to all those three bearings and if you don't have a transparent leg which maybe you don't then it's easy to set up a pipe from this corner to the spindle bearing at the front here without the need to see within the lid to set it up it's obvious where it needs to go the oil is too thick i made a bit of a schoolboy error with that but there is some good news my son needs to put new oil in his car gearbox and he probably won't pay me much money for it i might not save money but i will save face we'll leave the oil in here for a while keep an eye on it let's just see when i managed to get the new gear pump if it isn't soon i may well drain this out and go back to the iso 68 oil so overall i think it's worked very well and i hope it was useful to you thank you for watching hacks be shared [Music] you", "joVL70wtLAs": "just are not up water usage in kitchens of ordinary homes a difference of opinion has come between the technical people as to whether the water coming from a kitchen sink is gray water or black water it's our experience that it's better to treat it as black water rather than gray water now one of the simple tricks in the kitchen is to use a shower head instead of contact because a shower head writes water instead of putting it in volume and therefore consumes less in a kitchen you usually use a detention bar to clean the dishes like so and so therefore the treatment system will have to take care of the detergent cup it will also have to take care of the oil and grease coming out and the rice dal and other carbonaceous material coming out let's see how that is done now we go outside the kitchen to see the treatment unit come the first thing we need is a solid strap and an oil and grease pass this is how an oil and grease trap looks water is coming in agency and it's caught here in a pattern where you can see the grease floating that's held back by this particular blade and the second additional chamber also handles a bit more of the grease the solids are deposited at the bottom of these two chambers then you have a big joint pipe which picks up water halfway below the surface water level so that no grease is picked up and that brings it into a three chamber unit again this three chamber unit has a bubbler that we put in from an aquarium so that oxygen is put in and the dissolved oxygen level goes higher energy this leaves the water very well because the organic bacteria grow and eat up all the carbon material inside this water water then comes out of the oil and grease trap into a sand filter but before that this is how an oil and grease that looks the strongest water coming in from the kitchen and the explanation as we gave there before all limply is being held here carbon materials being deposited here what are being taken into the last three chambers without any oil or grease and without any carbonaceous material but then dissolved oxygen being put in through air bubblers to improve the water quality and then it comes out to this sander planted filter once it comes from the sand planted filter you have sand here and plants growing this is very well the roots of the vetiver go into the water and take away the phosphates from it the phosphate is coming from the detergent this is how a planted Sanford the lives water comes in from an island grease trap comes in into this particular root zone with sand is back once the water emerges from the root zone and the pacts and it goes to a fork that's the pond a this pond water can be used for landscaping purpose one of the indicators that we have is to put fish inside it the fish not only tell us what water quality is but also remove mosquito larvae and bacteria from it and not bacteria but mosquito larvae from it if the pond fills up with an overflow pipe the overflow pipe leads into a recharge way outside so the excess water is put back into the ground this way you take care of the kitchen water for you to productive use this water can be used for plants and excess water to be charged into that prefer a good oil and grease trap and blankets and filtered will ensure that about 100 litres of water from the kitchen is put to productive use in the house everything", "Z8UZUzWmZv8": "What's up guys, Matt from VapeFuse.com\nhere, helping to keep you up-to-date with the latest in herb vaping news and tech. Now,\na common theme in portable vaporizers these days, is they include an Aqua\nBubbler and so we've had bunched of questions from people, about how to fill\nup these Aqua Bubblers correctly. So this is from the FocusVape Pro. There's a\nbunch of other vapes out there, like the Dr. Dabber Switch, CloudV Electro\nMini, CloudV Phantom Premium etc. they all come equipped or with optional Aqua\nBubblers. So, I'm just gonna show you how to fill this one up. Your'e gonna want to use some\nfiltered water. So when you think about the temperature of the herb vapor that's\ncoming through your device, that's going through the water too, so in turn, is\nheating up a little bit of that water as it passes through it. Now stuff like\nchlorine that lays dormant in tap water for a while, when heated up turns into a\ngas it's not good for your insides at all. So if you can, always use filtered water\nwith the Aqua Bubbler. If you want to go to that next step and keep the\ncleaning to a minimum, pick up some Piece Water, you can check it out from the\nlink in our description. Piece Water, is a solution, it's pretty similar to water\nit's just been enriched with a bunch of vitamins and minerals, to make sure that\nnothing is sticking to the inside of your glass. So, I always use this in my\ndab rig, in my bong, from using a vape through it and then also in my aqua\nbubbler,  want to make sure I've got some Piece Water. So Piece Water is just\nmake sure you don't have to clean it, basically this keeps the res off\nthe outside of the glass as I said so. Now, I'm just gonna show you guys how to\nfill this up, I just got some filtered structured water here, just pouring that\ninto the bottom of the Aqua Bubbler and you'll see as it sort of starts to pull\nthrough. Now, I'm gonna want to flip that... and sort of bring it up and that just\nmakes that sealed air look there. As you can see, you just keep adjusting\nit, until you're not getting any water in your mouth. I'm just gonna do a bit of a shake\nto get rid of any excess or blow it back... That's about of the stage now, I'm not\ngetting any sort of splash back in my mouth. So as a FocusVape Pro\nBubbler, completely filled up, you can shake that, you can invert it, you can put\nit in your bag as is and no water really is gonna come out or most of it, it's\ndefinitely gonna stay. You might get an odd drop if the airlock sort of\nshifts but as you can see now even playing with it,\nnot getting anything out. So if you want to just change that water or clean it\nover. Same deal, just put it over a sink or a bowl and blow and it just shoots all\nthe water out of the base. We'll just complete it a couple of times... to clear the\nthing out completely and I'm just filling it up again now, into the base like\ngravity do its work, thanks to Newton. Drain that up,  just take a hit until you are not\ngetting it in your mouth. There you have it guys, this is how to fill up\na Glass Aqua Bubbler.  Thanks for watching.

culture and the environment for nature's best hope presented by mr doug tallamy my name is stephanie king and i am the program manager for the institute and we are so excited to have you with us this lecture is one of many opportunities that will be engaging our community with environmental education all of these programs are free to view thanks to the generosity of the national endowment for the arts fulton county arts and culture and georgia council for the arts be sure to register for future opportunities at serenbeinstitute.org events today's lecture features doug talamy doug is an author professor and environmentalist focused on exploring native species and how they impact our world in today's lecture we'll discuss simple steps that each of us can and must take to reverse declining biodiversity and will explain why we ourselves are nature's best hope you can learn more about doug and his work at homegrownnationalpark.org at the end of the lecture we will have a brief q a session so be sure to ask your questions using the chat or the q a feature thank you again for joining us doug take it away okay thank you very much in the screen share and slideshow there we go all right good morning everybody thanks for giving up this beautiful morning to sit inside in your zoom rooms hope we can make it worthwhile i want to talk about my idea of what nature's best hope is but before i do that i want to return to what happened on the east coast not this fall but the previous fall a year ago we had what we call an oak mast where all the members of the red oak group got together and decided to make their acorns at the same time and this is what it looked like in a lot of places well i'm easily entertained so i took one of those acorns and i just stared at it but i was rewarded an insect started to chew its way out of that acorn first to chewed a hole about the size of its head got his head through there and squeezed the rest of his body through that little hole it was a tight squeeze kind of looked like the pillsbury doughboy finally plop down very dangerous time for this insect barber because it's good to eat a lot of things want to get it so it squirms and wiggles its way below the surface of the ground very quickly takes about 30 seconds and down it goes where it stretches in all directions and forms a chamber and within that chamber it converts itself to a pupa then it stays underground for two years after two years comes out as an acorn weevil that's what an acorn weevil looks like a lot of people think they have big noses that's actually an extension of the head capsule and the mouthparts are at the end of that extension and they take those mouth parts and chew a hole down into the center of the acorn turn around lay an egg in that hole and that's how the larvae gets into the egg corn you might wonder why they spend two years underground why don't they come out the next year like most insects it takes 18 months for a red oak acorn to complete its developments if they came out the next year there wouldn't be enough acorns for it that's a good answer of course after they have left the acorn um that is a true hole true vacuum in the acorn and you know that nature abhors a vacuum so in this case she has filled it with three species of tender thorax ants tiny little ants where the entire colony lives inside the acorns that were hollowed out by egg corn weevils and if they find a brand new acorn that's empty they get excited because their old acorns falling apart so they tell everybody and the first thing they do is start to move their colony in they they get into it it takes about 30 minutes but everybody helps carrying larvae and eggs and the queen and after they're in moved in they post a guard there make sure nobody else comes in and they will stay in this acorn for the next two years until it falls apart well about this time my wife says what's your point what are you trying to tell us trying to tell you that that is just one of literally millions of very specialized interactions that comprise most of nature this is another one the relationship between jays and oaks j's are the primary disperser of oak egg horns they will grab an acorn from the the tree in the fall and they'll fly as far as two miles away and then they tap that acronym below the surface of the ground and of course the idea is that they're going to go find that acorn later in the winter and have something to eat but they bury a lot of anchors about 4 500 acorns per day and they only remember where fifteen hundred of them are some gay plants about three thousand oaks every second goal another specialized relationship i found this fall uh what is actually pollinating our witch hazels witch hazel of course are a little small tree shrub that blooms very late in the fall up here in pennsylvania you know blooms well after the leaves are down well after frost uh and i always wonder what's pollinating our witch hazel well if you go out at night you might find one of the winter moth species such as the bi-colored sallow that fly very late i caught a bi-colored salad on christmas eve this year and they're probably the primary uh pollinators of witch hazel and i don't know whether witch hazels are blooming late to take advantage of the winter moths that are flying very late or whether winter modes are flying late to take advantage of witch hazel but at this point they're taking advantage of each other you won't have pileated woodpickers breeding anywhere near you if you don't have a lot of carpenter ants because that's what they they rear their young on and you won't have carpenter ants unless you have the large trees that make those carpenter ants you won't have this bee adrenophacealii unless you have facilia that is the only pollen that that bee can rear its young on successfully and it turns out that pollen specialization is very common in our native bees we have about four thousand species of native bees and almost a third of them are highly specialized they can only reproduce in the pollen of particular plant genera so for example where i live there are about 13 species of native bees that can only reproduce in the pollen of perennial sunflowers you won't have a baltimore checker spot unless you have white turtle head so on and on and on nature really is a series of very specialized relationships today though these relationships nature itself is on the ropes and it's on the ropes because we didn't take teddy roosevelt's advice way back in 1908 teddy heard that the state of arizona was going to mine the grand canyon so he went to the canyon and he looked out over the edge and he said leave it as it is and with those five words he uh initiated the the process of creating the grand canyon national park the problem of course is that leaving the country as it was is not an option anymore we didn't do that it's only about five percent of the lower 48 states it's anything close to its original pristine ecological condition and that's because we have we've used the country i mean we've blogged it repeatedly we've we've tilled it we've drained it we've grazed it we've got 770 million acres of rangeland in this country and that is four and a half times the size of texas of course we've we've paved it and otherwise developed it we've straightened our rivers and dammed them and you can spell that any way you want we have polluted our skies and changed our climate for centuries to come we have drained our aquifers and introduced more than 3 300 species of plants from other continents to north america and many of those are running amok in our natural areas in short we have changed those natural layers we have we have fragmented them the tiny little remnants of their former cells and each one of those remnants are too small and too isolated from other cetera it's to sustain the species that run the ecosystems that we all depend on why have we done that it's a good question i suspect we thought the earth was so so large we could fowl it forever and there wouldn't be any consequences of course we were wrong about that and that's why we're seeing headlines like this at a pretty regular clip the insect apocalypse is here what does it mean for the rest of life on earth talking about global insect decline followed by this one north america has lost 3 billion birds in the last 50 years that is one third of the north american bird population gone now the u.n says oh we're going to lose a million species to extinction probably in the next 20 years and i love the way they report these these headlines um they might as well say we're going to lose oxygen in the next 20 years and then go on to the next headline i mean this is not an option folks i'm not going to lose a million species without serious serious consequences we have to make sure that doesn't happen so i could go on talking about the pox that we humans have delivered upon the environment that's upon all of our houses but that's not what this talk is about this talk is about a cure for that box and it's secure that'll take small efforts from lots of people but they will deliver enormous physical psychological and environmental benefits to everybody let's return briefly to this headline insect apocalypse is here what does it mean for the rest of life on earth well eo wilson the most famous entomologist of all times harvard emeritus he's 92 he still writes a book every year he told us what it would mean if we were to lose our insects and he did it way back in 1987 with this paper the little things that run the world and his message was very clear life as we know it depends on insects and if they were to disappear so would most of our flowering plants and if most of our flowering plants disappears it would so so radically alter energy flow through our terrestrial habitats that the food webs that support our animals the amphibians the reptiles the birds the mammals would all collapse and they would disappear the animals would disappear the biosphere the living portion of the earth would rot because we would have lost insect decomposers that right now rapidly turn over nutrients and all we would have is is bacteria and fungi and of course humans would not survive any of those drastic changes the good news is that doesn't have to happen we can save our insects we can save our birds we can save nature itself but we're going to have to change the way we landscape in order to do it why is that where remember humans are totally dependent on healthy ecosystems we are products of nature we can't live independently from nature i know we think we can but we can't we depend on what we call ecosystem services that are produced by nature here are some of the things that plants give us uh oxygen pretty important clean water also important how about carbon capture enormously important in today's world of climate change plants are pulling carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere out of harm's way turning that the carbon in that molecule into their own tissues and then pumping the extra carbon into the ground through their roots our soils are brown or black because of carbon that plant roots have deposited there over the eons plants build topsoil they hold it in place they prevent floods they dampen severe weather lots of really important things what do animals do for plants well they provide pest control services for those plants they pollinate nearly 90 percent of our flowering plants they disperse plant seeds and other things so designing landscapes like this that destroy the production of ecosystem services is just not a good idea never was a good idea but today it's a terrible idea because we have almost 7.9 billion people on the planet which means we need more ecosystem services today than ever before and instead when we landscape like this we're getting fewer and fewer uh there have been been visionaries through the the ages who have recognized that we humans needed to work on our relationship with planet earth and aldo leopold was one of the most eloquent wrote extensively in the first half of the 1900s one of the things he said is the oldest task in human history is to live in a piece of land without spoiling it now there have been some indigenous groups that have been good at doing that but you know our our huge western societies and our huge asian societies are terrible at doing that we habitually take more from the earth than it has to offer completely wrecking an area moving to another one wrecking that um aldo knew that wasn't wasn't a sustainable relationship with the planet earth so he had uh this idea he called it the land ethic he had a dream that we could actually learn to use the earth we had you know we have to farm it lumber and graze and do all of those things but then we could learn to do that gently in a way that doesn't actually destroy local ecosystems and that's what he called the land ethic he wrote about it in the same county almanac what he did not talk about was developing a land ethic where we actually lived and i'm not sure why that was but i suspect the notion that humans and nature cannot coexist in the same place at the same time that was so deeply embedded in the culture of aldo leopold's day still embedded in our own culture that he may not have recognized it as an option what i want to argue this morning is that living with nature not only is an option it is now the only viable option that is left to us you know in the past conservationists worked pretty much exclusively where there weren't a lot of people we now need to turn that on its head we need to save nature actually reconstruct it where we've torn it apart where there are a lot of people because that's pretty much everywhere in other words we have to find ways for nature to thrive in human dominated landscapes not hang on by a thread temporarily but thrive permanently in human dominated landscapes where are we going to start let's go back to private property we can't ignore it that's because most of the land out there is privately owned 85.6 percent of the us east of the mississippi is privately owned if we ignored private property we'd only be working on 15 of the land which means we would fail it's not enough of the land to do conservation on but there are a lot of conservation options that we are not taking advantage of right now how about power and pipeline rights of ways there's 21 million acres in those types of landscapes railroad rates awaits another 3 million acres roadside 17 million acres golf courses 2 million acres you can do a lot of conservation on golf courses airports 3 million acres the denver airport is twice the size of manhattan these are large areas then we have all the places we live in rural areas suburbia our cities hundreds of millions of acres in those landscapes if you end up just these areas and you can think of others that's 599 million acres that we could be doing conservation on that right now we're really not taking advantage of how big is 599 million acres it's big it's bigger than vermont plus new jersey plus maine virginia new york georgia florida oklahoma montana california even texas so not having a place to do conservation is not the issue uh there's plenty of places we can do conservation almost anywhere now when i'm talking about conservation i'm really talking about rebuilding the nature we have dismantled but all species don't contribute to to the ecosystem function equally so we have to start with the building blocks the most important species and then other species that depend on them can be added later so what am i talking about well there's two groups that we can't do without we talked about those plants particularly those flowering plants well you're not going to have the flowering plants unless you have the pollinators that allow them to reproduce so we need we need those species but we also need so those species are going to capture energy from the sun turn it into food which is now in the stored in the leaves of the plants but if the food stays there in other words unless something eats those plants we don't have any something any other species most vertebrates don't eat plants directly they eat something that ate plants and that's something typically as insects but it turns out caterpillars are transferring more energy from plants to other animals than any other type of plant eater so unless we want all the energy to remain locked up in in leaf tissues and have no functional food webs we need to have landscapes that support a lot of caterpillars let's use the carolina chickadee as an example that's the chickadee you have down there in georgia they of course are birds that are our feeders all winter long eating seed but when they're reproducing their babies can't eat seeds so they switch to insects and if they're in a healthy environment they will rear their young exclusively on caterpillars and they are not exceptions most of our birds are wearing their young eye insects 96 of them as a matter of fact are wearing their young and insects and most of those insects turn out to be caterpillars how do i know that there's lots of lines of evidence that suggest this but this is a citizen science project that my my recent phd student ashley kennedy finished not long ago she put out a call for bird photographers across the country to take pictures of birds during the breeding season when they were carrying food back to the nest they were going to send those pictures to ashley she was going to identify what the prey items and the beaks of the birds were and then reconstruct the nestling diet of all the birds that she she got pictures for she got thousands of pictures and she was able to reconstruct the nestling diet for 20 of the common bird families the green bars that you're looking at here are the percentage of those nestling diets that were caterpillars and in 16 out of the 20 common bird families caterpillars dominated the diet so again what would happen to our breeding birds if we constructed landscapes that don't have a lot of caterpillars they wouldn't be able to breed something special about caterpillars what is it well actually there's several things special about caterpillars and one of them is that they are relatively soft prey items think of this this caterpillar is a piece of sausage little sausage with a very thin wrapper the thin wrapper is exoskeleton it's cuticle made of chitin it is undigestible so birds don't want a lot of that and because caterpillars are soft you can stuff them down the throat of your your offspring without fear of injuring them and if you've ever watched a parent bird rare it's young they're pretty rough they take that beak it's like a plunger they just stuff it down there caterpillars are also relatively large prey items one medium-sized caterpillar is equal to the biomass of 200 aphids now some of our smaller birds do chase aphids around do you want to chase 200 aphids or get one caterpillar the nutritious they're very high in fat very high in protein they have a low percentage of chitin compared to most other insects like beetles for example beetles are not like little sausages they're like little tanks most of a beetle is undigestible and they have a lot of sharp edges and finally caterpillars are the best source for carotenoids a source of carotenoids for birds during the breeding season i mentioned carotenoids not because i love organic chemistry but because i'm a vertebrate and you're a vertebrate and birds are vertebrates and we vertebrates cannot make our own carotenoids only plants make carotenoids so we have to get our carotenoids from plants and we have to get them from plants because they're essential components of vertebrate diets and that's why my my wife cindy makes sure that i have access to a lot of carrots to get my beta-carotene and a lot of tomatoes to get my lycopene and whatever that is to get my lutein and if i eat those things they stimulate my immune system and i cannot think of a better time to have a very strong immune system their antioxidants they run around our body protect their dna from oxidative damage they improve color vision when your mother said eat your carrots you will see better she was right she didn't know she was right but it turns out she was right carotenoids improved sperm vitality they improved sexual attractiveness now we're talking about things like this male profanitary warbler who is bright yellow because he's had access to lots of luteins and the brighter yellow he is the more ladies he attracts so where are they getting their their carotenoids from from of course the prey items that they eat but carotenoids are not equally distributed across bird prey items these first two bars here are types of caterpillars they have far more carotenoids than other types of bird food third bar is orthopteroids things like grasshoppers and crickets and katydids here are the adult caterpillars down here the moths and butterflies themselves they have far fewer carotenoids because they're not eating green leaves it's the caterpillars that eat the green leaves where the carotenoids are and here is the earthworm way down here so the early bird gets the earthworm but he doesn't get any carotenoids does the carotenoid content of insect prey influence how birds hunt for for prey items well ashley did another study with bluebirds she took gopro cameras and put them on the rooftops of bluebird houses and those cameras took a picture once every second the idea was to get a picture of the bluebird as it was flying into the house with a prey item and then identify the prey item and see how much carotenoid it had in it well she had a lot of gopro cameras and she had a lot of blueberry boxes and she did it for three years so she had more than a million pictures to go through but out of the million pictures she had 7 628 that were good enough that she could identify what that prey item was and she got a very nice relationship caterpillars were brought back to the nest more than anything else they have the highest level of carotenoids followed by those others which have the nest highest level then everything else is nestled down here so yes it suggests carotenoids are important components in in bird prey choice but what it's really telling us is that caterpillars may not be optional parts of bird diets it's looking like they are essential parts of bird diets so okay birds need caterpillars how many do they need that's a good question let's go back to uh chickadees how many caterpillars does it take to make a nest of chickadees it takes a lot one or two a day is not enough it takes thousands to rear one clutch of chickadees and chickadees are a third of an ounce by the way that's four pennies worth of bird these are tiny birds but but thousands to get six thousand and nine thousand get those caterpillars to the point where they leave the nest and after they leave the nest they continue to the parents continue to feed the babies another 21 days but they're flying all around so nobody's counting those uh so you're talking about tens of thousands of caterpillars to make one clutch of chickadees and if we want chickadees reared in or or breeding in our yard we have to have that many caterpillars in our yard chickadees forage about 50 meters from the nest they're not flying five miles down the road to the nearest woodlot and if we landscape in a way that does not have all those caterpillars that's called bird decline you won't have breeding chickadees there you won't have breeding anything there and so this suggests that insect decline is directly related to bird decline if we if we look at the original data set from rosenberg at all who said we've lost three billion birds in the last 50 years and divide those birds these are terrestrial birds divide them up into two two groups the ones that require insects at some part of their life history and the ones that do not so things like doves and finches can reproduce without insects they actually gained a few numbers over the last 50 years but the birds that require insects on average lost 10 million individuals per species it doesn't prove cause and effect between insect decline and bird decline but it certainly is suggestive that those things are linked so in an abundance of caution i suggest we start landscaping in a way that supports caterpillars so many things need them how do we do that how do you add caterpillars to landscapes you do that by adding the plants that make those caterpillars there is a catch though and that is most plants don't make a lot of caterpillars so we have to be fussy about it we have to choose the ones that do and we have to be fussy about it because the caterpillars themselves are very fussy about which plants they eat and nothing illustrates it better than the the monarch butterfly you can have all the chameleons and all the crepe myrtles and all of the boxwoods and all of the burning bushes and all the calorie pears and all the other asian ornamentals that we landscape with typically and you won't make a single monarch butterfly because the only thing they develop on is milkweeds that's called fussiness that's called host plant specialization and most of the insects that eat plants are host plant specialists why because plants have made them that way plants don't want to be eaten they want to capture the energy from the sun and use it for their own growth and reproduction so they've loaded their leaves with nasty tasting chemicals secondary metabolic compounds that make those leaves either bitter or downright toxic and it's a really effective defense that keeps most of the insects of the world from eating most of the plants of the world and that's why it's green out there in the summertime not because there's no insects out there that want to eat those plants it's because most of the insects that are out there cannot eat most of the plants they are too well protected and if you don't believe me as soon as it greens up go out and eat a plant see if you like it you're not gonna like it there's a reason it's hard to get our kids to eat their vegetables they inherently know that they're toxic that's my little joke but this is not a joke insects do eat plants how do they get around those chemical defenses that's where the specialization comes in every lineage of plant that's out there protects itself with a unique compound of chemical defenses now a particular insect species cannot adapt to all of them so they pick one or two and they get really good at getting around those particular defenses they develop the enzymes that store and excrete and detoxify those compounds the behavioral adaptations and life history adaptations that minimize their exposure to those compounds but it takes a long period of exposure to those plant lineages for all these adaptations to to fall into place and once they do the insect is locked into eating those particular plant lineages they didn't develop the adaptations for anything else that's called host plant specialization and that is why when we bring over plants from other continents our insects can't eat them they haven't been here long enough for our insects to adapt to them how long does it take many many many thousands of years so it's not going to happen in our lifetime all i'm trying to say here is that plant choice matters if we want to reconstruct the food webs that support the life around us we have to choose the right plants or it's not going to work and i'm going to give you three examples of how well it does work but we do choose the right plants and i'm going to start with with our house right here in oxford pennsylvania we bought a uh it was a farm that had uh you know was sold off chopped up into 10 acre lots the last it was a very old farm had been farmed for 300 years the last thing they did was mow it for hay but around here what when you mow for hay you're really mowing all the root stocks of all the invasive plants from asia multiflora rose and earlier bittersweet and japanese honeysuckle and bush honeysuckle and privet and all those guys you know about those guys and then you call that hay so when they stop mowing when we bought the property that's what came back all the all the uh the nasties from from china so this is what our property looked like 10 acres of invasive plants that's my wife cindy getting ready to clear it all if you have a serious problem with invasive plants don't give up it is a lot of work there's no doubt about it we have to stay after it but it can be done and cindy proved it um what was i doing while she was clearing the land i was telling her she was doing a great job but i also was putting plants back that's important and the object was to increase the biodiversity at our our depleted landscape as fast as possible well in order to do that you got to have those caterpillars because they're the basis of the food web and you're not going to have the caterpillars unless you have the plants that make them so i started by trying to attract the canadian outlet i'd never even seen a canadian outlet if you want canadian alice and that's what the adult looks like just like a leaf you have to have meadow root because that's the only plant they eat well we didn't have any menorah i didn't know any meadow root around us the you know the land really had been farmed to death for hundreds of years so the meadow room was long gone but i got some seeds from some place planted the meadow room i you know i did not really think that canadian outlets would find our little patch of metaroo quickly if at all so i didn't go out and and check my meta group for about a month and a half and finally i just walked by and lo and behold it was almost defoliated with canadian health they had found it right away i was amazed and now we've got a a healthy population of metaroo and canadian outlets it's a big success so we've added two species to the property same thing with the goldenrod stowaway by the way that's a misnomer has nothing to do with goldenrod it's a specialist on this plant biden's aristosa i did know where there were some bidens in a power line cut about 14 miles away so i got some biden seeds i planted them people call this ditch daisy by the way they grew really nicely uh and uh it took about a year for the golden rod stowaway to find our bidens um but they did and now we've got a good population of both of those and now we've added four species to the property wanted the hackberry emperor not because it's the most beautiful butterfly in the world but it's part of the fauna that should be here but as its name suggests uh it would be it requires hackberry it's a specialist on hackberry we didn't have any hackberry so i planted hackberry we had to wait four years for the hackberry emperors to find our hackberry but they did and now we have a good population of both i walked by one of my heckberry branches this past june and on a single branch there were nine hackberry emperor caterpillars so it was great so i've added six species now this is how it goes i didn't plant goldenrod came in on its own and along with it came many of the species that eat golden rod there's 110 species of caterpillars that eat golden rod at my neck of the woods like the the brown hooded outlet the arcidua flower moth the golden rod leaf miner the distinct sparignothis the goldenrod gall moth this is one the goldenrod flower moth that has not come to our property i don't know why that's what its caterpillars look like so but this is part of the fun this is this is anticipation it's like waiting for the ketchup to come out of the bottle every year i go out to my golem around and i look and try to find the golden rod flower moth one of these years i will find it and that will be a great day planted virginia creeper yes virginia creeper it's a good native plant uh it can climb our trees without strangling them without girdling them without pulling them down has good fall color uh you you don't notice the blooms they're little green flowers but it's a magnet for our local pollinators very valuable makes important berries for the birds in the fall and it supports many of the big sphinx moths that are the primary source of protein for cardinals when they are reproducing so things like the pandora sphinx and it's beautiful adult the lettered sphinx the hog sphinx the abbott sphinx all on virginia creeper very important plant i want to see if i get the zebra swallowtail because i think it's the prettiest swallowtail around now we are just north of the northernmost population of zebra swallowtails on the east that that i know about we're about 26 miles north of that and you know i didn't know if we could actually attract these guys of course zebra swallowtails are specialists on paw paws and we didn't have any papas so i planted paw paws we did have to wait we had to wait nine years for the zebra swallowtails to find us but they finally did uh in the meantime we got the paw paw sphinx i didn't even know there was a paw paw sphinx and we're getting lots of papayas every year i want to see if i get to track the double tooth prominent just because it's such a cool looking caterpillar it's a specialist on elm i planted american elm they came right away one of the evening primrose moth because it's beautiful and i like beauty like anybody else so we planted evening primrose the moth came and it's it spends the day with its head stuffed in the flowers it's very cute and we planted lots of oak trees now these are just examples of the plants we put in our yard i want to focus on oaks for a while though because they are such important plants this is the bedford oak in bedford new york and people argue about whether it's 400 years old or 500 years old it's enormous but you know i've heard i've heard people say i'm not going to plan it out because i won't live long enough to enjoy it well if it has to be 400 years old before you can enjoy it you're right it won't but if you enjoy what the oak does if you enjoy the process of it becoming a big oak and all the things that contributes to your land you can enjoy it right away and i can say that with confidence because i planted my oaks as egg horns or as two foot bare root whips acorns by the way free bare root whips dollar fifty and right away they started to attract the moles that run the the food webs that bring in all the animals to our our yard things like the solitary oak leaf miner the juveniles dusky wing the yellow shouldered moth the orange-headed epicolema the red wash caterpillar the yellow vested moth the orange tufted oneida the spiny oak caterpillar the red the two spotted oak punky the variable oak leaf caterpillar the red humped oak worm the orange humped oakworm the pink striped oak worm the delightful dagger moth the pleasant dagger moth the lesser of daggermoth the greater oak dagger moth the street daggermoth the afflicted dagger moth the crown bukilatrix the white blotch heterocampa the oblique heterocampa the red line panapoda the laffer and literally hundreds more species of moss have come to the oaks on our property including the bernie mean caterpillar he comes in the wintertime because he wears gloves and they come right away this is a a pin oak that has just popped its head above the leaves and here's a crocus geometer standing on the ground eating the leaves of that oak so they start to contribute right away you don't have to wait centuries before your oaks start to build the food web at your yard this is our house as it will look in a month and a half maybe i'm sitting in this window right now we have lawn we're very traditional but i put a lot of plants back and i noticed right away that as soon as you start to put plants back the life around you comes in i started i made a goal four years ago to take a picture of every moth species that has come and is making a living on our property and i am up to 1033 species of moss that i have photographed so far on our 10 acres now pennsylvania is 2.4 million acres so on 1 240 thousands of the land area we're supporting 40 percent of all the moss species that are found in pennsylvania and because many of these are types of bird foods we have recorded 59 species of birds that have bred on our 10 acres not flu by but bread which is 38 of all the terrestrial birds in in pennsylvania i'm giving these statistics to convince you that this works and it's important to know that because look at these headlines we saw this in the fall world wildlife fund says we've lost two-thirds of wildlife from from planet earth since 1970. but i'm thinking point not at our house i am i know that we have com we have increased biodiversity at our house by at least two thirds and probably more than that and it didn't take nearly that long and we did it simply by putting the right plants back so don't give up you hear headlines like this we all want to jump off the earth don't give up we can turn it around but i know what you're thinking we have 10 acres maybe you don't will it work in a small suburban lot let's go to margie and dan turpstra's house in kirkwood missouri um they live on 0.6 acres 18 times less land than cindy and i have right in the middle of suburbia they're surrounded by everybody with the big lawns well the first thing they did when they moved into their house was get rid of their prominent invasive plant which is bush honeysuckle it's all over the place out there um logistera machiai hammer honeysuckle so they got rid of that they planted a lot of native plants and they also put in a feature that they call a bubbler it's a little water feature for the birds and then they sat back and started to count the birds that have used their yard they're up to 149 species including 35 warbler species just to put that in perspective we've only recorded eight werbler species at our house so on point six acres they're doing really well yes it works on smaller properties what about urban yards let's go to pam carlson's uh yard in uh in chicago and i mean in chicago right on the other side of this wall here is o'hare airport one of the runways of o'hare airport over here is kennedy expressway pam has one tenth of an acre that is three times smaller than the average lot size in in north america well she did the same thing she got rid of her invasive plants she put in 60 species of native plants a water feature and then she started to count the birds that have used her little little property and it's an island because it's there's no connectivity with any natural area around her she's a little speck in the middle of chicago but she has attracted i gotta adjust that she's up to 118 species of birds that have used her her yard uh great hornell came by the other day including a woodcock haven't seen a woodcock lately go to pam's house there it is sitting right there what about city centers though 82 percent of us live in cities like atlanta right in the middle of there well i was 2014 i was staring at this plant the sclepius tuberosa people call it butterfly weed you know but that reminds me we got a serious marketing issue with with our native plants we call them weeds and wonder why people don't don't plant them it's not this is not a weed let's not call it butterfly weed let's call it monarchs delight okay we're staring at monarchs delight 2014 the first thing i saw were two species of leaf cutter b mega kylie b i know they're leafcutter bees because they carry pollen on their tummy not on their their legs but leafcutter bees have very strict requirements not only do they need pollen and nectar but they also need soft leaves leaves of red butter perfect for them they're very soft and pliable because they cut out the edges of the leaves leave these little little semicircles and they roll up the leaf they cut out into a tube and then they lay in packet full of pollen and lay an egg on it that's what those tubes looks like here's three of them packed together it's pictured by heather holm and they stuff it in in a cracker crevice i often find these in the nozzles of my my watering cans you have to be careful about that and then the bee develops inside there well i think there were there were uh leaf cutter bees there because there was a redbud right next to the monarch's delight and i think that's also why there were bumblebees there bumblebees of course every winter is queens when they come out in the spring there are no workers to help them so the queen has to start the colony do all the work herself and she needs a lot of very efficient foraging to do that and redbud supplies exactly that there's abundant flowers um very densely packed full of of uh pollen and nectar and she can start her colony that way so i think that's why there were good bumblebees in this place as well and then i saw a monarch actually i saw two monarchs foraging on monarchs delight now this was 2014 2013 i'd gone the entire year without seeing a single monarch that was the low point of the monarch population in the east only 3.6 percent of the monarchs left so i was excited and this was june uh by the way which is very early for monarchs to get this far far north so maybe the monarchs weren't going to disappear after all that was good news why were they there well they had monarchs delight but there was another milkweed there as well i think it's purple milkweed so they had forage but they had host plant they could they could make more monarchs they could lay their eggs on on these plants and reproduce do you know where i was i was on the high line in the middle of manhattan i was 30 feet above the ha the the taxis here right in the middle of construction that's the amount of nature we're talking about on the high line it's a it's a it was an elevated railroad that was converted um into a tourist attraction very successful millions of people go there but despite the millions of people and the tiny amount of plants all those creatures found the high line somebody's done a a study of the number of bees on the high line they're up to 30 species that are using it right now this is rick dark right there he was always after me to go see the plants in the high line i'm not much of a city boy so i dragged my feet but you know seeing beautiful plants with nothing using them is actually depressing to me and that's what i thought i would find on the high line i mean what's going to find these plants in the middle of manhattan i didn't think anything would but i was totally wrong so it's very encouraging because it convinced me that if if thoughtful native plantings can bring life back to the middle of manhattan we can do this anywhere but there are four keys that we need to think about if we want to be completely successful and one of them is we have to shrink the area that's in lawn because remember those ecosystem services lawn destroys them we've got more than 40 million acres of lawn nation nationwide that's the an area the size of new england it's a big place so you know launch a status symbol and we're not going to give that up but i suggest we cut the area of lawn in half we can still manicure it we can still be good citizens our neighbors will still love us but we're going to have more plants in our yard and if we do that in half the area that's in lawn that'll give us 20 million acres to work with and if we do it at home we can create a new national park that i'm calling homegrown national park and it'll be bigger than the adirondacks plus yellowstone plus yosemite plus grand tetons canyonlands mount rainier north cascades badlands national park olympic national park sequoia national park plus the grand canyon plus denali which is huge plus the great smoky mountains about all those parks still less than 20 million acres so homegrown national park will be the biggest park in the country what do you get when you put a park at home you get the opportunity to develop a personal relationship with some part of the natural world at your own time at your own pace avoiding crowds and if you go to a real national park millions of other people there that's what you're interacting with most of the time it's also free there's no admission charge you can avoid travel hassles it's never closed no matter what pandemic comes down the road you get to experience the natural world alone and i think that's essential if you're going to develop that personal relationship with the natural world you need to do it alone how else can you do it this is a particularly important for our kids who are suffering from nature deficit disorder according to richard louv so what are we doing you know we we're getting 30 kids and putting them on a bus with a teacher and they drive for an hour and then they walk around a natural area and they teacher tells them not to touch anything and they get back in the bus and they they go home now i'm sure that's better than nothing but um what they've really experienced is 30 other kids and the teacher telling them not to to touch anything if there's some part of the natural world right in their yard they can go outside alone no parental supervision let them figure it out on their own develop a relationship on their own with nature most of them will will make it back alive it's important that they develop that relationship because they are the future stewards of our planet we're not going to be on this planet if we eliminate nature from it we need somebody to take care of it it's going to be our kids in the future so we've got they've got to understand what they're doing and learn how to do that right in their own yard and maybe they will learn how to hunt lizards i'm learning this from my own granddaughter zoe who lives in hawaii on a very modest piece of nature it's lawn and a hedge and a very tiny piece of lawn and a hedge but there are no lizards there so this is how you hunt leisure she sent me this picture and explained it very carefully you get on the ground and you disguise yourself with leaves and sticks so that the lizards don't see you coming then you crawl very slowly towards the lizards no smiling this is a serious business here you can wear your best dress that's okay but you crawl slowly you catch the lizard you put it in an aquarium and you've got that personal relationship now i don't think zoe's going to be catching lizards on the ground in her best dress the rest of her life i don't think but i guarantee she will remember doing this the rest of her life but i also guarantee she's going to be a good steward of the planet in part because of this experience when she grows up if you want to do exposure kids to more than catching lizards get this book nature play at home by nancy strinisty dozens of examples of how to expose kids to nature right where they're they're living and if you want to join homegrown national park go to our website homegrownnationalpark.org and get yourself on the map let's see we're over here you're going to you're going to identify where you live and the amount of area that you are you are converting to native plants that are going to support that that that part of nature and that will light up your area of your county and um you can you can watch the whole country light up here as more and more people join homegrown national park you can even get a sign and stick it in your your yard there no it doesn't cost anything and no we're not selling your your data okay we're going to shrink the lawn what are you going to put in the area that was lime that we've taken at well part of the plants we put there have to be what i call keystone plants now remember the roman arch the keystone is the stone in the middle of the arch if you take it out of the arch the arch full stamps so keystones are essential to the roman arch keystone plants are essential to our local food webs because they support so much of the food web that if we take them out the food web collapses we have found that just five percent of our native plants are making 75 percent of the caterpillar food that drives us food webs 14 of our native plants are making 90 of the caterpillar food that drives those food webs which means 85 of our native plants are contributing but not that much so think of native plants as as if they are the two by fours of this ecological house you're building the house is not going to stand up with those out those two by fours you can't build your ecological house out of wallpaper so if you have the two by fours there now the two by fours aren't going to make a complete house either you need the other plants to fill in but you they're essential you got to have these guys so the question is no longer simply are natives better than non-natives on average they certainly are but the real question is do we want ecologically productive plants in our yards or benign plants or even worse those ecologically destructive ones the invasive plants that escape our yards the privets and the bush honeysuckles and all of those guys and then go out into our natural areas and ecologically castrate them biological pollution i get an email once or twice a year that says don't i know that ginkgos ginkgo biloba from asia actually grew in north america seven million years ago that makes them native that means we can plant them and everything will be great yes i do know that ginkgos grew in seven in north america seven million years ago we can argue about whether that makes them native today uh but i'm not gonna have that argument because remember this isn't our metric anymore it's not where they're native or not it's whether they're productive or not there are a lot of unproductive natives so i don't you know i don't care if genko grew on the moon seven million years ago it supports zero species of caterpillars it's there but it's not contributing to your local landscape what is contributing uh a lot of plants contribute but the best keystone plant and 84 of the counties of north america is our oaks in the mid-atlantic states they support 557 species of caterpillars 557 species of bird food 900 species nationwide there is no other plant genus that comes close to that so here's an example of what keystone oaks are doing in in our yard so far i've taken a picture of 1033 moss species that's more species than all the birds in north america by the way right in our yard and i haven't gotten to the butterflies yet so out of the 1033 species 909 have known host plants out of that 900 oop i didn't chase 909 species 269 species use oaks now we have 69 genera of native woody plants in our property and only one of them is is the oaks quercus and we have hundreds of genera of herbaceous plants uh on our property so oaks represent less than 1.5 percent of our woody plant diversity and way less than one percent of our total plant diversity but they're supporting 30 percent of our moss species so imagine what would happen to the diversity in our house if we took oaks away that's the role of a keystone plant how do you find out what the keystone plants are where you live you go to native plant finder the national wildlife federation website put in your zip code and the ranked list of the top producing woody plants and top producing herbaceous plants four-year county will pop up this is what a typical list is going to look like uh oaks will be number one followed by native cherries and native willows notice i say native here if you go to the nursery and say i want to buy a cherry they're going to sell you a flowering cherry from from china if you say i want to buy a willow they'll sell you a weeping willow from from turkey and if you say want to buy an oak chances are they'll sell you a sawtooth oak from china you've got to specify i want a native member of these genera because if you don't do that you're going to have 65 percent fewer caterpillars produced on those plants even though these are native genera these are the top ranked herbaceous plants in terms of making caterpillars but these top ones here are also the top ranked in terms of making specialist pollinators those bees that can only reproduce on particular pollen so between between golden rods the various genera of asters and and sunflowers there are at least 40 species of bees that won't be in your yard unless you have those plants there because they need the pollen of those particular plants all right we're going to shrink the lawn we're going to put in keystone plants attract a lot of insects to our yard and then we're going to kill them with our security light which of course is not the goal there's a lot of research coming out now particularly from europe demonstrating that light pollution is one of the major causes of insect decline they can die by exhaustion they fly around around around the light until they drop colliding with the light bulb getting incinerated dehydration the bat comes and picks them off bright lights blind a lot of night insects who knew and it you know it wrecks what they ought to be doing their their daily life cycle but to me actually this is really good news because uh we've got to reverse insect declines and if if light pollution is one of the major causes it's the easiest one to turn around just turn off your light flick of a switch what could be easier but i know what you're thinking i can't turn off my security light at night because the bad man will come okay but a motion sensor on your security light so it only turns on when the batman does come the rest of the time it's off and the last first thing you're going to discover is that the the batman doesn't come very often if you don't want to do that take the white light out of your security light the mercury vapor bulbs are the very worst and put in a yellow bulb and a yellow led bulb is the best not just because it saves energy but it is the least attractive to nocturnal insects if we all switched out our lights for led lights overnight oops ahead of time overnight we would reduce insect uh deaths by by billions and we'd probably save billions of dollars too because um because they're much more efficient seems like a no-brainer all right we're gonna we're gonna shrink the lawn we're going to put in keystone plants we're going to turn out our lights and then we're going to invite mosquito joe to come to our yard and kill all our insects we seem to have no end to the ways we can kill all of our insects this is a booming business these days around the country a mosquito joe will will tell you that this is a natural product and that makes it okay and he is correct it is a natural product um he's half correct it comes from plants it comes from from chrysanthemums but that doesn't make it okay um cyanide is a natural product too so that's that's not a good good argument they'll also say it only kills mosquitoes not so kills all the insects it comes in contact with the big thing is it's expensive and it doesn't work why would you spend money on something that doesn't work in order to control mosquitoes in the adult stage all real mosquito people know you control them in the larval stage but if you're going to try to do it in the adult stage you have to kill 90 of the adults to get control this mosquito fogging kills about 10 of the adults so it's not even close to working this is the way you kill you kill mosquitoes you kill them in the larval stage and at home you can do it very simply by getting a bucket filling it full of water putting in straw or hay and letting it ferment for a couple of days it becomes irresistible to mosquitoes that want to lay their eggs overpositing mosquitoes they will lay them in your bucket in just a few days those eggs hatch you can put in a mosquito dunk that you get at the hardware store it's cheap a single dunk in there this is bacillus thuringiensis it's a bacterium that kills aquatic dipdra and the only aquatic dipterane in your bucket here is a mosquito so if a dragonfly gets in here it's not going to hurt it if a bird drinks out of it if a honeybee drinks out of it if your dog likes it doesn't hurt any of them the only thing it kills is is mosquitoes very targeted so it works and it's cheap why wouldn't we do that the fourth thing we need to do is to landscape in a way that allows caterpillars to complete their development what do i mean by that well i live in chester county pennsylvania where there's 511 species of caterpillars that develop on oaks a few of them like the polyphemus moth caterpillar actually complete their development on the tree the caterpillar eats the leaves it spins a cocoon and hangs from the tree the adult emerges and then it does it all over again everything happens on the tree and i wish everything did that but most of the species don't 94 of them 480 of the species that use oaks drop from the tree after the the caterpillars finished eating leaves and then they wiggle themselves beneath the ground and pupate underground or they spin a cocoon in the leaf litter that is under the tree and that's the problem there is no leaf litter under the tree plus we mow and we compact our soil so it's way too hard for anything to to tunnel underground and pupate this becomes an ecological trap the way we are our landscaping if we use uh important plants it calls in the the caterpillars to lay there or the moths to lay their eggs the caterpillars develop they drop down and then they die and the next generation smaller and the next generation after that is gone i am convinced that the way we landscape and you know we do this everywhere uh is a major cause of insect decline and of course the the cement landscape is even less of a viable option i'm not trying to discourage the use of trees in cities i'm trying to discourage the profligate use of cement as a default landscape we know it's a bad idea it destroys our watersheds cement by the way releases a tremendous amount of carbon dioxide it's one of the the top uh producers of that that terrible greenhouse gas so this is laziness we don't have to do that this is what most people do they put a tree in the middle of a lawn they they um and nobody studied how well the caterpillars do in a situation like this i was going to do it last summer but the kovid said no but i guarantee they're going to do better in a situation like this where you have a tree and then a layered landscape they can drop down maybe there's a dogwood here through the the native azalea the ferns easily get beneath the ground and and form their their pupa or spin a cocoon in the leaves that are down underneath there this becomes a safe site survivorship will be much higher in a situation like this or this is where you do your spring ephemeral gardening you make beds around your trees that's how you shrink your lawn these are safe sites and you have less lawn this is where you use your your uh ground covers like uh wild ginger may uh foam flower may apples ferns this is this is uh in athens georgia at a hotel the perfect perfect site for the caterpillars on these red maples to drop down and complete their development so we can do it another grad student desiree norango has done some wonderful work with chickadees in the suburbs of washington dc and her the results of her study suggest there is room for compromise in our plant choice and that's good news what she did was look at how well plants or landscapes that are dominated by native plants sustained chickadee populations versus landscapes dominated by introduced plants when the landscapes are dominated by introduced plants they produce 75 percent fewer caterpillars so there's 75 percent less bird food available for the the chickadees they were 60 less likely to have breeding chickadees at all so there are nest boxes up in each each landscape but the chickadees would come around and say well there's not enough food here we're not even going to try to breed if they did try those nests contained 1.5 fewer eggs they were 29 less likely to survive at all if they did survive they produce 1.2 fewer fledglings and it took them 1.5 days longer to reach maturity if you put all those numbers into a population growth model as a function of the percentage of woody non-native plants in your landscape this is what you get the dotted line is replacement rate that is the rate at which the the population has to make babies to replace the adults that die every year chickadees don't live that long if you reproduce at this rate that's a sustainable rate of reproduction your population is not growing but it's not shrinking either if you make more babies than adults die you have a growing population but if you make fewer babies below the dotted line here you have a shrinking unsustainable population right here generously speaking is the uh where those lines overlap which says that you can have up to 30 of your your woody plant biomass non-native in your yard as long as it's not invasive so you can have your crepe murder you can have your ginkgo you can have those things that aren't escaping your boxwood your camellias as long as they don't dominate the landscape if 70 of your your woody plant biomass is native you can have sustainable breeding birds in your yard so this is really important because that's the area of compromise if my message was that you couldn't have any non-native plants very few people would be listening because because we love our non-native plants it's not the presence of those non-natives that destroys food webs it's the absence of native plants if we get more of these native plants into our landscapes particularly those keystone plants we can have a lot more success can we use them in formal landscapes of course we can this is a garden from north carolina and they're they're switching out the non-natives for natives here's joe pie that's already in there notice i said joe pie not joe pie weed and they're going to do it over the entire garden and then send me send me a picture formality is a function of the the design it's not a function of the plants in that design our for our native plants are used in formal designs in europe all the time and i guess that's okay because there are non-native plants over there can we get a pollinator garden into a uh a typical suburban yard like this without offending anybody of course we can put a little fence around it all of a sudden it's okay a lot of species here servicing a lot of bees it's not very big but you know if everybody did it it would really help remember why we need pollinators you hear all the time you need them because they pollinate a third of our crops no they only pollinate about 12 of our crops but has nothing to do with our crops and because people think well if i don't live next to a farm i don't need any pollinators not so they pollinate 80 of all plants and 90 of all flowering plants if we lost their pollinators we'd lose 80 to 90 of the plants on the planet it's just not an option where do we need pollinators everywhere we need plants which is everywhere how about this design it's bigger servicing a lot more beast imagine the amount of life that is here versus the amount of life that is here none versus a lot can municipalities help us live with nature a lot of course they can and there's more and more examples where this happening minnesota has a cost-sharing program where it encourages homeowners to reduce their lawn by putting in appropriate prairie plantings for minnesota and the you know the state will help you pay for that pennsylvania is a similar program and apparently it just started last year but you get up to five thousand dollars per acre to convert your lawn into a real habitat what a great program florida there's an island off of florida that's paying residents to allow burrowing owls listed species to burrow in their front yard this is the way the endangered species act should have been written with carrots rather than sticks we want to you know if if somebody's going to pay you to take care of an invasive species or an endangered species on your yard everybody would want an endangered species as opposed to finding you because you've got one on your property missouri fayetteville arkansas have have bounties on calorie pears really you know you know how invasive these guys are so if you if you take out a calorie repair you get a free tree replacement even public utilities are getting into the app they give people 100 coupons to put in water efficient plants where water is a problem buffalo is giving people hundred dollar coupons to increase the percentage of natives just to increase the percentage of natives uh apparently virginia has a long conserva conversion program and so does uh of course the far west california in particular you can get up to two dollars per square foot rebate uh by taking out that thirsty lawn and putting in appropriate xeric planning so a lot of people are doing it and it's working really well i think we've made three missteps in the early years of conservation the first one is you know we like nature and some of us think it's important but very few of us think it's essential that's the misstep because if it's not essential when push comes to shove whenever resources are in short supply nature loses i went to the the cincinnati zoo before the virus broke out and there was this wall-sized poster there that epitomizes in my opinion what our society thinks of conservation we want to save nature so that future generations can enjoy it this was teddy roosevelt's argument gotta say we gotta create the national park so the future generations can enjoy them and yes i agree with that but it suggests nature's there just for entertainment no wonder we don't think it's essential we can we can watch television for entertainment we don't need nature we do need nature not just for entertainment we need nature so that we have future generations it's a little bit more urgent second misstep is that we have made that assumption that humans and nature cannot coexist which means we restrict conservation to the areas where there's no humans which means it's going to fail because those areas are too small and too isolated from each other david kwamen has a an excellent analogy between a persian rug and an ecosystem this is a functional persian rug that is not 71 persian rugs that is 71 rug fragments none of which are acting like a persian rug and that's what we've done to our ecosystems the u.n has uh designates biosphere reserves as places of ecological significance but i hate that language because it suggests that places on planet earth with no ecological significance not so every square inch of the planet has ecological significance including our yards including our corporate landscapes all of our infrastructure so we need to glue our rug back together again by putting the plants back and all those places we've taken the map by putting the important plants back the ones that are actually running our ecosystems those keystone native plants for sure and then many other natives that are doing vital roles we're not just building biological carters that connects these fragments we're going to create viable habitat where it doesn't exist right now which means we're going to start to share our landscapes with nature we're going to live together our third misstep was to leave earth stewardship to just a few specialists a few conservation biologists few ecologists we didn't see it as an inherent responsibility of everybody on the planet but i have no idea why because everybody in the planet depends entirely on the quality of earth's ecosystems so why wouldn't everybody have the responsibility for good or stewardship to keep those ecosystems in good shape i have no idea stan rushworth the cherokee elder once said that the western settler mindset is i have rights the mindset of indigenous people is i have obligations you're not born with these mindsets you're taught them we've been great at teaching this one we've been pretty poor at teaching our obligations towards stewardship of our only planet it doesn't mean you have to save biodiversity for a living but you really can save it where you live and i love this approach because it empowers each one of us right now most of us feel totally unempowered we feel helpless out there that you know planet has huge problems and it really seems like one person can't make a difference but here the cliche really works one person can make a difference go out and plant that oak tree plant any one of the keystone plants shrink your lawn put in a pollinator garden get rid of your invasive species you've created a viable ecosystem right where you live you can see it you become an important cog in the future wheel of conservation and it shrinks the problem down as something that's manageable for each one of us don't think about the entire planet you'll get depressed just worry about your part of the planet that you can influence if you own property it's obvious that's where you work if you don't own property help somebody who does volunteer for a land conservancy or a park or preserve they're all underfunded under staff they will love you so as property owners or as volunteers each one of us has the power and we certainly have the responsibility to fix dead landscapes like this whether or not we decide to do so is going to determine nature's fate and ultimately our own so i've convinced my grandchild that you are nature's best hope i hope i've convinced you as well thanks very much okay thank you so much doug that was extremely um informative i know that we have some questions already coming in that we will just jump into um and for anyone who has additional questions you can either use the chat feature or you can use the q a box at the bottom of the zoom screen so i know it could be a couple people have asked about recording um this is being recorded i will send out the link to that recording next week um okay can you send it to me too absolutely thank you yes absolutely um so one of the first questions we had was could you potentially list some um perennial plants that support different types of caterpillar species well goldenrod's the the number one perennial it supports again 110 species of caterpillars so that would be a good one any of our our uh asters are also very very high uh evening primrose is is very high um so those would be three for starters violets you know all of our fritillaries depend on violets you know what people think violets are weeds they're not waves they're great plants they're pretty too i don't know why they got that weed status thing but they're perennials that uh almost all of them support some species but those are those are important ones okay great um so someone has said that they have stopped weeding and seeding their lawn and they've had some moss move in should they leave it alone or do you think they should leave it i mean should they leave it or should they remove it remove the weeds so they don't have moths uh maybe you know um your lawn is never going to be a top functioning ecosystem so what i what i suggest is uh reduce the area of lawn and put in other plants that will support wildlife but the lawn you keep your neighbors will appreciate if you continue to mow it frequently and and manicure it it doesn't mean that you have to if you mow it frequently you'll keep those weeds down because the grass loves mowing weeds don't you'll find that you can have a beautiful green lawn by mowing frequently without all the fertilizer and and bread leaf herbicides that you put on because that's what's wrecking our watersheds so i would say reduce the the fertilizer the herbicides are in your fertilizer you probably don't even know it and and keep mowing your lawn and um but plant put those other plants in your in your yard and that's how you're going to really increase the biodiversity okay and i al you might have to so al is asking the question um i think it he's saying moths not moss yes oh okay i can't hear i'm sorry no no that's okay um well gee you know there are a lot of people that work hard to get moss what that means is you don't have enough sunlight for lawn that's another problem in order to get this status in but we try to force it in areas where it just doesn't want to grow it means you've got a lot of shade so there are things called moss gardens where people are working hard to cover as much of the land with moss as as possible so i guess i would say change your goal and say hey i want moss i'm getting it it's it's it's a wonderful achievement you're not gonna grasp wants sunlight and if you don't have it you don't have it so okay al i hope that was helpful um if you want me to clarify let me know in the chat um okay so what about people who don't necessarily have the best green thumb what is the best way to kind of help create these spaces um and have them to where you're able to upkeep them if gardening is not your expert you know expertise right uh it's a great question and it's it's it's one of our biggest challenges right now because if you were to go out and survey the entire american public you would find that most species by most species most people by far do not garden they don't have time to you know particularly kids people with with young kids they're going to soccer games and everything else so what do they do they hire somebody they hire a lawn service or a tree service and they just say you do it i want those services to become trained in what i call ecological landscaping or ecological gardening so you can still just hire somebody not have to worry about it let them create that beautiful but ecologically productive landscape and you don't have to worry about it that's the way that's where i want to go because that's where what most people do they just hire somebody we're moving in that direction slowly but we need a lot more people to jump in and put out their shingles saying i'm an ecological landscaper i'm trying to uh keep a list of people that i run into who are doing that so that when i get a question like this i can say hey hire this person um but you know it doesn't take a huge green thumb to go out and simply plant a tray most yards can accept uh at least one more tray uh and um there are few mistakes that people make they plant it too deep or they put a big volcano mulch garden or mulch you know thing around it but it's easy to avoid that another big mistake people make is trying to get as big a tree as possible to get that instant gratification this the smaller the tree you plant the faster it will grow and the healthier it will be the faster it will grow the rest of its life because it will develop big roots that are never pruned when you transplant a tree that's been in a pot or or root ball most of the roots have been cut off and it'll sit there for a decade trying to rebuild those roots if you plant a tiny tree never has that trauma and it'll pass the tree that you spent a thousand dollars on trying to get that instant gratification so go small again it doesn't take a huge green thumb to be able to do that that's perfect um that's all the questions i think um if anyone else has any questions you can also raise your hand and i can unmute you so you can ask questions just in case you don't want to type them out i don't see any hands raised so i think we might be good i know um someone mentioned we have plans to create a native species garden at the art farm so all this was super helpful information we want to be able to do native species and kind of create a space for butterflies as well so extremely helpful information i'm glad that we're recording this so we can share with the rest of the team and for everyone that's watching you know as long as you're subscribed to our newsletter you'll get updates on when that farm is being in when that farm when that garden is being installed um and you can come and see the space and doug the next time you're in atlanta after the pandemic you can see the space as well um i think that that is it unless you have any closing remarks me yeah and you heard enough remarks for me i think uh perfect you are nature's best hub that is my closing remark so yes um so i do see someone is asking questions about um serenbe having plans to remove invasive species so miss kathleen that would be a question for serenbe development um with the hoa they would be the ones to to answer that i think thomas peters might be your best contact um so that's a great question that you can definitely direct to them and they should be able to help well thank you so much doug thank you to everyone here come join us this morning we hope that you not only were able to gain information but that you'll start putting some of this into practice if you want to learn more about the work that doug is doing definitely check out homegrownnationalpark.org or you can check out any of his books that i've linked to in the chat and we hope that you'll join us for some of our other future events i know next sunday our artist in residency division air serenbe is doing a virtual art over dinner with john keller so you'll be able to learn some culinary tricks in the kitchen via zoom i believe so definitely check that out at air serenbe.com events and doug thank you again so much for being with us today and we hope that everyone has a great weekend you too okay see you later yes thanks bye", "pr8TX0NUn34": "you know what is good YouTube it's your boy 7g grinding out another video for you guys man so today's video I got a sick ass session man in this session today we are gonna be using this mg Arsenal bubbler that they gave to me I have not ever used a bubbler before so there's gonna be a first first try for you guys and reaction video I guess man I've never used a bowler but all I know is that you fill it up with barely any water put your joint right here blunt whatever the case is and then you cap it with this while hitting it with this right so we're gonna be session on that I ended up picking up these sticks pre-rolls just for the purpose of this [ __ ] video so hopefully they're good men picked up two of them so just in case we wanted it again - nice sesh holy [ __ ] bro I just pop this sucker open right and alright before anything I saw on the weed maps thing this [ __ ] had to pre-rolls right there right it had a big one and a little one and I asked the [ __ ] lady I was like hey do these pre-rolls come with two or one and she said to my [ __ ] you not man I'm gonna put a screen shot up it on the screen right now so just to show proof man I'm gonna call them out imma call them out so I guess it's just one big-ass one instead of just one small one which sucks I mean - two small ones which sucks but whatever I guess we're gonna be having to make it work so what's up with you guys man I'm gonna fill this up and I'm gonna get the [ __ ] started so what's up with you guys I hope you guys have all been good lately man we are here grinding these videos man hopefully you guys have been enjoying these two videos I mean these these um videos I've been posting every two days man that's kind of been my new schedule hopefully he hasn't been liking it I don't know [ __ ] but how much are you supposed to even put [Music] oh [ __ ] I'm over here dropping it but I just don't want to drop it on the joint budge emergency boys hold up hold up I almost got the [ __ ] joint with that would have been horrible cuz then it would have had a little spot where it wasn't gonna be burning but we're good so I put it like half waste do ya do this is kind of um I just don't want to get the freaking bowl inside whit because I know so pretty much all that you have to do is just stick it in here I just stick it in there and then alright that's not too bad I'm pretty sure freaking wedding I'm pretty sure I wet it a little bit yeah me but yeah alright back to the topic man hopefully you guys are doing good man hopefully this 2020 man we're already three months in man hopefully you guys have been chasing your dreams hopefully you guys have been doing things that you've been wanting to do for the longest time and don't hopefully no one's holding you back from doing those things hopefully everyone's just been chasing their dreams man like your boy over here I got all I got a lot of people um that are also chasing their dreams along with and then so I shout out to all you people that I should I don't know if I should keep this open for the purpose of it that for the purpose of this video I think I'm gonna keep it on but I think I'm a closer first just so I can light it perfectly because this thing hold up man and there's actually someone parking over there this is a private a private park so I'm just kind of like tiptoeing around cuz I you really don't want to get in trouble man he has no smoking out in public is always risky but I think we're gonna do it Chris [ __ ] this guy so let's go ahead and um spark up the [ __ ] so hopefully I do it right I don't know if I should spark it up first while it's in here or wind up but [ __ ] it let's go guys - Cheers you guys are over the age of 18 21 men let me know in the comments below what you guys are smoking out of let me know if you ever tried a bubbler and let me know what your experience has been and if you're new to this channel make sure if you're enjoying the content so far hit that subscribe button cheers guys I don't even know if I'm doing this right all right time to open this up I just really don't want a hotbox right now I think what I'm gonna do is I'm a lighted up by itself first because I don't know it's just weed I don't think I'm getting enough airflow on the bubbler itself so so far though I feel like I feel like this this 2020 man I've been doing a lot of progressing man I've definitely been doing a lot of cell phone myself thinking self-learning trying to learn ways to better not only better myself but the people around me how to help them better them you know things like that man so I think you have to stick it in there deep you know people always like you do cheers guys [Music] I don't know if I'm doing this wrong or what oh [ __ ] it's because I have to cap it I'm freaking [ __ ] all right I forgot that you have to cap it there's a little hole right here all right so now now let's see if this thing works oh I felt that I saw that I saw the smoke let's go ahead and do a little close up for you guys hold up let me see how close I could get without hurting myself holy [ __ ] this max bro right bad actually I don't know if it's supposed to it doesn't can anyone tell me if it's supposed to like filter it or if it's just supposed to be a better smoke session you know I don't know but let's go ahead and take another rib let's see if we can get a little thumbnail for you guys hmm that was fire I need to get an ashtray though before anything because I do not want to drop this please let me find it before I drop it all right so now that I'm gonna just keep my ashtray right here and we're just gonna sesh man so your this thing has been giving me some pretty freaking fat hits so now that we got this nice and lighted man we're gonna go ahead and just our session on it and it's time to get to talking man so as March twenty twenty men least this year has so far it brought me a lot of things that have been like you know really learning about myself really having to assess what I do in my life how I do think how I follow through with things man and I see I've just been getting a lot more motivated to be a better me not only on YouTube but you know overall last because I've been hitting the gym a lot harder I've been following my diet a lot more I've been trying to be a better person you know in terms of my how I act about Who I am of what my actions are and I feel like you know I'm progressing without a doubt I am progressing as an individual and I'm happy about that man this one right here was the Maui the Maui stick or Maui wowie some [ __ ] like that I believe it's a sativa you guys know I'm not too much of a fan of sativa but the taste is actually pretty good let's see how long we can keep the ash going alright boys so continuing the talk man let me know in the comments below how are

like this is so excessive having to use a bubbler bride rather just smoked the joining self but it is what it is we're gonna go ahead and keep session for you guys man yeah I don't know if it's the way that I'm hitting it because I'm basically like letting it build up and then I'm inhaling comp like a bomb but these hits are just way too harsh man you're starting to get hot in here about it place this down for a little slight second CES you can see right here this is how it looks - dude I'm sweating I've actually been I don't know why recently I've been sweating a lot more than usual which is very very strange damn it's gonna take me forever to kill this but we're gonna do it for you guys it makes it taste weird like that hold on I want to see if it tastes any different I don't know if it's just the bubbler if it's this [ __ ] this pre-roll it tastes kind of like me you know it's not bad it's just a very very very acquired taste and [ __ ] I just burnt off the cherry please just stay on it like at first it was good but now that I'm getting a little deeper into it I start tasting a sativa man I'm starting to taste this a tea with a lot more if he has no sativas in general or just like they have such a unique taste to them and they don't taste like Dai Li some ones that I've tried I think the only sativa that I've ever tried that was actually good with a mimosa - mimosa other than that I don't think I've ever tried any sativa that I actually like look at that little [ __ ] chamber of smoke juggernaut 1 if I can smoke that [ __ ] looks like ass oh what a [ __ ] fail bro oh my gosh I get the biggest bell of 2020 by doing that yo oh my goodness dude I was trying to blow the smoke out of there and I ended up [ __ ] blowing all the ash that was on the ashtray that it has to be the biggest fell over it tastes like ass bro hold on guys I'm gonna go ahead and step out for a second and just go ahead and [ __ ] clean myself up I started to hit me though I like I said I really usually don't like the TVs but I'm pretty sure if you smoke a whole J to the face it definitely is gonna do something to you yeah but the taste it's like a stale bong rip that's the thing it doesn't it really so filtered out at least for me doesn't me it's cool it's cool I like the function of it but honestly overall I feel like I would probably never end up using this again [Music]

Age of cannabis walk into any distance area in the 29 states where weeds legal and you'll be bowled over by the variety of concentrates available but in order to enjoy them you've generally had to either settle for a pen style portable vape or rustle with a blowtorch powered tabletop dab rake but that's where the puffs go peak comes in [Music] we got our first glimpse of the peak earlier this year at CES 2018 and I've been hyped to try it ever since luckily the peak did not disappoint this little device combines the easy intuitive useful vape pen and the inability to get lost in couch cushions of a tabletop tablet though it is a vaporizer the peak is shaped like the lovechild of a conventional water pipe in silent Hills Pyramid Head it offers an upward facing ceramic bowl situated in front of a tapered glass stem which can be removed from the rest of the unit and filled with water to improve vapor filtration it's what I always imagined bongs would look like in the distant future the entire unit stands 7 inches tall roughly the same height as Crystal Geyser water bottle and is appreciably bottom-heavy while it's out Evo rigged for as much as I loved it was notoriously unsteady and would topple if I so much as looked at it funny the peak on the other hand cause it's practically a weeble wobble you've got to give it a good shove to knock it over it offers four temperature settings between 450 and 600 degrees LED and haptic feedback and enough battery life for up to 30 individual taps it's about 4 to 6 bolts depending on how tightly you pack them plus it's portable the glass portion separates from the rest of the base for easy storage or replacement if you happen to drop it now using it is really easy once you've charged the unit over the course of two hours using the included microUSB cable at about 2 to 3 ounces of water to the glass stem and reattach it to the bottom half of the unit next up you add your concentrate toujours to the heating chamber and place the carb cap on top the carb cap is designed to regulate air flow through the bowl and prevent your precious vapor from escaping when you aren't actively drawing on it then you turn the peak on with a long press of the button located on the front of the base just underneath the bowl from there you select your preferred temperature indicated by one of four LED colors green blue red or white the temperature you choose will depend on what kind of concentrate you're using how much you've packed in and how much vapor you want produced after you've selected your heat level double-click the front button to activate the heating element it'll take 20 seconds for the peak to reach the lower temperature settings blue and green which represent 450 and 500 degrees and 25 seconds to hit the higher temperatures that is red and white once the unit is hot you simply inhale you'll be able to keep the peak in its designated operating temperature for as long as you'd like by double-clicking the front button once you've completed your session simply swap out the heating chamber with a q-tip and rubbing alcohol for a deeper clean you can remove and disassemble the entire bowl and heating housing before working over with alcohol wipes similarly the glass stem can be cleaned as you would a conventional water pipe a bit of isopropyl alcohol and salt usually does the trick what I like most about the peak is that it accommodated every kind of concentrate I threw at it cold water crumbles shatter honeycomb wax even some straight-up butane hash oil it's more affordable than the herbalizer more versatile than the volcano and requires a fraction of the set-up time that the herbal air is usually demand in short the peak is my new favorite thing you can pick one up from the puff co website it retails for three hundred and eighty dollars and I suggest you do so because this thing is lit", "qy-lk1LHJ4s": "yes this is a glass oil rig this oil ray has two chambered speculation and it's purple is perk it's three holes injector glass tube it held double chamber and this also has a male joint with what he made me turn like this I'll wrote this piece is originated from a glass bubbler with this same size but right now is our clothes I already weary meet it and ok here it has three colors green blue and amber colors that's chamber it still work it's silver make it and you can see all right the color is changing some peace overall this piece is very sturdy and flat and even though prompted very fussy class ok here we go we can see the water test and to see is like okay okay here we go Cheers", "NkAO670EGMQ": "my name is Willie Christie and we're here at the pottery in Los Angeles so today I want to show you how to clean your pipe using just normal things that you should be able to find around your house and in order to do that let's go to my house so I'm gonna teach you how to clean this bong using the items that should be laying around your house to get started cleaning your bong you're going to need blast pipe piece Chilam bubbler hammer whatever you got if it's glass and you smoke out of it you can clean it this way so you've got your glass piece and then you've got rubbing alcohol here I've got 91% I bought this off at Amazon higher percent alcohol the better the alcohol is what's getting off the gunk and then next just some table salt it's like 35 cents for this whole thing this acts as your abrasive the salt just spins around in there and helps clean off the gunk that's getting loosened by the alcohol next q-tips this is for those weird areas that may not be coming off completely and then for the extra little reach and scrub action I got a toothbrush hopefully it's a dirty toothbrush and don't plan on using it again and then plastic bags or saran wrap and that's gonna be to plug the bong up when it's filled with alcohol and you're shaking it and then finally I've just got some more Tupperware this is to pre-soak the stem or the bowl pieces that I'm not gonna be able to shake around as easily I dump the water out that's a given but the first step truly would be soaked like I mentioned you want to pre-soak some of your stuff so I've got a bowl and a stem here that are not gonna be cleaned as easily as this bong and I'm going to pre-soak these while I'm doing everything else so got a Tupperware dish just big enough to fit this resin II downstem in and I'm just going to literally squirt the alcohol you can wear gloves if you want I'm psycho so I don't care about my hands very much but gloves is good alcohol is bad for your skin so I'm literally just just filling this up with alcohol it's like $3 for a bottle so get that's why you want to be cheap because you're gonna want to use a lot of it to make sure that's fun pre-soaking just as long as the alcohol is getting in there that's good I'm gonna add my Bowl in there too while we clean the rest of the bottle we will be waiting for this pre-soak action to be taking place and so the next step is going to be soaking the bung as well so just like those pieces I'm gonna add this rubbing alcohol into the bong and I like to get a decent amount in there you know there's no shame there's no shame the more alcohol the easier so we've got a decent amount maybe a cup three quarters of a cup of rubbing alcohol in there as you can see that's already that's already taken off a lot you know you can see it's with all that brown stuff in there that's that's all gunk that this alcohol has just taken off on its own immediately and then the next step is salt and I'm just gonna dump that right in there with it the more salt again the better salt is cheap salt is safe I'm just gonna put a bunch of salt in there I'm gonna pour some in here and my pre soaked solution to I don't know if that's gonna help but when I shake it up later it will next step is going to be shake and before you shake this you're gonna want to secure it because you will get rubbing alcohol everywhere if you don't so right now I'm taking a sandwich bag and a hair tie top end is sealed I'm just gonna plug this up with my thumb and shake focusing on these gunky areas you can see right here this ring especially and so I'm angling angling the glass to where the salt is primarily hitting and if you're a perfectionist like me you will literally do this for ten minutes just to get all all those pieces off and so now we've got a pretty clean looking bomb 99% clean I might say and then this is where if you can get in there that last little hmm these last little bits are gonna come off super easily with a toothbrush so there's that that looks clean to me we'll see once we dump it out but yeah the difference the difference will be very apparent once I dump dump and rinse so dumping be careful dumping this stuff it smells bad you get it on your counter that resin will stain stick stink you know whatever grab my rinse water and you're gonna rinse this out a bunch cuz who wants to smoke rubbing alcohol I don't think that's safe step one two and three for the beaker gets you that and now for the rest of the pieces same thing they've been soaking you know something like this is gonna be really tough you know if your toothbrush doesn't fit in there this is where two q-tips come in and if you can see that because of the pre-soak action this is just all coming out immediately it's it's just like nothing it's like this wasn't smoked on for months and months and months you know it looks like you just hit it for the first time just wiping that out with a q-tip it's so easy boom all clear that's usually the hardest part the stem I'd say the bowl oh look at that that's just coming right off again the the hardest part of the bowl if you guys don't know this resin right here this is where this is where all the action happens this is where all the heat and initialled just madness happens when you're smoking weed so little dip dip and rinse see that that's already clearing out very nicely it's all over my hands - what you're gonna stink so what I'm gonna do for this bowl and this is really good for spoons and pipes as well it's essentially the same thing just alcohol salt shaking you know the same soak what is it soaked salt shake and scrub I'm taking this and I'm just putting it in a bag so I've got the salt here and this is enabling me to shake you can't do that with the Tupperware dish you're gonna break your bowl and this bags will break down they will leak eventually so keep keep an eye out if you notice drops coming out of the corner you probably busted the bag okay I'll see how that helps I mean it's looking really clean when I cover up the resin section with my finger all right so there you go clean Bowl so those of you that are able to clean this by your sink and not on a table which is probably what I'd recommend if you have a metal sink or even worse a ceramic sink be so careful he's so careful shaking this giant glass piece around in there because if you just touch the edge of your ceramic sink it's gone this whole piece is broken so if you're shaking it around in your kitchen you just go boom catch that on ceramic it's done all right so that that does it I like to call it the 5s system soak salt shake scrub and now the final step of this process smoke", "aDqfYqX3M5s": "it is i says me your friend to the end the baron of the ball jrv token and if you're new to the channel we do creative bonging on a budget let's get right to it with the latest schematic bam this is the base of the place that's going to make the magic happen right there you got your standard 4 piece connected to this hard hose you could get at your local home depot connected to this receptacle so you can see the hose pierces through we got it sealed [Music] water is going to be filled up to about here now the second part is going to be this right here as you can see that's how it's going to connect same same thing with the piece going right through it using this hard tool to hit it out of but the look is not the crazy part we wanted to add a little extra so what we're gonna do let me put the base down [Music] it's this little craft jar plastic what i did is put those tools right through it this is going to be filled with water and the top has those holes that's going to connect right there and it's going to it's going to serve as a second filtration system [Music] so let me throw everything together tape it up hit y'all with the catchphrases cool as that looks that doesn't matter if this doesn't work so uh let's do what we do and we're gonna test it out we got our bong taped up water up we got our [Music] butt let's do this [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] there you have it

monsoon bubbler water pipe this comes to us from brothers with glass and we're gonna let you know today is it really spill-proof and if it's really awesome smoking out of a pipe with water in it stay tuned we'll let you know so today we're gonna be reviewing the chameleon glass spill-proof monsoon bubbler water pipe that's probably the last time I'm going to say it in full we're just gonna call it the monsoon pipe but basically this pipe is a 5.7 5 by 1.25 inch spoon style water pipe that's fairly thick it has like a fairly thick glass or coating everywhere I don't know what the particular millimeter thickness is but I can tell just from touching it and knocking it on surfaces and just tell how strong of the glass it is something you'll really feel confident holding the quality of the glass is pretty good too you can just take a really good look at it close up it has really solid seals there are no like major major air bubbles are really just any air bubbles but as I said it is a spill proof water pipe so you can actually put in a small amount of water into this pipe and then actually get oh oh sorry spilling it's spilling sorry I was actually going to show you guys it Perkin up but we have a significantly less amount of water here but usually put it in through the bowl or through the carb and you can get a small amount of water inside so that when you take a hit you can actually get a little bit of percolation and water filtration to your smoke it percolates them very well it has like a great pool to it even without weed inside of the bowl you get like a good solid hit that's comparable to like a ball with an ash catcher I usually want to take the ash capture off of the illah delft I get like a more Airy harder to pull the bowl because there's so much air getting into the hit this type of bowl you're actually getting more hit than you are air so it's carving and it's pulling the bowl and you're getting more of an hit and because it's such a good percolator it doesn't really like faze you as much because you'd worry about not getting as much air but the water-filtration helps immensely it's pretty crazy it's pretty cool not a big fan of like the aesthetic I don't know like I like I love the clear part in the middle the fact that I can see the smoke build-up when I'm taking a hit is really [ __ ] cool like I love pipes that have clear elements so you can just see the milk build-up that's a real big plus but I'm actually not a big fan of the blue the days but that's just like a personal choice I mean you can see like I have a bomb with this type of blue but I'm just not a fan of the particular way they use it in this pipe I don't think it's as tasteful as an application of the color the hits on this pipe feels super smooth super like it's the smoothest pipe hit I've ever taken and it's almost comparable to a bong hit you know like if I blindfolded myself and like I [ __ ] took a hit of this and I had to like take a hit of some other like cheaper ball I would probably take this over like a cheap ball because it's that solid of like a percolator but pros aside the stocks and cons you heard me mention in the title or maybe the wording was so long you didn't catch it but this is a quote unquote spill-proof pipe and throughout this review dret this like recording of this I've spilled probably 3/4 of the water out on the table and I was smoking this with a few friends and we had a similar problem where we were all taking hits out of it passing it around someone would put it down on the table and everyone was being careful because they knew like bath water inside I don't know how this is gonna work so let me be gentle about this they put it down and without a doubt every time we pick it back up there'd be a little pool of like little bomb water underneath and this is bone water mind you you know this is [ __ ] the water inside gets smelly like your bong and it smells up even faster because it's such a small amount of water so when it spills it [ __ ] smells bro so it sucks it spills at all you know I'm sitting here now and I'm playing around with it a little bit and I see the water trapped inside of here like the water is trapped inside of the main chamber with the two or with the linked one percolator thing or whatever but for some reason the water will pop out sometimes into the bowl region and once it gets put in there if I turn the pipe sideways towards the carp cap down the largest fills out it's um it's really hard overall this piece is [ __ ] fantastic I mean it's super solid you know it looks great I mean not my particular aesthetic but I'm sure plenty of people are vibing with this piece and even I love the clear middle where you can just see the milk buildup I love the chug on this thing like this is one of the best like pools from a pipe I've ever gotten rivals some of the balls I've smoked let's just put it that way it really does feel like it significantly enhances the smoking experience and I haven't even mentioned the price throughout the entire video this pipe is actually $60 we got that sent this for free by brothers with glass just to review it and $60 for this pipe is [ __ ] bananas bro for how solid of a like blown piece it is for the fact that I can put water in it did this will last me years you know like this this I could fumble it in the sink when I'm like washing it with a little bit of alcohol and salt just like I do the illy and I'm sure that this thing will [ __ ] break this pipe gets an 8 out of 10 in our books just a super solid pipe feels fantastic like really well blown American glass the water is an excellent feature and the jug is just fantastic you know it'd be one thing if you can just put water in it and it sucked and it just like didn't really enhance to hit but it really just pools almost as if it were an ash capture on like a ball or something just really well tuned hit my only complaint about this and the only thing that really brings it down to the eight out of ten was the fact that it wasn't really spill proof you know just really getting that ball water smell everywhere sometimes after you've hit it three four or five ten times in the session it it adds up bro you know gets on your hands it gets on the table and it's not fun but still super solid pipe regardless if you're interested in purchasing this pipe I was told this was available exclusively through brothers with glass monsoons bubbler water proof something I don't know I said in the beginning but make sure to check out brothers with glass they sent over this pipe for us to review and they've got this in blue I think they have it in like black they have like a couple of the colors and just show him some love if you can't

can see it's a little dirty and when it's dirty you're not really going to get the full flavor that you're looking for and you know it's just not as safe I'm always about safety I'm always about cleanliness especially when it comes to our hot box family out there so we're going to show you how to clean your glass piece with the premium glass cleaner many people they use alcohols and stuff like that and we have videos showing how to clean with alcohol but if you really want to clean your high-end piece with something that will be fast and effective and you're willing to spend a little bit more money you can get something like radiance black label cleaner this is a cleaner that I have used personally for several years it's one of the only cleaners that I'll use my trying to several other cleaners some of them work well they all work pretty well but this one works quickly and that's the most important thing for me I don't want to have to keep it soaking or something of that nature I want to be able to be in and out within several minutes so everybody sit back line up that bowl and I'm going to show you what you need to do in order to clean your glass so now that you have your dirty bomb or water pipe from chameleon glass there's a few steps that you can take here and there's a few little extra accessories that you can have that will make this easier but basically what you need is just the Randy's black label okay one thing you can use to make to make your cleaning a little bit easier it is you can get this from mr. high-end this is sort of like a bowl cleaner and holder this can assist you with cleaning your bottle you're going to want to take out your bowl and get all the ashes out of there and you could do that on this little Bowl poker that comes with the mr. high-end think of this call just a poker or something like that but we'll have that information in the description but basically you can go ahead and just lightly scrape around the edges and you'll see that your bowl is going to be slightly cleaner than it was before then you can simply they made this really really cool is you could go ahead and just sit your bowl right there while it waits to be cleaned so mister high-end he's always coming up with great solutions another piece of the glass that you want to be careful with is the stem so this is the piece in which all of the smoke travels through and since we have this stem here you notice that the glass is not as dirty as maybe some others would be and that's kind of good but this gets really really gunky and this is really really bad um you're just gonna want to put this to the side for a second okay we'll get to that and you have these glass grapes from diviner Pro okay and these glass grips will allow you to kind of like cover the top usually you want to have one that fits exactly we don't have one of those but that doesn't mean we can't use it and that way we can kind of put a little bit of you know so nothing comes out okay and when we put in our randy's you'll see what I'm gonna do these will come in coming in so first you want to pour out all of the excess water all right then Randy's Black Label is it can be a little tricky and it took me a little bit to figure this out but what this is composed of is a liquid and a salt looking material it's grainy so the whole idea is to be able to get just a enough of the salt in there and enough of the liquid in there combined so that you don't over use one or the other and very simply you do that by shaking it up putting your finger on the end of it like this okay you're gonna shake it up you'll hear inside and then you'll simply over your sink point it in there and you'll see a lot of the you know salt or whatever they use come out okay I'm going to get a little bit more alcohol so don't shake it as much because it will settle to the bottom and then you'll go ahead and get some more alcohol in there so that's all you need just a little a few squirts okay that's just a little bit now what we're going to do is take our glass grips okay and very carefully get a good grip on your glass you don't want to break it okay and you're just going to shake it up okay try to work it through so that you get to all the problem areas and you'll see nearly immediately I mean it's much cleaner you'll start to notice that there's a little bit of a haze on the piece parts that haven't been touched yet okay and this works it's instant you know we don't have any there's no there's no time you know time you know timing that we added it or anything like that this is basically done okay what you can do to work it through the rest of the pipe is go ahead and tip it over and it will work its way through the rest and even though the the liquid looks a little bit little dirty it's not dirty you can still use it and then go ahead and flip it back down and a complicated piece like this which has a lot of little parts in it from community glass the typhoon is very easy to clean when you have something like this because you're not shaking it that much I literally just tipped it over one time and back again and it's clean really really quick okay so what's the next step well you can either reuse this which means we can pour this directly it's one of our other pieces or we can pour it out so why don't you conserve a little bit and we'll go ahead and pour some of this into our stem okay so we can go ahead and get this ready to clean okay boom highway to stem can soak a little bit in that and we can just turn on the sink basically just get it get everything out a good way to get all the bubbles out is to just let water go in one hand and it will come out with the other hand if you can see that it's a little trick that I learned but they get everything but it will get the majority of it out and the rest of it you could just work out be careful because your glass will be a most slippery so make sure you got a good grip okay you can probably do the same on this other end to get all the bubbles to the top and then go ahead and shake it out and this is pretty much done right here it's a nice clean piece a clean pipe in the happy pipe I'll tell you that and your lungs will thank you good so now that we have all the excess off the outside and there's no more bubbling you'll know it's all about me because the water stays clear there's no more of the alcohol or whatever they are using clean it out okay that's how you know you're safe and that's it go ahead and get you a paper towel or a washcloth wipe it on the outside so that's not slippery anymore okay there you go peace is basically clean that's it nice and clean perfect much cleaner than it was before and that was just with a little bit of the Raney's now let's move on to a little bit more of a complicated piece the stem is very very fragile you do not want to slam this around if this hits in the wrong way it will break and a stem like this looks like it's probably one that you can't really get in the store some of them you'll be able to you regular just standard stem but I'm not sure if you can get this exact one so we're going to make sure that we take good care of it now as you can see because you had the alcohol already in it just a little bit of water we'll get most of this out okay so the biggest problem with something like this is first of all you did a little bit on your hands because there's some on the outside but also there's been opening on egrants so how do we get it so that we are able to shake it out great question glass grip from divider Pro this is something actually I just got so I usually would have to kind of like put my finger over it and it really wouldn't work so well so I'd waste a lot but with this I feel like we have a good opportunity to if you can see I'm pinching it okay so that there isn't any slack and I'm putting my fingers around it so we don't drop it we're gonna take this the randy's again we're going to shake it up remember before you use it shake it up okay I'm just going to put a little bit in there and just swish it back and forth this won't take much keep working in with water a way to get you'll notice that the outside is sticky and my hands are getting sticky very easily fixed what I like to do is is take some of the Randy's and put it directly on my hand just a little bit barely any okay so you have a little bit of the sand and then we just kind of just push it back and forth and our again like this and it will clean the entire glass piece if you already see it's becoming much cleaner than it was before that and your hands are starting to clean up I wouldn't recommend using it all the time on your hands cause it'll really really dry out of their hands but if you ever did any residuals on your hand brandy is great so now we've only basically used a few swigs of this and it's pretty much clean but let's get the rest of it okay that's not a problem put our bomb grit our hourglass grip on the end again okay just so we can preserve some of it I know it didn't save all of it last time but can't be perfect and there you go I tried to put the little grains on the parts of the glass that were already dirty so that way you would brush up against it and yeah this looks like it'll be clean if I just put some some more water to it so for the third and final time yeah we're clean so not too bad it's only been a few minutes if you guys have been watching much better than soaking your glass piece overnight I don't think I can wait overnight I like mine to be clean and I can use it right away so that was three washes in the sink with a few sprays of the of the range so it's not like we're using the whole bottle just between one piece you can easily clean several pieces and some with one bottle of randy's if you use it properly so now that that's all clean and we drive it off go ahead and reattach it this is perfectly clean this is a type of water pipe that I like to use last piece is the bowl this is actually an easy piece to clean you simply plug one end with your finger like so okay and then you're going to put the Randi's on this side again shaking up the randy's because you want the the liquid and the salts the grains to mix so you have a nice even amount spray some in there take your finger if you don't have anything else and and just push it around the side here like this okay and then you can shake this back and forth okay got a little bit out got a little bit of it out in the sink now plug your finger on the other end so bad it won't go through so that we can kind of swish it around and this is so small you just want to put a little bit okay swish it around like that that's pretty much gonna all come out this is really caked up but swish it around again make sure you get the grains in there because that's what's going to rub up against everything and get it to come out and if you just put them put it between your fingers like this and shake it back and forth it won't take long okay oh yeah this is about playing this one doing that okay a lot of gunk coming out of there why it's a good thing to smoke glass that way this doesn't go in your lungs unfortunately okay now we just have the little areas and we'll just continue to plug each side okay without using any extra material okay no toothpicks no pipe cleaners and those are all accessories that you can use that will make this go by a little bit quicker but this is pretty quick this side is pretty much clean you know that this would be the last time for this item okay go ahead hold it between your hands you can see breaks it apart almost immediately let's get one good shape just so we don't have to do it again you have a little piece like this okay you might want to use a little pipe cleaner let's get in there I'm pretty picky so I wanted to be super clean for some people this would be good enough for me and you wanted to be really really clean so if you've seen me out at the Cup or something or wherever and you got a dirty piece man I mean I want to hit that see how picky I am about it so good it make sure you wash it off you'll know all that just that the randy's solution is up because it won't be slippery you'll be able to really really grip it just get our rag I like to use one of those rags that's kind of like a microfiber cloth that just cleans it it doesn't leave any residual material on it that's it we're all clean okay fill it back up ready to go nice and clean this is a totally different piece from what we looked at before and it really wasn't even that dirty and that just goes to show you how much gunk will be hidden if you don't if you don't clean it so remember Brandis black label they also have a green solution definitely go grab it at your local smoke shop remember guys a clean fight is a happy fight and it's much safer and helped you for you to be smoking out of glass that is clean Brandy's Black Label was one option for you there's several out there but I highly recommend that you use it can cost anywhere from five to ten dollars at your local shop and if your shop doesn't carry this option I recommend that they they get it ok it will definitely help you clean your piece faster thanks for the assistance from Meister and from divided pro with the glass bricks all their information will be located

because my first car was purple it was an Isuzu amigo and was sick and purple is just the color that I'll always be fun Jane Fonda this is the news trip pipe it comes with a quartz banger and a bowl but today we're gonna be using the quartz banger it's made of silicone it's purple silicone this this comes out kind of tricky we're gonna put the water in here probably about halfway I would think maybe we don't use tap water either only bottom one from my rigs strictly for my rigs can't never could right okay we're we're getting here you don't want to put your quartz banger in until you've got it secured and then once you got it secure go ahead and do whatever you want so we're gonna put the banger in you know I've got some nice bottled it's chilled some nice chilled bottled water but down here in the glass I'm gonna be using a lemon oh gee Rasen this is from true leave I haven't been able to find anymore that dry sip that I like so much but this is a lemon oh gee rosin from truly he's got a lot of flavor I used bottled water we don't use tap water for our rigs as I mentioned maybe I didn't it's got a suction cup so I can put it on the on the table I'm not sure how long I've been heating that up but it's probably been gonna let it chill for about 30 seconds well I get the dab ready all right so now I'm gonna take this nice chunk of lemon og throw blob right here or drop it right in there that's a monster I might have put it in a little hot in fact I'm certain that I put it in a little hot I think rosin always Chaz's the banger so like I put the first one in pretty hot I'm using a lemon oh gee and I did a dab and I think I did it too hot and I was still trying to perfect and I wasn't paying attention to the time so I'm pretty sure that we're pretty good on time and

them into these and fit all these together I put all glue over those put a little rubber piece right here the downstem fits into perfectly pretty sick pretty soon comes down into the end line right here you can see it's a harmonic in line which goes up and this chamber comes down out ten trees comes up into two Gatorade caps that has a little bottle of lotion it used to be some lotion that has little slits down here causing it to diffuse with the diffuser marbles so this start off is a little hair spray bottle like a lysol bottle this was a sobe bottle of plastic sobe here's a cap to a crab

couple where we explore and discuss our passion for cannabis on today's vlog we are here in the dab and cabin kitchen and we are going to be showing you some ways that you can keep your bong clean yes and not just any regular bong but specifically bongs that are a little bit more on the fancy side especially ones that have really unique features just like our freeze pipes here they've got some internal coils as well as some percolators down in the bottom on this bigger one we are going to dirty these up a little bit more and then dive into showing you guys how to keep them clean hey cheers everyone cheers okay yeah let's get these guys clean yes let's go we think it's really cool that freeze pipe partnered with the original 420 to create a custom cleaning bundle that is everything you need to clean your piece it comes with 420 cleaning solution along with rubber caps and plugs and don't worry if you miss anything in this video we're going to have a pin comment down below with a link to freeze pipe step-by-step guide with more tips on how to keep things clean first thing we're going to clean is this glycerin coil here at the top uh you just have to unhook it comes with a large and a small it's all like individually like packaged look at this it's a little rubber put this over the air okay can we get a close-up of this that is suggestive is what that is stretch is more than you think pant condom okay so we've got our 420 cleaner here shake it yeah and hear those crystals it's sandy something that has an abrasion to it i can actually get the resin off there when i see it just go in and going down in apply this large top yes just go back and forth running the solution through the coil it says to do this for about like five minutes and after you do this for five minutes uh it then says to like let it marinate solution in there we are shook pull out the big guy i love you can tell it's got a couple of extra coils in it right this one does look a little bit different versus the smaller one clean first on this guy is this base with all of these mini percolators and as you can tell it needs some love yes just emptied out all of the nasty water and the thing that we're going to be using new from the cleaning bundle for this guy are these like plugs bam there we go oh activate the crystals activate them crystals get the percolators totally submerged you can see it is definitely not just liquid we've got the stopper in the bottom we're going to put a cap on the top here really fit pretty much yeah thank you they're stretched they're easy to put on we're also going to drop some solution into the down stem shake it up get it all over the down stem area getting that tight seal so none of the solution is coming out shake this for about two to five minutes and then let it also marinate set aside let's pull out the other one all right cool now that we've let this sit we're just gonna empty this out into the sink pull off the rubber cap oh got a snap to it run it with uh warm water and basically now for the smaller base and the larger coil it's going to be the same process as the larger base and the smaller coil okay some things you got to get close up for look at these percolators hey right that's a cool thumbnail hey our pieces are ready for some hits we just fill them with some clean water i can attach my other little like coil right here to me like the best benefit of this is when it comes straight out of the freezer for me i'm actually going to switch it up and use one of freeze pipes brand new accessories they're hollow too check that out so if you want this as a backup to use while your freeze pipe attachment is in the fridge getting cold if you want something that's easier to clean because you don't necessarily want to have to deal with getting all of the coil and forcing all that down there this is a cool new way to just like kind of upgrade your bong nothing like the first fresh head oh love it [Music] wow how was

the bull's relief from stress and insomnia that has been known to give some people dry eyes and of course the paces this plant is a hybrid linked to OG Kush with a strong and sweet herbal and earthy flavors to land you in the sofa if you're not a seasoned smoker Leafly gives it a 4.3 out of 5 so today we have two pipes to show you this first is a handmade ceramic chalice pipe handcrafted locally in Victoria BC by pipes by Eric this piece utilizes a ceramic Chilam for the down stem which contains a stone screen designed to keep your butt from falling through as you smoke to be used by itself as a cello more one-hitter it has to be placed between the fingers and spoke from the base of your thumbs you might need a friend to light it though this unique piece can also be used as part of the chalice which is filled just below the side holes with water the water is too high it will get sucked into the pipe as you smoke it's never Pleasant but it doesn't take much so you just put a little bit in there and it'll work fine you used it as a combo place the Chilam into the top of the chalice and hold it in your hand just like an old-fashioned pipe this way you can control the flow of air with your thumb it allows you to choose when your head is done this part is called a carb or carburetor this next piece is a glass bubbler hand-blown in India it also has a car just like the chalice and has a bit of water in the bottom the filter in school your smoke you just fill it up from the side either through the car or it's through the top although I would suggest drying it afterwards and then you're ready to smoke let's try Eric's chalice out first I'm gonna use it as the combo and put some of this beautiful busted-up diamond og in there [Music] you could place the piece between your fingers like this to use it as a chilling but we'll use it as a whole chalice letting just a small corner so I can control just how much I'm smoking each of these unique pieces takes over five hours to make now let's try the hand-blown Indian bubbler the freestanding design and thick glass you'll solid in the hand and it's easy to fill hold and light [Music] this solid piece fits great in a pocket or a pouch although Eric's pipe also breaks down into small pieces for transportation both these pipes allow for a lot of the buds flavor to come through while still managing to filter the heat and harsh out of the tote the indian bubbler has thicker more potent totes but seems as though it would be much harder to clean than ours handmade chalice Eric's chalice still gives a great pull and the reed mouthpiece only impart SAS light for tea flavor which can be nice I love the basket and accessory as well both of these great pieces are available at pineapple Express on ask why Mount Road

for Keller Vader killer video all right I made a bubbler here at Sudoku bottles over here over here and this part right here is part of it like bendable laser so slacker oh this this right here is our

cleaning and nectar collector got my semi dirty nectar collector I've definitely seen way dirtier ones than this online but you know for the purpose of demonstration I think this will work so first of all we want to get the dirty water out yeah just blow into it get that water out of there really easy way to clean your nectar collectors with isopropyl alcohol I got some 91% here that's that's the good stuff alright so we're gonna put this in my handy shot glass and we're gonna get some of the ISO in the nectar collector by sucking the water in don't suck too hard it does not taste good alright so we're just gonna shake this up and let it soak for a little while and we'll come back in a little bit and show you the next step here we are with this honey bird deluxe that we are soaking with isopropyl alcohol it's been soaking for about 20 minutes I'm just gonna give it a good shake out here and now as you can see most of the residual oil inside here has come out so alright I think we're ready for the next step here we are at sink ready to do the final stage of cleaning on this honey bird deluxe so I'm gonna blow out the ISO alcohol that's in here and then I learned this trick from a good friend of mine Bluto pug who who is always figuring out how to clean these things better and better and his suggestion was to take a towel and kind of wrap up your piece and set in the sink straight over your your your hot water get the water running and then just let the water run through it and the hot water is actually going to flush out any of the extra oil in there and just let it let the water run for a few minutes on it and the end result will be a perfectly clean piece alright so this has been flushing with water for a few minutes now let's look at the results alright we got a pretty clean piece there if you got a few little spots in there that could maybe use a little more soaking so you know if you need to repeat these steps go ahead and fill it with ice oh and let it soak for a while flush it out with hot water and you'll have a pristine piece [Music]", "jJ8QEgIcefM": "[Music] the mini bubbler for the fury 2 is a great way to add one-piece water filtration to your fury to experience it's very simple to use it's a combined stem and water piece all-in-one now I've got about 3/4 of an inch and inch of water in there fill it to around this amount give it a couple hits make sure you're not getting anything in your mouth if you are just pour some out to load it I just like to turn it on its side grab some herb place that inside the bowl fill it up pretty much all the way I never like to pack it in there and then there you go as long as you press it gently it's gonna stay in there and not go anywhere simply use that with your fury tool like this I like to go on a reasonably high temperature maybe around 390 395 and then the mini bubbler is just gonna sit right inside the bowl like that adding a mini bubbler any kind of water filtration to your vaporizer experience is going to give you cooler and smoother vapor which makes it much more pleasant very nice [Music]", "DtYs1sXLe80": "hello senior stoner fans it's the real senior stoner back at you for an afternoon discussion on glass this is something i've really never talked about before but it struck me recently when i purchased another high-end bong it struck me the differences between different water percolating devices i don't want to use the term bong anymore so let's discuss from the right my right to my left from the right the least expensive to the left the most expensive and you're going to see why i didn't know why but i learned why and i'm going to share it with you let's talk first of all please don't pay attention to if there's dirt in some of these i haven't used one of these for a long time this is the one this is the least expensive glass device i could find of a nice size i bought it on dhgate.com which is a knockoff company in china that sells everything long story short i thought i had found the holy grail it wasn't the holy grail because as you can see the way it's constructed and designed it's very very hard to clean the inside piping and the design work the other thing i noted this was about 29 was that the glass was so light and thin this is extremely light and thin glass okay that's what you get for 29 got it well now we're going to move up further we're going to move up to another dhgate product but a 49 product now what a 49 product does is it gives you two different layers for percolation let me move these aside and show you what it does so what happens is that water then blends up through the top and would give you more water filtration the problem with both of these devices these two is they're both from china they're both cheap knock-offs and unfortunately in the world of glass it looks like you get what you pay for i have put them in the basement and haven't used them in a long time the challenge with this one is it's just designed poorly the challenge with this one is it's not good quality but once again you get what you pay for in this world let's pull them aside because i just wanted to use them as an example of inexpensive bonds and what you get if you remember i was in the mattress business just like bed if you pay 99 for a mattress good luck having it be any thicker than this okay you're not gonna get a jumbo pillow top unless you're spending fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars today so let's discuss glass the same way you want borrow skillet glass you want lab quality glass you want glass that's going to last glass that's going to be heavy in your hand now let's get to it this is a higher standard nine inch bubbler what this is designed for basically is to put any type of bowl if you will into it it is very versatile i put my g pen connect into it not just a bowl i put my honey badger into it not just a bowl very versatile piece made by higher standards this is a graph piece very similar you can see the graph piece and the higher standard piece are thicker thicker they're branded their companies are proud of their product and they have a very very nice weighted base both of them these are designed well they're designed well they're versatile i have both of them even though they're similar so now you understand what a bubbler is this is a 9-inch bubbler probably this is a 10-inch bubbler the design behind these is to allow you to put anything into the female mouthpiece anything you want and you can turn it into an email with a honey badger really really versatile devices great the challenge though with any bong nowadays you go on ebay you go on the internet and you look for a screen you know what you're gonna get this pardon that is black you're gonna get this it's a copper bordered already formed wire bowl about a half an inch wide and when you put it into a bowl like this it's a good fit but when you put it into some others it's not a good fit so what i don't understand about any of these devices frankly is why why a great product high quality product would want you to pull through a hole into the water all the residue i don't get it it's counterintuitive why they want you to dirty up your water peace water especially which is expensive does it make sense so that's a flaw in bongs in bubblers because you have to use a screen you have to you're going to say maybe some of you oh no that's what the hole is for you pull through well guess what you're going to see that there's some residue inside some of these bonds because of that but let's keep going well the session the newest one in the house i'm liking it mrs stoner is liking it the reason we like the session the reason we like the session is not just the quality now i will talk about the quality it's a really nice stand it's a really easy pull to pull up the bowl with its handle and the glass man this glass is thick okay i don't know how many millimeters it is but this is the thickest glass these two items you're going to see now are the thickest glass i've seen that's important okay the other part about the session this long that's really cool is it simple all you gotta do is inhale there's no holes there's no buttons there's no attachments you take your hit and clear it take your hit and clear it really simple so quality here meant simplicity it's also a versatile device but it is not the same opening size okay got to remember that it's a different opening size the session a wonderful device newest piece in the house i'm really liking it but let's move to the higher the hair agir this i don't even know how to describe it other than that it's a monster the hair or the higher is as i spoke before has a whole solid brass bowl believe it or not with a hole for you to put your weed in i'm not big on holes so even though that beautiful thing is there i end up sticking a screen in because i don't like pulling stuff through the bong water that's just me but one of the things that's great about this piece is the hit it gives the mouthpiece on this can you see the mouthpiece on this it's the size of a flamethrower i mean it's a monster check it out i mean you can hear it so what you've got here is you've got a tremendous assortment in the marketplace and what i hope i've done is shown you that there are really differences between glass pieces and the differences amount to price obviously which goes to performance okay and quality so you got to remember in this world you get what you pay for and what we want to do if we probably want to settle somewhere in the middle let's assume that we don't want to buy the cheapest thing on the market because it's not great and let's assume why should we buy the most expensive thing on the market because something else going to come out better so you buy the sweet spot that's where the action is in all types of things cars beds baseball mitts you name it these two okay and these two are the devices the grav and the higher standards happen to be the two devices that i use the most and here is why all the other devices really are designed for weed for flour these devices i bought specifically specifically because their female parts worked with my electronic attachments so what you can do in this world is you can spice things up quite a bit you can get a g pen connect you can get a honey badger you can get a go can torch there are a number of things out there on the market now that you can turn your bubbler your bong into an e-ring and that's what i did there hope you

capacity of point 4 grams with one button operation and ample vapor production you are going to be satisfied with every drop I like to send it to anyone for many reasons but my favorite parts of a deep chamber tasty vapor and how easy it is to use the one button on the side controls everything and the temperature options cover all the basics I would say this vaporizer is for fans of the crafty and mighty who can't splash the cash on a 300 plus dollar device all these reasons add up to the utility and 7:21 sitting in our number 5 spot coming in at number 4 the Arizer solo 2 is a great conduction vaporizer with flavor coming out of everywhere that long last stem that is a risers trademark cools the vapor really well before it hits your lips and the airflow is very free-flowing it comes with two of these glass aroma tubes a glass aroma dish some sample botanicals and no it's not the same kind of botanicals that we used to refer to on this channel actual botanicals a charger a carrying case with a belt clip if your feeling dad like to stem caps a stir tool and four screens the digital display and precise temperature control give you the ability to customize every aspect of your session and the three hours of battery-life is nothing to scoff at either the chamber holds up to 0.25 grams and it is nothing short of a workhorse vaporizer it is a well-built powerful device that will hit you harder than a freight train on steroids look the solo 2 was the third vaporizer I ever bought and I still have mine to this day it holds a special place in my collection and I love using it when friends come over or when I have a solo session I hate myself it's not necessarily a beautiful piece of machinery but it gets the job done and it is sturdy as hell one of my favorite things to do with the solo 2 is to run it through a water peace cooling the vapor down even more it gives some great smooth rips off a very capable device and that's why it comes in at number four coming in at number three the utili and 722 released at the end of 2019 brings a breath of fresh air to the award-winning view Tilian line the new sleek look and redesigned shell is classy as hell sorry and it's not just the aesthetics that have been updated this vaporizer maintains all the things that people loved event the 721 including 30-second heat up town while adding a couple more features utility does refine the airflow increase the maximum temperature and improved the boost mode all of these things add up to a better full spectrum extraction and I really love the changes to the 722 it comes with a cleaning brush tweezers a wax canister a set of o-rings and a USB charger the 2300 milliamp hour internal battery will have you vaporizing for 60 continuous minutes the included wax canister will help you paper as your favorite concentrate especially because the highest temperature has been increased to 225 degrees Celsius another true two-in-one the 722 is elegant in design and function features a point four gram chamber and has officially replaced the 721 in my lineup don't get me wrong I love the 721 but I just can't say no to a version update I love this vaporizer because didn't cost me much money and it looks and performs like a much more expensive device I call it my ballin on a budget vaporizer I'm sorry I said them nevertheless it comes in at our number three spot in spot number two the world renowned mighty from Storz and Bickel hasn't changed much in 2019 but it didn't really need to did it the mighty has great battery life tasty hits and packs a punch that could rival Anthony Joshua in the ring it is bigger than most portables surely but that trade-off gives you great design cool cool vapor and added functionality it features precise temperature control from 40 to 210 degrees Celsius the intricate cooling system housed in the mighty keeps your lips nice and chilly it's not a thing it comes with a grinder filling aid cleaning brush liquid pad extra set of o-rings charger and a dosing capsule for when you don't want to take your whole kit on the go look we all love the mighty if you have ever used a mighty there is a 100% chance that you enjoyed your experience if I could afford one I would have one I might steal this one don't tell anyone it features ninety minutes of continuous use that delicious flavor that Storz and Bickel is known for and can handle concentrates as well the reason it didn't make our number one spot is simple plastic if you've seen any of our other videos if I'm paying $300 for a device I don't want plastic yes I know it's not in the vapor path and yes I know it's specifically made plastic but still give me a nice tight metal body that sound gross I bet that sounded gross I didn't mean it nevertheless this is a fantastic vaporizer and that's why it sits in our number-two spot and now the moment you've all been waiting for or scrubbing - in our top spot this year is none other than the Zeus Ark named cannabis product of the Year at Oak cannabis 2019 the Ark is tiny and packed full of great features the haptic feedback will let you know when the unit is reached temperature and the accelerometer will detect when you haven't touched the unit in a while and will start to cool down to savior it also features an all gold vapor path which cools the vapor off really well and makes the hits off the zeus arc incredibly smooth comes with the charging cable a half pack spacer a flow singh tool and a bunch of cleaning tools it has a powerful 3500 million our internal battery which will last you 90 minutes of continuous use this high performance vaporizer offers massive clouds of flavorful vapor in a small compact body it looks incredible and the performance holds up to that look it's like picking up a novel with an awesome cover and then reading the novel and realizing you could have judged this book by the cover it gives me the high gloss German sports car feel I want in anything German made that tight metal body I was talking about earlier why did I say it again gross I've had my Arc since late 2018 when it was released and it is my go-to day-to-day device it is another unit I absolutely love ripping through my bomb one of my favorite parts about it is that it can come with you almost everywhere and it even fits inside of that don't lose [ __ ] pocket inside of your jeans you know that pocket in the pocket of your jeans I'm not gonna stand up and show you my lower half I'm not an animal but you get it either way all of these features add up to a fantastic vaporizer and that's why it's it's in our number one spot before we go a quick footnote we wanted to include the crafty plus in this list as it is another well-built device from Storz and Bickel the updates to the unit are great and I'll throw the link to the full video up in the corner here sadly Apple is seriously taken away from this device as they have removed all vaporizer apps from their App Store this means that roughly 50% of all vaporizer users will not be able to have the full experience of the crafty plus for those of you who have the Storz and Bickel app already this is a great device and definitely worth checking out but Apple helped Storz and Bickel elbow Jim and that's it for this one guys thank you so much for watching this video if you enjoyed it if you learned

vaporizer that I was able to get my hands on this is a all concentrate variation of their really popular dry herb vaporizer the normal a px so what we have here very compact unit with the chamber on top it's actually only it's like three and a half inches three and three-quarter inches tall the battery itself is around two inches so this thing is very small making it easy to take with you on the go constructed with an anodized aluminum body same sort of material that the PAX vaporizer is made out of and actually pulsar has redesigned their solid color a px dry units and they all come with this solid aluminum style body it looks really nice finish like brushed aluminum good-looking I don't like it let's go ahead and take a look at what's in the box pretty small packaging I don't think you really need too much with a wax vaporizer and in here it looks like we have a standard metal low tool they hook you up with a little silicone concentrate container put your waxes in it and I'm guessing also pretty necessary charger so three little accessories and a an instruction manual down at the bottom alright so let's take a look at the unit itself like I said it's compact vaporizer or just concentrates it's got a glass mouth guard that fits over a triple coil quartz atomizer you know kind of like men's razors how many coils can we add to an atomizer as of right now the answer is three can have three coils to an atomizer and what this does is you really get more surface area and it allow you to get larger hits out of one unit so this simply threads off as well it all comes apart and there's the battery and with the atomizer removed from the base all the pieces there just simply throw it all back together and go back on and you're good to go not much to it very straightforward device whereas most wax vaporizers like the pen styles are you know just like a battery with a button this one here the Pulsar apx wax when you press it five times to unlock you have a battery display so you're not gonna just suddenly run out when you're out using the vaporizer can't they've no more you're actually able to see when it goes down that's pretty nice along with a battery display it also has an indicator on there a little Peter represent the Pulsar logo so when you hold this down for five seconds initially it's going to start off red but after you've held it for five seconds the P will change colors got to be a better way to say that so in the user manual the Pulsar provides they actually discussed two different ways to use it they have a fill then heat method where you put your concentrates in hold the button down and allow it to heat up probably the more common way and then they also mention a like a pre heat by holding it down dropping your concentrate on I guess capping it and going so we'll do it the normal way first that I would say most people vaporize and that's by taking the concentrate and putting it on the coil and then holding it down to heat it up so I got a little crumble here I'm gonna go ahead and just toss this right on to the coil and let's see I'm just gonna slip the tap back over unlock it by pressing it five times there we go five times flash a couple times at you and you can go instantly so let's go for it pretty large clouds it is a triple coil so I am expecting to get big hits out of it I tried to keep an eye on the the letter here the indicators so I could see when it changed to green five second hits probably really all you need can go longer why not things a little fog machine I'm feeling it it's hitting hard right the little lungs it's not warm though like I hide burns or anything lips feel good on your - that's not getting overly hot a little powerhouse that's for sure for something so small well that was the first method and the other method figure probably be beneficial since we've already been heating it up they say to hold down the coil and then put the concentrate on I mean kind of strange method I think cuz won't it kind of like burn off the concentrate before you really even have a chance to get a hit on it so let's see put this aside take a little bit of my concentrate and hold it down and when it hits the 5 seconds I'm gonna train it's already beeping a little from before but let's see there's five seconds drop it on that's pretty instant captain it works cuz you're getting a hit right away but kind of stressful trying to do all these things at once so it worked worked well but if you like to take a little more relaxed approach I'd go with the first method of filling it up with your concentrate pulling it down and going that's more convenient from the road you stay like when you're out and about I like that first method either way those hit the apx wax being a triple coil vaporizer tripple quartz coil specifically doesn't have too much competition out there quite yet but one of the big players in the game is the source philosophy is the excel it is also a triple quartz coil vaporizer take a look at the comparison here these two you can see I'm the source version of the triple coil it's a little bit longer on the coils and the bowl itself is a little deeper so for someone who's looking to get those huge rips and is pretty experienced it's a good option just because you can hold more as far as like a nice beginner version and I'm more affordable when it's wet in a apx wax you're still gonna get the large clouds you're not gonna get the complete voltage and wattage temperature control that you you get with this one over here but at a fraction of the cost you are able to get a nice vapor production out of it as you can see pretty large clouds it's very compact in comparison as well so I do like this unit quite a bit just remove time I've had using it when compared in size if anyone's familiar with the apx the dry herb unit will give you a good idea they're almost parallel it's actually a little bit shorter and without the atomizer attached it's like half the size so what I like about the apx wax the size ultra compact you can take this with you almost anywhere the heat time heats up within about five seconds and taking large rips off the triple coil and just like the flavor it's clean it doesn't have any like kind of off unusual taste to it no metallic or anything like that and yeah one two tastes really good because investing a lot of money in these concentrates are not cheap so you can get good flavor out of it what I don't like and maybe a little nitpicky you got glass here it's more prone to breaking than like a solid metal attachment would be but that is something that they run a risk with because you get better flavor out of that as well glass Oh at all the apx wax is a good vaporizer for someone who wants to get large clouds but doesn't necessarily want much of a learning curve to it it's pretty straightforward five clicks put the wax on heat it and go it's not complicated at all so it's a great entry-level wax vaporizer that can really produce some large clouds now any questions or comments go ahead and leave them down there we'll get back to as always cheers guys [Music]

an art opening in New York to get a look at some expensive bongs so the art exhibit tonight it's actually being held at a guy's apartment named mr. gray all I know is that he's 21 years old and he's an art collector in the south mr. gray welcome to great space art today nice to meet you right now these guys are killing it in the world of cannabis but the condemned girl world has no quit exist yet so all these people are coming here tonight they're seeing this for the first time and they're going wait a second that's a beautiful piece of art and I go yeah you could also smoke out of it and actually this piece in particular you take the dome off and it's another piece really yeah oh that's really cool yeah oh it's really the highest-end stoner art you could get to the point where it's not stoner art at all its art that that reaches the contemporary art world yeah I mean they shouldn't be in a head shop right exactly and you know Robert Mickelson himself is actually very converse possible he's been in the Smithsonian before Corning Glass Museum he was classically trained really well known glass art right money for what all right there's a random man just keeping put money in your pocket you're like you know that's what happens here greyspace our magic happens yeah how did you get involved with this whole thing I joined a venture capital group and it was only for weave companies and there I'm a the guy who manufactured bones and I saw the manufacturing process which was interesting and then he said take a look next door there's some artists doing some interesting things there and I walk next door and there were these artists renting a warehouse from him blowing glass sculpture that you could smoke out of these weren't bongs first and foremost they were art and I knew immediately that I needed to bring it to the contemporary art world [Music] I'm not selling pipes on selling pieces of art be to smoke out and I want people to see it in the right setting and this is the right setting this is New York City and if people ask me all the time opening Colorado that's that's where the cannabis businesses it's much more about the art market and art is flourishing in New York more than anywhere else in America me and mr. gray actually went to kindergarten together like 20 years ago what's the surface real name Ben Benjamin Milstein for me he's always been B so the weird thing about this party's it's happening during New York Fashion Week but what you're seeing was a lot of people who are kind of in the fashion world in the art world young people eating very nice sushi drinking very nice champagne trying not to knock over very nice boxed you're one of the artists behind one of my favorite pieces and one of the most expensive pieces here tonight so can you tell me a little bit about this guy this piece is a robotic ocean protector goddess when it does get smoked it'll be a special time you know like a fine wine this is a bong this is you try to be kidding me how is this a bong so the mouthpiece that you put your mouth use right there the hole this is the joint where your nail goes on for concentrates and then this part comes off the frame comes off and you can smoke and clean it well this is to me like it's all ready to take this to the next level of art because it's taking the space that we know art as which is wall display and doing what you do best which is turning it into a bowl think a lot of my work kind of has that quality to it desire to see classy beautiful things that are recognizable in the art context I believe in the shared vision that a lot of pipe artists have to put this work out there in the proper setting and show it to people they might not ever run into it why did it take someone like you who's very young to come into this world and say I'm the guy that's gonna take this medium and make it a contemporary art idea you know why because it takes someone from outside the bomb scene to see that this is not a bomb at all that's a piece of art as the people buying this right now they're they're smokers they smoke out of these pieces and so they see it first and foremost as a functional piece of art and I see it as an art piece that's functional [Music]", "cJmR_E7iPX8": "alright so here we have a homemade to chamber level is made out of 20 ounce Dr Pepper bottle straw Electric safe

sound of the super 44 if you've wondered what the different series of mufflers sound like you're not alone most shops aren't willing to install each pair of mufflers just so you can hear what they sound like time is money but today we're gonna take the time to test eight of flowmasters popular mufflers so you can hear what they all sound like on a highly modified muscle car today we're looking at flowmasters line of mufflers for street rods and muscle cars for milder sounding like the super 50 moderate sounding like the pro series and 50 series Delta flow to the aggressive sounding mufflers like the 40 series Delta flow super 40 original 40 series the super 44 and the smallest and most aggressive of the bunch the super 10 the Dodge Challenger we have here is a great test mule for that classic flowmaster sound and we're here to help you make a decision on which muffler better suits your needs as we test the different mufflers keep in mind that every car will be different our Mopar has 550 horsepower coming from its 408 cubic in stroker making it a very aggressive sounding engine so even the milder mufflers are going to have a lot of tone we're here to help you make a decision on which muffler better suits your needs so let's get right to it the super 50 mufflers have a relatively mild exterior sound they're a great choice for daily driven cars because in most cases there's minimal interior resonance this is the quietest flowmaster we can fit on this particular car although not the quietest flowmaster offered if you don't want to make your presence known from blocks away this muffler will allow you to make an appearance without turning heads before you arrive inside you'll be able to hear your music and your passengers just fine from the outside the idle is a little healthier than a stock muffler but revving the engine lets people know that it's definitely not stock [Music] if you want a little bit of Rumble but still want to keep it tame you have a couple of mufflers to choose from the 50 series Delta flow mufflers have a Rumble to them and you'll be heard when you arrive you probably won't wake the neighbours with these but you will get noticed the Challenger is starting to sound more like a muscle car now but it's still tame enough that the sound isn't overbearing on longer trips the pro series mufflers are a patented laminar flow design with excellent performance characteristics you'll get a rumble with more bass tone than the 50 series Delta flow with street and strip performance in mind this is a muffler that will give you open header performance but still maintain a reasonable sound like the Delta flow the pro-series will give you a milder interior sound level now we're getting into the more aggressive sounding mufflers these mufflers will announce your arrival and like all flow masters these mufflers have that classic chambered sound but it's going to be louder and more aggressive flowmaster has a few mufflers in the aggressive sound range and each of these may give you a noticeable interior resonance conversations will need to be a little higher volume and a wide-open throttle conversation loses out to the sound of the mufflers the Challenger is rumbling like a muscle car should and these mufflers will be more noticeable on long trips if you want an aggressive sound in a deeper Rumble the aggressive mufflers are what you want we're installing the 40 series Delta flow first then the super 40 the 40 series super 44 and lastly will be the super 10 which will give you the deepest Rumble and loud a sound of all the mufflers we test today the 40 series Delta flow has additional Delta plates inside for better performance with the added benefit of reduced interior resonance to keep it somewhat tame [Music] the super 40 mufflers have a slightly different sound with more bass tones the 40 series mufflers can you hear the difference the super 44 mufflers [Music] the super 10 muffler series are the smallest and as you can probably tell they're also the loudest these are reading at ninety two point three decibels conversation we'll have to wait until you reach your destination [Music] as you can tell the Muppets got a little bit more aggressive and considerably louder by the time we got to the super 10 series mufflers from mild to wild now you have a little better idea of what sort of sound you can expect from each series of mufflers keep in mind different engines will have very different sound characteristics this Mopar is very aggressive sounding with its 3-inch exhaust so for you guys with 300 horsepower engines and two and a quarter inch exhaust expect quieter sounds across the board remember to than a major part of the sound quality from this or any car is the presence of a crossover pipe most folks prefer the sound of the H pipe although for performance the X design works well too the flowmaster sound is classic and for every car you have several choices [Music] you [Music]",

your preferred wax into the chamber using your stainless steel tool once you have completed this replace the bubbler and you are good to go if you prefer to use the nectar collector simply load your wax into the board's jar then fire the unit while dipping the nectar collector into the quartz charm and watch the vapor rise the headbanger has three voltage settings that you can switch between by pressing the fire button three times rapidly green is the lowest at 3 point 4 volts who is 3.7 and red is 4.2 volts let me tell you about some of the key features of a headbanger which make it such an outstanding device the first is of course the nectar collector this little attachment makes packing a tab simple the second is the design the is definitely unique the two-in-one ability is amazing and

it's Thomas here and today I want to show you how to organize and hide your airline tubing so that your tank doesn't look awful like this which is just completely unacceptable so where to start let me show you first things first you want to pick an airline tubing that's going to blend well with the background on your aquarium so for instance if your aquarium background is black you're going to want to use black airline tubing if your aquarium backgrounds blue you can use a blue clear tubing if you've got a lot of greens or a mix of blue and green you can try Bluegreen tubing and if you've got a white background no background at all or just a busy background you can use clear tubing and to make sure things really look good and stick well together make sure your suction cups match to black for black and clear for everything else running multiple air stones or air ornaments instead of making an octopus of valves and keys it's a lot better to just use a games out there nice and clean keep things nice and organized that way all the valves are in the same spot if you want to make an adjustment to your ear one when adding air line onto the aquarium it's best to locate it in the quarters of the tank where it's least likely to be obtrusive to your eye if you have it sitting in the center of the aquarium you're going to be able to see it quite easily while you're looking in your tank so moving it off to the side is going to keep it out of the way that way your eye is not likely to be drawn to it another way to minimize the amount of airline tubing you're going to have going into your aquarium is by using one big long air stone if you want bubbles across the entire tank smaller separate air stones will require more tubing in more locations meaning more things to distract you instead of look pretty [Music] I like to use 90 degree elbows at the bottom of the airline tubing right where it meets the bottom pane of glass this way the airline has no issue running directly across the bottom pane of glass horizontally doesn't feel like bunching up or creating a long curve that can make it pop out of the gravel this way everything stays put and it looks clean next plan out where you want all of your ornaments to go in the aquarium once you know where everything is going to go I recommend using clear airline tubing and clear suction cups to run tubing along the bottom of the tank to each ornament or air stone the reason I like to use clear is because if it ever does get uncovered for whatever reason it will more likely blend in with your gravel [Music] you [Music] [Music] now with all the tubing in place it's time to add the gravel [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it also makes a lot more sense to use one big air pump with a gang valve instead of several smaller air pumps this way you use less energy less outlets you're not going to have so many you know things in the stand cluttering things up with tubes and wires and cords you have less vibration and and therefore less noise all in all it's just a much better idea don't forget to use a check valve because that will protect your pump from any water back siphoning through the airline tubing if you had ever shuts off which could cause the pump to be destroyed [Music] you that is how you organize and hide the airline tubing on your aquarium so that you can have many many bubbles without the hideousness and if this still doesn't satisfy you you could always take a plastic plant and just hide the cords at the back that way to you guys have any questions feel free to drop those down in the

from black leaf black leaf I mean eighteen point eight millimeter joint with some beautiful fat ball no spring near it a beautiful down stem this just fit great look at that guy's just look at that with a little bit of water and your pretty pretty much done a little bit of ice over here so yeah guys this is my unboxing guys just just let me guys what do you think about it was a really nice deal guys for this bond I don't want to say any prices I don't want haters and [ __ ] I really don't like haters they think that roar and other stuff just for a [ __ ] pricey to straight tube well anyway I just want to make this pretty quick video guys thanks for all of you this video is just for my 2500 soups how are you guys gonna enjoy these videos and I'm going to enjoy them too and I'll see you guys in the next video guys alright you", "covvGAFn2AI": "what was that one a party people we're here and I have this pipe well you've probably seen it in a previous video where I unboxed it this is the chameleon monsoon pipe via will spill proof I don't know if you guys saw the water that's why yeah but allegedly spill proof pipe from brothers with glass very nice solid I would hit a rock or something but you know you get the idea I'm not the bowl out it was so solid but uh we're gonna be smoking on this today and we've already got it packed up even though it fell out on a pack a little more in do you see this spill-proof [ __ ] oh my god water everywhere everywhere but it's ok I have paper towels or something but you guys can see if the bowl is packed you guys can see in the weed you guys are probably tired of seeing weed it's nothing new it's the weed you've been seeing for the past couple days now slightly different lighting maybe a little different nug keeps showing you guys the real like the main big nug but here's a baby nut for you yeah man I wanted to smoke from this with you guys and just chill out and smoke from it a little bit because I want to record a review video for it today I've written a review for it I feel like recorded footage for it I just haven't sat down and actually recorded a review for it like a video review so I wanted to get that done today but before I did I wanted to refresh myself on just how the experience was with this pipe and as you can see it's [ __ ] spilling everywhere bro but what do you gonna do write a bad review that's what you do but cheers of the guys got your bowls packed two hash snails heated and see how this baby ribs nobody really smooth like for that amount of smoke I got you would think I hit like a little rig or something like that was a good amount of smoke it's hard to hate on this piece bro you see like a [ __ ] rips they [ __ ] really rips and it's [ __ ] smooth but [ __ ] if I show you guys the desk right now it's like covered and water do you and then imagine like you take a couple cokes off of this right and then the water gets all stanky and resinated just like any bong does and then the water spills like it did how you saw earlier smelly [ __ ] water everywhere bro now imagine that in your car on the go because this is like a to go pipe it's really hard I really want to give this thing like a positive review but at the same time I have a lot of major issues with it let's use here's one more hit me get in on the perk action for you guys we know but got me pretty high like for the amount of weed that I packed into it and the hit that I got pretty good just not I don't know man what do you guys think have you guys ever used a spill proof pipe before or like a pipe with water in it I'm really skeptical about these because I love bongs I need water you know like if I could smoke joints through my ball all the time I would I wouldn't even [ __ ] put it to my lips because why why not have a cooler smoother hit why not have everything chilled with ice but it's just you want it to work but it doesn't work too well guess it's kind of spell proof now my bad but I'll let you guys know what the review what I think in full but you guys can can't tell what's going on it's like 50/50 it's not a perfect experience but it's pretty crazy for 60 bucks I think it is maybe 70 you get yourself a really solid pipe this is like really solid I've like not dropped in a few times but I've done that like I don't want to say a test cuz it happens on accident but you know that the thing were you kind of like drop it on the table and it like you you have a moment where you're like did it crack did it nothing and and solid nothing no crack no nothing and even just looking at it really up close you can see there aren't like any crazy Chinese like [ __ ] shitty fusing things going on maybe not the best lighting to show you guys you can see no air bubbles just all like everything just smooth like no no funkiness this is like really sharp here really clean weird like a little china piece nearby I'll show you guys the example of like bad fusing I mean this isn't the best example we have really good examples of stuff that just looks really questionable once you get up close you know like look at this one like you can just see it just what happened bro you should have put down a piece of masking tape or like something it just really got a little drunk there woo beard off you know they're just little inconsistencies like that how they look how it looks like so rough you know like that doesn't look very clean that shows to me that they struggle to get that particular detail and this is like a weaker portion of the glass now look things like that you know this is super [ __ ] feel super solid it's crazy feels like my illa Delft like whatever glass they're using this is like real glass and blown well so it's hard to hate it's hard to hate you guys but I will come to a verdict and let you guys know what I think in full make sure to keep your eyes up for the review I will see you guys next time on the daily grind until then you guys know what to do keep on grinding stay regular yo baby have your [ __ ] licked by fat men in overcoat yeah", "7j2wifgUOkg": "hello everybody today revealed about the disease the original one but in case of emergency you can build one like this is very ugly by four so let's see how we can make we need a tube naturally if you are people that make the we return you will have some tube when you put their beer in the bathtub or when you move from one tank to another so surely give this one but we cannot apply exactly this Harbor because when we turn our tube in this point he will close so there is no path but now I will show you with this small count something to to block the tube to the stick you can make a bubble surely you notice that when I took the tube he closed himself so now we will put something inside to make the two more strong in this case I will use another small tube I will put two pieces together and after one we will turn around the car he will be more stable so they can pass through I check the dimensions the can't take out the tube following this dimension now I will put this tube inside this one and after using the can we will make about that fixing it with this peak and this line more than this I cannot put these tubes in this one so now we will change technique because I remember you that this is a bubbler in case of emergency so now we should solve the problem because it's an emergency so now we put this in this tube that is little-bitty good surely we fit and after we close this tube with this one so in this way the all of the fermented would be not so big this two peas we will put to test remedy it is one we will cast because it's too long you with this one I cannot keep the tube to the stick so now I will use this one that is for electricity you will British electricity to a wee lad another stick Metro main event go to vitarka target Red Sea I run across the windy or the boot or bootie redesign I do in CML 20 no that's going to another to jump out

video about the beer bye bye", "ARheZuFCqH4": "[Music] what's up everybody Cubans here and on today's video we are going to clean my damn rig this is my email Deb rig and it's my daily driver I've had for about maybe four years or so I got it in Colorado and I would estimate that I've done I don't know 17 billion downs out of it by now but I like to clean it at least weekly and I've only ever used it as an email and I've only ever used to drop them and I've never had an ale on the actual joint we're gonna clean this today and see if we can save some of this reclaimed and I actually I let it get a little bit dirtier than I normally would if you've been watching my Twitter stream at twitch.tv slash Cubans I've just been talking about how I want to build up a little more plane in here for the clean so we're gonna see if we can scoop some of this out and show you what we do here so one of the most important things for cleaning any piece hot water a lot of this stuff in here if it's warmed up it'll loosen up and become easier to remove all right so my water's wound up a little bit here I'm just gonna probably need it in a second I always use a drop down on my email the drop down prevents heat from going directly on the joint but it also gives me an extra spot to catch reclaimed so I catch the initial reclaimed here and then I also have more reclaiming the pipe but if you look a little closely you'll see there's an adapter in between so I have this set in the 14 millimeter in a 14 to 18 adapter so there's just another piece I'm gonna have to just run warm water on the outside here not one water it's not yeah I can see it loosening up I could see it letting go here and this is why I use this joint because it likes the nail likes to get stuck to the joint so if I were trying to pull this out of the drop-down itself it would be even harder but I got it nice and warmed up I can feel it loosening up hear that and just let go when I lived in Colorado I used to buy stuff so cheap that I just used to describe this out throw it away but we're gonna save this now and see if we can use it in the video later okay and this happens a lot I'm having a little trouble I don't want to force it separating this glass joint from the nail I've actually gone through a ton of these in the lifespan that I've had this nail but I've replaced I don't know a bunch of these because they get stuck to the nail and I've never had to replace my rig so we're just gonna take this I'm gonna separate it cuz that the titanium nails two parts and I'm just gonna soak this in up smooth I'm gonna soak this in a bag here I sometimes use a little blasters I don't have any right now that are available that aren't using weed so I'm just gonna put this in a little ziplock baggie here and honestly guys there's a ton of fancy cleaners out there I don't use none of that [ __ ] this is what we use I actually don't use salt I only ever need salt if I love my pieces get really really dirty and I find that it takes me longer to clean them if I use salt when it's not super dirty so I would rather clean it quicker all right so we're just gonna let these soak together clips I'm gonna get a little ice on there all right so we're just gonna let this soak I'm gonna get all the air out and zip it up now one thing they don't worry about is if you're using a plastic bag sometimes the alcohol just eat through the plastic and then it's leaking out so I usually use glass jars I don't I don't have any little ones right now so we're just gonna use this I'm gonna put it in the sink over here and the next thing I want to worry about is this claim here so we're gonna use that hot water oh well we're just gonna loosen in here a little bit I actually don't want to get this too warm because it'll be harder to get out okay so we got most of that out some of that right there is a little bit a little bit warmer and cake done so we're just gonna soak this all we got a good yeah we got a good grammar two out of there I look like so we're gonna say we're gonna see and I might actually just put more I'm still in this bag here so if even if you choose to skip collecting the reclaim it's nice to soak everything there's no salt in there it's just the alcohol I have a lot of q-tips here which is gonna help me get that stuff off once it's nice and ready and then we're gonna get this nice and cleaned all right eventually we get most of the reclaim out any of the stuff we want to save and then we're ready to just put ISO in here but one thing that I like to do before I get the ice on there it's all around the warm water through so what I want to do here his warmup a glance kitchen sprayers help a lot too if you have a sprayer sometimes you can create pressure and pushed up out this works a lot better with some bombs that I have but running hot water through this is gonna warm the glass up so when I for the isopropyl alcohol in here it'll warm the ISO up the glass will warm the ISO up and that will help me get get this piece nice and clean and you can clean this with like 70 percent rubbing alcohol but it's not nearly as good it's like using watered-down ISO that's why I don't want to get any water in here what a decent amount of alcohol and I'm just gonna spray it in both ends just to make sure that it's at its touch there and then I don't put any salt in just shake it nice and warm sometimes you need to shake it a little longer sometimes there's not a lot and then a lot of reclaim to get so you can just get it really really quickly this looks like it's going by pretty quickly that the heat helps tremendously I've only been shaking this for ten seconds or so but you can see it's it's basically clean I mean blasting this with hot water will probably do a good enough job for most people but as you can see as you can see you still have a little bit in here which we're gonna worry about so q-tips are big thing a lot of these bottles you can just put the tip of it on spin it around a little bit and it'll absorb some of the sound call yeah on this piece the inside of the joint here I'm just gonna scrub a little bit with the tip and then back to rinsing so you always want to make sure you rinse your piece really well after cleaning with ISO because if you don't that first inhale on it you're gonna get alcohol fumes so it's not gonna be good and this is nice and clean well this is all nice and clean I'm ready to start dabbing with this on my twitch stream at twitch.tv slash cue pens if you like this video subscribe to the channel for more content and check out my social media in the description below", "GScE6_86Fmk": "welcome to our ethical culture today we're going to talk about venturi aerators so that tray aerators are essentially a restriction created in a sole half of water flow to induce a current into the system so as you can see what we have here is a small venturi and is powered by a pump that pumps water through the venturi but when I place is venturi in the water you can see creates not only flow but also small air bubbles which aerates the aquarium so if I close happen to close the top of the venturi you can see that the air bubbles actually stop but when I release it you can see that above us is actually being used into the system and the air bubbles producer actually very spine which is probably only achievable if I using a blower with a diffuser set so I prefer to use venturi as they are convenient and you can you only require a pump to achieve both circulation and aeration and that's it", "IlCFHdSUuVU": "hello dr. fix master here I'm gonna share with you a couple of neat ideas for keeping your weed eater running happy happily and smoothly there's just a couple of things that usually go wrong with these things and I'm going to go over those if all of a sudden your weed eater does not start a couple of things you want to check are the following one is diaphragm and your carburetor - I'll explain these two are the hoses in your gas tank if you look inside of your gas tank this is applies to almost any small engine you will see that there are a couple of hoses on the inside going in one of them is an outlet from the carburetor and one of them is an inlet from the carburetor and it's very important of course you want fuel has to get in there in order to be ignited and in the engine and so that your motor runs these hoses get old rather quickly they get brittle as a result of being exposed to the gasoline for a long period of time they only last for a year and a half before they get so brittle that they just break off quite often there's a filter that's mow maybe an inch long at the end of the hose providing just a little weight on that hose and it's it's very easy for that hose to break off in the place so that so the hose isn't even down in the gasoline anymore so one of the first things you should do if your weed eater won't start look into the gas tank shine a light down in there and make sure that your hoses are intact once that's checked and you see that that's good I've actually had that happen to me a couple of times so that's why I'm sharing it with you very common for that to go wrong so once that's out of the loop we move over to the carburetor I'm going to show you how to disassemble this thing very easy to do in this case this is a weed eater Featherlite plus butt the others are gonna be similar there's an air air cleaner on the top a couple of screws just take these out take this cover off give a little air filter element inside that can come off all right now we're looking inside the the air filter housing holder or whatever you want to call it and you will see that there are a couple of hex key screws in here so I'm just gonna stick this in here and unwind them once you get these two hex key screws out quite long they go all the way through the carburetor once you get these off you can remove the the air filter cover from the carburetor and take the carburetor off and you get to the diaphragm okay so those are how this filter cover can come off try to not to jar anything because there's washers and things that are better to keep in one place with that so I'm going to gently set that on the table here and now you have the carburetor which is free to come loose you can see that it's it's loose it's free to move around all you have to do is unplug these hoses right here one is the outlet ones the inlet when you pump that primer bulb it one hose it sucks fuel out of the tank and the other one that returns fuel back into the tank you want to pump that a few times to make sure you got fuel in there and to make sure that you know and you're starting it that you've got fuel present at the carburetor so now we're at that point I have sitting here on the table a duplicate of this and I'm going to use that to show you the rest of this which is what goes wrong in these over time why it causes problems in starting your weed eater and I'm gonna leave this one right where it is because I just replaced this today to take care of this problem which has shown up several times in the 12 to 15 years that I've owned this weed eater every once in a while it's gonna happen and the sad thing is that people tend to have a problem like that and they take their weed eater to the garbage dump when really all it is is a is a very cheap part that just needs to be replaced and it just takes a few minutes to do it what I like to do is because I've purchased another carburetor I'll build this one have it sitting on the shelf so that at the very moment when this one goes bad I can just swap them my weed eater still works I can spend as much time as I want on this to order the new diaphragm and I'm good to go so I'm going to zoom in on this take the camera off its stand zoom in on this and show you what it is about this setup that is the most error-prone what's the most likely thing to cause you to have trouble starting up your weed eater here's the carburetor up close on this side you have the diaphragm on this side you have the primer bulb once in a while those primer bulbs will go out and if there gets a crack in it or anything you push on it and a few little squirts all over you'll know when you need to fix that part most of the gaskets and things inside and the primer bulb have a longer lifespan than the worst culprit the weak link in the system which is the diaphragm so I'm going to show you right here the first thing you got a cover flip that down and the diaphragm is right underneath it there's usually a gasket underneath the diaphragm I can get you hands are shaking a little bit so what you see here is a gasket and a diaphragm so I'm gonna just peel this gasket away from the diaphragm you're gonna have to sort of remember it's gonna have to sort of remember the order so you can put it back together correctly but this this diaphragm is some kind of I'm not sure what kind of material it's made out of but this is what they look like and there's they're soft they're supposed to be soft and just like that what happens over time is what happens when they when they're brand-new this this material is very flexible and there's a there's a little valve down inside there you can see this if I can point out to you right down there and then right in the middle that thing will with the motion of the engine and the flow of the fuel will bounce in and out and it will push on this post on the diaphragm and and that motion will pump fuel out of the tank and into your into your carburetor so that your weed eater can run what happens over time is that this very soft flexible material becomes kind of caramelized and stiff with age and when it gets bad enough you'll start having trouble starting it eventually it won't start at all which is what I discovered today it's February I live in Arizona so I was just trimming around the edges of the front lawn and I couldn't get this thing started I knew instantly what it was so I swapped out my carburetor and off I went but this you can tell when you when you're pushing on this metal thing you can even hear it in the video it's crunchy these things get crunchy and when they get crunchy they don't work anymore it's a very cheap part so when you get a new one you'll see that these things are very soft and very flexible they're not crunchy at all when they're soft and flexible like that they do their job properly and it only takes about a year maybe a year and a half for fuel just sitting in these things for a long period of time it it it crunches them up it makes them stiff and they don't work anymore so don't go throwing your weed eater away after a year year and a half when it just quits running go get yourself a diaphragm kit do this 5-minute repair put it back together in the same order and you're good to go I have put my carburetor back on put the cover back on and I'm gonna give you just a couple of tips for starting weed eaters when you've taken care of the diaphragm issues mine this feather-light plus has been a little bit temperamental even with a brand new carburetor and I'll just share one trick sometimes if I come in here and I put this thing on it's full choke position and I I pull the starter a couple of three times and if I get nothing a lot of times what that does is it floods the engine and then you have to wait for a half an hour before it starts so my recommendation is to give it a couple three poles in the off position if you get nothing then increase the amount of choke you're giving it a little bit at a time so this one only has a couple of settings 1/2 and full so I just come up here to half pull it a few times if I get nothing then go to the full that's what I've had the most luck with I say that because just today when I put a new carburetor in here I went straight to full choke because that's what the other one required and I immediately flooded the engine I had to let it sit when I came back and tried it the next time I started on this side pulled it a few times with the new carburetor in there and I can tell it was just getting ready to start wanting to I was getting a couple of pops and so I tried the half setting and then it fired right up once I revved it a few times take the choke off and it should idle and this one was idling perfectly works really well the other thing that I think is important is if you have if you mix large batches of 40 to one mix gas to oil you can you can end up by the time you get through all that gas these things don't use that much gas but but by the time you get through all that gas your fuel is getting pretty old so I've you know because I've had trouble starting this weed eater on occasion and the age of your fuel is important I've I've given up on mixing my own fuel and I just buy these cans from from Lowe's they're pre-mixed you got to get make sure you get the kind with the right ratio that's for your machine but I like this because you know they use high octane gas it's easy it's because it's pretty mixed I'm I'm getting it in small batches so I know that the fuel I have isn't getting so old that it gums up my machine and and makes things not work and you know that fuel that gets gummy is is basically death to these diaphragms so just keep that in mind I'm just going to take this out just today I was trying to start it up and I was pulling and pulling and pulling and pulling and because of that diaphragm getting all caramelized and crunchy it just wasn't starting at all I swapped in a new diaphragm I had another carburetor just like this like I said and I put the new diaphragm in there or it had a new diaphragm in it and why it runs beautifully now so I'm going to demonstrate you push the primer bulb a couple times leave that choke off see how we do oh and a half joke coming back to half joke and leave the choke off I just started again just to demonstrate your diaphragms are good things healthy fixing", "2AnWQGkAkSk": "[Music] hello my clouded friends it's me hazy feedback again with ghost stoner and today we were sent a beautiful package

day everyone", "xtooBVxwzg8": "hello everyone if this is your first time joining one of our live streams welcome to tuesday night dabs uh first tuesday of every month we basically just like to sesh with the internet yeah uh we are here on our youtube channel we usually um do some kind of fun smoking activity or a story time we also do a q a um and yeah we like to catch up with you guys so we always like starting off uh asking where are you guys and what are you smoking right now yes um today's vlog is going to be a fun one i'm not doing vlog stream streaming we're live no i challenge anyone joining us live or after the fact to be smoking out of something more exciting than this right here because this is our this is our new baby this is the baby it's the baby it's the stunning glass we do have the uh link in the chat here um and yeah we are basically going to be playing one of our favorite smoking games um that we i don't know if we invented but we have like perfected we'll say that this was a drinking game that i feel like me my friends invented in college that we have successfully transitioned into a smoking game and i always like whenever we can kind of like play a game with the channel i feel like it's always fun just to remind everyone that we don't have baby lunks hey i mean we'll see we'll see we'll see um but yeah basically we've played this game a couple of times before on the channel but never with the stoned and glass world's most futuristic gravity bomb here you've probably seen seth rogen hitting this before that was certainly my first introduction to it yes um but basically we get two dice two dices um and dice go one through six we've got six options to smoke you roll both of them and depending on what you get um you choose your adventure so say i roll a one and a five i'm either going to have a choice of smoking a flower bowl or hitting a banger taking a dab so um i'm trying to remember if you roll doubles you have to you have to do it or do you have to do two of it you have to do you have to do double of whatever and you can't you can't decide um it's just it is what it is yes like you are just taking double of whatever that is yep so it should be fun so as uh clark held up here we've got if we roll a one you've got flowerable two we've got this fun little joint do hickey here um for three we've got a g pengio that we can attach through this gonna get some vapes deep into you uh number four is the connect the g-pin connect probably one of my all-time favorite g-pin products just dabs on the go number five is banger banger quartz banger nothing and i honestly if you have never seen a quartz banger like attached to this like contraption it's fun um and then yeah number six is hookah hookah which is fun we've never smoked hookah on this channel we've got a little bowl packed up here um i really hope we don't get hookah first i will say as a as a caveat to anyone watching um when we sesh with our student normally we don't go back to back to back and mix it in a party mode like this this is the first time we're ever playing choose your own adventure with the student and normally if i'm doing dabs with it i'm going to do dabs and then i'm probably going to change the water and maybe give it a quick little scrub down with alcohol before i then load flour in vice versa definitely the same thing with hookah i will say it does tend to the water gets a little flavor of whatever you happen to be smoking with it so um if anyone gets one of these or has one of these um we don't normally sesh with it like this this is full on party mode that we're going into right now and is going to be fun but for that reason i'm hoping that i don't get like you know what is it double sixes first for hookah yeah because then everything is going to taste like hookah so we'll see we'll see but that's it's all fun and part of the game also love that i'm just checking in with the live chat i love that we are not the only ones smoking out of student glasses oh my gosh so good yes winning with someone else now shout out to cat and dabbing i love it great name dabbing coming in with the bacchio gelato sauce oh i love it i know that's scherbinski's i know that's good um yeah no i always loved yeah just like let us know in the chat what are you smoking on where are you smoking from i think it's great whenever we have like an international audience joining the sesh i mean this is literally what we're here to do is just to like smoke together as friends as family and play a little game play a little game we're also going to do a little q a later um we had questions up on our instagram they're still up if anybody wants to pop into the story and ask a question there uh we can also take some from

7 10 we celebrate we take dabs if 4 20 is the time to smoke then 7 10 is the time to dab if you flip 710 upside down it spells oil i hope someone learns that new every single time we have one of these live streams because like what are you i get enough dms we i feel like i hit 7 10 multiple times a week if not on the daily and try and get a little instagram story from it and i feel like at multiple times a week i'll get people dming like so what is 710 and i'm like yeah a lot of people don't know i don't expect people to know so it's fun to give a little thing but we should uh take a dab out of

going in three two dropping the dab and then yeah spin it and capping it there we go here we go yes hey i just took a dab out of a gravity bump from the future bam oh my goodness that's how you feel oh yeah we're really baked on this one guys this like huh it's crazy it's a slow creep too because there's no like one huge mega dab that you like cough your lungs out with and then you get the sweats and then you're like okay i took one dab and i'm dead this is just so smooth it's so smooth that it's so slow and then all of a sudden you're like oh my god i'm so high and it's just like it's fun you're like smoking out of a lava lamp like there's a kinetic force to it like yeah great so good yeah oh like a rubik's cube getting you hot like i don't understand okay my turn oh yes yes oh god we're still doing this all right i feel like we've got hookah left i think oh yeah because flower wait flower bowl flower bowl and i gotta say we have to at least go through all six options yeah that's that's the name of the game okay 1.6 oh like okay see there's no way we said it at the same time so you know we weren't faking that i love it that was perfect oh do i go one or six which one six i know that's great those are the little let's do one because we'll finish with hookah okay wait is this oh okay right that was yeah that's true that's true okay careful no no we're good we're good okay by the base it's okay okay don't want to burn your fingies no no okay so we got flower this is great oh can you grab underneath the candle there there's uh some hemp liquid perfect oh she getting all fancy uh from those not in that kenosaur stoner no hemp wick is basically an alternative instead of like using a butane lighter to light the weed i will say it's way easier with this to keep this lit here versus trying to do a lighter i have learned oh i'm just going to do it you could do it too but it's going to be easier for you to do this exactly it's not impossible with a lighter but it's just a little difficult yeah prone to all right i love it's like like hidden behind the glass it looks like a little old-timey [Music] there you go fanciest lamp by weed candlelight cheers everybody there we go oh my goodness this is getting so milky okay that's how you do it okay cheers okay this is this this is this this is a lot that's a lot flower bowl right the flower i mean honestly okay so so far out of the five ways to use it this seems like the best way gang right i'm getting higher oh my god but still like pretty [ __ ] smooth for as much smoke as was just in that and then in my lungs like i'm not dying it's so true she just took like i'm hi it's insane this is where like i love the live stream but i need an instant replay because that was not a little hit and that's because you think like oh you're just spinning it that it's just every single time you spin it that is a that is a massive bong rip wow okay love it love anyone i love the people that are just now jumping into the live stream welcome to the thunderdome welcome to the student dome welcome to the shed show okay well then i mean that was such a strong show i feel like i definitely gotta i mean i'm still gonna go so we got one more left on the board and hit yeah you got a six two and a half two six perfect two and a six six yeah because number two was the joints and like that sounds like that's not gonna happen so actually that's perfect okay so this um also comes with the student we've got some shisha shisha packed up in there i've got some mango mango shisha and um a little puck here that we're gonna light up and then this just sits right there i see this and then we'll just you see this we'll reattach the hose you got the you got the little puck oh wait guys tell me tell me i'm a hookah novice which way does the puck go this little cold does it go i thought it goes the other way i think it goes not like a bowl not like a bowl because then it sits yeah it sits flat so it's not like that because otherwise it's setting on a dome right because it's curved right oh okay so it sits on the flat side yeah she getting in oh tongs uh they should light it uh i mean that's a good we don't need tongs until the very the right okay you can light it like that yeah i guess i usually hold it and light it oh okay i mean yeah okay like at least i feel like this is what i did last time okay maybe i have to like use the little like blowtorch or something but i don't know as long as it catches let me know if i'm doing this all wrong but we're not big hookah people yeah lisa and maybe it's just like these you know cold stuff last time i heated up okay okay it's doing it all right cool yay there we go all right so we are going to need to oh she's in this just to prep it uh when it comes to hookah there we go gotta get that curb coal burning all the way and then um yeah just give it a good good couple rotations to crap oh it's gonna be so nice just realize it's not it doesn't even have weed in it's not thc it isn't gonna get us high i mean hookah does make you lightheaded i will say that that's not for a nine like yeah not tobacco smoker and stuff it absolutely will get me lightheaded yeah there we go there we go for you right i like yeah it's like to me like i'm not a regular like hookah smoker but i'm just like oh yeah this this is a like it's a good little throwback i definitely used to smoke hook like more in college oh right yeah we definitely went through um a phase where like yeah we would like yeah me and all my girlfriends would hang out and we'd have [ __ ] little bubbles and we'd be blowing smoke bubbles and taking pictures and just [ __ ] hookah is a great like a photographer's friend exactly the clouds in it are like yes oh and this is going to be good actually i realized because hookah you can kind of we're going to keep spinning it we're going to keep doing this we can maybe get into like some q and a as we finish up here this is the last thing here so right so just again to recap uh six different ways that you could use this tuning glass uh with the bowl as as it's you know marketed uh you could use it with joints also i've seen online like putting in a back woods like blunts like you can you can do it oh it's a lot of cool stuff all right the geo if you if you have a geo if you have a vape pen get this like ro get this like hose rubber attachment because it is the business um and then yeah oh my god connect cheap and connect love it uh the banger and now finally the hookah the hookah good recap okay questions um okay so uh first one here there we go getting milkier now um any thoughts on longer streams sending good vibes oh yes um i feel like we have definitely had the discussion for like twitch or live streaming like in general we have like shot an hour long like sesh that was playing like video games um that we like edited down and i don't know like i feel like this is definitely my speed in terms of like cool i can again it because me it feels like this is how i'm like hanging out with friends it's a good it's a good monthly catch-up yeah yeah i would say that but like yeah we have had fun playing some mario kart and stuff but yeah as far as like you know streaming for longer i think if you guys i mean to me it's like if it's in high demand i am happy to oblige so let us know oh that mango if you guys are down for longer streams hey yeah cause we don't have to we play smoky games video games all them games and also this uh shout out to anyone you know that's joining us live if you're in the chat feel free to send us some cues we'll try to send you some ace hey send us amazing okay guys what oh so good um so another question here how do you feel about the cannabis black market um it's a thing that's still very much alive in california even though we are in a legal state um i'd say we have friends that work and operate within the black market so in a certain sense like yeah i don't know we do support it in a way that like you know yeah we have friends that yeah exactly yeah that would operate within it but yeah at the same time we would definitely encourage people to buy your stuff from a licensed and legal dispensary unless you know i don't know you're in a situation like us where you know personally the people that are cultivating and growing and extracting and creating the things then i don't know i would probably avoid the black market and just know you got it lab tested and stuff but see and that's what i was gonna say to me that is the one big key differentiator um between me like the black market of legal market is that the legal market can guarantee lab testing and it totally just depends on how big of a deal that is for you yeah um and i know like i was raised in a black market so i totally understand if that is literally your only option right now than like you know seriously like you had do what you can um but then it's like yeah if you do have the uh to me it's like if you have the option between the black market or legal market legal market at least is gonna give you that that sense of security that like you're never gonna end up as a statistic on like some fake cart news reports like god yeah um let's see here a couple of questions here any chance to add super chat to the channel that's a fun question super chat yes yes right is that not any chance to have a super touch yeah i don't think it's disabled but i don't think i've yes yeah i don't know we'll figure it out the answer should be yes and if it's not yes then don't know yes um but i love what say i tried to find a clark shirt oh from that video which video i'm trying to think i i i'd like to think i have something solid solid teas oh get that yeah check it um oh i like someone asked like yo did you see this from yola um no now so shout out to dope is yellow who also shout out to yola who did a video with like four of these so jealous um but no no we we heard about this like early on yes yeah i don't know yeah i know right i'm like i'm so high no it's not like classified information or anything a fun fact for anyone that doesn't know um i'm the social media director for g pen um student and glass recently became part of the g pen family ie i'm also social media director for student glass recently so yeah since it has been redesigned and relaunched i'm actually handling all of their socials as well so um yeah it's fun we're in it we're part of the student family [Music] thank you to every people saying i'm a machine alex got some steel lungs thank you guys it's so much nicer now with hookah i will say right just going in and we love some mango love some mango smoke i mean not that it's not nice with dabs and weed but this is like way more mellow versus taking [ __ ] that's getting me oh actively higher because like yeah we are up there guys my goodness oh my gosh um let's see here another question here um oh a lot of people people telling me that like streamlabs is what i need for chat donations because i'm like yeah use the stream platform all right i'm gonna look into it good to know thank you people that want to donate that's very nice um any air purifier recommendations air purifier recommendations um we have one here that we enjoy and like oh god i don't know what it's called right i know it's like super like embarrassing environ cleanse yes is one and it's uh it's a video yes okay that was a good one yes that one was a little pricey though this one we got on amazon and it's really tiny and um our friends have one the cool thing about can you look and see what it is or i'll look and see what it is oh yeah no um i mean yeah what i'm gonna [Music] if you type in co-way to amazon c-o-w-a-y uh yeah it's a good it's a good little air purify it was fairly inexpensive and i like that you can set it to auto so that like as soon if it's turned on as soon as we like exhale a dab and there's smoke in the room it like all of a sudden turns to its little red mode and just turns on automatically and starts purifying and um it's not like as crazy as like a molecule i know that has like the crazy like that kills the bacteria and has all the extra stuff but it does have like the hepa standard whatever thing and it was pretty affordable so i like that one a lot i do i do like it i will say like family members have also bought it so it's fun all right the who could just hit me oh my god that does get you a little lightheaded and that little nicotine buzz oh okay guys but the mango is nice not ashamed to say there was a time er in point in clark's life when he was a smoker and like uh-oh uh-oh a little bit a little oh look at how milky it gets with the hookah though once you get it going it's crazy it's just solid milk and it just keeps going like honestly if you're into hookah like holy [ __ ] how is this not the coolest [ __ ] thing like gravity ball right i don't know i mean no no bias now you all know i work for the company but still like holy [ __ ] it is the coolest [ __ ] thing he's like i'm just like no one else has been just innovating like jeep like stunned in glass and stuff and then and i love to like i remember seeing the like the earliest model where i had like two arms and stuff like this is the nicest version of an approved bottle yeah it's fun okay more questions from instagram here oh my god i love someone just shout out um that like there is a be real like dr green thumb stoned in glass coming out that's green and gold it's beautiful if you have not bought this yet wait that's just like oh my goodness i mean i will say yeah it's it's that's going to be so it's probably going to be impossible to get but like very fun but yeah right now black is the only color that's available but who knows we could be doing yeah lots lots of fun collabs in the future so that's crazy um what's the one movie you could watch over and over again without being bored of it over and over again without being bored of it that's good that's good i would like i feel like like our first movie rango is definitely like up there rainbow's really good terms it's just like it's animation from like yeah beautiful i feel like it's it's something where it's like animation it's such an easy thing to like watch a lot of times and not get bored with it because you're just like oh you can just take notice of like little hand-drawn everything in animation yeah it's there for a reason because it's not like it was just shot in a happy accident like there's no real happy accidents and animations so yeah i know i'm trying to think of like um but yeah i'm trying to think that i'd watch because i am so bad about i'm not a repeat watcher it's so true i i definitely it's we're just it's the whole room yeah i i very i feel like i have a not great memory for like a lot of like useful facts but pop culture i have a rock solid like steel he can see something once and it's just like if it's on again he's like oh yeah okay this is about to happen there's like a repeat a line right before it said i'm like we saw this once in the theater like four years ago and now it just happens to be on tv like how do you remember this i barely remember this movie at all like yeah it's one of the few skills i have story remembering yeah he's very good at it and yeah so we don't repeat watch a lot of stuff actually um i've seen a couple people ask about like tv shows that we're binging and what we're watching right now which you are actually repeating something for my benefit that i'm watching for the first time oh my goodness um i think last time last month we were probably still talking about the office we watched the entire office in quarantine i'd never seen it loved it yep um we are almost done with 30 rock now for the first time and you've he's seen that i hadn't which is always amazing and then to get dip into a little drama another one that i'm now like obsessed with which i know i'm just late on the [ __ ] bandwagon everybody it's an amazing show and there's no excuse for me not to have seen it but we just finished season one of boardwalk empire and oh my god that is some good hbo drama some steve buscemi in the 1920s with everybody just looking so fancy and gangsters and it shot beautifully and it's oh like that's really good yeah oh yes yeah we're getting into season two now and i'm really enjoying it okay and here's the question that i have for everyone watching this live after the fact now um so absolutely this is my like evolution of the comedy shows that she's never watched is like introduced to the office now finishing up 30 rock check this she has seen neither parks and wreck or brooklyn nine-nine what should she go to next because chronologically yes parks and rec but like we just finished watching like palm springs the andy sandberg movie on uh hulu and like damn that was good so good and i'm ready to introduce her to nine nine uh so yeah let me know let me know what you guys think if you if you had to like oh dude don't you wish you could just rever like erase some memories of this i love it yes yes i love it i love people like coming in for like yes 30 wrong ooh someone's saying oh yeah kill bill so tarantino is something i could watch over and over again and still always love i've seen pulp fiction a ton of times um oh i love all the parks and rec every like strong votes no one says 30 rack oh no so it's a brooklyn nine-nine excuse me brooklyn nine-nine i'm high i get it jesus parks and rec has okay couple for nine nine couple for nine nine nine nine i think like cause 99 to me is more exciting like oh midnight gospel's latest binge we dipped our toes in midnight gospel is it's a weird one midnight gospel is is animation here don't go in too high i think we were too high when we saw it i knew what was in the shadows oh god also okay if you're into animation like uh midnight gospel uh close enough is oh my god our new favorite like adult animated comedy series which we did get hbo max for this some edibles for them i love that they reached out to an edible company but i will say with all honesty i don't know if we would have watched the show if we didn't promo it and i'm like it's an incredible show it's literally one of my new favorite shows now and i'm like holy [ __ ] the fact that i like might have missed this like close enough anyone that's a fan of the regular show regular regular show same creator now on hbo same guy starring in it it's literally just like his life in his early 30s living in l.a it's so ridiculous it does hit close to home and is very relatable to us because it is all in l.a they do [ __ ] baxter street they do griffith observatory like they hit it it's in l.a and they do a lot of l.a they do santee alley in the in the opening like so that is very fun but even if you don't live in l.a and like don't have an appreciation for where those things are it still is like yeah if you're in your mid to late 20s or you know early to mid 30s like oh [ __ ] it is it is some funny ass [ __ ] that just about like yeah sometimes you just want to stand and watch great british bake off and like oh my god did that just like get me and the relatability there feels yeah it's like oh my goodness yeah close enough i did not again that was that has been my favorite self show of the year yes in terms of life and i haven't seen enough people talking nobody's talking about it like yeah [ __ ] close enough it was so good hbo max yes regular show fans go yeah um oh i also love uh someone said like coming in from uh umbrella academy i watched season one and i've read the comics and like i like it i don't love it i sometimes feel like the umbrella academy just like sometimes just a little bit too silly but that's just my not to say that it's not good it's it's doing some crazy [ __ ] like oh man some tv oh my goodness oh good um let's see here so what's your favorite strain you purse prefer sativa indicator hybrid uh definitely sativas um i really like what is that like gelato like yeah auto right now has been like um a couple more here oh my god i'm so high guys wow this is a record breaker um where to stay in sacramento when you're a smoker lol i don't think we've ever been to sacramento oh yes i mean either i've been to sacramento to visit friends once state capital of california um i remember there was like their old town was literally like a dirt road and made to feel like oh this is kind of like what like pioneer s like was going on what felt like i was like oh this is a very old old town um but yeah i mean i thought it was i thought it was chill smoke under the bridge there you go there's a bridge next to a river that's where i got high i will say danny v coming in with the good recommendation the old guard on netflix such a good movie oh my god we might have to re-watch that one that one is worth a re-watch because god damn it it's not perfect but it's fun it's fun i very much enjoyed it it is a very fun refreshing action movie that i like i yeah i wanted to be the next john wick i want a whole [ __ ] trilogy of like give me yes i want a john way trilogy it deserves a john lifestyle it's every bit as fun as john wick how is charlize theron like in her 40s kicking so much as she's so good inspiration inspiration inspiration um what are your top 10 songs on your smoker's playlist whoo don't know if i have a top ten i gave you like the top top ones that come to my head right now what is it like the kid cuddy 420 like the marijuana like there is a song from king cody that ends exactly in four minutes 20 seconds that i always just like that's a good one now remember think it was like perfectly firm stoners um aladdin sane by david bowie if you've never listened to that full song it's like oh it's long it's good there's an amazing piano solo like you get really high and just like put on some good like headphones and listen to that [ __ ] like just stare up at the clouds and whatever it's it's a good time it's a good time i like just appreciate aaron ask uh like clark how did you quit smoking cigarettes um like thankfully you know i didn't i don't have a very strong addictive personality i'm very grateful for that but also this is this was totally just my trick that worked for me um i started like eating mints with like every single like cigarettes and then when i stopped smoking cigarettes i just kept eating the mints and so it's like every time you want a cigarette you just pop a mint and that's your yard never smoke a cigarette without having a mint in your mouth you haven't had anything i'm sure that doesn't work for like everyone i love the taste of the cigarette and stuff but i'm like yeah that like to me was an easy like oh and then because then your your brain just oh it's just the flavor of the mint and then you just yeah i don't know that worked for me but i'm just like okay i love i did i haven't even thought about that until that question was out so i was like oh yeah that is what that was my little trick uh let's see would you ever stream twice a month love the streams thank you someone did ask earl if we would do longer streams okay this is good feedback yeah um yeah exactly if it's requested we could definitely consider um either going longer or possibly doing yeah two tuesdays or throwing in a weekend there or something i'll also uh just you know throw it out there anyone that's considering like a super chat anyone that wants to watch more of us we have a patreon club right now that i'm i'm very happy has an entire library archive of exclusive vlogs i will say for 2020 we have been keeping up with patreon yes um we we didn't always keep up with it as good as we should last but there's like two three new videos yeah we are we are doing every thursday yeah yeah we are keeping up with them more so it's fun it's fun yeah um but yeah we will still definitely consider doing some more live streams not not through patreon though for sure mm-hmm um another question here any plans on moving or cabin for life no i mean cabin is amazing i love everything the cabin has given us i literally proposed to this woman sitting next to me in this cabin a studio apartment here in hollywood um but it is just that it is it is a studio apartment like we there's literally a tour on the channel if you haven't checked it out it's 420 square feet hey okay but yeah it's it's a tight studio apartment okay so i don't think it's yeah dab and cabin for life um we definitely we want to stay in la for sure we know that but we would definitely um consider eventually putting down roots here but for now the cabin certainly works for um where we are in life and what we're doing and what we want to do and stuff so right as much i love the cabin and i do love the cabin i also just love living in hollywood it is fun yeah we do live in a very cool um part of the city of access to like a bunch of cool stuff around us and stuff so it's not perfect it is highly weird but it's centrally located as [ __ ] yeah um oh i love where in the cabin did you propose okay quick quick proposal recap if [Music] yeah i will say i did get one of the best proposals not not bias or anything but it was very sweet that clark had gotten in touch with my work um and got them to send me home at lunch time on a friday of just like hey this is pre-g pen um but it was just like hey you're done with work or happy early weekend you know go home whatever um so i came home just thinking like okay cool start my weekend early nice cool walked into the cabin here all the furniture was kind of like push the sides there was a big open space here at the rug he had put flower petals everywhere there were like white gossamer curtains hanging from the ceiling and then he walked out in a suit and he proposed and he rather than a ring box he had put together a or actually not him put together commissioned a florist to create this amazing floral arrangement that was in like a enclosed like beauty and the beast literally looked like dome exactly like that he popped that off and there was like all my favorite flowers and also cannabis in there and there was a beautiful vintage art deco ring sitting on top of it there and i freaked out was like oh my god yes and then as soon as i said yes he turned around and then wheeled out two pack suitcases that i had never seen before and said okay well the best thing now about this is that we are going to go to iceland we're getting on a plane tonight to fly to your number one bucket list country for the next 10 days where we are going to drive around the entire island country that is iceland and stay in all these cute little boutique hotels of a night here and two nights here and experience the entire country and like it was the number one place that i have always wanted to go and it was oh my goodness the most insane surprise amazing proposal ever so yeah we we've gotten my mom was on her way up already to come and have dinner with us and take the cat back to san diego so she could watch over the cat and then we drove the airport and went to iceland for the next 10 days with oh god the most amazing trip ever so i gave her a ring and then we drove the ring yes it was if you can for anyone out there that is in a relationship that is considering a proposal for an engagement if you can somehow work travel into it travel maybe i will say i mean as much fun as getting proposed to in iceland would have been if the surprise trip had been to iceland and it was right around our five-year anniversary too it was like it was like a week before our five-year anniversary so i was expecting something like a week later and then of course we were in iceland for a five year having just been engaged and five is don't rush guys okay it took me over a year to plan that proposal too like i'm not just some trust fund baby that just like thought of that it was amazing to just yeah just think i was just getting off work and then bam you're getting proposed to bam you're on a plane to iceland like you've got yeah 10 days to just explore the most amazing place and worked it out like my family had known my work had known everyone had given them the okay and like he bought [ __ ] winter clothes for me and [ __ ] because like i didn't like it wasn't able to just pack that stuff up thought and planning into it and like it was whoo yeah don't i mean don't don't want to be braggy or biased or anything drive i've never shut i've never seen another proposal story that's honestly topped that one because i mean like oh it was it was the most magical i love youtube but that proposal is still the best thing i've ever done like it's still the best thing it's still the best thing yeah for all the right reasons not not the least which means that like that was what yeah what a hell of a trip just one and yeah that's my bet yeah if you can if you can extend the good feeling vibe of a proposal over like a [ __ ] any night like just go on a week or one night just at you you don't yeah go away and just keep that box extend that vibe as long as you can and stay in that bubble of like fresh fiance yeah oh fresh out of the oven fiance oh god yeah so good whoa [Music] i was like i knew the proposal i knew i was perfect for her travel we love travel we love we love each other all those things that's another fun question i'm seeing here what youtube channels besides your own would you suggest oh my god there is so there's so many some good ones um if you're into travel i will say cara nate yes handsome they're big but they're definitely like one of our favorite travel couples they went to 400 countries no they spent four years going to 100 countries yes that's how high i am and their content is so sharp so good such good editing they're really sweet um and now they just recently bought like a sprinter van that's like converted into like a live-in kind of situation they're driving across the country doing van lifestyle so um i think my one of our other favorite hidden gem youtube like travel channels is a series called pretty cool hotel tour oh my god yes hotel tour yeah it's pretty cool hotel yeah i forget the names but like just desserts pretty cool hotel tour yes just it's wonderful content it's what yeah they go it's this couple they go around the country and they go to these those weird themed motels that you always see with like the heart-shaped tubs and the cave room and you know the jungle room and whatever just these like there's some kind of sex motels but not really some of them are just like romance whatever they're quirky it's um they are they're fun yeah yeah i also love these people shouting like of course within our like is nothing but good vibes like i was trying i was trying to go for outside cannabis kind of just like if there's less anyone that has put forth like as a weed ambassador on this platform on any [ __ ] platform then like yeah we support you okay absolutely damn um we need we just need more more people out there doing it and then but then yeah like as far as like non-we people also just i love that we're like couples too it's just like rock on youtube uh becky and chris they're like they dude they have a helicopter that's a series where they flew their helicopter through like newfoundland home renovations so stylish yeah very very cool stuff like that i love it so i'm just like yeah they remind me that i'm like oh yeah we can always make our [ __ ] look better yeah like so many so many good youtubers oh and also oh mr beast is fun too for just viral content that's just like only you can do [ __ ] like this he has so much money that he's accumulated from doing this that he can just pull off the craziest stunts that's just like i don't even understand but yes i want to see and watch what this turns into like just very very cool [ __ ] he's the king of like you think it's all click bait and then he delivers on it we're just like there's like yeah i'm gonna adopt every dog and dog kennel i'm gonna build the world's largest lego tower and like does these things it's just like well-played mr beast so good someone's asking i want to confirm they're asking what's the name of the um hotel one i'm pretty sure it's pretty cool yeah pretty cool hotel tour pretty cool their youtube is a pretty cool hotel tour yes um oh god they also have an instagram too her photography is amazing um yeah i [ __ ] i love it they've got yeah a good number of videos on there that you can watch and like their tours are fantastic and they're they seem like a great couple yeah just like oh yeah i love mr beast and his friends and stuff yeah just so many and of course like david dobrik the whole vlog swipe but like i feel like that almost like for we have a youtube channel yeah of course we watch david yeah oh look other people that does like you know four minutes and 20 second videos hey where did we get that idea from i don't understand how david doesn't understand how to get it on the exact frame to always hit it unlike 4 20. that's like the thing that he does but they're always like 419 i'm like come on kid 419 and 17 frames like there you go come on figure it out come on david it takes that it takes literally to the frame attention but worth it worth it for that time stamp bam ooh bitching with babish another great also oh my god so many good food shows like freaking thrillists and sin foods oh send foods oh my god oh my god they are so funny if you want like hilarious food show yes they are fantastic yes realist ah so good oh my god i'm so high how about once hot ones it's entertaining hot ones so high okay i think we got through all these i know there's any questions um an 802 look at us guys love it any more fur babies in the future if we move into a bigger space oh 100 we are definitely bringing more babies into into this family and we would love another kitty and a dog and or dog oh my god a doggo oh we'd love the shiznit out of the doggo i also i would love to get one i have a theory but i don't i don't think it'd be animal cruelty i really want to get a bong that is its only purpose is to be a home for a betta fish ah i feel like that would be very difficult betta fish bong i don't think i think you if you got the right bong it would still be easy enough to like get him out to clean it and stuff but like right like betta fish they're fine and just like a little you see them in like on people's desks and like tiny little things like getting on filters or anything they don't have like water filtration and [ __ ] you just like put some food in the top of it and [ __ ] i don't know i don't i think that'd be fun someone photoshopped a beta fish into a bong soon yeah like that's that's what we need i love all people also coming in with good like netflix recommendations and stuff like yes there is a cooking show with weed watching we don't that's what i hate that you hate it when you're like it's fun it's fun it's not bad i wish i liked

live stream so sending good vibes everybody yeah love you guys peace out much love oh my god", "NkwOxIczT40": "the flooville flex is a pretty neat tank but there are some changes that I really thought would be handy to make especially to keep the species that I wanted to keep in here so I'm going to tell you all about that and just [Music] hey YouTube this is a pet tagging like I said before I really am enjoying the Googleplex the things I'm enjoying about it is it's a KITT tank it's got a really cool filter system in the back that can be modified and I wanted to take advantage of that today and show you a couple of mods that I made to make this a low-flow aquarium I just want to slow down the flow and I'm also blocking off the vents that are in the back now I understand the principle behind the size of the vents that they used but there's a problem with that I mean just about any fish that you would keep in a tank like this can probably fit through those tiny little vents especially the really teeny tiny ones even as we're recording this I'm watching my crab try his best to get inside that vent and if they got in there there's a chance I wouldn't see them or they could eventually work their way into the filter really caused a problem the same is true with shrimp if you've ever kept cherry shrimp they will go into your filter and just try to live in there so this is the kind of mod you want to make if you got shrimp or you've got a really tiny fish that could fit through those slots or anything like that now I don't currently have the 9 gallon version of this but I imagine that they're really really similar and maybe sizing down some of the measurements you can make the system work for that too the whole thing's really kind of a basic principle built around this unusual filter section in the back so what I did to block off the holes is I essentially made a pre-filter I went to Swiss tropicals comm and I got some of that poly foam you can get all different types of grades of this foam this is a little bit more porous and this is what I used I'm going to include the dimensions for this down below so once you get the foam cut to the dimensions that you need you can wedge it right into this little plastic spots that they have they even have sort of a thin that goes in the middle it's going to help keep that foam in place you just have to know to cut that area now to help make sure that foam is placed firmly against the grids I took some poly filter which'll is also going to kind of help grab all the really small particles of water out so I took that poly filter and I got a big ball of it and I just put it right there right next to the foam so the vents here then the foam and the poly filter just got a crammed in there right next to it I did that at the top and the bottom and it's made it for a really nice tight fit now doing all of that did block off the holes and it did decrease the flow but it didn't decrease it a lot the pump that comes with this thing is really really large is it is very very large and powerful which is good if you have a fish that needs a lot of flow but if you if you're thinking appending a betta in there or something else that really doesn't like a lot of flow like that though it's just going to tumble them all over the place and the first thing I did to try and alter this to see how it would do is I took the little spray valves and I just mounted them up so that the water would spray kind of out of the water and then go back in it just takes a little bit of the energy away from it so it's going to go up and have gravity pull it back down and that's going to be a little bit weaker than if it's just blasting straight into the aquarium but even with that it was just a little bit too much Plus that gets really loud if it water gets too low so what I decided to do is I took the pump that I bought for the matin filter that's actually a pump I think I found in one of the the king of DIYs projects I think it was for his corner filter I got the idea to use it on mine but I haven't set mine up yet it's a much smaller filter than the other filter but the hoses just happen to fit so all I did was I remove the pump move the hose from the old pump and attach the new one because this is so much smaller and it's made just to fit perfectly this pump doesn't actually go all the way to the bottom but it was on tight enough to where it didn't seem to be a problem it's just hanging there that could be good too though because I noticed there's a lot of silt that sort of built up underneath there and it would leave it open for you to clean underneath it which is not a bad thing now with kit tanks like this people always ask me how are the lights do they grow plants and to tell the truth it's a little soon to tell I mean I just started this at Christmas the plants are starting to grow starting to get acclimated they don't look too bad but I'm still kind of zeroing in on really achieving that balance I mean it's a new aquarium I'm still adding fish and changing things round so it's going to take a few more weeks before I know if that light will be sufficient however if it's not one possible mod you could choose are these suction cup lights these fit actually underwater this is what I use I use one just like this in the Steampunk aquarium to light it up on the inside I'm thinking these suction cups could be easily added up here and just give it at an additional array of lights got it in there see if you can tell just a little bit brighter yeah that's not a lot brighter but it's also a really small light bar imagine a lot bigger one this lid actually has all kinds of possibilities you can drill things you can do all kinds of stuff to modify this lid I mean one of the nice things about this tank is it's got a nice form-fitting lid that goes all the way across and it blocks off the filter area and everything so keep that in mind before you go cutting into it too much because it is useful to have a nice lettuce Peschel II if you're keeping the pom-pom crabs and things like that but then again if you take the measurements for this lid you could probably invent all sorts of really crazy things to fit on top of this I think that would be really cool in folks that's all I have for you today thank you so much for stopping by for this really quick little video about fluval flex mods of course if you want more information about any of the products that I've described there'll be links in the description below till next time follow your bliss keep a clean tank mod that flex I'll see you soon [Music] you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "F9RQGftLKeM": "a - this is blazing 420 haze here and we're pretty bad just [ __ ] but uh

I'm making a video but you're gonna lunge this for a bid five to ten minutes and shake it I boosted everything out all right for your disinfectant you don't want to put too much just like that and then you're gonna fill it with hot water then you're gonna let it soak for about try it as long as you can like the longer the better we did ours for 20 minutes last night and work really well so if you could do this at night too before you go to bed and just leave it overnight [ __ ] yeah get that [ __ ] clean no I'm saying and then this when it's finally done you take it out and you're gonna

next disconnect the upper cartridge tube which may feel warm to the touch from the lower cartridge cap by squeezing the tabs inward and pulling upwards then place the red hygiene cap onto the end of the upper cartridge tube to ensure no water drips lift up the clamping lever to release the lower cartridge and set it aside holding the handle of the water cartridge slowly pull upwards to remove the reservoir bottle tubes and all connections keeping it upright [Music] it's time to remove the packaging and install the new aqua ease water cartridge start by holding the handle of the upper water cartridge feed the upper cartridge tube down the small round cavity near the front of the unit [Music] gently lower the reservoir bottle into the large round opening then align the dispensing tube to the front and align the handle inlet to the steam chamber [Music] once all components are in place push firmly to fully seal and press the foam ring down into place press down and click the gray bracket closed then close the lid you're almost done [Music] remove the entire cap from a new bottle of water and wipe down the neck with a clean cloth remove the lower cartridge from the packaging and put on the supplied gloves now you're going to carefully feed the lower cartridge dip tube into the bottle and secure the lower cartridge cap onto the bottle opening press down on the clamping lever to lock then let's remove the red hygiene cap from the upper cartridge tube and discard ensure the side tabs are aligned with the slots push down until it is fully secured what you'll do now is attach the red air connector to the air supply inlet on the bottle cap of the lower cartridge the connection should be tight and secure slide the bottle into place inside the cabinet ensuring no tubes are pinched or kinked then close the cabinet door one more step priming the dispenser first release the child safety lock by lifting the red lever and simultaneously press and hold the hot and cold levers for one second you'll know the priming process has started when you see the flashing dispensing light the light will flash for two minutes and you'll hear the pump run that indicates the unit is when the light stops flashing the dispenser is fully primed and ready for use now you're ready for your next glass of refreshing great tasting water from the new Lumina bottom load water dispenser

we're only going to need one thing today because I see pop alcohol try and get the highest percentage they got 91% because it's a big bottle I couldn't find anything higher in the big bottles yeah so so really really simple and straightforward take your piece today as you can see it's kinda dirty I do take good care of my pieces so I try to not let them get super dirty sorry guys all right there we go sorry about that so all I need to do is pour your rubbing alcohol in the bottom a little bit in the top if you have a percolator I happen to have a splash catch well sorry I let it seep through that splash top there then you take care glass I'm not sure if you can see this and you plug all the holes and just shake it you can see that the alcohol turns brown and takes most of the resin off the ball now if you want you can use salt to get everything off like the little hard chunks but I don't really give a [ __ ] so I just likes it really good with rubbing alcohol get off most of the resin off I'm gonna clean this stem here [Music] now for the areas like the courage area right there on my glass you can do something I simple take it q-tip and just swap it out that if you really want but to be honest the alcohols already loosened it so your next step the next step is going to be washing the bone so do this yeah but I just turned up only potluck you have your alcohol in here keep shaking right No sorry with this doesn't worry alright [Music] there we go alright so we emptied our alcohol out of our bomb the next step is to take hot water let it get hot rinse it now is what you want to shake the hot water and a new ball and then simply dump it out now your last step is going to be now let your bong is clean it is very hot from the hot water we used so if we were to put ice-cold water in here the bong would crack and explode unless it is tempered glass I do not know if mine is or not so I always take the precautions so what you're gonna want to do is you're going to let me take your hot water and take it down from hot to lukewarm to medium coldish kind of you know you get the point work it from hot down to cold do it slowly and also put the water over the outside

full-sized version of the original Airvape XS vaporizer from\nthe American-based manufacturer Apollo. Inside the box you'll find: one Airvape\nx, one concentrate pad insert, one USB cable, one set of cleaning and packing tools,\none replacement filter screen set, one user manual, and one warranty card. The\nfirst thing you'll want to do with the unit is sterilize it; to do that, press\nthe power button on the front of the unit three times quickly to turn it on.\nUse the up arrow button to bring the unit to its highest temperature, which is\n220\u00b0C.\u00a0 The AirVape X will automatically begin heating up, so let\nthe unit sit and run through a full cycle. After three minutes, the AirVape X\nwill automatically turn off, so to re-engage the unit, press the power button\nthree times again to start heating. Repeat this process three more times to\ncomplete the sterilization; this will get rid of any of the manufacturing oils\nwhich may have gotten inside of the unit as a result of putting it together. Once\nyou've done this, you're ready to load your unit with freshly ground botanical.\nTo grind up your botanical we always recommend using the ZEUS Bolt grinder;\nthe Bolt grinder's been calibrated to grind up your botanical to the optimal\nconsistency for vaporization. This just means it's fine enough to be properly\nvaporized inside of your unit, but not so fine it flies through the screens. To\nload your unit, first remove the chamber cover by simply pulling it off. Using\nyour ZEUS scoop, load freshly ground botanical into the heating chamber.\nReplace the mouthpiece and you are ready to vaporize! To load your unit with waxes\nor concentrates, remove the magnetic lid to expose the heating chamber. Drop the\nconcentrate pad into the chamber, and then, using your wax tool, load a small\namount of wax on the pad and press it in slightly. Replace the lid, set the unit to\nthe highest heat setting, and you are ready to vaporize! The AirVape X\nvaporizer has precise temperature control which you can adjust to the\nindividual degree by pressing the up and down arrow buttons on the front of the\nunit. You can see the unit's set and actual temperature on the LED screen, and you\ncan also flip between Celsius and Fahrenheit by pressing and holding the\nup and down arrow buttons at the same time for 3 seconds.\nThe AirVape X can be set between 93 to 220 degrees Celsius and it'll\nautomatically begin heating up to the last preset temperature when you turn it\non. For best results, we recommend vaporizing dry herb between 190 to 210\ndegrees Celsius and concentrates at 220 degrees Celsius.\nOnce the chamber is fully heated, the unit will vibrate and the Apollo logo\nwill stop spinning on screen. To wrap this one up, let's talk about some of the\nkey features of the AirVape X which make it such a sweet device. The first is the\nAirvape X's precise temperature control; this unit offers you complete control\nover the type of vapor you want, so those who prefer either thick clouds or\nlighter more flavorful draws should reach satisfaction with the AirVape X's\nwide temperature range. The second is the ultra-slim size of the AirVape X. Even at\na slightly larger size than the original AirVape X, this is still perhaps one\nof the slimmest vaporizers available on the market today. And third is the crisp\nclear LED screen of the AirVape X. The screen will show you your precise\ntemperature control as well as battery life and session length. The AirVape X\nis a solid update of an already convenient, high value vaporizer which is\neasy to use and offers efficient, satisfying vapor time after time.

Fusion wax\npen; this unit is a no-frills wax pen kit which still manages to elevate your\nvaporizing experience with a few key items. Inside the box, you'll find one 650\nmAh adjustable voltage battery, one dual quartz coil, one single\nceramic coil, one ceramic doughnut coil, one USB charger, one silicon container\none nonstick dab tool and one user manual. To load your unit, use your wax\ntool to place a small amount of wax onto the coil. Screw the atomizer onto the\nbattery and then screw the mouthpiece onto the atomizer. Press the button five\ntimes to turn the unit on, then press the button three times quickly to toggle\nthrough the three different color-coded voltage settings. Press and hold the\nbutton to heat the coil while you draw and you are vaporizing! The Fusion has a\n15-second heat up timer which means you can heat the coil for up to 15 seconds\nat once. This should be more than sufficient for even the most experienced\nusers. The Ooze Fusion has three voltage settings available on the battery. The\nlowest setting is 3.6 volts, indicated by a green light; medium is\n3.9 volts indicated by a blue light; and the highest is 4.2 volts, which is a neat-looking greenish-yellow light. To wrap this up,\nlet's talk about some of the key features of the Ooze Fusion which make it\nsuch an interesting wax pen. The first is the adjustable voltage battery; this\nsimply means you have the option of three different voltages to heat up your\ncoils, and you can toggle through them on demand. The second is the Ooze Fusion's\nease of use; the Fusion has a very simple one-button operation with intuitive\ncontrols, which makes it as simple as possible to use. And lastly, the three\nincluded coils, each with adjustable airflow dials. You have a ceramic\ndoughnut quartz coil, a single ceramic coil, and a dual quartz coil. These\nvarying options allow you to further customize your vaporization experience\nto satisfy your individual preferences. The Ooze Fusion is a good unit for those\nseeking a convenient, high-value wax pen which is easy to use and offers\nefficient satisfying vapor. This is Mike here again for TVape TV, and for all the\nconnoisseurs out there, keep vapin'!", "TTXgj3Hltfo": "[Music] hi guys i'm caleb josh has frogs today we're in my apartment to set up this blue wall flex 15 this is a cool desktop compact aquarium it is an all-in-one with a the heater and filtration in the back it is a very aesthetic design from flue ball they also come in different sizes 15 means this is the 15 gallon it comes in both black and white and in other sizes as well we've all also has other desktop aquariums such as the flora and the speck and the edge and you can find them all on our website we also have these available and a lot of our kits they're a great kit tank because you pretty much get everything you need to have the basis for setting up your tank and they're also very attractive so let's open it up and take a look [Music] so now we have it all unboxed you can see it's a cool little neat design looking a little 15 gallon cube it's actually a bell front which is the distinguishing feature of the whole design the front is Bell fronted and you might think that it would distort the fish but it doesn't distort the fish at all it might magnify them a little bit from the front but not quite it is also featuring a honeycomb top banner that goes around to hide water levels and calcium deposits and such it has a seamless top to go with it it's plastic it does have a punch out right here you can punch out for other utilities it does have a sensor it comes with a remote and the remote allows you to access a wide lighting spectrum you can actually do storms you can do all kinds of artificial colors you can make it as naturalistic as possible or you can you know give your fish a disco party if you please the top comes right off you have the easy feeding port right here you can take the top off here is your LED lighting system with the plug looks like the pump is going to come boxed up so they have to unbox that this is where the water comes in and what blue ball did for their filtration system is the filtration is all-in-one in just a simple rectangle basically they have the mechanical filtration being this sponge you have your bio media which of course you would take out of the bag and rinse before use and also you have your mechanical filtration or excuse me your chemical filtration which is your carbon and as a nifty little handle just slides right in there with so much space you could potentially put way more bio media in here if you wanted to you could customize it quite a bit and this kit does not come with the heater so you would put the heater over in here and the nice thing is it keeps all the filtration out of the way out of sight out of mind you have a nice black background and your heater would be here out of sight away from the fish and keeping all of the heat distributed evenly as it goes through the filtration system [Music] so inside the box you're going to find at the pump which has suction cups on the bottom it's going to stick down like this and then you have the outtake coming up and it's going to go up to this hole so it'll set right down in here and then of course you'll bring the electrical cord up and then this will screw right into this you have your output nozzles so those will go inside here and that's how you screw it together and you can Direction your output nozzles to face upwards to skim the surface a lot of fish obvious like to do that or you can bend them anyway which way you want depending on your aquascape and however you want the flow to go which is pretty nice you can see that it's very customizable you can move them back and forth and up and down on a pivot but then you can also take each one individually and do the same also obvious like to angle them towards the top of the surface to break the water tension and this is your remote this gives you the option to do all kinds of different lighting features like I mentioned earlier [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so there you have it we have it all set up we went through the lighting cycles and played with that a little bit I can't see myself using most of these some of you might want to personally this is gonna be my personal tank I like to keep my tanks more naturalistic so I will probably just use the regular white one maybe in nighttime one one thing is you can't do timings on these so if you're going to use your light on a timer you're still gonna have to manually switch over between night and day if you want to go that route but like I said these are a really cool design really cool design two tanks to have that curved front they make them really stand out compared to a lot of other tanks and like I said they're all in one so they're very seamless in their design very easy to take care of they're great for beginners great for starter kids this is a staple and a lot of our starter kits on our website you can check out where you can get everything else to go with this such as the substrates and anything you need to go with it live plants if you want to go that route you don't have to use live plants we have kids that are including non live plants but if you do want to grow live plants like I plan to with this tank it's going to do great with that lighting system it's really bright nice bright LED", "p3bKIFe8ay8": "what if everyone is sent me and in this one I won't be teaching how to clean your puff go pique battery and atomizer so what you gonna need to do this is some 91% isopropyl alcohol if you have access to 99 grab that you can need some q-tips and you're also going to need a container to put everything all right so everything ready what you want to take apart the peak start off by taking off the card seem like the atomizer isn't making connection to the battery and you'll get a notification showing you that I actually broke it so I'm gonna show you what shows up we've gone over that let's go ahead and clean that battery terminal first what you want to do put a little bit of ice up in your plastic container grab one of your q-tips from the side right here just give it a little bit doesn't need a lot on there just need a tiny bit you know cuz you're not trying to [ __ ] this [ __ ] up and then what you need to do next is just spin it around into the threads so that you can grab all that excess way [Music] all right now that you've done that use the opposite side of the q-tip to dry it off there you go so now that we've cleaned up the battery terminal let's go ahead and clean up the atomizer so to start off just take it apart by taking off the cap right here and set this little ceramic bowl to the side because we've got other plans for it so what you want to do with your atomizer is completely submerge it in isopropyl alcohol along with the ceramic and rubber caps let's go ahead and drop that in there and put enough isopropyl alcohol to go above the atomizer so not what you want to do is just leave this in here for about two hours to let all the wax be carried up by the ISO all right so now what we're gonna do is clean up the ceramic bowl so what you want to do go ahead and grab a rig and grab one of your shittiest nails you can find if you're gonna do a lot of heating for this after you have this off grab that little ceramic bowl you can see it's got the black spot at the bottom that usually happens when you dial on it for at least a day or so and drop it in the bottom after you've done this right here you want to give this a [ __ ] ton of heat until the ceramic bowl is white and I'm gonna go ahead and speed this process up [Music] all right so I just plug eat for about a good minute and a half go ahead and take you down to the bank not as we've got everything all cleaned up pretty much all you have to do is put it back together start off by grab your atomizer and get the little ceramic or back in there and then this little ceramic piece goes in the ceramic ring make sure holes lined up with the ceramic top that's pretty much it your itemized is back together and perfectly clean looking brand-new all you have to do screw back onto your piece [Music] all right thank you for watching I hope you enjoyed this video and yeah just be sure to be careful with that atomizer let that [ __ ] dry off [Music]", "jM0Rya3Ex7k": "air lift pumps okay here is are actually two of them I made so basically how that works is simple here you got a three-quarter inch pipe that goes all the way true so here you got a ring that's glued in and on the other side you have a ring that's glued in and the middle piece goes all the way through so with other words in here is a chamber that's just a little bit bigger where the air I'm filling up right in here can go in and as it goes in in this section in here or over here our holes drilled in four or five rows of tiny little holes so they create inside here the air creates a pressure but then actually the air escapes into the pipe you can't really see those here but anyway as two bubbles or they're not bubbles yet it's just air that goes in there they creates bubbles once it hits the water that's going to be coming from down there so the entire part has to be submerged in about four feet of water and then us this is like this in the water you can imagine the bubbles from the air go out and then start driving up and I'll stay raise up they're actually taking the water with it so let me mount it on my little stand here let me turn the air on the air is driven by this little compressor here 110 liters per minute just goes out in a tube and comes in here let me plug that compressor in so you see there's quite a nice output on that there's certainly two things one is the amount that comes out and the other thing is how high can I go above the water level that was about 32 inches here is the pipe in a pipe designed by Glenn Martinez from Hawaii here goes to air in travel style in a pipe all the way down and all the way at the end we got few holes six rows as a matter of fact of tiny little holes that let the air come out and now the water who gets sucked in there or actually that since the pipe is standing in water about four feet the water level is about up here but as the air travels up it starts to move the water up so this is completely sealed and needless to say the nice part about it everything is out of the water not like at the little bow and lift pipe I showed you before so here I'm just going to hook up the air and the water is going to come up here together with the air so on top of here he designed the silencer and a configuration that separates the water and the air I will show you that next this piece here goes on top and here is where the water is going to come out and here is where the air will travel up here is another piece we could make that's even more silencer like a on a gun so you're not going to hear anything when that water is goggling but I want to show you something very neat he he made in here so this is the pipe where the water comes up and here is the entire trick and here let me take this apart as you can see that pipe comes up and that pipe just goes a little bit above the diameter of this outside pipe so what it does the water fills up completely flows out and then comes out to here and the air escapes to the top but what's going to happen here is because you are above the entire diameter is going to be filled with water and once the water is full and it starts rolling out you get what we call a siphon effect and it's going to start pulling that water out in that direction so let me mount this pipe and let me show you how that works I'm going to use the same little pump and again that system needs to be about four feet submerged in water let me connect the power there we go look at that steady furrow border so in here goes to here I can take this out not a problem then it quits needless to say as soon as I plug it back in the water will fall again so here we they'll extend this a little bit to see how high I can pump this is now six feet high five feet high and it's pumping just fine you", "YopeGw4mhtg": "hey guys it's Alex og pen today I'm going to show you everything you need to know about the G pen - first you'll want to register the serial number found on the bottom of the device @ G pen comm backslash register ensure that the battery is fully charged plug it in using the micro USB cable once it stops linking the dash is fully charged remove the mouthpiece and load finely-ground material into the chamber the chamber holds up to a quarter of a gram and you should not pack it too tight the device is not intended for tobacco liquids or concentrates next attach the mouthpiece you'll notice it's magnetic press the button five times to power on and activate heating press the button three times to select desired temperature range once you feel it vibrate it is heated to the desired temperature and you can draw from the mouthpiece to cancel heating press and hold the button for two seconds during activation the number of lights blinking represents the approximate percentage of battery power remaining press the button five times to turn off device vaporized material can be tapped out of the chamber easily the integrated air path and screen within the mouthpiece can be cleaned separately by removing the silicone insert you can soak these in isopropyl alcohol for a deep clean after soaking in isopropyl alcohol for a few minutes rinse with warm water and let air dry before reassembling", "9v7r27xFTR8": "hi I'm Alex from elevate and I'm BJ with seventh-floor and today we're gonna talk about the seventh floor vaporizer flavor disk pipe so BJ what is this new product you brought today it's an awesome new product that we've invented it's a new vaporizer called a flavour disc pipe a few years back we invented a small thing called a simple flavor disc and then this guy here is a great way to take that simple flavor disc on-the-go and vaporize the concentrates anywhere you are the disc itself what's it made out of ceramic and so it basically is a porous stone made out of ceramic that'll hold on your concentrates and not let it seep through to the bottom of the pipe so I just take any type of concentrate and load it on the top and then what would I do next you would use just any liner that you find in your pocket no need for a torch and then you would just give it a little bit of a tap on the top of the bowl verses kind of a scorcher that you would do with dry herbs and it takes a little bit getting used to but it's definitely an awesome piece to have in your repertoire you know if you're on the go I noticed there's not a carb on this is that on purpose it is actually yeah that's part of the flavor disc pipe you'll also notice that the hole on the bottom of the bowl is much too large to use flour and what that does is just allows the right amount of air to come over the simple flavor disc to give you the right amount of flavor the disc will kind of let you know when your hits done versus a carb hole that you would release and allow air in that's really cool now the pipe itself you guys make these we do we hand make these at a borosilicate right here in Colorado Springs Colorado we have several glass blowers on staff that make our production pieces and this is made by you know our company called elevate premier glass and can't take a large fat glob on top of this you can I definitely wouldn't recommend it it's made for smaller more flavorful hits that's why we call it the flavor disc putting too much concentrate on there might might deteriorate that flavor a little bit so you want to use smaller amounts until you get to an amount where you're really comfortable and you know what you're gonna get what's also great about it is that you can flip that simple flavor disc over and you'll have you an extras kind of sitting in the bottom there waiting for you that's really cool man I can't wait to use one of these I want to thank BJ stopping in from subfloor vaporizers I'm Alex from elevate and you have a great day [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "IRZWcr-L1tQ": "hello everyone I'm Alex dykes and today on the mountain garden we're talking about water treatment systems since we live in the middle of the redwood forest we depend on well water for all of our water the well is actually about 500 feet down the hill about 300 feet of elevation and about 500 feet across and it pumps right up here to this water treatment system this is a 5,000 gallon storage tank like many people on well water in the United States our well water is full of things that most city people don't really want in their water there's a lot of iron there's a lot of Magha knees there's a lot of calcium and occasionally according to our water tests there has been coliform bacteria in that water we don't really know the source of the coliform bacteria there are a number of different speculations it could just be that our aquifer has it hanging out in there or it could be that someone around has some sort of problem with their well wasn't properly capped and something is going down into the well and infecting the rest of the aquifer whatever the cause it is definitely a problem and it is something that we need to address even though the numbers are below the safe limits first off why do we need to remove some of these well iron of course will turn things orange so if you have a lot of iron in your water and you're trying to wash your whites and your washing machine then your whites won't get white they'll actually start turning orange over time Magon ease tends to turn things black and so it actually does exactly the same thing only with black stains and it's really obvious when you take a look at the water it has kind of a slightly orange tinge to it and then you let it sit for a while and you end up with a black film at the bottom of things it won't hurt you neither one of those things is bad for people to drink it just doesn't do so well when it comes to washing laundry and doing a number of other things calcium causes hard water deposits on your toilets your sinks it also causes soap to not work as well so you have to use more soap in your dishwasher more soap in your washing machine things don't suds properly in the shower so it feels like you aren't really cleaning your hair things like that in addition to the minerals we have another common problem for well users in the u.s. we have hydrogen sulfide in the water it's caused by decaying matter from a long long time ago that's down there in the ground and it has that rotten egg smell when you turn on a faucet the big way to get rid of hydrogen sulfide is just to allow it to come out of the water because it does come out of solution very easily once the water is at regular atmospheric pressure that's part of the reason we have this 5,000 gallon tank here of course tanks are required in our fire district for other reasons but it also is a great way of removing hydrogen sulfide from your water you basically pump the water into the tank and because you're not using all that 5,000 gallons right away the hydrogen sulfide just comes out of solution and the water that comes out of the tank doesn't smell anymore now that the water is basically a captive audience in our 5,000 gallon tank we can start treating it and the first stage is ozonation there are an awful lot of water treatment ozone systems available out there and we got kind of duped into buying one right up front because we didn't know that there were other options out there in order to assemble one yourself the big thing is that the parts inside this box I won't tell you exactly who we got it from they're all basically the same price they're all basically the same thing inside we have a fluorescent tube and the fluorescent tube is especially UV generating fluorescent tube it's inside a case and because air is passing across that it generates ozone this is exactly the same thing that you'll find at Spa Supply stores because spas and hot tubs use the same ozone generation mechanism in the same ozone delivery system nine times out of ten for most hot tubs so you can actually assemble yourself an awful lot cheaper with parts out there that's what we've done over time because over time we've had to replace just about everything so we're only using the original case that our original ozone system came with the other way of generating ozone is a Corona discharge system and that's this little module right here and we have both of those in this particular case because I wanted a little bit more ozone in the tank since our water turnover rate is so high we use the tank not just for household water but also for irrigation water and since all the water has to go through that system we wanted a little bit more ozone than just the UV lamp would deliver you can buy the corona discharge parts from most spa places as well when it comes to the air pump to deliver this ozone into your tank that's where things get a little bit different I'm actually using a pond air pump here this is a Dadar manufacturing a p40 air pump and it's a great air pump you can find it on amazon it is a little bit more expensive than the spa specific air pumps but it delivers an awful lot more air and also allows you to put the air stone lower in your tanks that way you get better turnover and better ozone impregnation in the water the ozone is delivered to the tank via a nylon air stone that's about 4 feet below the surface of the water it's hard to see in the video but it's way down there in the tank the result is that anything that's oxidizable will oxidize in the tanks that's iron manganese etc they'll all al-qaida oxidize come out of solution and then either settle on the bottom of the tank or be caught by a mechanical filter that I'll show you in a bit eurozone will also kill any bacteria that's living in the tank so if anything like a leaf falls in your tank or dust or spores that blow in the tank that sort of thing they'll all be killed by the ozone helping to keep it sanitary coming out of the tank we have a one and a half horsepower booster pump right there and then we have a large pressure tank to help keep the water at a consistent pressure things then split between the house and the garden right over there and for the household water we then enter a 20 inch tall filter body and this uses a graduated filter element it's a spun graduated element and over here you can see a used element you can see all that iron and manganese that's caught in that filter you can all catch it mechanically at this point because of the ozonator ozonation and mechanical filtration is sufficient for kitchen uses like drinking water ice cubes cooking that sort of thing you have no problem making clear ice cubes with the water after that process is done however it doesn't really do anything for calcium removal as well as extra iron removal for washing whites in your washing machine that's where we have a water softener we're on well water so we have a high iron and calcium content we also wanted to be able to deliver a good shower experience which means we decided to oversize our water softener here we found this one online and believed it was water softeners calm and it's much larger and offers much better flow characteristics than the ones you'll find at Sears Home Depot or Lowe's those are typically much much smaller units and its really obvious when you take a look at the plumbing connection sizes this one uses one inch plumbing connections a lot of those ones out there use either 1/2 or 3/4 inch connections it seems that there's a lot of misinformation about water softeners out there water softeners don't just remove calcium they trade calcium for something else and that something else has to be either sodium or potassium so you have to put either salt or potassium pellets in the tank on the outside and that's what actually flushes the resin bed to get the calcium out so it's really just an ion exchange thing going on it also tends to accept iron so iron comes out in that same process along with the calcium a lot of the misinformation centers on that sodium or that potassium yes the system does raise the sodium or the potassium levels on the water coming out of it it just really means that you shouldn't be drinking this water on a regular basis it's not going to hurt you to brush your teeth with it or even have a little sip of water now and then from this but if especially if you have high blood pressure problems you don't want to be drinking this water on a regular basis so you should exclude the water softener system from your kitchen plumbing so cook with it you shouldn't drink with it probably shouldn't be making ice cubes and that sort of thing with it long-term it's okay on a short-term basis but long-term you will end up raising your sodium or potassium intake after all those treatment processes are complete we have clean water for washing our hands washing our dishes washing our laundry etc we don't have any iron spot so we don't have any calcium deposits in our sinks or our toilets and most importantly we don't have any of that rotten egg smell especially if you already have a cistern or a water tank in place I highly encourage you to give ozonation a try a side benefit of the ozonation system is that ozonated water tends to act a little bit like OxiClean in the wash so it helps keep your whites whiter it also helps remove wine stains strangely enough if you're looking at getting a nose nation system for your water system and you already have a water tank or a cistern I highly recommend that you try this yourself you can again as I said find an awful lot of these parts either on Amazon or at spa supply companies and save a great deal of money versus buying a package system there are only a few parts you have to find from a company that's more dedicated towards water system delivery and really that's just the ozonator air stone that actually goes inside the tank in your water tank that one I haven't really been able to find a reliable source for outside of someone like triple ozone or ozone nation or any of those other places that are out there online the rest of the parts are all pretty easy to find and I encourage you to go ahead and try that yourself thanks taking the time to watch this video again I'm Alex and this has been the mountain garden comm

what's going on everybody my name is greg aka flippadelphia philadelphia flip flip play in philadelphia but a lot of people just call me flip and on this channel we smoke weed talk about weed products and just kind of chill if that sounds like something you'd be into hit that subscribe button it's like right here whisper style and today's nickname was brought to you by peyton moore thanks for the nickname homie and always sunny in philadelphia is one of my favorite [ __ ] shows so big shout outs to that if you've got an idea for what my next nickname should be leave it in the comments and maybe i'll consider that [ __ ] at some point if i feel like it and in today's video we're going to talk about something that can turn any bong you have into a dab rig an electronic dab rig it's the dab x mach 1 titanium rocket i did the lights in the back red and white because i feel like that's like standard rocket colors for some reason i don't [ __ ] know and if you stick around to the end of the video so yeah you can save some money on it but before we get into anything i figured we could use this [ __ ] to take a dab obviously because that's what the [ __ ] does i got some island sweet skunk right yeah that's what the [ __ ] it's called island sweet skunk by the homies over at cresco they make some [ __ ] flame ass [ __ ] straight up so let's get right into it [Music] please [Music] [Music] okay so the dab x that [ __ ] was [ __ ] dope uh and it comes with a bunch of little accessories and stuff right so first of all in here you got like a little extra chamber you got like a little traveling cap it's not a carb cat people i thought it was at first too but it's not so you're not using it you can put that on the top so no dirt and debris can get in there and [ __ ] all right so that's [ __ ] cool it comes with this little stand in there so like you never really have to put it on its side you can always just kind of like i mean you can't put that you could have put it on there with the battery because it's too heavy but you can always have this part like one a little stand in there and just have the battery next to it and it's all magnetic so you just like kind of click it together and it's ready to go right you just throw that onto your piece and bing bang boom you can take a dab the little cap says dab x this is gonna be so hard to see this look at that there it's so cute can you see it bad look at that it's dope and it's not a car cat i swear they literally hit me up like in the messages and they were like hey just so you know that's not a carb cap it's for like storage i was like oh all right cool you just take it out look put it in this little stand next to the thing it's got usbc charging and [ __ ] very cool right you're just gonna put them next to each other on the shelf it's [ __ ] heat it's fire super easy to use five clicks on five clicks off i feel like i said five because it's fly and five maybe i don't know i'm high [ __ ] right now other [ __ ] that it comes with it comes with the little dab tool you saw me use uh for the hit right it comes with an extra chamber for on top for when your like little bowl gets a little dirty and [ __ ] so you can just replace that just screws on super simple and it comes with this like little case in which this will be and in here is also like a charging cable and some extra o-rings and [ __ ] like that you know just general upkeep type [ __ ] right but most importantly i like the little box that comes in it's [ __ ] dope and the outside is that titanium kind of color i might just i'm keep this box i'm like a stickler for boxes like companies have cool boxes there's usually cool [ __ ] inside them right but let's go over some specifics right it has four temperature settings uh which you can cycle through using three clicks uh so you turn it on five clicks let me just show you actually it'll be way easier just pop it off so five clicks on and off it's gonna do a little light show when it turns on and then one two three wait man i did maybe i turned it off [ __ ] because it was already on all right two three four five turns on right i got it at the blue setting that's their like preferred setting it's the lowest one honestly but isn't that like 380 to 400 degree range nice cool dab you get all that full flavor i really like that [ __ ] right click it three times maybe i clicked it five times by accident or maybe it's on the white setting the white settings that stoner setting 400 to 420 degrees hey 420 baby and they say that's the best for like pressed stuff you know what i mean if you got some dabs that's been pressed you want to use that setting on there and then you can click it again three times boom boom boom we got the green setting the flipping loud setting hey we gotta take a hit on the green setting at some point even though i think they said this is more for like crystalline products you know what i mean uh you got diamonds and [ __ ] like that you want to use that on this setting right and then of course you got that crazy setting the red setting the danger [ __ ] setting the i'm gonna hit you in the [ __ ] lungs setting right and they say that's really best for like if you got like a bigger [ __ ] setup like if you about to take like a three foot bong out of hit like hit out of this [ __ ] we have a three and a half foot bong his name is mammoth like mammoth because he's big as [ __ ] he's actually in the corner over there i have not broke him out on the channel yet maybe i'll have to one of these days he needs some like a little bit of upkeep though and a new stem uh he's he's older he's an old man now but he's cool as [ __ ] so maybe we'll break him out one of these days and [ __ ] maybe we can throw the dab x on there let's take another dab real quick though just oh wait i forgot to tell you all the temperature settings i don't even [ __ ] remember where i get to white right all right so the greens like 420 to 440 and the red is like 440 to 470 i think they said the reds just like crazy [ __ ] we might have to take a red setting or at least a green one because channel colors and [ __ ] gotta rep the channel of course all right so where was i all right so we we got through circling through our [ __ ] right uh when you're ready you're gonna hit the launch sequence i like that they called it a launch sequence because it's the rocket it makes sense [ __ ] liftoff you know what i mean cool [ __ ] like that so uh let's let's do this [ __ ] let's take another little dab real quick right let's do it on the uh should we do it on the [ __ ] crazy red setting i mean this this is a small this is a small bong i'm using right here so i feel like it might be a little too much there's some water on the top of it that's weird let's do the green setting right let's get through here let's get to green there's white we're gonna go crazy the green all right and then you get the the temperature and like i said that just kind of clicks on there you're gonna grab this little tool man i [ __ ] love dabs get you super big let's just do a little one a little bit bigger though a little bit bigger a little more running out running out of my [ __ ] i'm gonna have to go to the dispensary soon all right time to take a dab all right so just hit the launch sequence it's a two clicker bing bing all right it says heating up in whatever color you chose i know that might be hard to see you see it's already heating up right and then you just inhale slow and then this little buttons for when you want to clear the chamber right it actually vibrates when it's ready i don't know if you heard that because my letter was moving damn green green sentence [ __ ] crazy damn okay that [ __ ] hit me that was strong as [ __ ] right green heated up like what's up clean out one of these bad boys i'm good to go whoo this [ __ ] is [ __ ] flames all right so there is some [ __ ] i forgot to tell you about right so if you've already been taking dabs and like it's already like it's going around and you're just throwing more in it you can skip the preheat like setting by doing like like a long hold and then a short hold for like it like skips all the preheat [ __ ] and if you're just keeping it going you want to keep hitting it and [ __ ] and it's already heated up you can enter manual mode where you literally just like hold this button down as long as you want to hit it for right so you hitting it you just like you just hold it like you know what i mean manual mode just has it this should have light up so it knew like that we're gonna turn it off for a second because i'm highest but all right whoo shit's nice man i'm super happy they hit me up with this because this [ __ ] is dope there's a little bit in there that button right there that's like the clear the chamber button right you hit that hits that extra airflow so like you kind of like you don't hit that button this one right here and then like you kind of let it get all like [ __ ] milky in there and then boom hit it with the clear [ __ ] like watch right listen to this i just drank some water i put a little extra water in here between the hits because there was like this much water left in the water bottle so i was like ah this could take it and it was like a lot more than i had originally planned so i just drank a little bit of water because this is filled up a little high at this point honestly dabs where have you been on my i wish i was younger when dabs like came out and [ __ ] you know what i mean and if you ever want to know where your battery's at you can always check it by clicking this button four times one two three four and it'll tell you where your battery's at white means you're fully charged [Music] hey [Music] [Music] [Music] apparently the battery is bigger ship you can get anywhere between 30 to 50 dabs off one full battery depending on what [ __ ] temperature setting you're using it at yeah so that's [ __ ] dope i mean this [ __ ] lasts forever once again i love the cool little case that it comes in because it's cool opens like a book there's a nice little message written from the guy you know what i mean it's like hey man that's buying this rocket mock one if this is just the mach 1 rocket like i hope i hope i can't wait to see what like more [ __ ] they do you know what i mean because this is already dope and shout out to their website dabex.com right right here and i'm gonna tell you why i'm shouting out the website specifically because there's something super [ __ ] satisfying when you scroll down their website because as you scroll down like it has this whole thing like being put together as you scroll and it's cool as [ __ ] i'm gonna put it up on the screen i probably did that already while i was talking about it and this is now a relevant statement that's how we run things around here irrelevantly it's just something super satisfying about that for me like the website was cool as [ __ ] so like i'm gonna make sure y'all see that cool ass website also the little x's that kind of turn or do their little [ __ ] dance when you're when you're reading through the [ __ ] i just hit myself in the hat i'm [ __ ] baked right now yo all right so before i recorded this video i ate uh a nerds rope they're like 400 milligrams of pop so i was already like like feeling that [ __ ] before we started and like i'm in full effect from that and the dab at this point like whoo i still got some of those nerd ropes left too let me see if i can find one to show you guys i think i have like two more be right back all right so yeah [ __ ] medicated [ __ ] nerds ropes 400 milligrams 60 minute excavation time it's been about an hour 20. i'm wrecked all right but before we go i gotta tell you make sure you hit up their website with all that cool [ __ ] i just talked about and make sure you use my coupon but you gotta be quick about this because the first 20 people are the only people that are going to get this right so i've used my code loud 20 you can get 20 off but you have to be one of the first people to use the coder it's not going to work straight up but the code is loud 20 first 20 people get 20 off i think they run for like 250 bucks so you gotta act fast because people are probably gonna scoop these up pretty quick right i'm high [ __ ] i'm gonna get the [ __ ] out of here don't forget to like comment share subscribe all that [ __ ] normal youtubers tell you to do before we go should we take another dab probably not but we're gonna oh man i'm running super loud [Music] not on green again that [ __ ] was crazy back to blue cresco makes the best [ __ ] [ __ ] i swear to god [Music] [Music] of karate and friendship for everyone day man [ __ ] love that show man what have you taken permission from marijuana a few marijuana", "AXMIudCoCaQ": "everybody get into some real weed lingo and some real pricey job all right chains to give a few very special things for you to try here all right what you got man I'm ready let's give this honeybadger a whirl I want to show you how this works it's got a ceramic tip as well as a bubbler it's like a warm straw then this is actually a portable dab rig he's pretty cool I think we should start with the NP X's King Louie we've been waiting for that now what John is doing is he's actually mixing the King Louie to concentrate its sauce all right we're gonna wait till that keeps up and then you're gonna hit that nozzle so what I smoke doing right here yes sir as soon as I start touching you're gonna breathe in okay there you go [Applause] [Music] beautiful flavor profile nice and tasty I mean I mean hey I'm here yeah one more time I'm gonna stuff constantly so the honey badger itself is about 250 retell the sauce itself roughly between 50 to 60 dollars what makes it special is the high terpenes they've probably got four or five different terpenes like limonene beta-carotene Mersin they're testing around well 13 to 15 milligrams per as well as your cannabinoids so the cannabis of THC is testing prior romic between 75 and 85 percent so you're getting some really amazing pure stuff there cool so how much does something like this cost it's 250 retail should drive the buggy this device here is is our showpiece though our friends over at Ziggy have been kind to provide us this rig to be able to play with took 14 glass flow or several miles or yeah it's it's 150 notices ofE yeah a 150,000 come that's right you think they will bite and use it about and just keep it as art piece typically you know we wouldn't allow somebody is cut from this but obviously the suspension so just load that up with the tingling yes sir you wanna put something on it now man yeah I put a real book on it more folks Mindy I got you a miss long all right [Music] what do you think the taste and flavorings like excellent that's what kind of makes up the sauce stuff special I think we should also try um which one you want to buy Adam yeah you like of our mmm yeah it's two gig to Gig to fairs we got here a a can of gar our friends provided for us this thing's worth roughly retail side five $600 it's a thousand milligrams plus they're they're amazing they made it specially for you my friend what they've done is they've ground-up the flower in the in the palm nice and then they dipped in oil they've got Keef in it it's it's a super joint is what it is you want to light it up that was custom-made for for you it's not a for sale product here in this market yet hmm so it's uh so one of the first to have it you could blow it out and it looks good with TV five hundred dollars man issue [Music] right till you work to be able to experience just ain't get paid for it I can't even mind it's just like what dreams are made of", "IhqPbV4SyBw": "hi my name is Dennis glaze I work for again state university and within the university I work for Sea Grant extension within the aquatic animal health program I work with aquatic veterinarian dr. Tim Miller Morgan and our emphasis obviously is on aquatic animal health and that's what we'll be talking about today is aquatic animal health in relationship to plumbing life support systems for aquatic animals we're going to go over here and I want to show you this here this is a typical setup of a aquatic animal life support system where you have some sort of sump here within the sump usually that's a filtration system maybe we'll put the heater in here I don't have the filtration system in here so you're going to imagine that you have a pump here that will take the water from that system and shoot it up into the main tank the tank will fill then overflow and it comes back down here so we have a recirculating system it's an ongoing system some key points to this is the pump here pumps come in different sizes different flow rates which will determine a circulation rate so you can imagine water coming in through here and I have a spray bar across here so that water comes in and it goes across and so we have water circulating from this point over to this point one common mistake people make is they put this the inlet right next to the outlet so your circulation just basically goes right here not a good thing for this reason fish live in the system they eat and they give off fish waste okay so the point of circulation is one get the food to the fish and to get the fish waste out of the system and in to the filtration system clean the water up and take it back in here so that circulation is it partially determined by two main points here one is the size of the pump and two is the size of the outlet here okay so these pieces here are called bulkheads as you can see there's different sizes to ball kids and I don't have one with me but I've seen them up to six inches in diameter okay so that's what we're really talking about here is both heads here a bulkhead all bulkhead is a fitting where you can take water out of a system and hook it into a plumbing disaster don't get sub gaskets on them they tighten up really nicely they're very common in this trade so that the challenge here is what size bulkhead do we want to use okay and so when I want to show you then over here this here is a pump it has a one inch outlet size one inch pumps like this typically on the average will pump around a thousand to 1500 gallons per hour okay and so you know that's probably more than what we need for this system but it's a real common pump it's real common fitting and so you have that much water coming through here it's going to come in through a one inch pipe typically what the student will do or new person to the trade will do will have a 1 inch coming in here so it just makes sense let's take a 1 inch coming out here okay and so this here against our bulkhead and this little tool we have here I've just downsized it with these reducer fittings to simulate a one-inch bulkhead opening and so this is what happens when you do this arrangement again a real typical error you have a one inch line coming in we want to have a one inch hole coming out or one inch bulkhead and this is what happens here so if you can imagine this is your tank and your your setup above you know some really nice carpeting or wood floor now you have water all over your floor obviously it's not what we want to do so we need to figure out what size bulkhead opening would work best with this size outlet okay and so it's really nice here we start doing this taking this off we'll see the water flow starting to come down now we're at about I think it's an inch and a quarter opening this here would represent an inch and a half opening you see well we're getting pretty close here water level starting to come down if we go here to the next size now we're at a two inch opening you can see the water level comes down quite substantially so this was your tank you could probably run this pretty safely you know that noise is a siphon effect that occurs and that's why instead of going just a two inch you might even want to go back up to the next size which is two and a half inch now you're safe if something happens something clogs it's opening you're still going to have room to prevent overflow so you like to say a good basic rule is whatever size coming in you double the size going out so if I have a one inch line coming in I do a two inch opening going out and then to be safe I like to go up one half inch farthest now we're at three and a half inch this way allows maximum flow out of this pump going through this system and the point being there is another option I could come over here and turn my valve and I could turn my valve down so now I valve my water down to where let's say half the water is coming out and that I could reattach all those and probably go back down to one inch opening and it probably would work the problem of that is you've reduced circulation and our goal is to get as much circulation as possible the other thing I want to grab a bulkhead right here the other thing to consider too you know you might say why not just goes big as bulkhead as I can go well the problem that is is size the bigger the bulkhead the farther down I'm going to have to go on my aquarium and cost of course costs are going to go up the bigger the bulkhead so you can see with this one here we made a lot of extra room just so we can show the overflow but you would have to go down at least that much to make this bulkhead work if you go a four inch or six-inch bulkhead you're going down this far and what happens is water is going to go out through this hole and probably never fill up to here so if I have a bulkhead down here this is all going to be empty it's going to really waste my space so I want to go as big as I need but no smaller and no bigger you want to get as close as you can to the right side that way you'll show yourself circulation and you'll assure yourself having healthy fish for plenty of circulation for them again take waste away and bring food to them you you", "MHYoMGHAlOo": "what's good it's your boy 3js I've got something special for you today I'm gonna take you on a picnic but first if you're wondering if this is me I'm not sure it is it's me with my youth steamboat it's a piece of art illustrated by Dave Myers illustration and one of my sponsors Ryan Avery from SGS designs brought up I

picnic we've got some special items today we've got one of my favorite waters we've got some OG Kush coming in at 23% and we've got the new booze glyco it's a glycerin chilled glass water pipe that you put in the freezer so this has been sitting in the freezer put the bowl in the freezer you put the pipe in the freezer that's what you do folks this is it it's frozen got glycerin it's ice-cold we're gonna see how this thing rips I've got some og cush 23 percent flour and we're just gonna see how it works so a little bit of water in it halfway this Tim is what I was told we're just about there everybody I'm super stoked to try this out I've got a really nice table that a friend of mine gave me with this dope chair and I'm trying not to get any water on the table so I'm being really gentle with this I bought this og Coast from flowing the other day just just for this piece so I would usually grind it up but it looks like this has a nice little like screen in it so I'm just gonna break up some of this OG Kush real nice just break it up like a fat bowl because you know why not it's been a long time since I've used a glass bowl or a bong as they call them I really don't use pipes that much I use my rigs because I really like concentrates I like you know the nectar collectors and the things like that but this is the first bong that I've had in a long time and I'm really excited about this piece right here once again this is the use glyco just released it's the blue model again it is me oh my shirt holding my yellow steamboat that's the sickest already know that now let's try this piece right here super strong it's actually cooler and smoothies than I would have thought that's just a browsing distillate for a little more razzle dazzle but I'll get to that I just wanted to make a quick video to try this thing out and spit it in the freezer you can see the smoke pouring down you just got milky pulling it's really nice the water down there yeah this is really great I usually wouldn't smoke sativa in the evening or even a hybrid leaning sativa but I just spent the day shooting with a homie and I'm about to work on that project I wanted to kind of throw this in the middle because I just got this I'm gonna be doing some photos with it but right now I just wanted to get used to it it's a great little piece that soon as I go we've got more on the way thanks

like the 8 inch once provides enough lot of support for the plant 5 gallon bucket pick that up any hardware store but I find if you if you go to the hydroponic stores they have the black ones I won't let any white through some quarter-inch airline 5/8 diameter clear tubing this is a 5/8 barbed fitting goes it sandwiches the bucket in between you can get a grommet with a 90 on it might be a little a little cleaner but this is what I have around so this is what I'm using some zip ties air pump and some air stones it's the first thing you want to do get your drill this is a 1 inch drill bit not sure the actual name but that's what size is for that fitting so get your bucket what I like to do is go you be hopping in chop take it nice and slow and just drill your hole put the hole wherever I like to put it let his liquor the handles like this put the whole here that way I can lift my bucket the water level is indicator is going to be right here it's good to go get some plastic from the drill bit some of the plastic kicks off just take your scissors and clean it up don't cut yourself it's nice and clean on the inside to take your fitting it's gonna have two gaskets this is gonna slide in from the inside the gasket this is going to go on the outside with the gasket you clamp it screw that on nice and tight you don't need to go overkill with it but make sure it's snug what you're gonna do next it's a 7/32 drill bit take that go right above your spigot there drill two holes don't push too hard I don't want to start digging into the bucket the holes are just into this lip we're gonna put a zip tie to support the water level indicator speed it like this make sure to buy quality quality zip ties that walk another one get it newt take our 5/8 clear wine jam it on the barbed fitting pull it up to about there cut it then just snug the zip tie up just enough so it's holding it don't want to put it too much too tight snip this there we go so that's the water level indicator can use that to also just check the pH put some into a cup out of the pot get the water next we're gonna drill a hole for the airline I like to put it right here from the side you can put it through the top of the neck cup but it's just going to get in the way when you're lifting it up lifting the plan out if you swap out nutrients so anywhere is good take your stone this one is a 1.4 by 1.7 quarter inch really doesn't matter which one you're using if you're using one of the flat ones or stone type make sure it's not super small feed enough bin so that the wine is touching the bottom of the bucket now put you're going on that cup on I'll throw some water in these things and attach the Punk and I'll be back [Music] hey guys so I got the water in it see the water level here it's a little high on that one and the clay pebbles are in top and they're air pumps running everything is looking good just double check for leaks once you have it all filled out [Applause] using tap water let the up there stone run for over 24 hours on that top water to dechlorinate it for you gesture pH levels and add your nutrients grow your plants in there but it's a easy deep water culture hydroponic system easy to set up they'll do just fine for a small operation for a beginner have fun", "D4ZsY3n6Pvk": "about freakin time watch out patience alright man aim this one focus v-cards official review what this video I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about this product we're gonna take some dabs with this product and we're gonna give our official review if at any point in time you enjoyed this video make sure you have this video the thumbs up and if you haven't scribed a custom drop for 20 already subscribe for my all right man here it is focus V Carta official review this video is gonna go into the outdoors videos playlists and this video is all for fun the focus V Carta we got this from way back to calm I'll put the link in the description the official review man let's do it talk to you a little bit about some things that I do like about this will talk to you about a couple things that I don't like about this will take some gams out of this bad boy and then we're gonna give our official review first things first let's talk about it man how we get outcomes on this bad boy things like puffed go pick man up there's like 379 or 399 the focus the Carta 250 dollars let's go man this is fair price I like the price on the focus be cards man what else you get with it man you get an oil slick you get a charger you get a dabber tool we have another one of those up there you get multiple buckets to get two quarts - titanium buckets you get some alcohol swabs and that's it it's all ready to go design man hits sleek fits right into a to-go cup portable size you know I'm talking about man uh let's see talk about one things I don't like about it man I do like the price here's one of these I don't like about it is the airflow but Wisla I wish it had bigger slits bigger holes for maximum airflow I wish that I could just hit you in a single and fill up superfast because the more air flow the more combustion and the better hit you can get you need the airflow to mix with it to get the better hit if you're just sucking through a little teeny strop you can only hit it so [ __ ] hard you know so that's one of the things I don't like about it it's talking about another things one thing I don't like why here's the only thing I don't like about it is the atomizer I couldn't figure it out I was literally taking the dabber and prying in here I could not unscrew it figure out because it says on to the right so I know that's how you screwed in the bad boy and that's what was confusing me it took me a long time to figure it out it's reversed thread so I didn't like that it's just my own personal thing that it was a reverse thread so you can pull that out take your titanium buckets out quick quartz buckets in and then instead of less the Lucy it's lefty tighty so lefty tighty righty loosey so I didn't really care much for that just because I'm a superstar and it was tough for me to figure out but that's it that's all that I don't like about this product plan atomizers are cheaper than the puffs go the puffs go peak you're gonna go on their site and pay $40 a piece for their atomizers that's [ __ ] ridiculous these are still high price these are $30 but still they beat the puff comb and I've actually had like the worst testimony from people friends I know I've had literally people who had puff Copic atomizer I know a friend who used one two times in a broke I have a different friend who used an atomizer five times in one broke and another friend you used one ten times the atomizers and the peaks go out so fast and they're high-priced it's ridiculous I've had so many people ask me over time do you like the puff go peak do you like the puff go peak and I always tell them hell no ridiculous so I'm super happy about this product this thing came out fired two of these bad boys mine to 50 a pop we got a bunch of extra atomizers let's laugh you know over the time because we're gonna go hard on this bad boy and see what's up with it for real but enough talking about it man let's take a frickin dad with it wait a minute we forgot one more thing that the camera comes when I'm talking about a man let's uh hit the action show you guys what's up first so how to operate startup is blinking you hit it five times one two three four five and that turns it on and then that cycles to the power one button at a time so this is low two is medium three of course medium high four is high and the temperatures are 500 on level one so right here it will heat up to 500 level to do 630 level 3 it will do 770 and level 4 it will do 842 degrees it looks like it heated up there to one of the green means go take a little dab of these diamonds are going right in and go for it I forgot to put water in it one two three four five so it's on hi there we'll go low medium medium i hi we'll put it on high hi there and now I was out cheating uphill take another dab some nice sea snakes diamonds put that right on in there let's go focus V Carta you can see it oh this thing is hidden off top that's bigger and better than any puff kopi kid I've ever had I just shut down there nothing hit hard ma'am so that yeah I got that one titanium in there that's what I like she could set it up any way you like quartz titanium interchange the atomizer will show you that real quick here pull that off pull the quartz out put the titanium in and let me tighten and that easy not one dad got me good man let's take another one here let's let's put the let's put the let's do the quartz let's do quartz dish we'll do this one a little bit lower temperature we'll see what's that man let's set this one let's set it instead of two max we'll set it to low we'll set it to low this time we'll try a low temperature down by does bad boy and see what's up man low temp more than C sneaks diamonds in there oh wait for that thing to say green means go green means go low tamp no water again Cheers I'm pretty sure it needs the water let's see what happens when we just crank this up now shut it off 12.5 back on 1 2 3 cycle back - hi there while that bad boy is heating up we put some water in this thing [Music] careful water in the damned I'm pissed he means go seems hitman titanium in quartz dishes on their unceasing they get me some ed stuff off the bat the brand-new ones when they get me so messed up let's break it down man price 250 atomizers 30 bucks killing puff Co peak portable stylish man I'm super glad that I got these man when it comes down to my official review the focus V Carta it's an excellent review I would recommend this to any stoner who likes that portable action everybody's been asking about the puffs those man I would tell them to fire on this thing this thing is way better bang for your buck way better you'll get your money's worth out of this way before you will out of the puff coke peak atomizers or beat it this thing it's better not even go [ __ ] I'm in [ __ ] let's do it one more time crank this bad boy up dawn hi let's load it up one more time big dime in there go breathe that in so you can see how big this thing it's way harder portable dab-dab purse on the market the focus me

FWSHOOOOOOO Hey it's Marvolo and welcome back to my channel\nfor another weekly smoke session. I've got Dewgong here with some ice, and I've\ngot a bowl of LSD, Lambs Breath and Sour Diesel, loaded up. And I'm going to take a hit to get this smoke\nsesh started. Ahhh. I really miss my old bowl. I wish I hadn't shattered it. I don't know if I had told you guys that,\nbut the bowl I used to use most often on my 18mm pieces uhm, it shattered. I think I actually showed you guys. Yeah. But anyways, I've been missing it. I haven't got a better replacement. And this bowl just kind of sucks. So I'm kind of at this weird place right now\nwhere I feel like it's been a long time since I've talked to you guys, but it really hasn't\nbeen, because...well the book review I will have just put up probably when this goes up. I haven't even edited it yet, but I'm kind\nof like, backlog posting. Ahfef. Okay, I'll explain it real quick. So I went out of town, down to California\nfor like 3 or 4 days. And I planned to get these videos edited and\nhopefully get them up either right before leaving, or right when I went home, but with\nthe ear stretching video, I ended up realizing I had more plugs, and I just got stressed\nout so I didn't edit anything. And yeah. It just got put off, and put off after I got\nback for a while. Because that was in February that I left. So yeah, I filmed that smoke sesh, that last\nsmoke sesh, was on Valentine's Day that it was filmed. And now it's, you know, the beginning of March. Or the second week of March now. So I was pretty far behind, and that feels\nlike quite a while ago. And now I have a friend coming to visit for\nabout a week while they are on Spring Break. Bow-chicka-wow-wow. Yeah, that kind of friend. I didn't smoke weed the whole time I was in\nCalifornia. I also didn't vape the whole time I was in\nCalifornia. So when I got back, my tolerance was really\nlow, and I expected to film a smoke sesh a lot sooner, and have that low tolerance, but,\nyou know, it's been almost three weeks now, so I have been smoking. But up until today, I'd only been smoking...I\nmean I...yeah I'd only been smoking out of a bubbler. Yeah, that's it. I was going to say a blunt, but I'm like no,\nthat was a video I edited.. I smoked that before I left. Also an interesting thing. I guess it's more depressing than interesting. Before...after...So between making that video\nand leaving for California, which like, there were only like three days between that, I\nthink. Uh, we put my dog down as well. So within a week period, I lost my childhood\ncat and my childhood dog. He was 17. He was very old, and he was in a lot of pain\nand suffering. But oh my god, he, you know, stubborn every\nsecond of his life. Till the very end. Before they put an animal down, they usually\nsedate them first, and then they basically overdose the animal. And we had the vet come to our house to put\nour dog down. It took about 2 hours, because they gave him\nenough, more than enough, sedative to tranquilize a horse and he was still standing there fighting\nit. And even then, like, when they were trying\nto get a vein for his IV, I had to hold a flashlight, because he was just so dehydrated\nand his veins were just fucked. But he was still growling and protesting the\nwhole damn time. He was just so stubborn, and I mean, he was\nin a lot of pain, so he was more grumpy probably than usual, but he was a good dog. Dundee was a good stinky old man dog. And yeah we had a lot of really good memories\nwith him, and it's sad that he's gone, but good that he's not suffering. It just kind of sucked. I got on a train, rode a train for about 13\nhours. Just a couple hours after putting my dog down. So that was...that was strange. And there are a lot of people I would like\nto visit in California, but this trip, I went to Northern California. Maybe in the future, I'll make a trip down\nto Southern Cali and get to see some of my friends that are down there. Maybe not. I don't know. I don't really like the heat. As far as my health goes, I've still been\nhaving bleeding, but it's lessening. Oh, I had the worst vomiting experience today. One of the most disgusting tasting vomits\never. Because that's what you guys want to hear\nabout, right? My vomit. Anyway this vomit was so gross that I drank\nwater afterward, and it tasted sweet. I drank it straight out of the tap, and it\ntasted like there was sugar in the water. That's how bad my vomit had tasted. That was the start to my day today. Disgusting vomit. And then I went right back to bed. The one bad thing when I was down in California\nis that after I got home, I had a UTI. And that sucks. It's a Urinary Tract Infection. And I used to get Urinary Tract Infections\npretty often, and bladder infections. A couple times, it lead to kidney infections,\nand it's because for me at least, and it's different from person to person, but for me\nit's because I will sometimes, especially when I'm anxious, or nervous, in a new place,\nor around people that I don't necessarily fully trust, just uncomfortable spaces. I don't feel comfortable going to the bathroom. And so I learn to hold my bladder, sometimes\nfor like over 24 hours, I think that's the time I got a kidney infection. I held my bladder for over 24 hours. Yeah. I wasn't too surprised about that, but supposedly\nthat's some sort of relation into OCD for me. I have been told. I'm not sure. It's just a thing that I....I don't know. I don't know why I do it. I don't know why I do the things I do. Cheers to that. I don't know if you guys have really seen\nthis torch, because I don't know if I've filmed with it. I used to have a really shitty one I think\nthe last time I did dabs, but this thing is fucking amazing. I feel like I could probably do welding with\nit, but it's even got a safety on it. Oh fancy fancy. Press the button, and then there's a lock\nbutton so you don't have to keep holding it, and then there's Fwchooooo. Fwchooooooo. Fwchooo. Fwchoooo. I really like fire. Until recently, it has been dead. It has been dead because I decided that I\nwanted to try to clean my dab attachment. And I got a bunch of oil out of it that I\nwas going to use, but I never did. It was kind of gross. I used all of my butane getting the oil onto\npaper and out of the rig. But I did go get butane, and you know there\nwas only like one option at the little tiny store I went to. And the brand name, I just had an issue with. It makes me laugh. And one of my friends pointed out, you know,\nnatural selection. Population on this planet is pretty high,\nso...But look at that. How misleading will this be to some dumb teenager,\nor just dumb...I mean people of any ages. Anyone that's dumb enough to do whip-its. Not that whip-its are the dumbest thing that\nyou could do, but it's still stupid. And it does say whip-it butane, but if you're\nnot that smart, you might be like hah, I didn't know whip-its were butane hah. That's cool. I'm just worried that this is going to kill\npeople. Whip-it brand butane. And if you didn't understand any of that,\nthen that's probably good. It means that you've stayed out of idiotic\nsocial scenes, more than likely. Or you just haven't been on the internet in\nthe right places. Cause you can learn about just about anything\non here. Okay. Oooh. Dead bowl. Dead bowl. I am going to load a second bowl. I have to renew my card soon. That is going to suck. It's expensive. I would like for one of my other doctors to\njust sign off on my forms, but I'm too scared to do that, so I'll probably end up just scheduling\nthe appointment, like I usually do, and paying a ridiculous amount of money to get my card\nrenewed. And I'll keep doing that for a while, but\nI don't know. Eventually with how expensive the OMMP is,\nand most any medical marijuana programs, I think, I might switch to just using recreational,\nor trying to grow my own and seeing if I could just do that. Because it doesn't really make that much sense. Is my...my collar is all fucked up, isn't\nit? Uh, how embarrassing. Huhhh. I get a really good deal on what I pay on\nmy cannabis, but the fees I have to pay annually kind of suck, and without Cat I don't have\nanyone to like...kind of share the costs with me, because Cat was my caregiver and everything. I mean that's just going to suck for me but\nI'm gonna do it. I don't know if you noticed, but Dewgong is\na lot cleaner than usual. I cleaned it today. If you check out the tree, it's still dirty,\nand I have no idea...It might just take a lot of patience to get that, but I don't know. I just have never been able to get that middle\nthere part of my....I don't know, this part right around here on my tree, I don't know,\nit just never goes clean. So if you have any tips for cleaning tree\npercs, that'd be really cool. I know I've talked about this before, but\nwhat I use to clean my pieces is just isopropyl alcohol and sea salt. And, you know, the higher percentage of alcohol,\nthe better. Usually about 90% isopropyl alcohol is ideal,\nbut right now I have 70%. I still got it pretty clean. I used a fuck ton of sea salt though. Another cool thing, ahhh, If I can open it. Yeah. A friend of my mom's gave me two grams of\ndab. So I think I'm going to do some dabs in my\nnext session. I do have a little bit of a problem though. I really don't know which of my pieces is\ngoing to be good for taking a dab. In most of my videos, in fact in all of the\nvideos where I took dabs on my channel, I was taking it out of one of Cat's pieces. It was Mr. Mime. So I'm not really sure which one of my pieces\nis going to work. I can rule out Missingno and Cthulu, because\nthey're just a little too big. But I think in my next video, that's what\nI'm probably going to do. Is try to figure out which of my pieces work\nbest for dabs. Until I get an actual dab rig. But for now, it is what it is. Oh! I've got people that have asked me questions\nabout like hair and makeup and doing tutorials for different hair and makeup I've had. And I could try, but the fact is, most of\nthe time I'm just going off the top of my head and improvising. So the chances of me recreating something...I\ndon't know that they are very high. I know that I'm very high. Alright, this bowl is just about dead, so\nthat's going to be it for this video. I'm sorry if it's a little bit shorter. Maybe it isn't. I guess we'll see when I edit it.

review calm and today I have the Pulsar barbed fire wax atomizer this is a standalone attachment it's not associated with pulsars apx lines such as their a px wax this is intended for use with a mod style compatible battery something that has wattage control on it the barb fire comes in this little box here with the cart community barbed wire on it something you'd find on a frat guys arm probably in the box you're going to find the attachment it is 510 threaded so go on most batteries and you're going to find a dab tool for putting your concentrates on the atomizer the Pulsar barb fire has a dual Kanthal twisted ribbon with quartz coil atomizer that's a lot of stuff being said what does it mean it's the same sort of material that atomizers for general like ejuice mod vaporizers are made out of it's supposed to be high quality and the life expectancy on that type of coil is supposed to last longer or so they claim it as an adjustable airflow so no matter what sort of concentrate you want to vaporize be it more viscous waxy or a little bit on the thinner side the barb fire should be able to be compatible with that what kind of battery are you going to want to use the barb fire attachment on it's going to be a mod style compatible battery something with wattage regulation this operates from 15 to 25 watts so ideally you'd be in there I'm going to use the source volt battery the 40 watt one the same style that comes with the orb for signature kit I have an a px wax but when trying to use the battery that that includes I found that it was giving me some problems and just didn't really have the juice to do it so I would not recommend using the a px wax battery with the Pulsar barb fire attachment definitely get something with wads regulation they give clean of flash vaporization so I'm guessing that means instant generally flash is pretty quick my wax is kind of more of a crumble so I'm going to go with two air holes open and I have it set to 17 watts is what I'm going to be using on this so we are all set to go let's take a hit flash vaporization yeah I think that was pretty instant right there hitting it perhaps with the two air holes open definitely followers are pretty wide like board to it a lot of air flow coming through and close it up just a little bit and check it out with one air hole getting clouds from it it doesn't feel too hot on the lungs as I'm hitting it despite how instant that vapors come in through that's pretty rapid heat I'm going to go for it one more time here give a nice little pre heat not much left but honestly that first hit was kind of what did it you could see the large cloud off that first draw I kind of agree with it on the terms of instant vaporization right there that was rapid there really isn't anything like this that I've seen so far I've come across other attachments like the candy pens pearl or the MIG brain fog ER but those are made of ceramic this Kanthal dual ribbon whatever the heck they called it it produces some pretty fast clouds and some large ones at that so this is a unique attachment that I've come across I like the power that you get out of it the instant heat I do agree with the flash vaporization as they called it that stands up to it if what I don't like is if you don't already have a battery you're going to put down 4495 on the attachment and then have to go out and purchase a battery separately in order to make this work so if you happen to have a mod style compatible battery at home I would recommend picking up the Pulsar barbed fire it's great for anyone who likes that dab on the go sort of vibe if you can't always get to a rig it's nice to have one in your pocket and this is kind of what that is you know I like the value it's not too expensive under $50 so I would recommend it alright guys so if you have any questions or comments you can leave them down there in the comment section as always Cheers vape on", "L8i_DeVc2_o": "all right fam welcome back to another video in this one as y'all can tell we're bringing the freeze pipe xl out so we're gonna be reviewing the xl version if y'all didn't check the unboxing of this go check it out and this one we're just gonna be reviewing so we're going to be taking a couple ribs we're going to see how good it functions and yeah the top piece is in the freezer we're going to go get it and get this video started let's go all right fam we're back as y'all can see fresh out the freezer hopefully y'all can tell on the camera like it's pretty [ __ ] cold all right and in this one we're going to be packing up a few balls right now we're going to pack a few bowls and take a few ribs out of this i already smoked out of this as y'all can see the bowl is dirty because this is amazing bro i took a one gram dab out of this already on instagram took a hell of fat ribs this long is a beast it breaks down the smoke so much like it makes the head so much smoother that it's just like you know a game changer at this point it's just a freaking game changer fam freeze pipe bombs let's take the box out should we leave it up here let's put it down here look you already know what this is free spike bomb from that to the right right here all right so we're grinding up some bud from the homie guy indoors in our santa cruz shredder i already know the vibes i'm not sponsored by santa cruz maybe one day i like your boy you really look good all right so now as y'all know the bowl is very good and it's um it has a screen on it so the good thing about it is you won't dirty your bone always keep it nice and clean no dirtiness goes in like dirtiness will still go in but not no weed so you know it's gonna be easy to clean because as y'all can tell i keep mine brand new and i already used it like a [ __ ] fan and it's brand new brand new brand new brand new very easy to clean maybe i'll do a video on how to clean bonks i already have that video up so go check that one might affect maybe i'll redo it but all right so the bong is a 18 millimeter so it is a big monster that's why they call it xl because it's for beasts that's why we got it let's take a [ __ ] favorite by this the strain worth smoking i don't even remember what this is like it's from the homie guy indoors but i don't remember the name of this strange i think it's some old school like og looks pretty good it's pretty good smells fire too all right so let's get this [ __ ] going stuff down there get a lighter all right all right fam let's take a rip out of this cheers oh super cool probably super smooth you don't even feel it you don't even feel and i'm taking fat ribs and i'm telling you like you're not even coughing because of the because of the coldness as well but like this these downstairs right here these perks it just breaks down the smoke so much him like it makes it so much smoother so much smoother i'll do a close-up too of the of the function of this so y'all can tell this brings a clamp for the bowl as well but you know i wouldn't advise on using it because you want to clear it and you want to lift the bowl up so i took that clamp out but yeah bro this is super smooth super smooth i'm both done the bowl is done and you saw me cough what once and you know i cough you know i call when some good bunkers let me get the poker all right we got the poker ram see that's done see you keep all that dirtiness out of your bong that's [ __ ] amazing like you know it still got dirty as y'all can see right there it got a little bit dirty you see but it's nothing that you can clean real quick and it will not get clogged it will not get clogged that's one thing i can guarantee you this down stain right here will not get glowed if you change the bowl piece that's another story but like if you keep everything original bro are y'all hearing the wind leg i'm just gonna show you guys what the [ __ ] we're dealing with over here mess what the [ __ ] is this bro it's snowing look at this [ __ ] thunderstorm snowman and [ __ ] the trees are about to fall jesus christ back to this [ __ ] [Music] all right put it in frame again boom all right and now i'm going to take a dab too y'all never see me took a dab i think in this channel on instagram yourself but on this channel y'all y'all never really saw me take a dab so we're gonna take one i got my banger bro my banger is [ __ ] it's like maybe this is like you see that that like scratch on there like this blinger has is like two years or three years like i don't buy a new banger because why because i don't [ __ ] dab like that you know i barely do dab so and when i do dabs i got my i got my boost evo you know so like i've already do um electric hit than these ones because these ones just take so much time but for this video purposes we're going to take a dab out of this because this [ __ ] bro makes every hit so smooth it's amazing like i took a gram go on my instagram right here top smoker 420 and you're going to see oh graham no problemo no bro all right where's what the [ __ ] is my torch all right i'm gonna heat this up mmm the butane butane is out already on this [ __ ] i can already tell we're gonna fill this up with some team we're gonna be right back already fam we're back probably y'all can't tell but this is red hot so i'm just going to collect my dab right here we got some shatter from the homie guy indoors as well i need my carpet i'm touching with my hand because it's only going to be me smoking i really care so we got my carpet right there y'all can tell right there see i felt i've got that on focus yep all right now it's going to cool down a little bit i'm going to skip that [ __ ] that [ __ ] bro these eggs can suck sometimes let it cool down a bit more this is a nice size day of no cape it's a nice idea if you guys are dabbing like servants a friend of yours i wouldn't advise you to touch you with your hand but if it's for you who cares you know right there i'm just gonna drop it like this nah i might [ __ ] it up i might end up [ __ ] it up i'm just gonna drop it in there [ __ ] that i like my dave's not too cold but not too hot bro because i don't like to burn my lungs i hate to cough i hate to call food smoking your lungs it's the worst [ __ ] that this helps a lot but you got to take it at the right time as well if you're going to burn your your lungs is not smart [ __ ] that all right all right all right let's get in there cheers i guess huh let's get it big dabs big devs for me this is a big deal so [Music] oh grab that water how's it going he's [ __ ] crazy [Music] all right oh that was a good day well like i saw like it makes you cough at the end because it's a strong dam but while you're hitting it it's super smooth super smooth because i don't know it like it's the perks bro because it has so many perks that the smoke just breaks through and it becomes like i don't know weaker you know but even in devs like this [ __ ] is amazing you know the free spy bomb from the other one like i said fam where's the look this was the other one if you guys are like in question of getting this one or the exhale get the exhale bro like this i'm gonna do a like imagine uh this one versus this one type of video but get this one trust me way better hits way way stronger this one is pretty good too but this one is just a [ __ ] beast now let's get to those close-ups of the cinematic chats we're going to switch it to flower again and we're gonna take a couple ribs so y'all can see you know the cinematic shots of this not a couple but just like one nice one you know let's get it come on hey hey come on that [ __ ] is always nice you know especially with these perks you know those close-ups are just super nice and yeah fam um i hope y'all like this video if you guys like the freeze pipe go get yourself one my rating for this one it's a 10 10 out of 10 no problem 10 out of 10. doesn't clog it's good super smooth and it's a beast you know and it looks like it's beautiful you know everything everything and one more thing it's super thick it's not like thin glaze it's super nice glaze that that's why it's getting a tan bro and you see it's still frozen i don't know if y'all can see on the video but it's still [ __ ] frozen it's a beast it's a beast so yeah fam for me it gets a tan you already know go follow the homies on their instagram

highly effective ways to cultivate mushrooms indoors discreetly with minimal infrastructure and minimal cost in this video we'll take you through the full process of making a mono tub including cultivating and creating your own Master Grade spawn and optional upgrades for your mono tub to take your grow to the next level hey I'm Kevin I'm here with north spore and today we're gonna talk about mono tube cultivation which is a really simple at home cultivation method so how a lot of professional growers get their start and what we're gonna do is use a pasteurized manure substrate to grow oysters mushrooms today and you can grow a wide variety of mushrooms and different types of agaricus shaggy Mane's so on and so forth using this method and this substrate so let's go over some of the materials we're gonna need for this for monotube cultivation you're gonna start with a tub this is a clear 70 quart Sterilite container any similar plastic container will work we're gonna use black spray paint to spray paint the bottom half of this tub that'll keep your substrate dark if you use a dark one you're going to want to have a window or some sort of lighting system involved we're gonna use a two inch hole saw on a power drill we're gonna use this to drill holes into the side of the mono tub we're gonna stuff those holes with a polyfill we're going to secure that polyfill with duct tape we're gonna fill the mono tub with our bulk substrate in this case we're using boomer bags we're gonna have to spray bottles one with 70% isopropyl alcohol one with water we're gonna have our colonised bag of oyster mushroom grain spawn if you wanted to make your own grain spawn and we'll go into this more later you can purchase our sterilized grain bags with injection ports in that way you can inject your liquid culture whether it's spores or mycelial culture directly into the grain to make it grain spawn and of course you're gonna want rubber gloves and labels and a sharpie keep track of things and we're gonna case it all with coconut quarter all right so let's hop into our flow hood start the process of making our Green spawn with a four culture or liquid culture could be tissue could be sports so weird or fluid it's a hepa air filtered locally with positive pressure so it's gonna keep everything real clean when you unbox your green just make sure to check your bag for any rips or tears or holes there is anything like that let us know we'll take care of it for you spray your hands down with alcohol spray your forearms down with alcohol you want to just keep this place as sterile as possible you really can't use too much wipe your surfaces down wipe your hands down again and then we're gonna start sterilizing this bag by spring it was rubbing alcohol and getting some on our hands and kind of getting into little nooks and crannies again you can't be too sterile so just keep going if you're not sure so that's our injection port right there and that's where our liquid culture is gonna go so you want to take your liquid culture tilt it up and down a few times that's gonna disperse any spores or culture evenly throughout the liquid Brahe down a paper towel and wipe down your score syringe everything that you can this is all sterile technique so pay attention to the process here notice how we didn't touch the needle at all at any point and kept it into the packaging for as long as possible you're gonna want to flame sterilize the tip and now it's ready to go into the injection port clean it off before you put it in and then kind of angle it downward slightly that'll get your liquid culture into a moister area of the bag with a little more water in the grain and it's gonna spread a little faster that way these injection ports are self sealing so you don't have to worry about contamination coming in afterwards now you want to leave it and let it sit to start colonizing you get to a certain point you can take your bag and break it up break up all that mycelium and spread it around and disperse it more easily through your bag let it sit and let it slowly colonize now you're gonna get a more even colonization rate and the faster now we have our ready grain spawn it's all white it's cohesive it's kind of just like a brick it's ready to go so the first step is we're going to take our tub and we're going to spray paint it or spray paint the bottom half of it black and the reason why we do that is because though mushrooms are not photosynthetic they are photosensitive and so the light is gonna influence how they grow so if we didn't spray-paint this you'd have mushrooms fruiting down here they'd be fruiting on the bottom they'd be unharvested oh but they'd still be using your valuable substrate so we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna take this outside because we don't want to spray paint inside so we're outside of our facility we're in downtown Westbrook Maine right now so what we're gonna do is we're gonna start by using this tape to make some nice clean lines so we rent the paint from bleeding so now that its hub is tapes we're gonna start spray painting so make sure you give it a good shake we're ready to start [Music] [Music] so we just spray-painted our tote brought it back inside it's pretty dry now so we can start to remove the tape technically unnecessary but we're just hoping for a nice clean line and open that it looks good so I'm gonna start pulling this tape off right here sorry tub is painted the tape is off and we are ready for the next step which is drilling holes in the side so again we're using a two inch hole saw right here on a power drill and this part is one of the trickier parts it's really easy to crack the plastic so you need to have it going at a high speed without like any pressure on it you just want the teeth to do the work without any of your own pressure involved so we're gonna do two on each of these sides and one on each of these sides and we're doing this to allow air flow because we need ventilation because as the mushrooms start colonizing the substrate they're gonna be releasing carbon dioxide too much carbon dioxide is going to result in no fruiting or really deformed fruiting time to start drilling so again you're gonna be really really careful make sure your drill is in forward and not backwards [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so the edges they're a little rough so we're just going to trim these up as best we can with utility knife just to make it all a little more smooth just like that keep doing this to all the holes you just want to keep things looking good but also minimizes the space where there could be gaps for air that's not going through the polyfill come in so we got our holes drilled we cleaned them up now we're gonna put our polyfill in and this kind of axe is like a very simple air filter to help keep unwanted spores and whatnot out so we just stuff it in the hole you want a nice big handful like a big clump in there you can see it's kind of coming out that side too that's alright alright another one [Music] we've got our holes filled with the polyfill and now we're gonna tape around the edges of the polyfill and we do that primarily just to keep the polyfill from falling out unexpectedly come around the edge here kind of just doing a square if you look under the video you'll find some links for some of this stuff like the polyfill there's links for other resources too and we have a bunch of information on our website as well all right last little bit on this one doesn't look that pretty good thing the mushrooms don't care so your tubs all ready you're batting the polyfill is in the holes it's all covered up it's taped it looks secure so now comes one of the most important parts and that's sterilizing your container and that includes sterilizing the space that you're in and it includes sterilizing all of your materials that you're gonna attach from here on out if we weren't doing this video we'd probably be in a much smaller cleanroom this room is large it's really be really hard to clean and keep sterile but for the sake of making this video we're gonna make it work this is where everything can go wrong in this you've already put all this time into making your tub so let's make sure we do it right and how we do that is primarily with isopropyl alcohol plain old rubbing alcohol this is a 70% and I'm gonna put on gloves now this is the part where we want to be very clean and again if we were doing this at home our selves we would try to be in a much smaller room and a much cleaner room and if you had a room that you say wanted to vacuum to make cleaning that's great but if you're just vacuuming you're gonna spread a bunch of stuff in the air so you want to have some sort of ventilation system maybe like a HEPA filter there's varying degrees of low to high tech you can go with this a lot of people just really cleaning their bathroom and doing it in the bathroom and that works really well for a lot of reasons one because it's really small too because there's not a lot of porous surfaces in the bathroom three because it's easy to clean and keep clean let's just pretend we're in a bathroom right now isopropyl evaporates which is really convenient so I just like to spray everything down so we're gonna really get in there I'll hold this up for you kind of see we're just getting all in there these little crevices here you want to make sure those are all covered again that polyfill to spray in the bottom we're getting all in there we're smelling the rubbing alcohol we know it's there it's working so I usually like to just let this air dry as it evaporates it'll help disinfect everything around it I'll take the top of this spray that down just to be extra careful you can even do the outside of your container you might as well you're not gonna make anything too sterile ever you know we're on a tablecloth right now if you were doing this at home we'd want some sort of non-porous surface one that you can easily disinfect I would totally wipe this down too let's assume that we're just in a nice clean space right now so I'm gonna start doing my hands now going down my arms a bit really getting in there there spores on everything all of the time it's really easy to grow fungus you just want to make sure it's the fungus you want to grow now we're going to start putting our substrate into our tub we're gonna use three of these so we're gonna open up these boxes just one two best to keep these in the box for as long as you can helps keep unwanted stuff from getting on them some of these bags you might notice that they're a little firm a little like a brick and that's just normal from them condensing and being put in the Auto Club so what we're gonna do is in the bag break up the substrate it's much easier this way it's a lot less messy and you're gonna have hopefully no incidence of contamination by doing it this way whereas if you were doing it after the bag was open you'd be asking for trouble all right that one feels pretty good this one not quite as condensed looking good this one kind of in the middle so now we're gonna sterilize the outsides of these bags not being shy about the amount of isopropyl we use so our bags have been sprayed they're sterile spray the hands again make sure they're nice and clean we have our substrate ready to get put in let's take a look at our grain spawn so you can see here this is really nicely colonized this again is our oyster mushroom grain spawn as you saw earlier if you wanted to make your own grain spawn using the injection ports using some type of liquid culture you can definitely do that and that's what these are for but we're gonna be using this oyster mushroom spawn it's fully colonized you can tell because it it's all white and it looks great looks real happy and again with this super important that we spray it down but before we do that we want to break this up too and you want to break it up really as best as you can each one of these little pieces of grain is essentially a seed so the more broken up it is the more distributed in the substrate it's gonna be and the better rates of colonization you're gonna have to be real gentle with your grain spawn you don't want to puncture the bag you just gotta love it a little bit so I'm gonna gently squeeze in the sides squeeze that I'll put it down kind of massaged the bag break up all that grain getting out all those clumps so there's our green spawn all broken up it looks a lot different all of a sudden we're gonna definitely spray the outside of this bag too very important this is our utility knife we're gonna spray the outside of this open up the blade get in there and now we're ready to cut open some bags slowly and carefully and gently remove the lid off of our tub and so we want to layer the grain and the substrate and the grain and the substrate and the reason why we want to do that instead of maybe just mixing it all the others because we're gonna minimize the air contact it has we're gonna minimize the contact with our hands that it has and hopefully by doing that minimize overall any sort of contamination that we might experience we're gonna only gonna open one bag of substrate at a time we're gonna try to do this as quickly and effectively and cleanly as possible I'll start by opening up the grain spawn so we're gonna add a real thin layer of grain spawn to the bottom of our top so I'm gonna sterilize my hands again real quick cuz we're gonna talk about something called field capacity of your substrate so when I look at this substrate in here I'm gonna want to take a handful I'm just gonna want to squeeze it as hard as I can I should be able to get a drop or two of water out of there feeling a little bit coming between my fingers but not that much now we try to make everything as even as possible here but there's always gonna be variations in the relative moisture of your substrate this is a little dry so I'm going to take the water spritzer I'm just gonna do two three four maybe five or six sprays in there just add a little bit more moisture all right I'm gonna test it again give it another squeeze real hard a couple drops just like that perfect it's exactly what we wanted you don't want it to be too wet it's too wet there won't be enough oxygen and you'll grow a lovely batch of green mold I'm gonna spread this out very gently just to cover up kind of make a nice even layer on the bottom as best as I can you can kind of break up chunks but again you really want to minimize your contact and another layer of grain spawn on top of here you just want to maximize the surface area of the substrate in contact with the grain spawn off to the side for the moment and we'll sterilize that again for sure we're doing a nice layer in here spreading it out just a little bit all right we're gonna do our second bag of substrate now and again we're using three in this particular example and we're just gonna gently sprinkle this back on top adding that second layer of substrate so right now we have a layer of grain spawn on the bottom a layer of substrate a layer of grain spawn and now the second layer of substrate again spritz the hands real quick gently spread this around just covering it all back up do a quick check of the field capacity because it's a different bag give it a squeeze oh that one feels perfect so we're gonna just keep going with that one and now we can add our next layer of Spawn and the thing with grain spawn is once you open it unless you're in a really sterile space and you can really reseal it properly you're just gonna want to use all of it at once we're going to save this a little bit to throw on top quick sterilization of this bag again quick sterilization of the knife again come through opening up this third and final bag of substrate quick check feeling water maybe a little dry but not too bad just a few just to moisten the top up there now we haven't really been mixing the other layers but for the top we're gonna just gently mix it in just kind of get that grain spawn a little more in contact with the substrate minimize its contact with the air where it's not gonna be able to grow so we're just kind of gently gently going in here so all of our spawn is mixed in all of our substrate is in here everything's looking real good one final step I want to do is just spray down the edges the tops again with some alcohol all right so now we're gonna take our lid which I had off to the side I'm gonna spray it down again we're gonna take this lid we're gonna put it right back on the top and we're gonna close it shut one thing you're gonna be looking at here is a certain amount of humidity that's gonna come up and condense on the top that's gonna be a good indicator of the health of the colony and how your mushrooms are doing so you want to see some condensation inside of here that's how you know it's gonna be at the right moisture level you're also gonna really really really want to take this lid off like five times a day it's really important that used don't do that every time you open the lid you're introducing new contaminants new spores all sorts of stuff and you're altering the humidity as well so really the best way to do it is to try to peek in through the top or peek in through the sides doing your best to just or really not open it even though it's really exciting at this point we basically just wait it's been a couple weeks our tub is nicely colonized we even have some little baby pins on there already so it's time to start casing our substrate and I mentioned before we're gonna use this Coco car this is just the variety we use it's wash loose it's really easy to work with one of the great reasons to use it largely it just keeps moisture in the substrate that's colonized and it helps keep an ambient moisture higher for the fruiting mushroom so they don't dry out and stop growing there's some other reasons other types of mushrooms and tubs will enjoy a casing as well so as we're looking at our tub two weeks later we can see it's just a really nice white mat of mycelium here you can see how it's kind of hold the substrate away from the edges it's really just one brick right now it's fully colonized and you can start to see these little pins starting to form now so these are kind of conglomerates of mycelium that are gonna form the fruiting bodies which we ultimately harvest if you look over here you can see this exudate this is a sign of healthy metabolism inside the mycelium and you can also see how it's kind of hydrophobic that water right there that exudate it's not sinking in it's being held above it and so that is one of the other indicators for having a nice healthy culture and you can see by looking at this it's hydrophobic it's fully colonized this is going to be really good at resisting any type of contamination at this point in the process we're gonna put about one to two inches on top of here there's some small clumps there that's alright it's nothing serious just kind of gently putting it on now we're gonna smooth it out it's kind of a bigger chunk I'll break this up a bit so now we're just gonna smooth it out covering the substrate nice and gentle getting into the corners letting it fill in wherever it is you don't really want to see any mycelium at all at this point we've got a nice even layer of our casing the cocoa quar and now the next step is to just hydrate it and we're gonna use this spray bottle and you just it takes a little while you just keep going the idea is to saturate the casing to the point that its moist enough for the mycelium to break through and also that it maintains enough moisture for the mushrooms and mature mushrooms that we're trying to grow here I like to use a spray bottle because instead of just pouring water on top of it you're getting a nice even concentration across the surface that's gonna sink in if you just sprinkle water on it you might have parts where it just drips through the casing right into the mycelium and that's not ideal so this is a good way to do it so our casing is properly hydrated we spritzed it enough so now the time comes to put the lid back on top of it and leave it a little bit cracked the mushrooms themselves what we harvest they like to have a little bit more airflow a little bit more oxygen a little bit lower carbon dioxide so keeping the lid crack is gonna help us do that and we just want to make sure we spritz it once or twice a day just kind of maintain that humidity level in the casing and that's it keep an eye on it see how it's going and then you wait until you harvest so this is a really basic mono tub it's about as basic as it gets and that's why it's so good if you are interested we're gonna show you how to pimp your tub a little bit make it a little more exciting a little more automated we can have lights in here we can have humidity regulation we can do all of this stuff pretty easily and we'll show you how to do that too it's been a couple weeks since we cased our substrate you can see we've got some really nice mature oyster mushrooms in here pretty good flush for us to harvest it looks like they're a little bit past their prime a tiny bit the caps are kind of folding in they're still edible they're still perfectly good to eat so we've got a few tools with us we've got the harvest bin what ira freshly harvested clean mushrooms in two very important and then this opinel mushroom knife which is a really great night for a while foraging for mushroom cultivation whatever you're doing it's got a lock and you just twist it like that open it up lock it back up it's nice curved hook there and we've got this little boar hairbrush to brush off any dirt that might be on them so we're gonna pick these mushrooms by hand and we're gonna trim them with a knife you can see we've got some substrate some of the casing on here so we're just gonna kind of you know brush off what we can seeing this not really a marketable part we'll just cut that right off we'll put this in our harvest bin still got a little more on here this brush does a really good job of getting this stuff off so when you're pulling up the mushrooms it's kind of a firm but gentle force you'll feel them lift up the trick is to have it lift up from the base and not kind of break any of your stems on the mushrooms it's not what you want to do so we're going to take this just cut this bottom off like that perfect there you go so you may have noticed we're in a different spot right now we're in the front of the north's for fruiting rooms here this is our production facility this is where we grow clean do all those fun things with the mushrooms not upstairs today so if you were to for example want to dry your mushrooms immediately after harvesting there are a lot of good options for doing that there are several really good dehydrators out there you can get excalibur makes a really really high-quality dehydrator it's really customizable you can get a screen with a fan on it that works really well you could always use an oven on the lowest possible setting and just keep an eye on them kind of shake them around a bit so essentially we want our dried mushrooms to have the consistency of a cracker you want to be able to break it and have it be a nice clean break if it's too wet it's gonna be a little bendy if you have it too wet and you store it it's a really good way to grow mold obviously that's not something we want to do pull it out of the dehydrator or however you're dehydrating it try not to leave it out for too long because it can reabsorb atmospheric moisture alright so this is our first flush our first harvest this one took about four weeks from start to finish if you just keep taking care of your tub it'll continue producing flushes of mushrooms sometimes for a few months each progressive one after this is good be a little bit smaller and take a little bit longer the tub is really done when you decide that it's done when it's no longer worth your effort to maintain it keep it humid etc etc then you can dump it out start outdoor beds use them as a base for compost there's all sorts of really wonderful options that spend mushroom substrate has to offer we're excited to cook up some of these oyster mushrooms for dinner tonight if you stick around we're going to show you some of the optional upgrades you can give to your tub looking at these mushrooms they're a bit conical they're a bit tubular the caps aren't as open and wide as we would like for an oyster mushroom and that's indicative most likely of higher than maybe desired carbon dioxide levels in here and the carbon dioxide is a natural effect of mushroom respiration adding an airflow system which will show you how to do and a lighting system could really have made these a little better and we'll get into that in the next part of this video if you like this video be sure to give us a follow we've got more coming for you check out our Instagram at North spore mushrooms and be sure to check out our website which is north spore comm we've got a bunch of good content on there we got blog post we got pictures we've got a great store all sorts of good stuff for you to check out so we're back upstairs we've got this freshly cleaned out and we're gonna start doing some modification so you can really dial in your growth so there's four things we're gonna consider and we're talking about mushroom cultivation temperature humidity carbon dioxide and light temperature we're indoors we're not gonna really worry about that too much if you wanted to alter your temperature say it was a little too cold where you're growing a seed germination mat works really well you just throw that right underneath here humidity we want to make about an 80 to 90 percent humidity to ensure good mushroom pinning and growth and we're gonna do that with a reptile or terrarium tank fogger and for carbon dioxide we're not gonna just rely on these we're gonna actually add a small computer fan and that's gonna just purge the air and bring in fresh oxygen for light we're gonna add an LED strip onto the top it's a dimmable one it's really nice light isn't overly important but it helps ensure good growth and color on your mushrooms we're gonna start off with our air exchange system and this is how we're gonna regulate carbon dioxide in here so what we're gonna use for that is this really simple computer fan this one's great because it has a direct AC plug which is gonna make this really simple here's a vent cover for the back of the fan this is gonna be helpful to keep bugs and whatever from flying into our tub this is mounting hardware for it this is a cycle timer your fans gonna plug in right there and then this plugs into the wall and as you adjust these knobs it's gonna tell the fan when to turn on and how long and when to turn off and for how long if you want to you can use a carbon dioxide meter like we have here this is where the management kind of comes into play so you can take this and you can read your carbon dioxide levels in your tank and dial it in that way to your perfect conditions or you could just use trial and error based on how the mushrooms look and dial it in just by looking at it and then we have our drill with a four inch hole saw we're gonna use to drill a hole right here and mount our fan now I know I mentioned this earlier but because we're working with a hard rigid plastic you're gonna want to go really slow with this and not put a lot of pressure on it if you put pressure on it you're probably gonna crack your tub [Applause] [Music] [Music] the whole saw is a little bit bigger than that fan so we're gonna use some tape to just square it out [Music] we want to be pushing fresh air into this tub so that means we're gonna flip it around like this then we're gonna mount it on here like that put this on here is this gonna be pulling air in through here so we want to have this on prevent random things from flowing in there and messing up our fans rubber washers and some nuts so our fan is all hooked up it's mounted and now it's plugged into this cycle timer we'll plug this cycle timer right in so this top one here is gonna tell you how long in seconds or minutes the fan is gonna be on and the bottom one will tell you how long it stays off so we'll move this to on for say 50 seconds right about there and we'll have it turn off for just five or so seconds for this example and these are all gonna change depending on your needs which you'll have to dial in as you make your system so now it's on I can feel that it's on right here I'm feeling this fresh air coming in to the tub I can turn it down a little bit to so it just turned off right around thirty seconds so now it's gonna stay off for five or so seconds there it is back on just like that so obviously all of this is adjustable you could have it turn off for twenty minutes you could have a turn off for a whole hour or on for a whole hour it's up to you as you have the air going it's gonna have a tendency to dry out your mushrooms so you're gonna need to adjust the humidity in response to that so for that we have this reptile terrarium fogger it's got water in here and it's got this hose right here we're gonna put this hose into the tank and then to make it even better we have this humidity regulator so this has a probe right here we're gonna put this end of the probe into the tub this is gonna read our relative humidity inside the tub this plugs into the regulator and the reptile fogger is gonna get plugged right into here while this goes into the outlet so what this is gonna say is when it reaches a minimum humidity this is gonna turn on and when it reaches a maximum humidity this is gonna turn off well we're gonna start setting this up this part's really easy we're just gonna put this tube from the fogger kind of just through the polyfill on the side here you know take a look make sure it's not full of polyfill you can kind of stuff it back around that looks great it's inside so now we can take our fogger we can plug it into our humidity control and then we can plug our humidity controller into a power supply all right let's turn the fogger on so it knows to run so now we're gonna adjust this our relative humidity is 35% inside there right now to dry for mushrooms and I have the upper limit here by holding it down set to 90 the lower limit set to 75 so it's supposed to run between 90 anything above 90 percent humidity it's gonna turn off anything below 75% humidity it's good at so the third and final part to this today is the LED light strip our light control so mushrooms really don't need anything more than ambient light they're not photosynthetic but having enough light is going to help them grow in the right direction and it's gonna help make sure they develop colors and aren't translucent and white and albino this is a really simple little LED light bar it's got a little button here that turns on and off and it's dimmable which is a really nice feature now it's on and I can adjust the brightness by holding it down and then letting go and touching it again getting dimmer again mushrooms don't really need that much light this is a nice setup especially if you're doing this in a darker place where there is an ambient light so in a room like this we don't really need this but if you were doing this in a closet or a basement that was really dark or under your bed this can be a really good feature and you can attach it to a timer so it turns on and off whenever you want whether that's to match natural daylight cycles or to keep it as discrete as possible the choice is really yours and we're just going to attach this to our lid with these little sticky pads that are going to attach these metal disks that are attached to magnets let's mount our LED bar onto our lid there's our lid just do this so we have these little sticky double-sided things that we're gonna put on here to help attach it to our lid just like that [Music] just stick it right on put some pressure under here keep it firm turn it on and there is our really cool really high-tech motto job [Music]", "eMsDRA_JciM": "what's up guys today we're taking a look at this 14 inch straight tube water pipe it has a forearm ash catcher percolator and it kind of works as both um so i took this home for a few days smoked a good amount of balls out of it i promise you that um and i really really like this piece right here it's pretty thick it's got a thick base on it so if you knock it around it's probably not going to crack or break too much the rest of it as it goes up is pretty thick itself up to this mouthpiece which i find really cool because it's kind of tapered compared to the rest of it um so you ain't got to worry about if you're getting a good suction on it you know it's smaller than the rest of it um the only thing i don't like is this little graphic right here it says hipster unless you're into that then you know you know this right here this percolator gives a lot of good diffusion um so when you hit it it's not hot you're not gonna choke too much or anything um so i guess let me go ahead and hit it for y'all um thanks to the uns stocker for this lighter right here i didn't have one so i had to go find one so like i said you could tell that was a pretty big hit and that thing was smooth i really really really like this um so if i had to write it i would give it a 9 out of 10. only reason i take that one off is because of this little graphic i'm not into that but um other than that it's a really really great piece um if you if you're interested in it links in the description below please like comment and subscribe and remember guys to stay lifted", "-QRTMHYLZEY": "all right hello I'm salt and I am privileged and honored to get to participate in this livestream thing that the Corning Museum of Glass is doing so I'm going to demonstrate some pipe technique really excited to get to share some of the pipe culture with the overall glass community so you know pull up a chair get some popcorn and I'll try to explain a little bit about what I'm doing so today I used some Paramore peach and I did an application over clear as my base and I'm also going to incorporate some alchemy potion nice new CFL activated color and I'm also going to incorporate some the original gun mounts made here at Corning many many years ago for television sets so and the spirit of kind of marrying the past and the future together I'm gonna use these all these different colors on one piece and I don't know hope you guys enjoy so all right so traditionally to make a pipe bubble in other words to get the smoke from an elevated position down into the bottom of the water chamber scientific technique was adapted in order to do something called a down stem there's other things like butt seals and ring seals also adapted from scientific glassblowing in order to create the functionality at least traditionally and so what I'm demonstrating right now is called Rip Curl and it's a version of what I as a salt perk which stands for sculpturally applied linear tube or tunnel and so this is my adaptation of an organic and sculptural approach to making something function and I feel like it's probably the one of the most innovative things that I have to offer and that's why I chose to show this for the live stream so I'm carving in some negative space here into the wall of my water chamber okay now I'm satisfied with the depth and the definition I'm gonna use the tungsten pick to get some holes in it I banged it on the table just in case there's any little flecks of glass in there I don't want them sticking arbitrarily to the inside of my bong that I'm making here all right now I'm gonna make the rest of the downstem by covering up part of this channel with some of this potion minor adjustments here houses nice classes quiet right now nobody's saying anything all right I got it all melted smooth can I show you guys a little closer what's going on here okay so the smoke will enter up here travel down this tube and tap into the bottom of my vessel here apparently you might notice I just popped a big hole on the side of this thing and I'm gonna try to do something interesting with it and all right so now I have a window of potion that lets you view into the bubble chamber of this bong I'm making in the pipe culture the ability to see what's going on inside is highly valued so that's why I've innovated this technique we actually hand me that rod of the peach stick it out of the kiln it's on the right there thank you so with this paramore peach color I find that it along with a lot of the paramour colors they work better for me if I mix them up a little bit so I'm just going to prepare a little section of that mixed up color that I'll use to do some eyelids and other details on the piece that's what I'm doing right now Phyllis [Applause] alright so I just added what's called a bridge for this piece of clear excuse me this piece of clear glass adds structure to what I'm working on but will not be part of the finished piece it's just there so that I can be more aggressive and get the glass hotter without it losing its shape yeah there was a bubble and I popped it and now I'm melting it out okay now I got a lid on my bottom window there I call that a soul window because it's you know the eyes being the window to the soul and this allows you to see inside to the functional part of my Rip Curl and on this side I got one of my traditional salt eyes also lid it up yeah where's my new tool at there it is yeah shout out to Scott Griffin my TA and maker of Griffin tools for hooking up this special tool real time for me yeah yeah we like we talked about it yesterday and he already had it made but this morning so you're gonna plug your website real quick yeah yeah we'll talk about my fee later on all right cool all right watch out behind me it's all in the wrist y'all behind me is the little wick tool the is it out back there no right here I planar with the paper towel on it here's the trick for the internet pipe cleaner with the paper towel to get the condensation out of my tube Thanks hmm like that the spot I really don't like right here so I'm just gonna take it out go are we doing on time it's noon right now I keep going the camera guy says I can keep going so I'm gonna keep going for you guys looks like I got it too hot it's kind of bent over so I'm going to cut my bridge or I'm gonna attempt anyway to cut my bridge and straighten it I'm working very very aggressively right now in order to try to finish this thing in time for you guys so sometimes that causes unforeseen issues like this one this is closed set I'm scared shoutout to Krista the tech who's been helping me the whole time I was here all right can you want y'all lop the end of that off so it's open for me no it's okay it's fine as is thank you so I choose this imagery of eyes and teeth sometimes claws and armor for my pieces because the salt pipe grew up in an environment where pipes were not sometimes not seen as art because they were functional or just because of the stigma attached to the pipe and also not seen as legal at times and so I make a pipe that's both camouflaged in order to protect itself protect its end-user and I use this imagery of the defense mechanisms featured and animals and insects in order to kind of give my pieces the tools they need to defend themselves in these harsher environments and at the same time the salt pipe is meant to be treated like a living thing you know if you take care of it it'll take care of you and so I like to think about the symbiotic relationship between the owner and the piece and how these people the vast network of people that everyday use their salt piece and have a positive experience maybe have like a perspective change and those ideas are really exciting and satisfying to me and so this is why I do the things that I do will you run the condensation tool through that please thank you it's alright if it's not gonna work I'll just take it okay so this is how it goes sometimes because of how quickly and aggressively I've been working in order to try to finish there were times whenever I would have normally reheated this thing in the kiln and as a result I've got a crack but I'm gonna take this opportunity to show you guys how I would fix this so first I'm stabilizing the crack with an annealing flame so it doesn't spread and I'm getting everything that I can see on the surface fully molten and then I'm gonna look through this clear bottom to see on the inside if there's any more crack but actually I do see a little bit and so the fastest way to fix that is like this that's not the fire alarm is it I hate to have to finish this thing with the building burning down around me okay again I'm stabilizing and I'm gonna go inside and hit the back side of the crack which usually will make it just immediately disappear and it did I got lucky because it wasn't a bad one it was literally just as a result of kind of pushing things a little too far in order to try to finish and now I'm kind of using my mini torch like a flashlight because it will it will light anything up that's damaged and let me know students do you guys remember when I was talking about these pressed glass colors wanting to separate and crack on the surface that's what I was talking about it it makes like it's it's a crack that if you don't deal with it it can be really bad but if you if you get on it immediately they like kind of go away on their own yeah on this one I had two different spots on one the clear was cracked and that's why I went inside and what happened was I was just too aggressive with some of this texturing and on the other part over here I had a light surface crack go through some of this texture that was on the outside but it didn't go through to the clear and so now you can see I'm just kind of paddling back and forth over it and kind of burnishing it back into place and then I'm gonna redo my car blinds alright I'm just gonna close this up and let it sit for a second I probably do it's pretty bad so some of that texture that I put on there that caused the problem is actually one of the things that I always incorporated in my pieces because pipe art is experienced in a different way than most traditional forms of art in that you're supposed to touch it and not just touch it but you you share it you hand it to other people and you have these social experiences with it so knowing that I try to take advantage of those opportunities and add textures for the end user to interact with while they're smoking out of their salt pipe and some of those textures are meant to bring you into the moment you know some sharper points you know that are there to remind you that you're holding a piece of glass and just also to be present and enjoy like what's happening right now whereas other textures are meant to be more relaxing like a worry stone or you know one of those little squeeze balls and while others are meant to be kind of meditative so if you're thinking some deep thoughts about something you can kind of pet your salt pipe and it will relax you and help you think in theory [Music] you [Music]", "WcKP_LIQ-RU": "what's going on everybody it's your boy the low key legend how the [ __ ] we feeling today y'all feeling all right man welcome your faces back to a brand new video today we are going to be breaking down another unboxing video shout out to the company sponsored today's video they go by the name of inhale co okay the link will be right here also it will be in the description you guys should go check them out they have a ton of different variety of bongs accessories um any real stoner equipment that you really might need they have on this website i was just checking them out right now man uh blow torches grinders bongs bong attachments anything you guys might need for your collection maybe another addition to it go check them out my link will be in the description also i have a promo code and if you guys click that you'll get 10 off so be sure you would take advantage of that and yeah let's pretty much just dive right on into this shout out to inhale co like i said man uh link in the description and they sent me a little box that they wanted me to review so without further ado ladies gentlemen boys and girls let's dive right on into this so the first thing we have here is i do believe a grinder of theirs okay so they have i think three different grinders you can choose from on their website they have a rick and morty one they have a spongebob one and they have a mario one okay so this is what we have right here i'm not sure exactly which one it is i'm gonna go ahead and pop this open though and um take a peek oh baby oh this is crazy all right guys so we got the spongebob one all right and if i'm actually oh my god okay so i don't know if you guys know but uh i did a review on a grinder like this before and it's actually called the new style grinder it's on my uh it's on my channel already this feels exactly like it okay so i'm gonna go ahead and already tell you guys right now this is a very very durable grinder okay just the way it feels i could already tell you by holding it that this is a really really good grinder okay and you can see that it has the um you know the regular catcher and it also has the keef catcher down here as well and it comes with a little pick oh my god i've never seen a pic like this this is crazy i don't even know what this is bro i it's got to be you know something with the keith but it looks like uh like bristles bro that's crazy that's never i've never got that in a grinder and i can't wait to experiment with that and then they have the uh you know the little sifter right here for the uh for the keith but i could already tell you guys for a 100 fact that this is a very very well made grinder just because i have one already like this without the design on it okay so i'm like this that's crazy bro it literally feels the exact same and it's got this cool ass design on it too guys so we could we could uh take a quick look on that the stoner spongebob get with it come on quit playing and they have like i said they have a mario one as well so i'm guessing the mario one is the same thing half of it will be you know like a uh intoxicated mario or a uh the rick and morty one it's a half um you know half faced stone thing but dude this is crazy this is a really really cool grinder i could already i could just by the design and everything and the durability i'm not definitely go check them out i think they're on sale right now too guys so if you want to get your hands if you need a grinder a very durable cheap grinder this is this is the wave i'm telling you right now this so this will definitely get the job done it's not light you know it's a pretty hefty grinder it's very it seems very durable it seems like it's going to act the same way as my other grinder i have and i'm telling you that thing's a beast so i can already tell you guys that this thing right now is probably gonna function like a beast i'm also going to uh have a sesh video out in a couple days and once i grab some more we uh some more bud i'm going to grind this [ __ ] up and just double check with you guys in the next episode of sesh if this grinder does keep up which i'm sure it will um just by feeling it man you could you guys know how you could feel certain grinders and kind of know that they're you know about the action this is it bro this is not no light grinder this is not no cheap grinder this is very durable yeah next episode of sesh we're gonna actually try this out and uh you know just kind of verify that it is what it is so anyways man grinder if you guys need one i think they're less than 15 on the website three different ones you could choose from plus the 10 off you can get this grinder for probably 10 bucks and you can get different designs as well very very uh very good deal in my eyes i would say definitely um worth the cop so now we're gonna hop into the next package guys um on inhale coat and i do believe this is a blow torch okay so they have a couple different things on their website um including little electronic little dab rigs and things you can get your hands on they do have other torches but i do believe that this is their main torch this is gonna be the one that you're gonna want to get your hands on if you're going for dabbing and um you know a a refillable butane torch so shout out to inhale coat like i said man because it's crazy i really needed a new torch for like so long and then they they finally reached out to me and i was like oh my god it's a dream come true like i needed a torch and you know here it is so let's go ahead and unbox this man see how this is i'm actually going to heat up a dab in a sec as well using this torch uh because this is going to be the new daily the daily driver man we'll see if it uh it holds up as well i'm sure it'll do a lot better than my other torch so here's the packaging here we got guys butane torch um bs 850 i'm not sure about you know the specs and everything i'm just gonna go ahead and pop it open and see how it kind of runs so we got here all right so got the torch and oh hell no dude they gave me some stickers too that's crazy yo shout out that's that's awesome bro i'm gonna throw some of these up somewhere i'm sure that uh yeah that's a dope so i'm guessing this is the same thing with all the mari or with the grinders so this is my grinder right here as you guys can see and if you guys wanted the mario one that's how it look and if you wanted the rick and morty one that is also how it would look so that's pretty cool i'm gonna definitely find a cool spot for them real soon uh and now let's take a look at the torch here though guys so first look at it um it looks pretty cool it looks like we have a little ring right here a little space or a little stand for the actual torch gonna go ahead and pop that out and see what this does so i'm gonna go ahead and just kind of push this in here and you can kind of see it just kind of goes right in holy [ __ ] dude this is a torch bro i'm telling you okay so let's kind of uh experiment how it works here okay so i obviously was tweaking for a sec it looks like there's an actual cap on here so the first thing we're going to want to do obviously i didn't know this but we're going to want to remove the safety cap right here so that comes off and now here's the actual base design for the torch we have the butane nozzle right here we have the go ahead start fuse right here as well or the fuse which is actually you know the ignition thing right here i'm going to go ahead and fill this one up really quick guys and here is my other torch really quick kind of show you guys the difference uh of both of them so if we take a look here it's the same thing same kind of outline this thing though you could tell that this is broken right here this is coming undone and this is my daily driver torch so you can tell that this is almost broken right here this whole thing spins around like this should not be doing that you feel me that should not happen when i fill up my butane right here it leaks a lot which is not good you don't want to have leaky butane and yeah i mean you could already tell the difference between both of these you could you i mean i can easily i could tell that this one's gonna be so much better than this one so [ __ ] this torch this is the one i i had for a minute um i'm going to cancel this one though and go ahead and fill this with butane we're gonna see how this one goes once it's filled with some butane and uh heat ourselves up a dab yeah all right so i got my butane here and i'm gonna go ahead and attempt to fill it um and see if it leaks all right y'all so with that attempt it definitely uh i don't think it leaked too much i mean i don't know if uh you know the nozzle on this thing needs to be changed or whatever but uh i could tell you guaranteed that it doesn't squirt or doesn't doesn't leak as much as that other one used to um this is definitely a lot more obtainable especially it doesn't get on your hands as much because this whole [ __ ] base right here is like i think this thing saves it a lot this thing this whole little rubber thing so you put this on and it kind of god it's dude look at that like the last one i had it was like this big ass like plastic thing that you had to put the torch in and then it kind of just stood there this one super simple straight to the point just a nice little thing like on this one i don't even have it because it i think i lost it like it was so big and absurd that it's like why the [ __ ] would i even have that on my torch you feel me this is all you need right here just a little stopper to hold it up and to keep it in place and that's it like that's perfect dude it's bro shout out to inhale co i promise you dude like this is exactly what i needed and they came in clutch just like random as [ __ ] bro so i'm telling you right now man if you guys need a torch check their website out you guys can get yourself a brand new torch for a very very affordable price as well as a grinder and not even like no no dinky like no design grinder this this [ __ ] has designs on it and it's very very effective i can already tell you guys but um we're gonna go ahead and triple test that or double test that in another episode of sesh i'll probably be in our next video but yeah i'm telling you this is probably going to be my my daily grinder right here dude it seems like it's the exact durability the same material as my other one and that one is a tank so i could already tell you that this one is probably going to be a tank anyways man that is pretty much all i have for you guys in this episode of set uh [ __ ] sesh i said that's hilarious in this unboxing shout out to and hailco as i said man if you guys are looking to get yourself a new butane torch a new bong maybe some new bong accessories uh you know a nail maybe a carb cap a grinder you feel me um if you guys need any of that [ __ ] any accessories any stoner equipment be sure to check out hail co like i said link in the description on screen uh use the promo code or not promo code i should have a referral code in the description so check that out uh pretty sure if you just click it and go there you're automatically it's automatically a referral code so anyways man that's all i got for you guys in this one i'm gonna heat this dab up take this nice little fatty and we will i will see you guys in this next episode of sesh very very shortly within a couple days this is a super long unboxing video i don't i don't think it needed to be this long but i mean [ __ ] it dude whatever it is what it is love each and every one of you guys man y'all have a great rest of your day night evening well um y'all stay safe stay savage stay low-key is your boy to low-key legend i'm out of here guys [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] adios [Music] you", "arcDdONzgBk": "hello senior stoner fan just the real

situations people need to talk to people and i think they in most cases people think therapy is really only for very sick people it's not so what i want to talk about is the fact that therapy is much more than just sitting on a couch many many misconceptions are out there about what it means to talk to a mental health professional the need to talk about our emotions is not something to poke fun at or be told that you're weak or be shamed the stigma is a stigma from the past that really is gone so here's the reality about therapy therapy is an incredible tool very useful and it helps with a tremendous range of issues anywhere from anxiety to sleep issues relationships to trauma therapy is incredibly helpful with people managing mental health issues i'm going to try to convince you but i'm going to give you reasons why you should give the practice of therapy a try really it's because i've been so successful with it i have had so much therapy over the years and it's helped me a great deal i know there are tremendous amount of people out there hurting hopefully you'll be able to seek out and get help for yourselves too let's discuss some of the reasons why you might want to go talk to someone are you experiencing unexpected mood swings are you taking on more negativity than usual is it persistent maybe it's worth talking to somebody professional you know unfortunately it's typically a sign that something's wrong and a good therapist can get to the root of the cause you'll have an opportunity to open up about your feelings circumstances in a confidential environment what if you're undergoing a big change in life well you certainly need someone to talk to then this could be a career a family change moving to a new neighborhood a multitude of different things new ventures are challenging and it's normal to seek assistance with that think about it you can work with someone with a neutral perspective to identify goals help you peel back the situation and develop a plan to achieve them therapy often involves the development of skills and strategies that you may not have had you see today with tele telemedicine you can sit on your iphone and have a video chat with a therapist and work through many of your issues god forbid you're having harmful thoughts call 9-1-1 if you are they're completely preventable situations self-harm you need to be in front of a licensed professional please call a hotline if you have an issue like that what have you withdrawn from things what if you've withdrawn from things that used to bring you joy what if there's a loss of motivation you know what that's a signal if you were a social butterfly and suddenly you're pulling away from everything you could be experiencing something deeper a professional therapist is trained to help you uncover what might be occurring the truth is therapy can be very helpful for many people and often it helps individuals sustain positive good mental health what if you're feeling isolated or alone many people deal with this with loneliness with isolation especially now well guess what you're not alone and when you enter therapy you get an immediate sense of relief that you're not alone that problem is extremely well understood and shared by others and can bring a sense of true comfort and hope to both people involved if you have a severe substance abuse problem you need to talk to somebody professional think about it if you find yourself god forbid an alcohol situation or a hard drug situation please there are tremendous breakthroughs in giving care to people suffering from these problems don't sit by the wayside and think there's no help out there for you you can be helped what if you think you have a serious mental condition i've gone through life many times thinking that well guess what you're not alone if you've been feeling off for a long time reach out whether you have an inkling that you're bipolar whether you think you have something else now is the time don't ignore the situation these things are treatable don't let it get out of hand so you become an uncomfortable person in your own skin what if you feel like you've lost control that's a common feeling with people either in substance abuse situations unemployment situations that lack of control keeps people in a circle they call it the circle the cycle of addiction and unfortunately it's not just addiction to to drugs or to alcohol is addiction to bad behaviors so please if you've lost control poke your head up and let's talk to someone what if your relationships feel strained well you know what relationships no matter what type are very hard work we're not expected to have all the answers so if you're with a partner therapy can help both of you have better ways to communicate couples therapy you see even if one partner is hesitant it's still an important thing to think about because a therapist a good therapist can help you pinpoint how to help your partner interpret a misunderstanding think about it what if you've been going through life and everything you've been saying has been twisted just a little bit to left by your partner maybe you can have somebody help that impression be straightened the key thing for everybody to remember here is that therapy is good don't fear it there's no stigma anymore what if you don't sleep right go to the therapist what if you just need to talk to somebody find a therapist and i am not an advertising agent for therapists but therapy is perfectly normal and valuable you know why because it's an experiential thing and it really works there's proof that therapy works well if you enjoy today's discussion about therapy please subscribe to my channel send me your comments i reply to every one of them thanks for watching

like that's cool what's up everybody welcome to another episode my name is Taylor some people don't know that because my initial I don't know I'm 26 BlueGlass mountain bike snowboard pretty average guy the glass consumes my life it has the past seven years got into it at Mesa Art Center about six years ago and then started working at chameleon for about a year there I really learned the fundamentals of glassblowing I prepped for them for six months and then after that they let me make pipes I did made pipes for about four or five months for them it was brutal 40 hours a week we just bust out hand pipes but uh I've made a lot I've made a lot a lot a lot of hand pipes so from that I I've got enough money to buy my own equipment had a place to do it and I've been doing my own thing the last five years pretty cool very beginning you took some classes at Mesa Arts yeah massage centers they offer entered introduction to flame working to spoil silicate which no pipes or anything just like pendants marbles dishes patterns things like that and from there I a friend of mine from high school told me that this pipe shop was hiring I was like well let me go check this out so I got wind it in for an interview and they hired me and I started the following week so the first time I ever saw a glassblowing was in a high school art class my teacher showed us Chihuly and I was hooked the moment I saw them with a molten piece of glass and like an inch thick of newspaper wet newspaper when I was like by forming with their hand I was like holy [ __ ] how do I do that like that's cool and it was nothing like she just kind of showed us this video for something that I don't even know the project was but I'm cold months later I finished I wanted projects earlier and sort of a friend of mine and she kind of took us aside and we made beads on a map gas torch in pots yeah in school we gotta said we liked it a little bit of bead making my torch and how it's just like this is cool it's just tie it like I like this but then I started asking about classes and where to do it and that's kind of how it all started yeah well that's the funny thing about it so I took about three months worth of classes but when I went in for the interview they asked me if I had blown glass before and I said yes and they kind of were discouraged because they like to teach people who have from a fresh start so you don't have to reteach any bad habits but I was still fresh enough and didn't have a my own feeling for it and was like kind of spun at the time of information just absorbing it all that they they're like well he doesn't have any bad habits that we can't correct so I showed them in my interview what I could do and they figured I'd be a good fit so yeah honestly it wasn't even prep but it was prep but it was only one task all I did was pull points I pulled points for like 40 hours a week right for six months yeah it sucked I hated doing it it was hot in that shop I had just kept doing the same thing over and over but I attribute the fact that I can spin glass well is because of like you know 10,000 hour rule I think I've put it in close to like 7,000 all that [ __ ] you know not really but like that's the ideology I kind of yeah exactly if you do the same thing just like a bunch you're gonna get good at it so the way that works was that it's like they had only so many hours that the shop was open and if you put in 40 hours on by Friday whenever you were I finished up until like seven o'clock on Friday you had free time so let's say I had my 40 hours done by two o'clock on Friday I'd have you know five hours of free time I can use anything of their just would you start me at that point um it was really hard to work 40 hours doing the same thing over and over and then wanna go blow glass afterwards you for yourself so a lot of the times I didn't use it but my boss knew that I was interested in glass outside of the job so one day he came up to me and asked I wanted to come in on Saturday and he would be willing to teach me whatever I wanted yeah and so I was chase chase goes by chase AZ glasses chase glass yeah yeah yeah I think I came over exactly what handle it yeah he was today's wonder studio now but that guy's a bother he's yet he taught me a lot of things taught me how to make a pipe me how to make a bubbler was more than willing to share technique and a key kind of when I worked there he was kind of the good guy like for me but everyone the other guy the other managers were kind of like work harder and she's like we're doing good man okay yeah Chase is really cool so you went in you Brett made some prep start blowing glass pipes did that for how long about six months of glass pipe making I was there for a year six months of prep six months of this thing man that's made a couple thousand there yeah and the quota per day was like 50s nearly forty five yeah that's like [ __ ] like ADA eight an hour maybe a little under and there's are just like little spoons like Hume the outside maybe a design on it or something like nothing spectacular yeah and I had to make him in like eight minutes or less it was like go go go save your money started yeah I bought a torch bought a kiln my grandparents were going to let me use a shed in the backyard of the studio so I did that for a couple years and then what was like one of the first pieces you made I actually do I would remember this my friend came over that night and I made this little reticello pendant it was just like slime and yellow and it brokes I didn't have my kiln wasn't I don't have the electricity setups just the gas and yeah that broke but cuz it didn't Emil it's gonna be looking yeah I'm finally free I'm doing my own thing yeah do you ever work for anybody else happened no I haven't I was four years ago turn five cool so let's talk about the people you meet today what is it it's a recyclate it spins water it's got an uptake god drain it's uh honestly what is it I don't know it's this color right here home blown made this color I'm going glass but they're down here in Tempe a couple miles away yeah this is something that they put into a pot to stir it up dip into it yeah like a drill like a drill bit of hole I like this like a couple feet long stick it in the pie just spins it up yep some little stick of big old chunk of glass clear glass in that pot pull it out and it'll just be this big like lava glass stretch that down and we get this cool color it's not named or anything that's just a nice teal good yeah I colored is a lot more glass right oh yeah a lot I mean like a click pounded by the pound okay so I'll pound of colored glass usually goes for like 80 bucks and you do $100 and it's not like the rare stuff no I feel good there's just one color company molten Aurora they're making color that's like 160 bucks a pound that's a little bit different this rig I use probably a little over a half pound in it so on my end it's like 40 bucks where the material time-space and paying for all the equipment doesn't invested in and everything there's quite a buildup maybe a bug maybe yeah maybe a dollar and that's like the high-end sigh max like best clear because there's different grades of glass I mean I bought today I I pumped went out today that was about four and a half hours on this recycler from scratch normally I'll take my leisure time and we'll take like eight to ten hours yeah what color yeah how much more I would add you to the line where you're the weak leg stuff like this um so I've got to prep the line tubing which takes probably close to an hour then I've got to actually do the pattern work it's another hour on top of it and then I've got to incorporate that into the piece because there's some there's more involvement with that now that you've got the pattern section you would have to add that to the piece and it's a little more involved there things can go wrong there's more risk involved yeah it is it's something that you kind of build on top of with your recyclers themselves isn't there a little bit of yeah there is the proportions of the uptake sand drains those proportions of the top can and the bottom can those things aren't right they won't work correctly yeah I've got a list have small been a few pictures of things I've tried before prototypes of different styles you know what works what doesn't what's aesthetically pleasing what isn't because without trying you don't know I don't know I thought I'm kind of I think incorporating more pattern work into my work is really what I'd like to go it's just a little risky taking that leap because I may not see that return hopefully yeah I mean I'm still having fun blowing glass so it's not that doesn't take anything away from it but I do need to get paid so I can make hype tomorrow okay when I was looking at your stuff [Music] yeah it is it feels good to understand what I'm doing and have control because there's a there's a big part of me and I still don't have full control of what I'm doing a lot of like a glass is learning everyday it is a hard thing to do and I still [ __ ] up [ __ ] all the time man I've had I can't tell you how many times I've dropped a piece when it's almost done just like just like right off there like so where I put those little bridges on my handle sometimes that area I can get shocked and snap and so I've dropped probably five or six pieces directly from here all the way to the ground sometimes they break sometimes they bounce I pick it up and I continue working yeah it's uh go home I don't know I tried sometimes I'll fight through it and I'll start over I've done that a couple times but a lot of time I just give you sad yeah yeah no accepting failure is something I still haven't done but it's something needs to be done how about I collapse yeah yeah yeah and on top of that peace is the maker [ __ ] cool [ __ ] like definitely some advice over the neighbor shout out the studio yeah they shot the future is there anybody for you to aspire to work with get to make that dream come true collabs are a lot of fun to do [Music] so now your skill set for this guy hi man it's been nice talking to you been a cool sesh today I'm looking forward to kill there", "xdZBGzy5CRw": "This is a dangerous profession, you just gotta work safe. I don't think that there are too many glassblowers who ever sit down behind the torch without indulging first. I've been blowing glass and advancing the cause of better bongs since 1981. most younger glass blowers are not of the impression that their inventions are worth protecting. When it became apparent to me that bongs are starting to incorporate a lot of fancy laboratory seals I got to be thinking 'hey, why try to make a bong look like it belongs in a laboratory? Why not take an actual piece of laboratory apparatus and turn it into a bong?' Since the 1940s the standard operating procedure in chemistry laboratories, if the object of the day is to scrub a gas with a liquid, has been to use a gas washing bottle which consists of a fritted disc. I took it upon myself to make some molds and make some fritted discs and when I created the first fritted disc and used it in April of 2011 I was genuinely surprised how well it worked. My eyes kinda rolled back in my head and I was like 'oh my god this is the best bong hit I've ever had' by like a whole quantum level and I'm like I need a patent attorney. Got my Rooster Apparatus Fritted disc perc It's so smooth. The paraphernalia industry has been the bulk of my income for the last 40 years, really. It was my first bong hit that set me down the course that I follow that was really what changed my life.", "oCNkj_k41BI": "yeah it's 6:30 in the morning there is like 50 dudes two tanks and a helicopter a tank two tanks what's up everybody welcome to the daily session my name is Rick James and today we're out at frosties freshest studio we're doing a filming shooting of rig and finding out who he is so I doing everyone what's up frosty how are you doing today doing good so tell me a little bit about yourself but we want to hear your story so I got into blowing glass after I controlled for growing marijuana I was big a Negroni out here for quite a bit I had quite a few houses plants yada yada I had a little bit of trouble someone told me I lost my Gardens so after I lost my Gardens it was either working 9:00 to 5:00 or I chose to blow some glass I may sit by and sell a lot of glass it was just something I did when I was growing so I knew there's a good market in the industry if you could make something that people liked I definitely knew there was you know good money behind it at first my goal just make like hundred bucks a day well you could make it a regular job so I started making spoons and things of that nature so I hated taking spoons after like 50 or so spoons people were asking me to make pendants my logo is a snowman and so people wanted to see the Snowman after that I started making a few pendants that involved into hollow pendants which evolved into making rigs I knew you needed a niche in the market as well so I took the hollows then kept my face that was kind of people know me for now it's still within with the Snowman yeah so in the face evolved onto a pond to the bottles and that's what I've kind of been making that people would know me for is my faces that I put on my rigs so wait hold on let's take this a step back you said that you'd had some grows and you were working in the industry that way or correct that's what I started out it's done it for quite a few years out here that was like my big thing when I first started I they I lost my homes my cars things like that I think they found like 700 plants when they came that's crazy yes 700 yeah that's where the so that was doing my thing you know that's that's what me beforehand so just one day wake up and get popped in yeah it's 6:30 in the morning there's like 50 dudes two tanks and a helicopter I take two tanks are you saying that like you got walked out in you slept yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it was pretty crazy did you ever think that was gonna happen I mean it's always in the back of your mind that's something you know could happen it's not like you don't plan that to happen right so that's crazy so things happen get in trouble and then you just decide okay I'm gonna start blowing glass I had to choose something and that was it that was what I chose to do I guess I used to buy and sell glass so I mean some of these pieces go 10 15 20 plus thousand dollars I mean it up into the 40 the $60,000 ranges right so I was happy if I could make a couple hundred bucks a day at this point you know what I mean and how long did it take you to get to that level just a couple hundred dollars um well I'd say progressed pretty fast but I put a lot of time in I've been on the torch for about a year and a half ago so I worked pretty hard every day that's a lot of hours you know 16-hour days on a regular basis I got no days off that vent that really helps quite a bit I think the amount of time I worked you know I probably have worked maybe three years worth of work in my year and a half so that was a huge factor in helping me progress as fast as I have we started making spoons and did you just use like your Instagram name or like yeah so I kept my yeah I kept my Instagram name when they and I got Topher growing they put my name on the newness Frosty's Frosty's fresh my weed was always frosty and always fresh so we harvest every two weeks that's kinda where my name came from I got to my logo came from the company lrg was a big inspiration allergy is a lifted research group it's a weed based company a lot of people don't realize that they throw it on their kids and send them to school so I wanted a cartoon love cartoons I wanted a logo similar to that that I could throw on a shirt if you knew who I was you knew who I was if you didn't it's just a snowman to you so no you know you know you know so I can go into the store with like my snow machine people think it's funny older people think it's funny it's cool it's a snowman across this snowman because they'll actually know what they know who I am what I'm about and like my history and stuff so what came first like the snowman the image or like the glass like um 100 cent my image that was that was my image when I grew okay so that's always been my logo from when I grew was on my pack so I'm not all my wax all my products I just transitioned that 100 percent of the glass they put me on the news I'm all over Facebook Google yada yada so I figure there's quite a bit of history behind that a lot of people knew who I was with that name so instead of getting rid of that I tried to turn a bad into a positive and I just kept my name and pushed forward so people knew who I was before they now understand what happened to me they understand what I'm doing I had a lot of support from the community which was super awesome they interested what I went through I don't think what I was doing was a horrible thing I may have had too many plans but was not there kill anybody I actually helped quite a few people with you know the medicine I produced ago so I guess I start to take a negative thing and turn it into a positive thing so I did definitely kept my name people knew who it was and then on that point for I just sorted making glass it's awesome so we need the spoons mmm then go independence pendants into I made solid pendants for a while and how are they doing they were fine but when I started getting into some shops I had a little bit of complaints are heavy some people like that some people did and right exactly so we transition at a hollow it was a different world but something new for me to learn how long did it take to like figure that out I made like 150 stalled ones I so I understood the face pretty well I was still try to improve I still trying to improve on it constantly but um so I understood the face pretty well now it was to the point of like learning how to make a hollow bubble and apply a face to it or sculpt to go wherever I wanted to do it well I probably made like another 50 to 100 hollow pendants and then the market was demanding rigs I mean everybody wants I think pandas are more than accessories so if you have a big enough name then you can sell Fitness like that but I got to the point where I needed to make rigs so I started to you know taking my hollow learning and pushing it on to a rig at that point I understood how to do the face still so I put it onto a bottle I want to keep that niche I know a lot of the bigger artists elbow Rhino things like that they have a niche everybody knows elbow for his dinosaurs you know what he does everybody knows Rhino for his ducks you know bigger name artists have an inch so I took that as something that I needed to have for sure my faces were a hit I had been doing really well so I didn't took that transition on my bottles so I had something people knew me for they could see my work and recognize it how did you learn how to blow glass a lot of trial and error honestly I've seen a few people blow glass I've watched people here and there and when I was buying and selling in the days I read seen some things hearing it but honestly it's trial and error man get on the bike and ride you know and make some mistakes and I knew a lot of the bigger artists because I've bought sold so I would study their work like things I had problems with I would look and see how they did things and try to reverse-engineer their work and not to necessarily copy them but to see like okay how are they doing things like what is what are they going about how they get any things done and so that helped me a lot and I started the top and work my way down try to perfect my eyes my nose my mouth and then continue to go over and over again and I still constantly try to perfect these things but uh that's that was like really my way in who was like some of your bigger inspirations then um when I first got started I had a homing Jordi Minich I paint a painting for me came down and I watched him work a few times so I learned a lot of sculpting off of watching him work glassblowing yeah yeah and glass whole he's a really big artist as a lot of sculpting for he's does a lot of faces so there's a couple big guys that do things similar you know and I and I look up to did you feel that like sculpting was your way to go or like you kind of fell into it honestly like people bug me to make the pendants and then just trying to make a face that's really what I was focused on and I want to make something different than what most people made most rigs are simple are their horns or this that and you don't see a ton of things with faces on them yeah you don't see a ton of characters really out there right now well what's interesting about yours - is it looks kind of like smushed a little bit or like yeah like definitely a character like you're saying like you can point it out and say yeah that's frosty fresh and that was my huge my huge goal from the start is to have something an itch or something that people notice so if they see my work they know what's my work I wanted something that you could recognize easily and I was like who made that you know I mean like you automatically know no one else is doing what you're doing right tell me about what we did today we shot you making a rig and what what did you make yeah shout out to puff co puff girls are killing it right now and it's a huge market so people want attachments for their puff coast I did a series of ten I do a lot of limited series stuff so the first ten I did with my full face bottles and I left him alone for a little bit and then the demand is still been if people bug me constantly they're all day to make puff Co attachments so today you got to see me make a head in the bottle okay so I made five of those for the puff Co eye that would be the only five that I made and so I suppose got to pick their colors and then we made you were working on two of them today this is two out of the five correct correct so the other three are finished these are the last two that I was finishing up you got to see the head in the bottle actual head being made today and then I had one that was pretty much made and I needed to just assemble it from the bottom portion down what colors were you working with the one that we assembled today was posted from glass alchemy I love glass Alchemy's colors I think they constantly strived for the best colors out there and then I also did the plain head that you got to watch me make was Amazon bronze which will be sandblasted it'll be a flat black when it's completely done you do all the sandblasting yourself yeah all my same blessing to do myself I have a little setup here and it's pretty simple it's pretty impressive for you said a year and a half and you this deep into like your skill set yeah I think like the hours I put in and the determination to feed my family it's not a hobby to me I mean I love what I do but this is what put some food on the table and you know see the sink-or-swim and I have I'm a fair amount I have eight dogs and I definitely need to keep them fed it's not you have eight dogs I have six French cheese chug and a Great Dane and so my Great Dane eats like a horse she's a small horse and then the pack too so that was that's a big thing for me too that pushed me though is like I said I need to make sure they're taken care of I mean make sure there's a roof over our heads and that everything was okay so there was really no option to fail you were driven to survive 100% and now it looks like they're doing really good for yourself yeah I love what I do I've had a huge support from the community I'm super happy from day to day currently I am incarcerated for what I was doing so I want to work with these program how does that work they let me out at 9:00 in the morning I get to go to work and then I have to be back by 9:00 at night that's so crazy it's the best the situation could be okay for the amount of plants and amount of marijuana they found I definitely gotta win to prison there's my first offense I never been in trouble before which helped me a lot so I am thankful for what happened but when I got a grant anything no not at all I could have done things made me differently a little bit put on no I never would like to lost that experience I probably make close to a million dollars a year doing what I was doing so 32 years old I mean I had a great time good run yeah 100% and it's brought me into this I probably never would've blown glass if I didn't transition you know familiar here so so what's next um heavier pieces man I've been doing a lot of collabs trying to expand my work with other artists and I really wants to work with them hit him up yeah 100% I love to do collabs it really broadens my horizon my work pushes me to do things I'm not comfortable with so I really that's really where I'm at right now what's been the most fun or like one of the best collabs that you've worked on so far um one of the ones I did recently was pretty dope I did with nest glass okay we did recycler I don't build recyclers so that's something outside of the work that I do so working with people that do recycles are fun I have the option with work with some a bigger artist now as I progress in which is cool to me I feel like I'm a young white belt so I've only been on the torch for a year and a half yeah I know my work has progressed fast but uh and my mind said I still there's people out there that are way waited 15 10 15 20 years on the torch and to work with some of these people that have been on the torch for 10 or 15 years that are actually accepting me and say yeah I'm down to collab with you stuff like that is super cool to me it shows that I've you know I have progressed enough where people actually are accepted to work with my with my art and you were talking about how everything is limited for you so you're not making the same thing over and over that's my goal like say like with a puff hose right the first I don't need to attend a numbered 1 through 10 these ones are a little bit different than the first one there one through fives I'm gonna do a 1 through 5 of a naked edition with just a simple clean bottle a lot of my merchandise is like that a lot of my shirts are numbered you know 1 out of 50 or what it you know whatever they're do 50 that we make I like to get people something that nobody else has you know what I mean that's big to me so yeah but that's also good for the collectors too because then that way you'll still be able to retain the value of your piece yeah that's the goal to it is eight and the collectability but also not to have what everybody else has like my faces are all very similar but I try to make them a little bit differently different colors I try to give somebody one-of-a-kind piece if I can you know I mean I try not to have the exact same piece every single time that's not my goal so pretty much give a special experience for everybody yeah okay what would you recommend to somebody who wants to get started in the blowing glass man people ask me all the time like really you got to get a torch and just just start pulling glass like a couple hundred bucks you get yourself a torch you need an oxygen tank and some propane and you pretty much off and running where can we get some class at like um I starter us yeah oh my selfie lamp work supply it's a company that I like a lot of they're really good to their customers mountain glass is a decent company out there there's quite a few companies that you can actually get a whole like raw material from but it's just like riding a bike man I mean I could tell you all day how to ride that thing but until you get on it and ride it like it just it's not the same you know that's a great explanation so yeah and and it comes down to like how good you want to ride that bike how many tricks you Lindy like I can tell you all day how to do that but until you get on to practice and learn then you're not gonna get anywhere with it that's you know pretty much how I learned myself I've had friends and in different artists you know throw me some tips and information here and there but at the end of the day just comes down to trial and error there's quite a bit of hands-on experience I think you need to put in to actually learn how to blow glass where can we find your stuff at all my stuff's on Frosty's fresh on Instagram fr sty s fre sh on Instagram I do have a website Frosty's fresh store that's my main social media that I use right now and quite a few smoke shops in the valley of Arizona Phoenix Arizona I have flavored stuff as well well we appreciate your time man and look forward to seeing what you come up with in the future thank you man thank you for your time yeah no problem [Music]", "6iRI0GpC9u4": "hello good people and welcome to the fusing shop if this is your first time here i'd like to give you a nice howdy duty welcome to uh our glassblowing channel um in this video we're going to be doing an implosion style marble we're going to be using silver and gold fume for the implosion and this particular implosion is going to be done on hollow tubing which is a little bit different than the implosion video that i did previously which was done on solid rod i'll leave a link to that video in the description below and you can check that out when you get a chance so right now i am just heating up the end of my tubing in a minute i'm about heating up about an inch of that tubing and then i am going to be popping that out in a minute so just go ahead get a nice even heat you want to make sure it gets to like a dull kind of orange color before you start puffing this out and you want to make sure that it is heated evenly all the way around so remember to rotate that rod in the flame and i like to rotate towards me i find that that works for me you could rotate whatever is comfortable for you and when you take it out of the flame wait a couple seconds before you give a gentle puff you don't need to blow hard into the tube just be gentle with the glass there's no reason to go crazy here give a nice gentle puff and i like to rotate at a quarter turn and then give a little puff and then rotate and pop and rotate and puff this way you get a nice even bubble all right that's looking pretty good and i'm gonna do some adjustments to the flame to get it to a nice fuming flame that i'm going to be using and the first um so first metal that i'm going to be fuming is the silver so i got my silver on the end of that that punty and sometimes you have to play with the flame chemistry a little bit to get it to work so just keep that in mind that wasn't giving me the fume that i wanted so i adjusted the flame a little bit give me that nice pinpoint flame that's good for doing this type of work and keep your fume close to the cones of the fire and when it starts to fume you can actually see the flame change and change color and you also see that that glass is turning a little bit yellow there we go now you can see what it looks like and now i am going to go ahead and put a little bit of gold onto the end of that ball this way kind of has a cool little fade effect in the glass so just bouncing that in and out of the flame while rotating while keeping that gold close the cones of the fire and just letting that build up on the glass i always like to fume a little bit of silver first because it'll help the gold stick to the glass better okay and now i'm just going to add a little bit more silver so just go ahead and you can see the flame changing color right there in that shot beautiful and that is what that silver and gold fume are looking like right now now to keep the metal on the glass i'm gonna encase with some clear dots and i'm just going to go around you never want to go around more than the halfway point of your bubble so i'm going a little bit above that and starting to make my dots a little bit above the halfway point because i am going to be imploding this design so just go ahead and i'm just dropping little dots of glass around you want to try to get the spacing more than the size of the dots that's what i find works best so try to get them evenly spaced i just keep going around the glass now moving up a little bit and i'm putting like kind of in between the dots that i just laid so you could do whatever pattern works for you you can make lines you can make dots and lines it's again your art and your preference so just continue to go around and it looks really cool looks like a kind of like a mace and medieval kind of mace as you as you uh keep adding the dots to the glass and this you want to be careful that you keep your glass hot uh because it's very easy to crack it at this point so just keep that in mind as you're laying your dots down you don't want to be too slow or if you do want to take your time make sure you flash it every now and then in a nice soft annealing flame this way i'll just give you a quick shot of that because again i want to get into that annealing flame and avoid any kind of cracks so just get that annealing flame going and this also helps strike the fume a little bit and now my gopro is having a problem with the white balance here as you see it turned back to normal now i am thinking about a better place to put that gopro because i do have a dydymium lens on there but for some reason the white balance is always a little bit a little bit funny so if you guys have any suggestions on how to get that um color issue worked out by all means let me know um so right now i'm just doing your standard implosion pretty much you keep the tip of your glass in the fire and rotate i just keep rotate rotate rotate keep rotating and eventually that fume will begin to implode and move towards the center of the glass so again just keeping that tip in the fire and rotating the glass towards me so just sit chill out relax excuse me keep rotating that glass and you will start to see the pattern implode into the center of the glass you can use a graphite paddle to help move things along that is your preference and if you have those tools available then by all means go ahead and use them i just like to chill out and rotate the glass it's also just good practice and muscle memory to get used to rotating with your hands the more you do it of course the better you get at it so practice practice practice so just keep going rotate rotate and um again there's really no set rules for doing an implosion you want to keep your implosion close to on center as you can this way your design will be you know in the middle of your piece rather than like off to the side so you know just keep that in mind as you're doing your implosion you want it to be close to close to on center and now i'm going with the elbows up position having my glass angle downwards and this again just helps the glass move a little bit faster and implode a little bit quicker and now back to parallel and it's good to change your angles every now and then again get used to heating in different directions and different ways you can see the implosion there it's looking good and again make sure that you are working in a safe way and that you you keep yourself safe and others around you and um you know know what you're doing if you're getting into the last blowing you know take a couple classes with somebody before you start buying a torch and get started on your own it's important to have the basics especially you know as far as safety goes and ventilation so those are really important i know you can watch the videos on youtube but it's so much better to go and take an actual class from someone this way once something does um get messed up and you can rest assure that it will that you know how to um how to deal with it so right now i'm attaching a punty because i am going to be detaching my my tubing so i just that attached on a cold seal punty and now i'm heating up to get ready to blow out a bubble changing the grip a little bit and now i'm just going to puff that bubble out and it makes a nice thin piece of glass you don't want to pop not pop you don't want to blow this out too much because you can make bubble trash so just blow it out thin enough without without popping it and then i just popped a small hole and now i flame cut all the way around and just cut that tube right off and this leaves a little bit of excess glass on your design in which you in which you could either tweeze it off or i am just going to melt it back in with the rest of the piece so you could tweeze it or you could use another rod to peel off that extra glass it's completely up to you whenever your preference is you want you do want to try to focus on leaving as little glass as possible though because the more glass you you leave on the more you have to take off so just something to keep in mind and right now i'm getting a um another glass rod hot as i rotate the the piece and this glass rod i'm going to start to make a gather on it so i'm just getting it hot and starting that gather because um this is going to become my lens on the marble so just getting it hot starting to make the gather get used to working with two hands if you do plan on flame working because there are so many so many times that you need to use two hands and um there's what it's looking like you can see all those cool little dots in there um so yeah definitely get used to working with two hands it's just uh something you're gonna need to get used to when you work with glass now i'm just smooshing that clear rod onto my pattern now and i'm pressing my right hand into my left hand and gathering up some clear and that will form the lens when we go ahead and uh get to that point but right now again just heating up that rod and gathering up glass making sure everything looks good you know look at it from different angles to make sure that it's the woods coming out the way you want don't just look from one angle because remember we're working in a three-dimensional world so always keep that in mind as you're working okay at this point i am pretty happy with the size of the the lens and i'm gonna sharpen up my flame a little bit because now i'm gonna go ahead and twist that that implosion and the way you do that is by heating up where the glass is the thickest so i'm going to heat up right in that middle and just keep rotating it on center and get a lot of heat in there and you can see my left hand has stopped and my right hand is continuing to rotate and that will give us the twist you can keep both hands rotating and if one rotates faster than the other this will also work again different ways of doing it and uh do whatever works best for you so here i'm feeling cutting off the punty and um i know if i'm going to be using these punties again that it's best to clean off the end so i'm just sharpening up that end because i'll be using that for a cold seal later on so just go ahead and sharpen that up toss it down it's always easier to do while it's hot then after you put it down and you have to reheat it so try to keep that in mind as you're working to clean up those uh punties and uh have them ready for your next project or your next step or whatever um so yeah just inspecting expecting what that looks like you can see the twist in the glass now looks really cool and now i'm going to be putting a backer on because this fume really pops when you have a nice backer so i'm backing with my cobalt blue i like using this when i when i do fume just gives a really cool effect if you check out my galaxy marble video i also use this same cobalt blue to back that marble and that was also done with silver fume this this was a mixture of silver and gold and right now i am just forming a gather on that cobalt rod getting nice and nice and juicy hot and now i'm going to just be attaching it to the marble and again i'm going to be doing the same thing as i did with the clear i'm going to put that heat solely onto the cobalt rod and gently push my left hand into the right hand and just let that glass start to gather nice even rotations again this doesn't have to be perfect just relax with the glass remember this is supposed to be fun it's not supposed to be a tedious task so keep that in mind and now i'm just going to be using my graphite paddle to help paddle that design down into the rest of the marble you don't have to do this it's just another technique to help speed things along a little bit and there you can see the white balance has shifted again with the gopro again if you guys have any idea why that keeps happening uh hit me with a comment below i it must be because the different light from the torch and everything else that's uh going on around it and the camera is just trying to compensate and it just like has no idea what's going on so uh if you're an expert gopro user by all means let me know what i can do to stop that from happening because i find it a little bit annoying and i'm sure you guys do too so leave a comment below and let me know if you have any ideas all right so now i have that paddle down to the size that i that i want and here i'm going to be using the cobalt rod as a punty and i should have sharpened it up before uh like i was saying but i didn't so here i am back in the flame heating it up again and now you can see there we go sharpening it up so i could use that for my cold seal again make sure you get used to working with two hands it's really really critical if you want to do this type of work i know i said it before in the video but i'll say it again um can never hear something enough you know so just keep that in mind okay i got that putty all ready to go and now pretty much the rest of the video is going to be just rounding out this design and getting that marble in a perfect sphere so at this point i will kindly give you a heads up if you want to skip to the end of this video by all means go ahead and do so i left time stamps in the description below if you want to watch me um round this out um that's cool too you'll see how i put that nice hot mar uh nice red hot marble in the marble mode like i'm doing right now and this is again pretty much all i'm going to be doing for the rest of the video um so i won't be offended if you skip to the end it's all good things and to use the marble mold just so i can explain what i'm doing here is um you can see how nice and round it's becoming already uh to use the marble mold you when you take it out of the flame you want to wait a couple seconds for the glass to kind of develop like a thin film before you drop it into that marble mold because if you do not um you can like make the glass all misshapen and it will completely distort whatever you just worked on so make sure you give it a couple seconds before you when you take it out of the flame before you go into the marble mold and make sure you rotate as you go into the mold because gravity is constantly pulling that glass down so when it is molten hot like that you have to keep that in mind once you drop it in that mold it can start to get misshapen if you're not rotating so just a couple little tidbits to keep in mind when you're shaping your marble right now i'm attaching my cold seal punty it wasn't uh on center so i just cracked it off and i'm going to reattach if your punties are not on center take the couple seconds to pop them off and reattach them it just makes your life so much easier when the glass is centered up um so don't think that you have to get it right on center the first time you know for me i'm like 50 on center so um i am not an expert and nor do i claim to be one i just uh you know enjoy melting glass and chilling out and teaching people so um yeah you know if it's not on center take the extra like five seconds pop it off reattach and you know get everything centered up before you continue i know a lot of people when they're first starting they like to just you know attach it and it's like called what's uh it's called crankshafting it looks like the crankshaft of an engine so when they're rotating you could see that the glasses you know the punt is all over the place and it just makes your life so much easier that you just you know get get it on center from the get-go right out of the gate and you know everything will be smooth from there on out all right this is looking pretty good gonna go back into the marble mold again wait a couple seconds before you go into the mold and you rotate the mold or your marble whichever one you prefer this way you get all the of the different angles and really get a nice perfectly round marble when you're done with this so it's looking pretty good already and you shape one end at a time and this is the lens that i'm you know shaping right now just keep rotate rotate rotate turn that marble mold and remember this graphite is super hot right now so be careful that you keep um the hot side away from you when you place it on your your work table the radiant heat from the marble does transfer to the graphite so just keep that in mind when you're working with your tools that they can also pick up heat and potentially burn you so all right here i'm cracking off that cold seal and all you do is just gently tap it with another rod or your tweezers or whatever you have around and now i'm just going to polish off that blep and melt it into the rest of the design since i use cobalt as a punty um it the color matches perfectly if you want to add color dots to this or like a twisty spirally effect you can uh you can do that as well um i usually leave them solid in the back and i just like the way it looks and right now i'm just rotating that in the mold to make sure that there's no blemishes or imperfections that i missed so look around check it out because now's your the time when you could fix it as opposed to when it goes into the kiln and you take it out and you realize oh man this has like a little um dent here that i could have polished out or it has like a little piece of extra glass that wasn't taken off you know check it before you put it before you put in the kiln again it takes you a couple seconds just to rotate it around in the mold and um make sure it looks good try not to get the punty stuck when you do this so if your glass is hot again wait a couple seconds before you touch that punty to it and now it's going into the kiln for a neon if you enjoy this video don't forget to like comment and subscribe and check out another cool glass blowing video while you're here thanks so much and we'll see you next time", "gR6SQYKX7ZU": "what's good it's your boy 3js I'm here today with my glyco and the new product from fluent at Keith's it's fire looks really good it smells really good it smells a lot like blue dream since it smells like blue dream I thought I'd use some blue dream flower in it so let's hop in here grab some blue dream and I'm only I'm just using a little bit of flour because I really want to try this Keith pretty excited about it I've got my handy dandy tools from skillet tools over here I'm just trying to pack a nice little foundation of flour just a nice little bed to put this keep on let me see if I can show I just brought up some small pieces I'm gonna just made a nice little bit now I'm going to take out one of my tools from skillet tools you're gonna give it a little bit get a lot of it right take that Keith I'm just gonna put it right on top flattened out now you don't use this much captain this is good for the captain but I wouldn't recommend you using this much I'd recommend you using a little bit like and maybe something like that but I'm excited it's bedtime I just got this and I really want to try it it's so good it is so good the bowl is still teaching man look at that this stuff is good this is good stuff fluent Keith schnapps trans-pacific it's just fire Keith from bother Graham just cannabis trichomes yeah it's so good let me tell you it's just it's really good really nice cannabis trichomes says it on the box Keith Richards go get it you", "EhNj9qbbv5s": "yeah Jason Christian is working with the star-studded teams at area to 5/3 glass in beautiful Tacoma Washington today the team will be combining their skills to make a red dragon around Jason gathered up a little clear glass out of the furnace he's going to use that to pick up a lay across the barber from Jason chris has a chunk of red glass that red glass is going to get laid on the outside of the dragon's leg oh yeah that you got it Jason made the Dragons like earlier his own studio back in Seattle he brought it down to two five three and put it in their pickup up so he could heat it up and then add this new bit again that's some of the red glass that Chris had earlier he got it hot and brought it over so the Jason can sniff and then he'll go on to squeeze that down which will be the armor on the side of the dragon's leg each of the four dragon legs will rest in the garage until it's time to assemble the finished piece together the final dragon leg is gonna be a little bit different and then it's holding the crystal ball Jason has gathered up some clear glass he's starting to lightly separate it from the pipe with the jacks before picking up what we call the marble tool which is essentially a metal ring on the end of a metal rod with that tool you can get a nice round marble shape and then cut it down a little bit more using these Aqib on the shears yes yeah [Music] now it's time to add that crystal ball into the dragon's claw have you where'd the torch Chris gave the ball little heat Jason's gonna cool the neckline down with this shears and then he'll break off the ball into the special ring tweezers he's asked Chris to heat up the break off area with the oxy propane torch and then to heat up the center of the Dragons cloth before pushing the two together [Music] lately I think it's just this season once those fingers wrapped around the ball he'll go so far as to grab each individual end after heating it pulling it out until it gets very thin snipping or breaking that off to a point you can repeating that process grabbing the glass stretching it out into a long point and then snipping it off that was the last of the dragon's legs now it's time to make the dragon's head lay in a wonder all Chris has some of that red glass he's brought it over to Randy who has a clear bubble on the end of a hollow blowpipe so far everything we've seen the team make has been solid glass but this is now a bubble though it won't stay a bubble for long Randy rolled the color back over the clear bubble and now Jason has gone back into the furnace this is where the liquid clear glass is kept at 2,100 degrees Fahrenheit you can see the pot in there it's like a big flower pot being used as a Super Bowl in that pot is liquid molten glass Jason would like to make everything out of pure color but sometimes that isn't practical in this case he wants clear glass over the color but just a little bit so he's pulling most of the clear glass off the end that clear glass will get recycled and thrown back into the furnace another day well you got a good start so jason has a bubble it's gonna stretch that bubble out cut a little notch in the end and blow [Music] he's working on making a hollow tube and then he'll make that tube into what we call a snorkel after opening up the end Jason has started to bend the tube do an angle turning while he gathers he'll put that snorkel down and make a seal with the liquid glass on the surface of the furnace he's inhaling literally sucking the molten glass up into the tube just like a straw can't really turn the glass around too much but he's letting it drip off so he doesn't trail any glass on the sill of the furnace it's rolling around on the steel table cannoli dude I love it you can see that opening in the end filled with clear glass do you have a San Juan and open he wants the color to wrap all the way around so he's gone with his jacks he's starting to squeeze the glass down drawing the color from the sides into the center going with his diamond shears and cut that extra glass off it's still very hot as we can watch it sink and melt in real time so now we've got a solid rod of glass most of its clear but there's a thin layer of red glass on the outside yeah he is a strange strange mechanic yeah it's time to shade the dragon's head essence using the jacks to press three indentations into the circumference of the glass yeah right the next step is to define the mouth of the dragon Jason will use the flat crimps to round the outer perimeter and then use the tag to cut a crease in and separate the upper and lower sections of the jaw the reason he does it this way is because he wants the color to come back with him instead of cutting with the shears which would leave a big clear spot on the inside of the dragon's mouth big Owens nasty man on fire Randy can hold the pipe regard Jason is very concerned about keeping the Dragons head on center even though he knows the dragon is a mythical creature we'll look more realistic if everything is perfectly symmetrical to create the Dragons snow Jason will work from the outside and then on the inside with the interior sculpting tools Johnny I ever thought it was oh really and she didn't have any tools the conventional kind of torch on it built up to the bench and she would blow and here the team talked about the development of this sort of technique which is relatively new in the history of glassblowing Jason uses the torch to spot heat the area he wants to move the most and then they'll go and slowly push and pull the glass coaxing it into the form he has in mind Jason is making a series of red dragon they'll all be a little different but they'll all go through the same steps to be completed the next step is to create the lips and the teeth of the dragon starting the first the bottom jaw and their room heating the process on the top Disney heating and then going in with the knife to cut a crease in the glass the inside will be the tea they're all made in China outside will be the lips [Music] some raging furnace you know like once the teeth are in the place the next step is to pull back the crease of the jaw and make sure everything is on center hey looking back there Jason can now eat the individual jars and cut the teeth into that section no longer and Jason will repeat that both the lower and then the upper jaw been up there and he's like oh you guys should come to the studio you know like check the studio a little longer yeah take a moment to straighten up the teeth asking Chris to site down the center of the paper before using the tips of the shears to cut the nostril into the end of the snout yeah pull the tip of the nose then one by one heat can stretch the teeth Thank You Randy yeah yeah then throwing it out to a long thread and then breaking the thread to create a sharp point you're getting on it Jason squares up the end of the lower jaw and then starts to make the eyelids listen to it I listen to a book on the eyes will be separate bits of black blouse it's called boys in the boat it's about I I hated me when I was driving here and then one last time Chris cut in some teeth and little lower front lip yeah I'm sorry Pookie now it's time to place the I don't start like this now pushing in the ball to create the eye socket again making sure that these holes are symmetrical and even the ice themselves are black glass Jason has taken a rod of black and heated the ends up to make them into small marbles those marbles get placed inside the eye socket and then they're broken free from the rod Jason wants to work quickly to draw the outer edges of the eyelids and then press the upper eyelid down over the eye once the left side is complete the same thing on the right he's the eye socket push in the marble of black glass break it off the rod and then start to heat install the eyeball the next bit to be applied is the armor on the underside of the dragon's jaw neck this comes on as one long bit which Jason works quickly to snip have you ever seen them those dragons and I love their piece of art have you ever seen her make one with a lower arm in place now the upper fangs can be applied it's that same rod of red glass this time simply poked in and stretched to be made into a point Jason starts by heating the end of the rod where he wants it to attach to the mouth Beni heats up a little higher causing the glass to melt where he can then stretch it and break it off into nothing I remember the first time I had got my opportunity where Pitino once the front of the dragon's face is pretty complete it's time to break it off and work on the back of the dragon's head to do that a new rod was made the punty will be the new handle for the piece Jason will go in and expand that massive glass they'll then snip on the top and the bottom to create two sides working with the flat crimps you can begin to squeeze those two sides and flare them out into the armor on either side of the dragon's head and then go up and down another Randy Walker and he's got a bunch of oh yeah the flaps are heated up and then snipped into the individual sections of armor plating oh really got my bath crazy okay yeah don't bathe one the glass needs to be at least a thousand degrees Fahrenheit to move in order to cut it it needs to be much much hotter than Jason wants to take a moment and prepare the area on the back of the head that will attach to the Dragons neck the armor plates are flattened with the flat crypts and then pulled to Jill Reza knows credit card that will put it on the Hat the reheating chamber used in the glass studio is called the glory hole it burns at 2300 degrees Fahrenheit [Music] Chris just gave the dragons having flash in preparation for attaching the whisker to the side of the dragon's face the whisker starts as a straight red glass rod and then Jason continues to heat and shape it and attach it to the side of the dragon's head it's challenging enough to do this on the first side but far more challenging is to do the same thing on the other side making a perfect mirror image from the first Jason wants to make sure that those whiskers are firmly attached to the side of the dragon's head so that they don't pop off later on once he's content that both the whiskers are symmetrical and even the next step will be to attach the ears to the top of the dragon's head [Music] the red glass is attached to the top of the dragon's head snipped off and then squeezed with the tweezers [Music] not only am i like the dragon's armor those ears are then pulled to points broken to create a sharp edge I got them I got the lucky number her pool and there's more work to do on the dragon's head but for now it will rest in the garage staying warm at about a thousand degrees Fahrenheit it's time to make the body of the dragon so that we can attach all the parts that we've been working on so far and complete the project the body of the Dragon will be a much larger mess than we've seen the team work with so far jason has started by gathering up a bubble of clear glass and now he's laying out red glass rods called cane that cane was pulled earlier just for this project red glass coating clear glass in the middle all the Canes should be the same width the same circumference in the same density of color yeah my ears birthday we put the Canes on a hot plate so that they get preheated and are less likely to crack before going into the hole the cane will be heated up and melted together into a continuous sheet that sheet then will be rolled up on the outside of Jason's bubble you can see the edges of the cane got warm in the glory hole Chris will lightly squeeze the Canes together right behind him Jason comes without gather of fresh hot glass the Canes get rolled up like a tractor tread on the outside of the bubble Jason will then spend a few minutes pushing that came down into the surface of the bubble normally he's very concerned about where the two sides of the cane meet up for this project though he wants a gap in the middle Randy has picked up some of the same red glass they've been using all day and covered it with a layer of fresh glass from the furnace that blob that gets laid down over the seam of the cane this new mass will be the breastplate for the dragon's armor and define the belly of the beast now it's time to start to elongate the Dragons body Jason begins by arrowing a mass just beyond that section of breastplate now then begin the process of grabbing the glass with the diamond sheers and stretching it to its full length the team will repeat this process a few times heating stretching and then pulling the mask until it gets to the desired length as Jason and Chris work together they're especially concerned about keeping all the canes straight and that one okay we'll strain this one once this side of the mass has reached the desired length do a little rotation Jason will start to nip in a bit with the diamond shears in preparation for removing some of the extra material this class will stop moving at about 950 degrees Fahrenheit even though the outside may be cool to the touch the inside is still quite warm in resists breaking the team will take a moment to Center the glass in preparation for applying the roll around this roller wrap will be a mass of clear glass freshly gathered from the furnace and marvered to a point the pipe holding the Dragons body is placed in to offset rollers while the mass of clear glass is placed on a stationary yoke when Chris spins the pipe it turns like a screw in that thread of clear glass gets stuck to the outside of the body [Music] this will be the armor around the Dragons body Randy is using the torch to make sure that thin thread of glass doesn't cool down too quickly and pop off we gotta make sure that that we keep the chest straight you know enemy from here the team can start to draw out the curves of the dragon's body and tail towards me is that looking pretty straight after [Music] Jason wants a long fluid graceful curve so he'll take his time and work each section individually from time to time he'll use those cork pads to push the glass around so we wanted looking this way yeah trim the neck to create the place where the Dragons head will attach to the body [Music] it's time to create the mane of armor plating that will be flowing down the back of the Dragons neck Randy brings a bit of a hot red glass that Jason lays on in one fell swoop let's say that Randy they'll then proceed to flatten that bit down into a Ridge using the textured crimps he'll segment the rich with a side of the knife and then he'll proceed to reheat flatten and stretch to a point each and every segment of armor on the back of the Dragons neck as he works he'll jump around he works this way so that each of the dragons armor points has a chance to cool down and not to pull around while the other one is created it's time to begin work on the Dragons tail in order to access the tail we need to break it off the blowpipe and in order to do that we need a new way to hold on to the dragon brandi is making that now a new punty this one will support the weight of the dragons body and its legs and its head so it's got to be a pretty good sized piece of glass brandi is rolling it into a dome Jason will apply it right into the center of the Dragons chest this is a special kind of punching called the sculpture punting and fullback Sal Randy push the punty onto the piece and then pull back so that Jason could cut a small notch with a little water in a tap the dragons body is broken free chris has picked up another bar of red glass from the color evident in preparation for creating the armor plates on the back of the dragon's tail now's when Jason gets to have fun and play with the glass yeah sighs let's go front to back using the cork pads Jason is going to find two that is the curve of the Dragon this will be his last chance to make major movement in the body before applying the bits for the tail there are a few things more exciting than laying down a half a bar of beautiful red glass in one fell swoop Chris had to work extra hot so that Jason could get in with the crimps and flatten it before the glass cools down too much just like the armor plating on the back of the neck Jason segments the long bed into sections and then heats each section in turn and pulls it to a point to create the spiny armor plating for the back of the dragon's tail the very tip of the Dragons tail will get to final bits which will be cut and pulled into a flaming point Jason has to work quickly to slice the bit into separate sections yet before it's too cool to move [Music] Chris knows that Jason will expect this new bed to be just like the last one he heats it in the furnace while Randy heats the dragon in the glory hole Chris brings the bid over Jason taps it on and then draws it down the side of the tail it's taken over four hours for the team to create all the parts of the Dragon the legs the head and the body and tail it'll take less than one hour to assemble the final Dragon together Jason begins by heating a section of the body where the first leg will be attached so we'll leave this one my dad another one's gonna go forward the leg is brought from the garage given a light flash and then pushed into that hot section of the Dragons body Jason will jump from the back left leg to the front right leg and you could see how the Canes get pushed out of the way as the dragon leg is pushed into the body during the leg with a grabber tool Jason will take a moment and straighten everything up using the cork pad the cork is much softer and much less likely to break one of the delicate parts of the leg the fourth and final leg is the one holding the crystal ball and now it's time to attach the dragon's head to the body and I know it'll find its way back a couple flashes just like the legs the head has been hanging out the garage on the cold side Chris has moved it over to the hot side in preparation for running it into the glory hole and bringing it over to Jason [Music] timing is everything as the team prepares to attach the head to the body and open again Jason will use the oxy propane torch to heat up the top of the neck where the head is too attached [Music] unlike the legs the head is still attached to that sculpture punty that it was made on earlier so jason has to work quickly to attach the head and then break the punty tree that punty left a little bit of glass on the tip of the Dragons snout so Jason wants to heat that up pull it and cut it free with his shears Jason thought he was just about done but he forgot to attach the horns to the top of the dragon's head he's having Chris bring those over now like the claws the horns were made earlier back in Jason's studio in Seattle he brought them with him put him in the oven and warmed them up so that he can attach the horns once all the larger pieces are already on the dragon [Music] you see how Chris hangs out under Jason with that paddle if that small bit should drop Chris could catch it with a last piece in place Jason will take a moment to fine-tune and straighten all the different parts of the dragon [Music] the sharpest and smallest points are saved for the very end you see Jason uses finger to flick off the very tip of the dragon's tail after all these hours of work the most important step is removing the dragon from the punty and placing it into the oven where it will cool down overnight Jason goes in with his shears and narrows that connection point on the punty Randy takes the final flash yeah [Music] Jason uses a little water to create a stress crack on the plenty this grabs the piece with his Kevlar gloves and places it into the Anila after cooling down a couple days in the annealing oven this dragon was cold worked to clean up the area where it broke off the punty Jason had a talented metal Smith create a stand to display the finished piece Jason Christian and his red dragon pretty sweet dude I'm Greg Owen g-man on fire thanks for watching", "35L9LwegZrM": "already know what it is welcome back to my channel anytime in this video if you

stopping by weeds reviews and checking out another one of my videos today some more products from a platinum vape new strands that come out that i was slacking on getting but i have gotten and i'm here to review for you guys today i'm gonna look at a sativa and an indica the sativa we'll be taking a look at is apple fritter and the endicott we'll be looking at is motor city kush motor city kush indica apple fritter sativa which one should we do first blindfold motor city cushion is one gram indica testing at 76.86 lab test 835. now this is indica so look for a relaxed kind of hungry euphoric thing out of this one at least that's what it says on the packaging again i will say everybody's body's different right elon some of it isn't healed some of us don't that being said screw this bad boy in let's get a taste of it that bubba um uh detroit was it bubba something about detroit bubba that i reviewed last time that was a really good cartridge from an indica strand um i'm hoping this lives up to what detroit bubble was motor city kush let's see boys girls yeah we have girls on this channel now hey how you guys doing for a while there's just us boys all right this cartridge is nice too cool this one has its own taste not really peppery like i was thinking we were going to see a lot of pepper from platinum vape now like it was going to be like their signature taste not the case this one here not peppery whatsoever real sweet decently real sweet diesel earthy taste no pepper whatsoever smooth nice tasting cartridge tell you what platinum knocking out of the out of the park at least with their indicas a couple of their hybrids nah i don't know yet like there was khalifa or that was cleveland khalifa kush with khalifa there was khalifa no they're uh khalifa kush it wasn't that great i was kind of let down with that one it was okay it was still like a three it wasn't like like hitting like a presto or uh you know like being like a a mittens extract it wasn't nothing that terrible but it was nothing great either like what you expect from planet vape like you expect kind of a quality cartridge quality cartridge sorry package quality cartridge every time from platinum vape because that's just what we're used to we're just using quality from planet vape when we're using instructions coming out kind of being shocked at how good they are because it seems like they're put way more and more into this they're coming out with new strands all the time now which that was something i had complained about with platinum how cool quality of the product was and how i would just wish more with strands would readily be coming out and that's something that they seem to be doing which other companies aren't you see mkx they're not keeping up with platinum vape platinum vape is blowing them out of the water right now because these new strands keep coming out all the time and they keep doing a good job with the ones that come out but every now and then out of the couple that they let out there's a few disappointments and that was one of mine so far motor city cush though definitely a five-star cartridge i'm not gonna give it up our sorry definitely four-star cartridge i'm not gonna give it a five yet because there's just so many of these other products that i still have to test i don't wanna make that make it so high that i have to keep giving out fives whenever you know there might be some fours and then one will be incredible to where it'll be at five but so far just a four nothing blowing your socks off but a really great cartridge again this was motor city cush indica one grand by platinum vape also i want to touch base on something you guys platinum vape's got a thing going on right now for the golden ticket when you buy a cartridge you get a golden ticket you win their little um sweepstakes that they got going on right now so they got a golden ticket sweepstakes going on right now we've opened three so far we haven't gotten it um i'm sure it's not gonna be too easy to get but it is a thing going on so when you open your cartridge look for your golden ticket willy wonka you want your golden ticket because that would be your golden chance to make your way because with the golden ticket it's a golden day you know come on people it's how it's gonna be so apple fritter sativa you guys all know you're on the channel you watch me if you can watch the channel i'm not a big sativa guy i test the sativas i do occasionally like to have steep around i have two up there so you know i open this one they're probably all going to fall nope i opened this about a month ago you can see i just really don't hit them that much i really don't his teeth that much um just because it's really not my thing and i'm more of an indica guy or a hybrid guy i'm really more of indica person myself if i'm going to buy a cartridge not just to review just a smoke i'm going to pick it in to come most of the time but this apple fritter was last tested 12 22 of 21 comes in at 70 76.6 we'll get off and take a look into it i had never known this around i actually went to a dispenser i never go to i've never really been to i think i've been to it maybe once in two years i went to it last weekend just stopping by coming back from my sister's place because it was actually close to there and it was a sunday and all the other ones were closing so i figured i'd stop by this one because it was on my way home it was close i could get there in the time allowed it and they happened to have this so i just grabbed it i seen it i was like um i've never seen it anywhere i'm gonna grab it so if you guys have seen this you already had it let me know in the comments what you think if you think the same thing if you haven't had it well we'll see what it's like together right away and outside of the cartridge is really sticky feels like maybe bad pour and maybe they clean it up as good as they should have but yeah the whole outside of this one's really sticky so this is the apple fritter sativa by platinum vape like like i said again 76.66 coming in lab tested 12 22. now this says it's supposed to have a real that's why you never go by what it says in the backbone i'm telling you you can't ever go by what it says this one says here it says earthy apple and sweet okay now i'm gonna tell you what it tastes like there's no earthy there's no apple there's no sweet it's a real chemically gassy off-tasting smell our taste and smell that comes off it not pleasant not whatsoever oh this cartridge is bad guys i mean i'm not putting on either i would give it a two and that might be pushing it i don't think i can even smoke this car the rest of this cartridge the reason being it's real chemically tasty it tastes like i'm smoking uh one of those trees for your car the air freshener trees that's what it tastes like i'm inhaling really bad cartridge i don't enjoy this at all elon even if he handled he wouldn't enjoy it yeah if you guys bought this dude if you agree with me let me know in the comments if you haven't bought it you probably want to think of it twice before doing so there's no apple to it there's no fritter to it there's nothing sweet there's nothing that tastes good about this cartridge and now like i said i'm not just putting on i'm not making it up if it was good i would say it was good i'm not just saying it because it's a tiva and i don't really like sativas because i there's a lot of stevia i did enjoy um this one here is just not there especially after tasting like trying like the new um detroit um kush and all those other ones and this it's just this just does fails in comparisons big time big time big time that's the apple fritter by planet vape i don't know if i would erect i can't recommend this car whatsoever i wouldn't say waste your money on this maybe if you're picking up four or four hundred you just want to try it or you haven't tried it you said [ __ ] it i don't care what this guy thinks i want to try anything for myself go ahead and do it but let me know in the comments what you think if you agree with me if i'm crazy but this cartridge here real chemically real are it just doesn't taste good at all it doesn't yeah i mean i can get a sense of what they're trying to do with the apple the other tastes there like this it just doesn't balance out well and it ends up tasting chemically yeah it doesn't balance out you can pick up the apple in there and what they're trying to do but it's just too artificial and it becomes chemically balanced tasting it doesn't it's bad it's not a great cartridge guys so that being said if you haven't subscribed guys i really appreciate you subscribing it would mean the world to me and if you haven't or if you have thank you
