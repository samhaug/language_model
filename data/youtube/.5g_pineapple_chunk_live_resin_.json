{"v-Zuz2Kj7Oo": "[Music] what is up lead - welcome to my channel herbes hot house where the only hurts you see are the ones in the pots today I have an excellent video plan for you as we dive into the growers notes for the pineapple chunk run because that is correct as so the tips tricks and the lessons learned from growing this Barney's farm strain but before we get to it if you want to help grow this community don't forget to subscribe to this channel and don't forget to like the content unless we know that you're enjoying it LSD that 7 foot behemoth [Music] date this husband one of the fastest-growing strains that we've ever had in fact when this seed was freshly germinated a grew an inch in 24 hours we got it as a sample pack of one so it was all or nothing at just the two week mark the plant was moved to a solo cup with some seedling mix and around the 1 month mark it was moved outdoors to a fabric smart pot this was also the last time that this plant was indoors [Applause] honestly this is a pretty straightforward strain it took very little maintenance it grew out his best under full sunlight hot humidity and lots of rainwater fact this would be a strength I would highly recommend for beginners his six weeks into the vegetative cycle I was starting to get fan leaves that were bigger than my own hands fortunately I don't have any clips of this but one of the best selling points of this strain is the fact that it is so easy to clone and when I clone the strain I started to see roots within two to three weeks I only regret what this train is not immediately putting in a 20 gallon pot buzzer grew so rapidly it also became rebound quicker for that if you're going to grow the strain outdoors I recommend going straight to the 20 gallon and that brings us on over to the flower stage [Music] August and September was a really rough year for flowering plants outdoors there was a lot of rain and a lot of humidity and temperature fluctuations during this period and my other three outdoor plants all got powdery white mildew on them but not this one because it has a resistance to mildew about the lineage for this plant is cheese as skunk number one which are two very mildew resistant strains this will be an attribute when looking for seas for growing outdoors next year my only suggestion would be what I didn't do here is not clipping back the fan leaves any sooner this greatly helps the airflow around the plant and this also assists with the next stage harvesting and curing [Music] he'd write REM keyring method was used with all the branches from the pineapple chunk pair to other strains that we have dried these branches dried quite quickly after drying for just eight days they were trimmed up and then put on a drying rack for further floor making the total dry time from plant to dried flower only twelve days this is the 80% indica and a 20% sativa strain with a high CBD content when you smell this a smells like pine citrus and pineapple the highest best described as energizing of light euphoria and is great for those that use it for pain management you've made it this far in the video this marks the end and now it's time to hear from you leave me a comment below as to what your favorite pineapple strain is I hope this video helps you to make any judgments if you want to grow this strain or not until the next video I'll see you guys on the next one Tata for now [Music] [Applause]", "xvxDQ-H-f3Q": "[Music] [Music] [Music] it's where'd you smoke sensitive we're gonna be smoking on pineapple chunk you had this whole thing didn't look I had about like three and a half in here and it's just taking me this long to make this video I've literally just been enjoying it on a daily smoking this pineapple chunk getting to really know the flower and getting really acquainted with the terpenes so let's talk about it I put some of those Tyrone Cash Terp jelly on top of this bullski time to go hit it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] alright one thing I love about this particular strength is that it's got a really citrusy fruity on their tongue I guess you would imagine that with pineapple chunk as a name but it really holds true the lemony in terpene profile of this particular strain has to be really really high because oh it smells like it's just straight love it you know when you pull it out it's real gas - real gas almost like ammonia like but mostly more gas like more petrol you know just got that real punch in the face like diesel and a smell now I love it it's an indica dominant thing the buds are dark they're green they're just very very sticky here let me get one out after this head yeah that's right these are nice fat dense but like the real dense and chunky they're dark green they got very very distinct bright orange hairs on them I'm gonna throw up some pictures up so you guys can see it as well in this video this particular cut had a little bit of a grass he smell initially because it was pretty fresh-cut but now that it's been a little while the real real profile of the weed is coming out and it just smells amazing it just smells really really good some of the denser nug some of the bigger nose have a little bit of a purple undertone to him he might be a little bit hard to see on camera because it's very very slight of a tent but it's still very very pretty to look at and I spent hours looking at this particular bus it was a cured and trim very well for those who don't go oh no one legalized bud growing so there's a lot of homegrown going around and the results speak for themselves [Music] it's great really really good the only downside to it is I suppose it could have been a little bit better this one was a little bit crossed I had a few seeds in there so I believed like a week could have been a little bit stronger if it never did cross the content of the THC is for probably throughout around 20 are a little bit under 20% I don't think it's really up there look like you know the top of the top tier and it's not as strong of a high as other routes you're gonna have to smoke just a little bit more to get high however packs a hell of a punch like you will get really really big I'm giving pineapple chunk a seven point two out of ten it's a decent smoke and I believe if you got a better version of it it would have raided a lot better but given that this one has seeds in it it's been cross pollinated and again it could have just been slightly slightly stronger it's getting up and it's getting a seven range other than the high range however don't let that discriminate you from picking this train up it's a great strain and I think I've grown even more properly and under the right conditions this strain would knock you out and be in the nines and the high nines just for this what it is in this particular cut 7.2 baby alright thank you guys for watching this has been Ward your spokes and I'll see you on the next video [Music] Oh", "nYn-f4aPsyI": "hey folks I'm the CBD driver thanks for joining me today if you have not done so so far please subscribe to this channel turn those notifications on and that way you can get up-to-date information on what I have new posts out for reviews or tutorials also give me a big thumbs up if you like what you see and leave a comment down below so that I can give you guys the content you would like to see on this channel ok today's review it's a live resin from Empire Wellness this runs 70 dollars a gram and it comes in at 55 point five percent CBD per 1 gram container this is a great product that ships very discreetly and quickly and when you open up that package you'll see a glass container that has your live resin inside of it it has a screw on plastic top with the branding for empire wellness and extracts on there also the information about this product it says 55 milligrams of CBD and this this live resin is actually extracted from two different strains and that is the ACDC and Charlotte's Web strain both of these are well known for helping with epilepsy the seizures that are associated with that pain discomfort and inflammation now when you open up that size-appropriate container you will see a yellow buttery type of consistency for this live resin it's not sticky and gooey as I was expecting it it's actually a little more moist than a crumble so it's easy to just carve off a chunk of this for putting in your nail putting on a nail putting in your vape pen or whatever you choose to vaporize this with I suggest you grab a glop of this and you throw it on those vaporizers or rigs and you start vaping this stuff now the flavor the flavor I got was mixed but the majority of the flavor I got had a very nice lemons move flavor to it although there was a sweetness in there when I hit this on an electric nail and it had almost like a bubblegum type flavor but I only got that sensation just one time the nice thing about this is even though you use a small amount you can still get enormous clouds so a lot of density a lot of volume with a small amount of material I set my vaporizer pen to the medium setting and it work just fine it is very smooth the exhale also has reminiscent flavors of lemon but it doesn't stay on your tongue that long so it kind of dissipates quite quite quickly now the effects within about a minute I could feel that characteristic heaviness behind my eyes the relaxation in my neck my back my shoulders I just felt at ease and very peaceful and that sensation lasted for me maybe an hour an hour and a half I came back I took some more puffs of this from my vape pen and I was set for another couple hours I really like the product it's a relatively high priced product but I think that might be because you're taking it from two separate strains and with the co2 extraction you're just paying for the processing and where it's derived I have to give this 5 out of 5 on my dabber scale it did what I was expecting it to do the flavor was good it was smooth there was no irritation on the back of my throat no matter what and I just really liked the effects so 5 out of 5 on my dad or skill for this this is the live resin wax from Empire Wellness I will provide a link down below so you can pick some of that up coming up I have some more reviews from Empire Wellness including a 99% CBD isolate with Grape Ape turps and their auto CBD flower this doesn't have any THC but it provides quite a nice feeling when combusted alright guys thanks for viewing again subscribe if you can and stay

"xkB4784SOOM": "hey what's good everybody jay ping here checking in respectmyregion.com here today to do a quick taste test live resin vape review featuring the pineapple muffin live resin vape cart from orchid essentials so this is their gold live resin product line cartridge by pure tech project vapors are the world's first cannabis cartridges emissions tested at afner standards the highest standards in the world puretech ceramic is higher quality than competitors and offers superior flavor and user experience the pineapple muffin so we're gonna check this out i'm pretty excited because i've never had this brand before i was just introduced to it recently so it's gonna be just quite an experience so let's dive in shall we interesting enough i've been having trouble getting into some of the boxes oh there we go okay here we go so easy slide up nice big cartridge here check that out that's the oil and then just gonna twist it on to the battery that i have there they do have a custom nice powerful battery over here and then five four three two one you guys know the rules one hit wow off to the races with that one man that is delicious you've got this beautiful gold live resin inside there i can tell that it's not disliked because of the consistency and there's like this film over um you know over the glass kind of like housing for for this device um let's see taste on that first hit absolutely phenomenal i won't sit here and say that it was extremely pineapple but it was sweet it was piney it was earthy spicy citrusy and i'm definitely energized after that first hitting so second hit there it is there it is you really get that pineapple on the second one okay so 84.6 thc point two percent cbd this is a half gram uh cannabis oil cart delicious manufactured uh what is that july 23rd 2020 score out of 10 for the taste i gotta give it a really high score i'm gonna give it a 9.5 i need to know the terpenes to know what's going on somewhere here change it up make it smaller bigger whatever you got to do i got to know the terps and that kind of lets me know what exactly it is that i'm tasting otherwise it's a perfect score 9.5 add the terps to the back i know what i'm tasting it can for sure uh kind of prove what i have going on in my mouth the high that i'm probably gonna experience bam taste test through and through for that really good um there was a slight metally taste but i believe that it's just because of this battery being as powerful as it as it is so that would be 0.25 for the terps and 0.25 for the battery if there could be something different maybe there should be but i don't know at this point really solid experience very impressed score out of 100 i've got a number in my head already 95 on the taste test the packaging a little tough um one second draw cartridge contains 75 servings cannabis oil distillate and terpenes so ingredients it says cannabis oil and then in parentheses it says distillate and then it says and terpenes so is this live resin or is this a distillate in terpenes i'm not sure let's check the other one it says the same thing we could have a labeling inconsistency here um because of that i gotta give it an eight out of ten because now i'm confused and this would definitely turn me off if i were buying it because now i don't know for sure what it is if they don't know what it is i don't know what it is but aside from that 95 on the flavor the effects the potency the product appeal all those things very high but there is a major packaging and presentation issue going on causing me to drop the overall score to an 80 out of 100 so definitely be sure to tune in uh for more taste test reviews big shout out to orca you guys have a really solid item here let's figure out the packaging and get the numbers up and help the consumers understand what's going on at a higher level so they can trust what's going on here i really appreciate everybody for all the love and support be sure to

you guys peace", "7kK5OpaIgfE": "what's up guys today I got a brand new product from steezy who's gonna be the from there liquid live resin line which is a gold line they got a silver line as well this is gonna be the pineapple half gram pretty excited some species really not into the light reading game now no more try this bad boy out my old products that I've consumed in the past few weeks right here we have some live resin from raw garden you can see the TC percentage or milligrams also have some other Suzi prosthetics dizzy products you can see the chief CML is at 83 the blue purse is at 83 and this live residence 72 percent so that should be interesting and they have a brand new scratch off part where you could authenticate your product on the website just to make sure you always have the good stuff the real products so yeah let's try it out all right so he's gonna press this in and then you just kind of keep me safe alright so you can see right away this dizzy products come with some new regulations for the state of California you got the print California logo so you can see that the the oil is pretty dark for a live resin I mean not even rock gardens this dark and I so kind of throw it into the battery and try it out honestly I feel like this should have been a sativa possibly a sativa dominant hybrid but uh definitely doesn't feel like an indica I mean if your body tango I feel like a big uplifted but I'm used to steezy indicas knocking you on your ass that's pretty much where I'm trying to get at so still definitely recommend five out of five tastes five out of five hi-yah will enjoy this one try it out", "XDVDMkUthak": "all right here we are in the tent just uh it's not the top down all the pineapple charts that we got here she's doing very nice everything's everything - beep toute we're chopping her down at least three days early just looking at everything she's at the eight weeks she's at 8.5 and she's had about a week worth of flush shouldn't be too bad there's not too much going on on the bottom growth so it's been disappointing but again we made that call after what to get everything and how how dense the the canopy was we understood that so that's about it for for that we're just gonna take out all the pineapple chunks or cut through the trellis netting and get all that done pull all the pineapple chunks out we will then take the super Lemon Haze also out tyub spread everything out for the last two weeks of its life into the 3x3 exposed as much as I can on the bottom for the last two weeks see what I can do with that and bring everything in the three by three flatten out stretched out into here all follow those plants following clones so we will do all that today and that's about it I'm just going to take out the pineapple chunk chopper all up hangar and be done with that and then following a week or two once that's done and dry essentially and cured we will chop down our super Lemon Haze dry that and cure and then I will produce a video detailing the total weight between both of them now that's about it for me hope you guys are enjoy thank you guys so much for watching I really appreciate these small updates and providing them to you hopefully you guys enjoy them unfortunately there's a little bit of a little bit of like I think the canopy on the bottom is just so dense and it's just useless right now it's all large [ __ ] so I am I am a little disappointed in that I felt like I should probably the lollipop a lot more and make sure that gets done next time a little bit better if this happens again with the canopy being too large so that's alright though nothing too crazy we're gonna cry about it we're just gonna get everything done and yeah thank you guys so much for watching and you can see obviously if I had dents this is if this was all washed out properly all this will spread out properly it would consume a lot more space so you've been able to cover everything and overall get a better better coverage but that's what we'll do for the next next harvest here with the twelve plants and the three by three we'll bring them in here lay everything out flat do a small bit of defoliation since it's already done it's stretched we don't have to worry about anything too much we'll just build this tent up bring these three super Lemon Haze into the 3x3 level everything out I might put one trellis netting in the 3x3 just for the super Lemon Haze here because they're toppling over and toppling over so it definitely it definitely needs the support and that's about it but it's gonna be a little difficult so I might not do that I might just tie everything out and up to the ceiling and see how that goes I've seen that technique that's as far as that goes and yeah it would just been better to expose the center of the plant a little bit more and overall have a better exposure so yeah that's about it", "9DJDyBErCgA": "what's up guys I'm back today as you can see I'm

your on", "CAdtEFU2oy0": "sup buddy welcome back you glad you found the place well I told y'all he's gonna give you a little how-to and what's up so that's what we're going to do in this one in the last video we showed you how to prep your material in your tubes so if you ain't watch that when you trying to do this you might want to go and check that out but now let's go ahead and get on with showing you how to how to do the rest of this so what you're gonna do we've told you in the last one go ahead and refreeze your tubes after you pack them that's them over there so we've real froze them for ya bout 12 hours get your tubes ready and you get your water boiling alright so you're gonna have your water boiling on the stove and then once that starts boiling here's where all the fun starts so we come out here always always always do this outside don't ever ever ever ever try to do this anywhere covered or under anything or yeah that's I mean I ain't go I usually you know you don't have any slick baggy clothes or none of that dumb  on you know what I mean like nothing that's gonna create sparks no flannels nothing like that rubber soled shoes try to keep to a minimum so what you're gonna do is you take your hot water you put it in your square big pyrex dish right so then we float the pan that we're blowing into onto the water alright so what you're gonna do is you just float your little pan in the hot water you get your tube alright so we got our tube here it's all frosty ready to go we got our rubber bands down just a little ways from the lip you know what I mean by our cap now for this fresh frozen stuff you're going to create a whole lot of pressure that's gonna build up and if you don't do it right you'll blow this filter in a hole bunch of material another out into your pan and you don't want that so what you do to prevent that is you take like a hose clamp all right and then take your bandana and you wrap it around the tube anyway and then you take your hose clamp and you put your hose clamp around where the rubber band is usually rubber band it's like a gasket to hold the in there all right and then you always want to take something them pop down in the hole I take a little tiny metal screwdriver and poke down in the hole and clean it out and that really helps but make sure you keep that hole cleaned out and then you just go ahead and you're in two cans to 300 milliliter cans of butane they're each one of these little tubes and then after you've ran your second can you just shake your tube out into that pan there like I said you'll have to change the hot water in here about every three tubes all right so after you get it ran out into the pan and you wait till they'll be you know probably just a couple minutes and then the liquid like the actual butane liquid that's in the pan will start to evaporate off because the butane starts to evaporate I like 32 degrees or boil off it like 32 degrees so it'll start bubbling real big and then once all of the liquid is out and you're just left with the jelly oil kind of then that's when you want to blow your next tube into there and I don't never blow more than you know in a box you get about six tubes there's 12 cans so I never put more than than 12 cans so six tubes in one one pan once you get more than that it just starts to kind of saturate and you're not really it's just too much to work with but don't just keep blowing and filling the pan up always run the the butane out let the butane purge off from the heat eat before you just fill the pan up that's how you have accidents always always always keep your fire extinguisher over there and keep your assistant decide so keep all your together all right so that'll be this one that's how to blow the the next one will go ahead and run you through a little bit about how to purge it come on back now stay safe", "RyldtYtDf58": "yes yes guys are you doing it's just in Justin's world in the house so back for another fun-filled episode of you know what the Ocala bomb so a little bit of a review today guys I wanna say a little bit review its [ __ ] timing so we're back to small butts again guys but hey [ __ ] it it is something very very nice got a little bit the grind up already very very nice oh ah I'll just show you a little bit but I've got here okay and then I'll tell you a little bit about yet so guys this is pineapple chunk and I know it's a very very small buds but I'm very very lucky to have this little lady she is quite powerful full of Dairy Dairy goodness so yeah very very nice flower guys okay so basically just to start with obviously it's a Barney's farm strain it's a cross between a skunk number one I'll have to look at the other one so it's a cheese skunk number one and a barn is pineapple okay so quite strong earthy cheese pain-killing stress-relieving lots of energy very good first if you if you're suffering from sleep or not enough sleep this will help you very happy a euphoric relaxed so I find it quite strong strain to be honest with you it's very very nice a very very complex flavor okay cuz you can smell the fruit in it which is obviously coming from the pineapple you can definitely smell the cheese in there and you can definitely smell the skunk in it so all of the three crosses in this are absolutely 100% a paradise and yeah just a very small but the deal's a deal God you could smell the point upcoming friend I mean this one soon was in strength it is I think up to about 25% to change so but I don't think it knows whether it wants to be an indica or wherever it wants to be a [ __ ] sativa it's obviously just a hybrid with a nice [ __ ] punch of everything to be fair so I do feel quite energetic with this one I do feel I want to sort of do stuff and sort of get on dude I mean it's one of those not add it for a little while again Barney's farm straying I do like Barney's although some of those strains are the best as you guys might note what you actually grow out if you've actually gone on that site on BEC few problems in the gene pools but hey if you get a good one you get a good one the vanilla cushion this is [ __ ] fantastic four varnas you ever get a chance to try that one as well but yeah I first like this one again in bor\u00e5s barmy and Amsterdam oh yeah the first place I tried that which when it was relatively quite a new strain end to be fair so pineapple chunks very very nice oh right then guys so bond number one let's have a [ __ ] bomb guys get your bonsai splits out that side [ __ ] roll up with me yeah because I'm not gonna be smoking here all by myself so yes yes this is for you guys very spunky and very skunky a fruity Tony's coming through to start with and the exhale of cheese so obviously I've smoked this training for I know what it's like but hey it packs a punch because I can feel it immediately I could feel it all in my eyes I can feel it my body so all the way friend this is a strain which you know me max a bit of a [ __ ] kick if you know I'm saying always went back got coffee down here as well oh I'm in the middle today is my god cleaning that opens on one number one yeah immediate effects immediate effects feel really high really really high it's really sort of sort of taking me up there very very sleep all but you can feel the [ __ ] indica in it as well so like I say it doesn't know what it wants to be it doesn't know whether it needs to be an indica or sativa which is great I love it when they fight against each other like that and you're getting a bit of both so you're getting the relaxation of the indica in there but you are getting a very very uplifting sleep or sort of almost like a crushing energy boost with this one very very unusual to be fair I like it I like it a lot cuz I like cheese yeah I love that dairy sort thankless that you get with cheese I like the way cheese makes you feel as well you just get that really nice uplifting sort of euphoric sort of feeling with it what you get with this so those notes come in through you know from the cheese scope number one again is quite uplifting smells [ __ ] lovely and you can smell it in the ring to be fair I've got virgin media coming soon to do in store so I thought man it's very much after this [ __ ] okay I know I think I think the posters on the walls gonna give it away really knowing it so I just come clean I just come clean ask if they want Smith oh man coffee today guys Cheers as you can see that's had an effect on me very very nice have not had anything so uplifting is that for a while I don't matter lifting strains but that is really like oh it's like [ __ ] rocket have you tried pineapple chunks guys what you think about you know the mean the only leaf fly or whatever it is it's got some very very good sort of reviews you know what I mean from people we were just saying they suffer from a lot of like you know anxiety and sleeplessness and stuff like that very very good the painkiller props is a bit a very very good as well but yeah what a lineage what a lineage that you've got on that so really really impressed really really impressed with that to be fair it's at yeah sort of [ __ ] very very question effect on me in fact I'm gonna have a number one a very very light in color very nice-looking it's a little bit squished it didn't come to me in the best condition guys but hey some of the weight some of the weeds never do but it smells [ __ ] so fruity it smells so fruity and so cheesy let's go okay everything everything that is cost review can smell it you can pick them all like I really [ __ ] like that as you can tell so I hope you have a good day today what you are smoking all right there you got anything nice you'll cheer later on today so obviously I've been quite lucky to come across this little 1g surprise of this that's all I could get is a gram hey get what you get got try and make this last me today so don't think unsightly or smoking loads I'm [ __ ] not [ __ ] it well I guess erm I will review them but it's always good to look back on and see what strange you like there's a lot of my [ __ ] forget what actually smoked why she like so it will be good to look back on some of these videos as well as part of you know research purposes if you're not I mean so guys are you ready for another bomb yeah because I think I'm a by train so definitely feel the up to 25% on it definitely feel that it's a high-bred yeah I mean you can't distinguish one or the other it's both yeah that's a foot that's a fat one so check that one eh guys yes yes so football number two do you guys having a spliff I'm a big [ __ ] joke right now yeah piece one love to guys like that is strong it is you don't need many of these I don't like anything you do get used to strange quite quickly but this is this is a [ __ ] paradise to me do you mean this is a parish to me of you know mean that I've lived in but don't feel gates lock with that isn't that like all right it's just [ __ ] there it's just dad you know like when you have one and it's just really really [ __ ] satisfying it you're really satisfies you that's what it does to me absolutely such as four units of pop mate can lop lop it can not not get at all that's probably one of the best smokes are bad in a little while to be fair guys it's not the best Barney's farm strange because like I so I have trying some other bonus farms that I really really really like locust see the vanilla Kirsch you get to try it out in a pond minimum there with some ice yeah vanilla Kirsch in the mall then lots and lots of ice in your bong you have a [ __ ] two on that mate I am Telling You that's one of the most flavorful varieties the eye of Arts but a good Fino of it guys because I've had bad Pinos of the vanilla Kush as well it's got to be a good thing you know I mean you've got to pick a good one but yeah that's probably quite a memorable good bonus farm one for me but this one I per se this particular point upward choke is really good it's really [ __ ] good it almost smells like apple Minogue like they put these flavors in and it kind of like it makes you sort of go oh yeah I can smell that I can probably now sniffing that ass mumble Apple in it it smells like fresh apple not pineapple so I definitely feel I can smell a fruit today I'll just smell the cheese it again and you can smell it skunky as well so Oh how would you rate that Joey very again creative and a jet tech if you're gonna want to go out and you're gonna do activities you're gonna want to go out and do your garden and stuff like that you weren't gonna want to get [ __ ] done right in the house you just want to do some bad well you need a little bit more of an energy boost a bit of a Red Bull yeah again that's the one that's the one for you that's the type of weeds I like I don't like weeds that make me just [ __ ] you fall asleep so I can't do an affair they've got that purpose on a nighttime the heavy heavy end occurs but it's be fair once you smoke those you don't want to do anything else but [ __ ] sit down and you just your whole your motivation just goes and you know if you were at that point where you need to relax like that that's fine that's what they're for but for me I like to get [ __ ] done in a minute I've got a lot on the go so I don't want to be sleepy I want to be you know I want to be high and sort of satisfied in that sort of way but I want to also be able to get on with my [ __ ] day so I'm saying and this this strain allows me to do that so again this is a big big favorite big favorite of mine but so I love the super Lemon Haze this for the same reason they give me that same - I'm saying but this has got more pack than the super Lemon Haze let me tell you it's a lot more stronger so a lot more stronger you get more of an even balance between this is you know this is tyranny and occur in air definitely definitely three left oh I'm just wafting now anion waffling well as you know we have to have a freefall test before we actually grade it so we'll have another bomb yeah I'll let you guys get your other spliff on or jump saying like your other spliff back up if you put it bang in the ashtray Jimmy let's say quickly you can roll can you roll it as fast as I can pack a [ __ ] ball right one two three let's go you done I'm gonna choke n why ain't I so bong number Frey can just show you there is [ __ ] weed in it I'm not [ __ ] the bait yes yes so bomb number 3 let's go let's grate this [ __ ] so breathe coffee first oh I am ready let's go [Music] sexual that was [ __ ] just so satisfying just like a big [ __ ] warm cuddle just coming all arranged really fill the warps Annette really feel you know the effects lot stronger died obviously really nice taste do taste pineapple in it as you smoking it as I smell it down it smells very aptly suppose more like an apple yeah very very nice very very complex flavors but you can again you can distinguish all three of the crosses which have gone into it which i think is really really nice to be fair but sometimes you get some crosses and they don't taste like what they should be that is exactly what it says it is its point apple chunks guys so sorry about that you do is come in yeah like it euphoric energetic definitely definitely recommends buy it again with own two percent and yeah it's one of those it's one of em I went to a coffee shop Amsterdam I would definitely you know going to Barney's and I pop it I would definitely order this like definitely go in now on the menu and I would order this and obviously have it off anyway as well Joe saying so it again if we could get it again I get it definitely it's definitely one of those that you go yeah some of that it's one of those more wish ones I'm awfully now you can see the effects you know I'm saying you can see the effects feeling quite quite nice quite nice it's got a very very strong janaab say in school because the flavor of it is like a 10 out of 10 you know the smell is a 10 out of 10 100 % you know the high you know it's up there as well it's a nine out of ten I would say it's definitely creeping up there to like whatever better ones knowing I turn parents doesn't look so nice this particular but so I'd probably give this particular but probably a bite you know an eight out of ten or looks I've seen better but it was really a small little but at the end of day so the bigger bigger buds look always look better don't they so so overall it's got to get a good sort of nine out of ten really see as the pineapple chunks for Barney's farm so definitely recommend that yeah very very nice and like you say I'm gonna have a good day now and you can see the effects it's having on me it's actually a bit of a creeper as I'm talking I'll I'm a mumbling my words so I know it's [ __ ] working and this is why we don't edit on the air guys and so you can see there's from start to finish I don't want to be fake I don't want to show anything thing I just want to show it as it is basically so but guys girls all you people out there in the cannabis community a thank you so much for your support thank you

peace out guys peace one", "15bUgrAlOLg": "my name is Cheyenne I am a supervisor at cinder in Spokane Valley and today I am going to trying some pineapple chunks from Virginia company these guys are aeroponic very clean facility one of my favorite things about them is that like they said on here clean controlled and consistent I haven't had anything from Virginia company that I don't like so pretty excited about this smell is definitely one of the first things that I look for this one has a little bit of a kind of sweet almost citrusy almost citrusy kind of smell to it it's not super overpowering but it's definitely there by nice dense bud which I always look for dense but especially when it's an indica don't want it to be super flaky or like crumble apart and my fingers but want to be able to break it up by hand which this one so it's definitely a good mug so oh yeah there's some super frosty teal good job Virginia Company pineapple chunk this is supposed to be a pretty heavy indica to yourself we'll see what happens here this one's so much lighter in color than most other indicas sounds like a really light green all right my fingers are super coated and sticky [Music] Wow [Music] as very good as a very light kind of flavor to it kind of sweet but not like not like a berry sweet or like a fruity it's [Music] yeah a little bit little tiny tiny tiny bit about that citrus there definitely a couple of I feel like this is like almost kind of like a uplifting like definitely more of a lighter indicus feel than I was expecting I was expecting this to be a little bit more heavy so knee high but I actually feel kind of like energized a little bit this one is testing at twenty nine point seventeen percent well it's pretty decent I give it like a nine eight or a nine out of ten for flavor really like the way that the buds feel and it smoked really nice and definitely have a good buzz off this guy say nine nine four flavors ten for looks and appearance and overall I give it yeah a nine nose like that [Music]", "8WI42h3epM0": "a YouTube Alex here back again with another quick video this one's gonna be really quick really short and I apologize because I just made a 10 minute video doing a review on this Sour Diesel cart that I got from Moxie and the video was messed up the audio was messed up so here it is again I already opened it and just did like three or four rips off of it Moxie Sour Diesel is the strain here's the stats I'm gonna give you this really fast guys I apologize hybrid usually it's a sativa but this one it's a hybrid he goes the stats came in this nice little tube this nice little tube here was inside filled up to the top really nice you know how you know Moxie cartridges are nice really good tasting I'm buzzed it hits really nice I said just made a ten minute video and the sound was messed up for some reason I think it was because I had my laptop behind the camera and for some reason it interferes with the sound from behind because this microphone picks up from the front I don't know but yeah so I have to redo the whole video which I'm doing now Sour Diesel liquid live resin cartridge by Moxie very good stuff since our diesel tag got ripped a little bit yeah it's starting to kick in I'm feeling it I just make the video up and played it back and heard this the sound was messed up so I figured I'm gonna make another video real quick grip depend again a couple of times for you guys Sour Diesel by Moxie you guys know Sour Diesel is one of my favorites it's got a real nice like peppery earthy piney kind of taste it tastes really good yeah moxie live resin cartridges are my favorite and then the second place of course is the Cresco this Cresco live resin carts are really good too you never look at those stats real quick you see the stats the box moxie came in that nice little tube tastes really good hits really well highly recommend it Sour Diesel by Moxie live resin cartridge what can sa I'm happy with it I paid 60 bucks for this cartridge the little pricey for the half gram but I had $10 and points so I only paid 50 out-of-pocket yeah Cheers very nice let me know what you guys are smoking on this Friday down in the comment section have a good weekend this video was really short but that's alright short and sweet moxie cartridge Sour Diesel go tag I ripped off there you go you said let me know what you guys are smoking on have a good weekend that's the Moxie Sour Diesel liquid live resin cartridge have a good weekend peeps", "tt2jaAPM66I": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title we are going to be comparing live rosin and live resin first off let's get this out of the way live resin is made with bho which is a solvent and live rosin is made with no solvents then let's get that out of the way but the brands that we have in question here is raw garden and we got classics this being the live resin and this being the live rosin and i made a video on this one already but i did not make a video on this but i woke up today and i was just like i want to make a video so let's just see what i got and see what videos i can make so you know like i said i rarely get live rosin so when i do i try to make the most videos out of it as i can and once again shout out to p2ps for making this possible he gave me some funds to uh purchase some live rosin myself he didn't tell me to purchase live rosin but you know i figured you guys have been asking for me to get live rosin for quite some time now you know i don't get it all too much but when i do it's a it's a special occasion but once again shout out to p2 peeps he finally reached 1k on youtube here's hoping the 10k this year you know what i'm saying so like i said uh i did a video on this classics live rosin already but i didn't do a video on this but i would like to say that this strawberry rose from raw garden is super fire i will be giving you close-up shots and all that stuff but i would i wanted to make this video to explain the differences between live resin and live rosin because it's an only one letter difference and i feel like some people especially people get getting into cannabis or extracts and stuff don't really know what's up also take what i say with a grain of salt because i am not an expert in any way this is just me uh researching stuff from myself but live resin for those of you who don't know is basically the live and live resin means is when you harvest your plants and you flash freeze right when you harvest them instead of allowing the plant to cure over months and all that stuff and basically reduce the moisture in the plants but the initial moisture from when you just harvest the plants is the initial terpenes that you get from that live resin so right after harvesting you know how plants look super sticky when you just harvest them but then when you cure them they kind of like dry out and become less crystallized and all that stuff but when you just harvest them you flash freeze them you get all the live resin terpenes the initial terpenes that are there when you just harvest the plant usually extracted through a closed loop system using bho and all this other stuff but yeah that's generally how you make live resin live rosin on the other hand you would think you know you would just uh you know flash free some rosin or something and make it that way or maybe flash-free some plants and then just squish it but for those of you who don't know rosin is made by heat and pressure you know i've made some rosin on this channel before i use the the juice box which is a handheld rosin and basically you get a little you shape your little nug into like a hockey puck and then you squeeze the [ __ ] out of it with metal plates that are hot and in return you just get oil that squeezes out in between the metal plates and that's what you collect in terms of rosin but that is not live rosin that is flower rosin live rosin is a little bit more complicated that's probably why it costs so much more in terms you know 710 labs costing like 70 to 80 this might i add was like around 45 to 50 so still pretty pretty pricey uh but probably on the lower end of live rosins that you can get on the market uh but live rosin basically have to make ice hash which is you know you put your your your flour into like an ice bath and you shake out all the trichomes and then you filter it with micron bags and then you get like this bubble hash or bubble melt hash and then you smash it with heat and pressure and then that's the end result and the end result is a very terp terpy terp rich [ __ ] end result you know it is usually like whitish to brownish light brownish uh but the end result is very very good top of the line concentration you can get today is it's got to be live rosin so uh i figured i'd make a video comparing the two and yeah you know like i said it's not every day that i have live rosin in my inventory you know so uh i will get some close-ups on it but we're gonna be hitting it out of the smoke ski so let's just open this i do want to show you guys what they look like all right so we got the strawberry rose as you can see percentage right here eighty seven point five five percent tc not bad i will post the crosses post process but pretty much that's what it looks like i mean it's been picked up but definitely one of the the better raw garden strains that i've tried in a while you know don't get me wrong all of them taste pretty fire but this one stuck out very strong strawberry taste just all around good and then we got this one right here so this is the rosin as you can see right here the percentage of thc is not that as much as the live browsing but still very very tasty so let's open that for you guys sorry one hander so that's what it looks like not the greatest looking live rosing honestly it looks like some nasty crumble but i'll tell you right now the taste is there guys holy [ __ ] stevie really enjoyed this on the santa clara vlog those are what we're working with in this video i'm gonna take a hit of both and we're gonna see um i mean i kind of explained the differences between the two already now we're just gonna have to just hit the damn thing you know we're gonna turn on the smoke ski and uh we're just gonna let it rip i definitely used the [ __ ] out of the smoke ski yesterday so hopefully it's still running good it is that blue battery so might i add that this is awakened make as well so i won't go too too crazy but we are going to take some hits to say the least hopefully you guys have been enjoying the content lately i try my best to upload frequently so i appreciate you guys let's start that over again and uh let's take a hit so like i said i did try i tried these already strawberry rose phenomenal raw garden like uh if you're a fan of strawberry and you're a fan of raw garden i don't see why not you're not getting this uh because it's honestly one of them the raw gardens that stuck out to me most recently other guava cookies did too also but this one too so tasty still a little bit more in here i'm gonna finish that um but like i said as far as the taste goes very very refreshing uh very strong strawberry sweetness to it but as you can see it's 87 thc as well so it's definitely high up in terms of potency and the taste is there so i definitely would recommend for all you raw garden fans out there i'm saying this as i wear this sweater but good stuff let's clean that real quick let's take a hit of that all right take a hit of this live rosin about it i would like to mention is that when i put this onto the nail it kind of heats up faster than live res uh it starts bubbling quicker um i don't know if you guys notice that is too maybe it's the thinner in some ways i don't know but it just seems like it bubbles up quicker and it vaporizes quicker like starts bubbling quicker but cheers oh jesus okay there's something about live rosie it just tastes clean it could be just like the placebo of you knowing that it's solventless that you just you just think it's cleaner i don't know but it's for some reason it just tastes cleaner a lot more smoother the hits was faster that's why i cough but i feel like live rosin is but a bit more bearable in terms of uh smoothness or you know harshness so but with this video with the end of this video i will take this last hit and hopefully you did enjoy this video hopefully you learned something between the differences between live resin and live rosin because you know i would i would have loved to see someone make a video on this [ __ ] you know i'm saying i'm sure there's videos out there but there could be more you know so cheers this oh that is going to be the end of the video like i said hopefully you did learn something between the differences between live resin and live rosin you know there's a major difference in terms of price between the two so it's good that you know what makes them so different in terms of that major discrepancy and price you know what i'm saying but other than that hopefully you did enjoy the video peace out [Music] [Music] hey [Music] you", "oqaOfO5hJRs": "god shoes [Music] yep [Music] is it's like so easy it's on my keychain [Music] rather take [Music] oh my veins pop out [Music] [Laughter] [Music] moxie's kicked in full effect the rso's way kicked in and the downing dog was uh there too but check this out [Music] oh my god i got it i got it he's covered in sawdust guys", "IHVAYIwAszw": "[Music] oh yo what is going on everybody welcome back to another cartridge review of video with your boy savvy gman so if you guys haven't watched i think it's my last video not too sure when this one's gonna be uploaded but i uploaded a video where i got an exotic subscription box and inside of that box came this thing right here all right so this right here is the alien labs live resin disposable this one in particular as you can see right there it's the gelato 41 which honestly i'm super super excited about because the first ever exotic weed strain that i ever ever tried was gelato 41 from cookies back when they used to make that back in the day i think back in like what was it like 2015 2016 when they started making that and sadly they don't make it anymore but alien labs did come out with their own gelato 41 and it's a live resin disposable inside of a pod so i'm just super psyched about this because aside from the fact that it's gelato i've literally heard nothing but good things about this thing right here right literally people are claiming that it's the best live resin disposable out on the market and i think i'm going to put that to the test today all right guys so before we hop into this though i did like i said get this inside of my nug club subscription box so shout out to nug club and also i saw a picture that alien labs posted where the famous rapper gunna is over here smoking on an alien labs disposable so dude if you got rappers smoking on your thing maybe it might just be good right it might just be at least a little good all right so without further ado let's get into this gelato 41 alien labs live resin disposable let me go ahead and pop it open for you i'm actually not too sure how you even open this right here but i'm gonna go ahead and just yank this sucker out boom there you go right there boys as you go just go ahead and slide it up there's first looks of how the the thing looks right there the disposable that's the front and this right here is the back saying that you are not alone so you know stoners we're never alone there's always going to be stoners out there in the world so shout out to the packaging super super dope packaging honestly alien labs always kills it with their presentation but without further ado i'm gonna go ahead and shoot this to the side but before that the total thc percentage on this is a 66 percent with two percent um cbd and a total of 74 cannabinoids so they added a lot of terpenes into this one so i'm hoping i could get some flavor and stuff like that but yeah without further ado guys let me go ahead and show you guys how the disposable looks straight out of the box this right here is the front and then this right here is the back side honestly like i said alien labs kills it with their presentation every single time from their flower to their cartridges all that good stuff i always feel like when i'm smoking this it's like some super super fire but i'm not gonna lie dude alien labs is in the pricing range it's up there bro it's it's literally off my scale off my radar that's usually why you guys never really see videos on that it's because in my opinion it's way too overpriced but like i said let's go ahead and test this out first hit of the gelato 41 by alien labzio cheers super freaking smooth all the way through you instantly get hit in the face with the terpenes like honestly and then the airflow is phenomenal some of the hold on hold on i'm not gonna say some of the best that i've seen let me just continue to hit it and see if the airflow continues to be as good as it was on the first hit because usually there's times where after you hit the cartridge wax instantly gets clogged in the chamber and you always get restricted hits but honestly off of that first hit i'm not gonna lie man i'm not gonna you know you guys know i don't bs i always try to keep it 100 with everybody no matter if it's a paid sponsorship or not this this right here is not a paid sponsorship by the way this is 100 honest savvy g review um that first hit i like i said a lot of terpenes but going in on hit number two cheers oh wow this thing is hitting like a champ bro this this has to be so far like look i've tried so many cartridges so many disposables so many this so many that i think this disposable pod right here has to have some of the best airflow that i've ever ever had on any device or you know any piece whatsoever the airflow super magnificent honestly when you're inhaling it's just super super nice being able to get that much airflow in one single hit there's no restriction whatsoever and it's bouncing onto the flavor aspect of this though because i know this is where a lot of people want you know want my thoughts the flavor super super good i honestly it's spot on on the gelato flavor it's like it brings back memories man i haven't had like i said a gelato 41 in so freaking long but i have had other gelatos like gelato 33s etc and gelato's always have that really really deep rich taste to it and that's exactly what i'm getting out of this pod so so far so good man i honestly don't really feel too much of a head change so far and it must be because the thc is a little bit lower on the a little bit on the lower side but let's go in on hit number three and see how this thing smacks cheers super large clouds too i know you guys are seeing these freaking clouds and they're humongous i'm only taking about five to seven second rips off of this and i'm getting big huge clouds all right i love it i love the clouds you guys know me i'm a cloud chaser um but with that being said like there's just so much to talk about this all right so first off every single time that i hit it i catch myself looking at the at the device itself it's very very eye appealing all right i love the presentation of this light everything just looks super super futuristic and dope about this all right so that's the first thing that i have to get off my chest just of how dope it looks and next up so i already talked about the clouds humongous clouds that this thing produced the flavor profile is is there the gelato 41 is there definitely there i'm not really getting too much of like that regular live resin taste that i get from other pods like stizzy and things like that so that's what i like i hate i hate that flavor bro i hate that generic live resin taste that come out on people's live resins it's just so disgusting i don't like it so i'm glad that alien labs was able to cut this out and i believe i'm not too sure don't don't quote me on this but from the last time that i did my little research alien labs was their live resin is still being produced by the people over there at friendly farms i think they have a collaboration because a lot of people actually like friendly farms and the live resin that they make i'm actually a fan of it myself i think it's some of the better tasting live resin out there on the market so this could this collaboration between alien labs and friendly farms is honestly a banger so i kind of want to taste other strains just like the milky way and things like that the ones that are a little bit more on the terpier and high end of the thc side but so far for the gelato 41 like i like everything about it it's just the fact that the height is just super super subtle and i and it's nothing to do specifically with this live resin in like alone i think it's just live resins overall like i've there's never been a time where i get a live resin cartridge or a pod whatever you want to say and i've been like super super smacked like i do get that that entourage effect it's like very very mellow very calm and sedating but it's not like a boom punching your face and leave you knock down the couch like dazed off you feel me so that being said i'm going on another hit i'm not really too sure how long this video is going to be i'm out here just ranting about the pod what i like what i don't like about it usually how these cartridge reviews go but so far man i like it there's nothing bad about that about it that i can like say other than the fact that the high is just not hitting me and it's obviously just because i'm a heavy hitter dude i'm a bigger dude i've been smoking for such a longer time so it's obviously not going to get me super super bait but maybe if you're newer to the marking you cop one of these and then maybe you might get faded but with that being said let's go in on hit number four or five and should we take a blinker i'm gonna go ahead and take a blinker for you guys man shout out to shout out to the people who still take blinkers man i feel like i was i don't want to say i was the first one but i could be one of the first ones to do this on the youtube platform take blinkers so shout out to all the people that hopped on my wave after that cheers oh so smooth literally all the way through gelato 41 just sticks out so much and i it didn't taste burnt at all i think these blinkers i don't know i didn't count but they could be kept out at like seven to eight seconds and not a full 10 second blinker but that also is just to preserve the oil and to make sure that you're not burning it because i've had i've had other cartridges that i take blinkers off of it like live resins and stuff and by the end of the day you start getting like black oil coming out of the holes which is not something you really want because that just means that you're burning the heck out of your live resin so that being said guys um the overall the overall you know final thoughts on this product i have to say all right let's break this down so the flavor definitely there the terpenes hit you in the face like i mean they added almost 10 terpenes so i definitely would want to see like taste the taste but like i said it is there you definitely get that gelato 41 taste and next up the high like i said the height is just very very mellow it's like i feel the head change but it's not like a boom slapping in your face high that you get with distillate and other type of waxes like the live resin as you guys know gives you the full entourage effect and that's what i'm getting it's very very mellow and not too much to say not too much hype around the high but the overall production of this disposable i have to say it's actually freaking dope and i could see why some people hopped on the wave but me personally i don't think i would see myself copying this more in the future just because of the fact that it doesn't get me too baked um maybe if they come out with some crazy cross flavors then i'll probably go ahead and try another one but for what it is man it's good but it's definitely not something that i would be going after again but yeah let me know down in the comments below what you guys think if you guys have ever tried one of these disposables i know a lot of my fans or supporters i must say you guys always talk about this one in specific and say that it's like the best out on the market is it the best on the market i guess in the category of live resins this could be one of the best out on the market i don't know if it's the best on the market but definitely one of the better ones just based off the overall build quality and the overall taste and yeah man alien labs is definitely one of those brands that you can never pass up on you know they're going to be making some fire so with that being said i'm gonna go ahead and end out this review here if you guys enjoyed today's video do me one last favor we're trying to hit 50k bro let's try to hit 50k asap within this next month and yeah just hit that subscribe button hit the like hit the comments and we'll catch you guys on the next video", "m0LvVdJk1mM": "was known on youtube Jamie are we back in the garden detect a look at our pineapple chunks see what it's looking like our structure as you can see me after planet tied down in multiple areas around that planet as you can see and I was to open the point up so it's a push out and as you can see be successful we did that as you can see through here you have a nice structure to the point let's get over the top of this look at this very nice it's a beautiful green you see the only teal tops all over this planet over as you can see the canopy that's filled in in the middle here everything is catching up as you can see pretty much so a pretty even canopy all the way around just this better lightning is catching up a little bit so once this gets up right here will it be pretty good you know I will be taking clothes off of this girl soon and you know I'll get about four or five phones off of her and then nothing I'll throw her in the flower I think she's probably at the perfect size to be morning I was a little bit you know see those two spots were their tops it's been topped here there's my tough over here it's topped over here topped over here it's been top so many places it's hard to find oh right here so probably on the top this planet maybe one more time go throu top everything and in about a week or two drawer into flower I've got a pretty decent sized stalk you probably see one of those roots we will come in here take a couple clothes and clean it up in here on the stuff that we know that's not gonna get any light and just try to focus on everything that's up here you know so I'll probably come in and take everything for my bar here so it comes to take everything from abroad here and try to get my clones I'll fold it in another few weeks go ahead and throw her a flower I'm thinking I should get the half a foot to a foot growth out of it and then the next couple weeks out of these t fives all blue spectrum with it and if I can get that I'll be very happy hopefully I get a pretty nice stretching to flower and I might throw a trellis on it straw get out probably the two of them one to help you know keep it opened up and then another to help support the bus once they start flowering as you were seeing the other than our seven gonna part we don't you know I didn't put enough dirt in it as you see and everything is looking at you before I just wanted to let you guys see this plant will show you really well everything is gone we switched over to the blue planet nutrients and everything is safe to be like everything we can sit back here and as you can see Titanic is pretty full and everything is pretty much eaten was in the back there might be one a hair or two Salah but pretty much everything even when I go over on the top everything on the outside and let the metal growing a little more we're gonna have them I'm pretty I'm taking you can have a pretty good yield out of this plane hopefully you get about a half a pound that's gonna be our goal for this planet half pound pineapple shape that's what we're going for so I'm I started recording videos once a week just on this pineapple chunks more for about a half a pound that's my goal I won't be too mad with you know six ounces but if I can get a half a pound off this planet I felt like I did a great job so I want to just keep this thing and cruise control and keep feeding what I'm feeding it and basically you know get this thing going over to flower and get the party started start getting some nuts in here and you got some nut shots and some flower videos so you know so like subscribe share help grow the channel you know once we get 1,200 subscribers we will be having a giveaway and I think I'm gonna be giving away beans simonize beans so you know like coming and subscribe guys you know help to channel out and you know get to that giveaway so I don't know yeah you know I got some hey 707 headband and some perpetrating wreck some jock hair she also got a diesel Matic Otto flower so you know I give away a few beans and you know that's pretty much everything guys also let me show you this right here are th suebob we did LS t it today and we also the least it a little bit let them them tops get some white also I read LST they're already starting to turn up so you know but I didn't pull up one over again as you can see we're going on the plant show you all the bunches we got tying it down over here yeah a lot of whites just started opening this sprout up got these tops over here I got this blocking this one so I'm gonna come in here and we're just going to squeeze and take that leap off allow this these two spots to get it a little bit more light so they can grow up and we're coming in here also take this one off so I can get a little bit more light coverage over here in this area and let these nodes start growing up even with the rest of the just with the place so that's pretty much everything guys hope you enjoyed the video you know leave a thumbs up for me if you if you liked it thumbs down if you don't like it comments you know doc criticism you know help whatever you got for me you know information I'm willing to you know learn you know and you know if it's something I like you know maybe who knows I might add it in so till next time guys peace out eight pound fine up eight pounds pineapple chunk that's what we're going for peace", "rQmE9SfVFdE": "what is good everybody Richie Rich Great Lakes cannabis club man we're back in this garden dude check out my garden here it's a 4x4 grow room - we've got the 2001 Mars hydro TSW 2000 in there check out the bottoms of these girls we got them all tied down got him trained went to the rope Method Man's kind of combination and everything I've been doing I kind of like the way that is this pineapple chunk here is stretched right out you can see she's growing pretty nice man they're probably on week 4 so there's a whole G cush in the back let's get to this cush man here this thing's finishing up week seven starting we gave this weekend and I thought she started changing colors on her leaves thinking she's you know finishing up and all and it was more of a gold color I mean I don't know if you could see this on here but everything started like turning brown and gold man and I I was like sweet it's finishing up well came home yesterday and this girl here started doing the same exact thing well I had this damn light probably 18 inches off of these plants and I'm pretty sure that I burned on them so then watching all your guys's video everybody's got their lights up pretty good distance so we went ahead and raised everything up we still got a little ways to go up if we need to but I think I need to raise my lights up just kind of learning my craft and kind of just trying to learn as we go man so I could have actually had those lights turned up pretty good dude check out that shot there but these girls are going pretty good man I feel like if I train them a little better um I can get more than 30 grams per plant which seems to be right about my average sometimes I get 30 for some time to get there - but we're just gonna call that 30 grams per plant which I don't feel like that's very good so let me know what you guys average getting off per plant it doesn't matter if I put it in a three gallon five gallon seven gallon getting about thirty to thirty grams and so anyway we're gonna either try to increase that or maybe I just put 16 plants in here and just grow plants so anyway let's get you over the veg area man I just kind of did some reconfiguring and we changed layout just a little bit check out all these clones I got here just pulled some out of the cloner tonight all those little one gallons here man this ones these girls are doing pretty good I need to get ready some for flowers so we're gonna show you I got two experimental girls back in here man they're in ten gallon pots man we're gonna that's Big Mama and chocolate mint og back there went ahead and took these skin off of my 4x4 tent just to give me some more room hung that light down there maybe get some under lighting somehow some way or some low light for some of these clones just kind of experimenting man that's what we do on this channel we just keep switching it up and trying to hone in our craft so it's important to label everything man I probably got about six of these girls here that just say unknown cuz my dumb ass can't you know always write down what I'm taking it off of so as you can see hopefully everything going for it we'll have some type of ID marker on them I like the little ones that go around the bottom so I'm gonna look into getting some of those but yeah man these are my bed girls trying to get it all out so I can just get my clone making process down so be interesting what these gonna look like in a couple weeks so anyway man that's my veg garden that's my flower garden let me know what you guys are doing Richie Rich later", "c9p8j4tiK0Q": "[Music] hey everyone eric here from peer pressure it has been a while since we've gotten a chance to do solventless review really excited to sit down with pyramid today and review their pineapple chunk live rosin pax pod it is great as a quick disclaimer as a part of our protocols we check everyone's temperature and do contact tracing so this interview was conducted without masks just wanted to explain that we're trying to keep everything above board so it's nice and safe for these interviews all right watch on thanks for joining us today i had the pleasure of reviewing pyramids pineapple chunk hybrid solventless rosin pod these pods are 100 hash rosin which makes the flavor profile and effect vastly superior to other ones out there that i've gotten to try the pineapple chunk is a really nice hybrid very middle of the road effect wise and you would expect it to be pretty fruity but in this case we found that it was really hashy when i was smoking it it really reminded me of some old-school bubble hash that we used to put on bolt hoppers so one of the coolest things about these pyramid pods is that they're actually taking advantage of paxpod's smartpod technology which means that when you connect it with the app on your phone it's going to tell you all kinds of cool things about the strain but that it's also got pre-loaded temperature settings right onto it so if you take a small rip it's going to run at a very low temperature preserving your terpenes or if you really want to go for it it can also ramp the temperature up so you can blow a huge cloud overall this technology is really really cool so the color is really nice the effect is not going to put you to sleep it's not going to get you up and excited it's a nice mid-time day high that you can kind of just ride out wherever you're going and like i said before the pineapple notes are pretty minimal what you're really getting in this card or at least what i found was a lovely hashy kind of sweet flavor that came through and just boosted my day it's a nice break from whatever's going on in your day at that moment and it's really easy to consume with these packs of vaporizers eric here with peer pressure really excited to have pyramid on the show we're going to do some intros and then start talking about hash canvas processing everything and then we'll start talking about these products so let's start off with jake tell us a little bit about yourself hey eric thanks for having us today um yeah my name is jake berry i started pyramid with my business partner coley walsh about six years ago now um i moved out here originally from texas after graduating from college and i um started off as a button in the industry um that was my first gig here and i quickly realized that you know what i really want to move into the extraction side of things and we i really saw a niche there that i feel i felt like we could kind of build a brand around now um at that point vape pens were really just getting started and it quickly became one of my favorite ways to smoke as a blood tender and i just saw the growth happening and you know coley was actually my boss at the dispensary and you know talking to him i was like hey why don't we why don't we look into this why don't we why don't we do this you know i feel like i can find the funding for us to do this and get this up and going yeah and um so we did we started looking around for different licenses and back then i mean it was nightmarish to find a new thing um you know to get into the industry was very difficult and [Music] just googling and going through different municipalities web pages i found the city of we ridge it was the second city i called um and asked them about it and it turns out they were having a lottery within 30 days so um it had just been announced and like happenstance it happened to stumble upon it started applying for and doing the application i had never done something like this in my life um and kind of had to quickly figure things out at that point cole and i were both still working at the dispensary while trying to do all this on our days off finished the app got it in and happened to win the lottery and here you are and here we are now that's incredible uh and matt tell us a little bit about yourself uh what got you in the industry and what do you do at pyramid i'm matt cease i'm the lab manager at pyramid i've been there for about a year and a half now i got my start out in the garage my cousin was growing and he just needed somebody to do some extractions unfortunately butane none of that was like an option so it was all just bubble hash and rosin started with a hair straightener and five gallon bubble bags and it's just grown from there wow cool so in your role as the lab manager at pyramid what kinds of extraction and processes do you oversee now supercritical co2 okay all the ethanol post extraction the winterization distillation we run white film and also overseeing all the solvents cool okay and you guys are mainly focused on bubble hash and rosin you guys do any sift we don't do any sift unfortunately we tried to do sift in the beginning but all of our product just kind of came out dark okay so not the way you guys wanted the route we wanted to go okay cool so jake you started as a bud tender now you're running your own company with coley does it look like being the ceo of pyramid put us in your shoes running a cannabis company what does that look like um you know i think a lot of people think it's this super glamorous job and you know it's actually a lot of work um you know i would say both of us um you know we're five years in now and we're both probably averaging 60 to 70 hours a week typically um you know i wake up at 6 00 a.m i am at work no later than 8 30 and i stay till you know six seven sometimes and so it's a very busy um job and uh but it's super rewarding and that's the great part like i go to work every day and i love my job and so i feel like i hit the lottery like the hours don't matter you know it's super enjoyable um but it's just it's also just exciting like everything like my feeling and my favorite part personally is launching these new products you know getting into uh the solventless side of the thing like of the industry was something very interesting for for me to do in launch this is just my favorite like parts of being the ceo is saying you know giving the company a vision and saying look this is where i see us going this is something that i think we want to do and launch you know and not everything works out you know you can definitely have those you know stinkers happen but um the rising line is going well you know it was something that we really wanted to get into and it's going great and similarly to us going into michigan yeah you know so no that's awesome and you know for a follow-up to that you know what are some of the pieces of advice that you would give to someone who wants to be a cannabis business owner you know what what would you offer to someone who's either trying to get into it or is at the very beginning stage you know now you're five years deep you know um don't get intimidated it's a very very intimidating um experience you know i was 23 when i got into the so you're very young yeah i'm 29 now um and it's very intimidating especially if you don't have a lot of that you know experience and background but just be confident and and continue to stay humble throughout the process because you're going to get hit honestly like along the way so just kind of like keep persevering and working hard and you know don't focus on the little things you know there's a lot bigger fish to fry in the day and like if you get caught up on every everything along the way you know it's you're never going to get there so just focus on what on your goal and and keep working towards it and eventually it'll happen well it sounds like you've built a good team around you you know are there any aspects of team building or like you know bringing on the right lab manager to do the work is there anything that's worth mentioning there definitely um the industry is an interesting place to work in um you know there's a lot of bosses out there that you know might not connect with their employees i think um and so it kind of goes back to that being humble part that i was mentioning yeah you know start this and and work hard towards it but build that relationship with the people you work with you know i'm no i'm nobody in this in the grand scheme of things you know like i i'm more showing up to work every day and working and you know i want to hire people that want to come to work every day that are happy and excited and can feel like that they can connect with me more you know they see me working every day yeah so hopefully that inspires them to also come here and work and show up and so hiring the right people is super key yeah but keep that family mentality um and that's something that i learned from my parents you know and like my culture of just keeping that cohesive bond between everybody and so you know i try to say hello to everybody whenever i come to work every day and um and um i would say people should do that you know if they're looking to start something yeah so word of the y's for everyone who's listening uh pay attention to your company culture obviously that can make all the difference honestly it'll make it break you your company culture is so so important um you know like our christmas parties are like my favorite thing to do every single year it's like we play good yeah we play um white elephant and it's just fun it's it's a good time to let loose everybody to just kind of poke from each other and that's the other thing don't take yourself too seriously i really don't take myself too seriously i mean look at my you know joke around with people you know have those experiences and and be be relatable once you think you're better than anybody else you're gonna very easily no longer be able to succeed especially in this industry yeah so no that that's great advice matt you know to shift gears a little bit tell me about what a day in the life looks like of you the lab manager managing all these different processes all these extraction methods and then you know solvent lists at the end of the day being perhaps your top shelf product you know what what is what does a day look like for you it is extremely busy i'll start off by saying that that's true everything has to be done very very particularly like very peculiar with everything that's done cleanliness i mean just that alone takes up a huge part of the day a lot of people don't focus a lot on that but anything that your product touches it gets on your product it's in the end product people are smoking it it's just not good for anybody but the lab starts off you know you turn the lights on you fire up all the machines and it's just making sure that nothing's broken first so like a lot a lot of our equipment's running overnight with a super critical co2 extraction you know matt is constantly like reloading the equipment setting it up for running it and then he has to set up a run for overnight so you know in order to kind of reach our goals and and keep up with the production of all of our sales you know he's got to be on point all day long you know a lot of people think that it's just kind of come to work and get high and hang out and no and that's like ass buster yeah yeah it's unbelievable yeah that's not the industry you know and so um if that's what you think is happening here you know that that's not the case you know everybody who works for a pyramid works incredibly hard and um you know and and we try to keep that environment going for them so we get in the lab turn on the lights make sure everything's still functioning properly and following that it's redoing the process that you did the day before all of it's the most labor-intensive job i think i've ever had i really i have a hard time even describing like where i start and where i end but it's always changing too it's like and there's always a new fire there's a new problem every single day that you have to solve it's like being a detective a mechanic and then a scientist you're definitely not a scientist right away you're not a chemist you come in and it's okay what's broken all right let me pull out the wrenches let me pull out the tools let's fix this machine and then as you're fixing that machine chances are something somewhere else is just not going perfectly so you bounce around the lab constantly it's like a ping pong ball and then introducing solvent list to our line actually kind of let me slow down a lot the process is much more much more connected i would say like actually getting to wash you know you're in touch with everything in tune with everything and then when you get to the rosin press it takes finesse throughout the press isn't something you go up to and go and pull the handle and get beautiful rosin it's actually a lot of finesse a lot a lot of finesse well that's really interesting and you know talking about connecting with the plant connecting with solvent lists you know why did you guys bring solvent lists on in the first place and i i'd love to get both of your perspectives on this i mean i'm sure you were advocating for it as someone who started off doing ice water hash absolutely no it was mainly the quality you can't you can't reach the uh the terpene profile on anything else in my opinion than you can with live rosin it tastes so true to the plant and it brings me back to kind of like the original days when i first started smoking weed it has that real true wheat taste when i smoke some concentrates they almost all taste the same to me a little bit like vho co2 extractions there's slight differences but each strain has the same particular taste to them with live rosin i've noticed it brings out way more of the flavors that you don't originally notice yeah and i would have to agree with him completely there you know i remember when i first started smoking you know a long time time ago now um it was so exciting to like experience the next the next bag the next pickup you know and um and just try something new and fill a different experience yeah and i i i kind of agree with what matt's saying is concentrates you can definitely notice the self differences but i think a lot of it's harder for people to with certain things that you just with rosin especially with live rosin um it's extremely pronounced exactly essentially and i'm immediately pronounced um and you know everything every wash is different and you know and kind of going back to original question you know yeah you know matt was pushing for something you know and coley and i at the same time we're looking for kind of that we wanted that high-end option as part of our portfolio of different things that we offer and um with our relationship with pax and just like our vape experiences we felt like we could really kind of bring something new um and you know we wanted that that option so it was kind of a mixture of you know matt's experience with bubble hash prior to and saying you know this is something that's becoming a thing me kind of realizing that it's on the come up as well and uh saying you know what let's produce this new high-end product um for our consumers so that's awesome and you know when you're thinking about making a solvent-less product as the lab manager what are you trying to look at is it you know intense strain selection are you guys sourcing specific things from your own garden you know walk me through a little bit how you select the strains that you do that you decide to wash and process mostly it's trial and error unfortunately we do small test washes on things if we need to find out what the yields will be and stuff like that from our grow you know we had some really good things like cherry cake wedding cake uh we've been running this pineapple chunk that we were just playing here today was something that that yielded on the really low side unfortunately but the quality of it is just so good that yeah you can't had to go for it you have to yeah and uh yeah and and i guess you know i i do a lot of the sourcing in the material okay you know um and we've attended some of y'all's classes actually and um and and heard advice from you all you know you guys are the experts honestly at the end of the day you guys have been doing this for a long time and that kind of moves our strength selection um to a certain degree and but finding those relationships of those quality growers is difficult you know and so we have a very small grow um and uh our product typically that comes out of there washes really well i think a lot of that's attributed to the growing style and the lights that we use we use three fifteen watt leds we've got flour under them and the turkey profile comes you know at the end of flowers really really good and so um yeah the yields are very low but transferring that flower into rosin um it tends to come through exceptionally without it rises brings the quality up that much higher yeah that's why i personally believe i mean i noticed it on our other extraction methods as well is that um the lights matter so much um you know from outdoor to greenhouse to you know uh hbs lights to um lec's um there's such a unique difference that you kind of noticed from being in the industry for so long um and but otherwise yeah you know i mean we can only provide a little bit amount of what we produce so we've got to go to outside sources and find and make those relationships with different grow facilities that can provide us that high quality material so and when you get some high quality material that jake has said you know hey man we're getting the strain in you know let's go for it how do you guys decide which solidless products you're going to turn it into for example you know we've got pax pods with us we've got some grams of some live rosin you know do you make a determination beforehand of where you want that material to go we just started doing the grams so it's not even we haven't released it to the market yet all right everyone exclusive coming out in the next couple weeks realistically so we're actually going to start running and pressing a lot more than we have been um to release these these grams okay so it's been pods first and now we're getting into grams yes sir cool and how what what does that look like are you guys thinking about pretty much just doing live rosin uh what what does that release look like it'll just just be live rosin um the big thing is we haven't really gotten to do too much testing on making sauces or batters and what we're going to do yet whether it's going to be just a crumble uh it's going to come fresh off the press so we still have to work out some kinks there i'm guessing it probably some r d that went into getting these pens right um yeah absolutely yeah that was a huge struggle i mean figuring all that out and pins are not easy like yeah hey no we can be honest about that and you know i think everyone who's tuned in and watching now you know we're not here to tell everyone that making a rosin pen is something that you can just pick up and do on day one so for the rosin pens specifically what were some of the hurdles that you guys went through to now come out with what is an award-winning product getting everything off the press and out of the bags like washing is super easy doing the rosin press was super easy getting the actual oil into the carts and the pods and getting them to flow correctly and hit correctly was by far the most part like the most difficult part that we had and that's just the viscosity getting you know getting the viscosity i mean as you know when your first comes off the press most of it's still thca so it's going to crystallize it's going to butter up and in order to flow in a cart you need it to be liquid so it has to be de-carbed back into thc and when you're doing that there's just there's a lot of problems that can arise so it took you guys definitely some trial and error uh some missteps but now we're at a point where you guys have a product that it looks like you're super proud of absolutely yeah you know and i i think you know some of the to expound on what matt was saying is the terpene retention you know what do people want out of rosin they want it to taste it's amazing the best product they've ever had closest to the plant yeah getting that right on that post process after the press is so integral to like what we do to make a quality product and i mean that took him long long time to figure it out uh just to keep that terpene retention and then beyond that yeah filling is is a whole different thing this isn't like this you know i can't crank the heat up and pump it in a cart yeah and have it flow well you know and so um there's still trial and error in that you know it's like you gotta it takes a while to really dial it in and um we feel like we've gotten into a pretty good spot right now obviously we release the product but there's always ways we can improve upon our process so i'd love to hear from you matt you know you said that this was one of the first pens that you guys made and it won an award tell us a little bit about the trophy we've got on the table here and what the story is behind that one yeah so this was a face-off og it was actually our very first wash in our new wash machine it was our very first time on the rosin press first time trying to de-carve things into a cart so there was there was a lot of lost face-off og grams yeah i apologize to them but um yeah it's it you know it's a really difficult process but we're here today you know we got everything dialed in yeah that's that's a cool story yeah considering it's our first watch we're i mean we were surprised when it came through you know it was it was something where we were i mean i i think i was pushing that we were in the middle of developing this product and release and we wanted to get it in before um this competition and you know i was you know on the back of matt saying get this going let's go let's go let's let's be let's enter this you know hopefully we'll something good will come out of it and it happened to and it happened to be his first wash which is ridiculous in itself but super happy no that's awesome to see you guys hitting a home run like that tell me a little bit about your relationship with pax you know we've got some products here you guys are putting your rosin pens in pax pods uh walk me through that sure um so we've been a pax partner for i think going on two years now two and a half years um and we launched with obviously our other products and pax you know provides the hardware provides the battery you know the actual pod system but you know everything that's inside of that you're smoking is is directly from us or any of the other partners that are on the platform um we there was no rosin on that platform at all and that's where we really saw like a good way to to get in and you know we wanted to launch this so this is actually the first rosin pod packs anything um in in the market in colorado no just in nature nationwide yeah this is the first rosin pax pod that you can consume very cool um and so we saw that kind of that lane that we wanted to get into that we kind of went along with our goal of you know having a really high end product that we could sell and we figured pairing it with like our packs you know distributorship was a really good move and so that's kind of how we got there um but yeah you know these things aren't the same either you know like a 510 cart is much different than a pack spot and we have different feeling techniques for each of those options um and so there's a lot of r d on that back end too that like our production manager aaron really had to play around with to figure out how to make these work well you know you don't want someone to get a product to try it and not work and so figuring that out was was difficult yeah so you and aaron were working hard to bring these products here today all right so we've got pineapple chunk rosin on deck both in live rosin pax pod form as well as grams uh how did this strain fall into your hands it starts off in house with our grow and then i hand select the nugs that we're going to use to wash we hand wash i don't advise anybody to use a drill in a paddle it's just just don't do it it's not worth it it's going to waste your time following that we throw them in a two and a half well actually we from there we select which trichomes are going to be the best to press you don't want to just i mean you can mix all of your all of your bubble hash selections together but you're not going to get the greatest quality that you could by selecting which trichomes are better which in this case was the 90 to 120 micron range following that selection they go in the freeze dryer we freeze dry them yeah and then we load them up in two and a half by nine pure pressure bags set them on the peer pressure pike's peak version yeah and we press it around 180 185 degrees i like to press until the oil will start to darken up or pretty much you can tell by as you're adding pressure you'll see possibly the oil darkening up a little bit i like to stop right around that point yeah and that's a lot of trial and error though i mean yeah it varies honestly not even from strange terrain each press will vary like i said it's a lot of finesse when you're working the press it's not something you just pull the handle and you get your perfect oil but so there's some trial and error there you know as far as the grow since you know we talk so much about growing and how important that obviously is for all forms of extraction but especially solventless tell me a little bit about your grow and you know how you guys got a product this good yeah so um all the genetics we've gotten have been from growers around uh colorado um we fl we we grow in a deep water culture system so we use a current culture system um and then we fly under 351 lec's we really feel like the end product while you might not get as big of yields like you know bigger buds we definitely get a higher quality product like in our wash specifically or in our extracts because we don't really sell any weight um all of it goes right into our process um so we either process it into our you know distillates or we process it into our co2 oil or now a lot of it's going right to fresh frozen so um you know the harvest is very very important really knowing what you're doing there is it is key to making the wash go well um you want to harvest right away you know a lot of people think that oh it's okay to you know buck these buds and let them sit here while i finish this harvest no you want to go very very quickly and go um on a plant my plant basis almost um you know you really don't want them to be sitting around for any more than 20 30 minutes so wow so it's a quick d fan um you know all right in the stock and then you buck the buds very quickly um everything we cure is in turkey bags typically and that's kind of what we do for our fresh resin as well so you know pluck buck bag and throw it in the freezer immediately it's very important um to not get too much water cotton content because it definitely will affect the wash on the back end oh so you guys have it nailed down that was almost like a little limerick i i like that so we've got pineapple chunk with us what are some strains that you guys like to smoke start with you matt i've got a weird palette personally one of my favorites right now is mandarin dreams i absolutely love that strange i mean it just sounds nice i also love bananas anything with banana in it is always a go-to for me and then cheese bio cheese any kind of cheese uk cheese i love cheese cheese okay cheesy terms i can't get enough cheese that's awesome what about you uh you know i'm big on the cheese game too um cheese quake is like one of my favorite strains ever um i haven't seen her around in a long time um i don't know how little washes we haven't gotten a chance to watch something like that but i also really like a lot of sub cool genetics personally um so like space queen is amazing crossed with anything jelly bean nine pound hammer jelly beans my favorites hands down yeah and um that's one strain that i really want to wash um and so that'll be coming in the pipeline too awesome so that's kind of yeah that's my favorite strain we're gonna do it at some point okay okay that's right i think you get a decision in there you know i would also love to learn you know before we right before we get into the review here you know let's wrap this up with tell me a little bit about what does pyramid stand for like what are your guys's philosophies um you know it's a very difficult question especially put into words um you know when coley and i started out we you know we were just trying to to get get things going and you know it was really hard to to kind of figure out what we wanted to stand for as a company and you know i think the biggest thing that kind of we look for and and that we want like our message to be is we just want to be a good place to work you know i feel like a lot of people are very unsatisfied in their life and and we want people to enjoy coming to work with us you know not for us but with us on this and so you know beyond that um you know personally like i really like um kind of able to you know expand upon my heritage and and show that you know minorities can be successful in this space um and uh and so i think that's something that we really have going for us there is um anybody can can get into this you know it doesn't have to be one person the other so you know we really are interested in in working with communities of color yeah um and you know that's kind of one of the big things we're doing in michigan specifically we're working in a um kind of a lower income area and bring jobs bring jobs to those areas you know bring business back into these areas that have you know over time have have gotten the shorten the stick here um and so you know i i wouldn't say we have a you know i'm not the marketing guy who's gonna tell you this is our philosophy this is our mantra sure i think it's more of just like inside of us yeah this is kind of who we are as people and we want this to come through on our business side as well so yeah that i mean that's a great explanation jake walk me through what do we have on the table here uh and what are we gonna review so today we are going to review our um pineapple chunk live rosin pods um we don't have a rate today so we'll kind of just let you guys look at bigger hams um and then we're also going to kind of show you guys the newest tech coming out of packs that a lot of people have not experienced or seen yet cool um and so i'll kind of review through that real quick okay yeah please show me break it out um all right so you know pax right now um just released this product it is the pax era pro they've added a lot of really cool tech into this product that is is very new uh i love the packaging to start off with yeah and then honestly the feel of it is is it's it's really premium you know i think pax really wants to be that apple of um of uh vaporizers and i think magnetic lid yeah all right they've put uh they've put some thought into this okay and even there you know yeah shows yeah very well thought out packaging um i really like the new finish on the actual product um and they've done a lot of different things with it now so you actually get some color options which didn't exist before okay um so we've got silver we've got a red a jade and a traditional black i like the silver a lot nice um very clean yep so they've added usbc um charging to so they've kind of upgraded the charging it's fast charged so um throw it in your car you know or you take it out to a hike and it's not ready it's gonna be ready weight is almost nothing which is very cool very cool um and some of the features they've added to it are really nice um they have the traditional child proof usage on here you know you connect it to your phone yeah and it's going to be child proof so your kid can't can't mess with it which i think is a really awesome feature for a lot of people totally um and then some of the what i really like though is that so if you look at all of our pods you really wouldn't really notice it let's crack one of these up real quick please i was hoping we might um okay so yeah so this is our packaging so we really wanted to go with a more um hash head feel to it yeah if you you know we want it to be we really like our packaging to look fun yeah and that's kind of the direction we're going with a lot of things and so we wanted to kind of give you that rosin feel to it that that fresh press and that's kind of how we came up with this yeah with the director this it's very different for us um and so inside the child proof packaging you'll find a a pot obviously pull it out check it out all right and now you are saying child proof often i want to make sure just pop this baby right in there oh it's vibrating and lighting up so no it knows yeah that's another cool feature is the haptic feedback um so you know you plug it into your new era pro and it will vibrate you know like hey this is this is so is this primed and ready to go is there anything else i need to do here uh no go for it okay cool these are very childhood yeah good you guys you guys got your packaging down and you know as a marketing person i'm i'm very appreciative of aesthetics and uh this this got some to spare so you can definitely take a hit um there's three different settings that we load on these pods so these pods are actually smart pods now so tell me what does that mean smart pod okay so in-house so we what we do is you know we fill the pod and then we tag them okay so whenever you buy a new pod it'll have this red band around it when you pull it into your air pro and you have your app on your phone it'll literally show you like this is a pyramid pod so it'll have our logo okay we'll get the description of the strain it'll tell you the potencies so you know that's one thing that i hate about you know our 510 carts is like you forget what you're smoking a lot of the time so you know we have it engraved on the pod but also when you plug it in it's going to give you description of the strain um and then beyond that um we have an expert temp that we set it to and then you also have a load temp automatically set in a high temp so if you really want that high vapor production with you don't care too much about the turbine preservation yeah you can bump it'll bump up automatically or you can set to like our typical temperature so where am i at right now um you know i think you're probably right in the middle okay realistically because voltage obviously very important part of getting a good grip with a solventless pen specifically and usually lower voltage lower temperature you know if i'm going to spend the money to really get a premium vape i'm not just trying to cook all my terps well i think that's a huge benefit to the pax platform is that you know if you're you know if you're that hashtag and you're looking for that really high quality product using a 510 card is usually not gonna get you there um unless you're using a very expensive battery to get there yeah where this really allows you to dial in your high um and dial in the experience you want to get you know we can take it really low and you're going to get that really good flavor almost like a dry vape yeah um but you're not going to get that that that big cloud so typically i like to pump it up a little bit okay um to get that experience right away well i've sat and heard so much about this strain let's [Music] hmm that's really good i mean it it's interesting because with a vape sometimes you never kind of know what you're gonna get and there's a lot of information there's a lot of education and you know especially with the vape crisis that was you know in full swing last year like having a real nice solvent-less vape like this i i really like the experience especially the rosin experience um out of this i mean it's really hard to replicate a true dab in vape form i think that's what what people criticize vape a lot for yeah people want the convenience especially the purists the purest yeah you know they kind of hate on vape a lot and we're really trying to get these p get those individuals who want that high quality product yeah onto a vaporizing platform and that's what our raw our live rosin pods do especially on the pax platform yeah you know just kind of taking this experience in you know it's it's fruity but it's also got something else behind it like it's very smooth and sometimes some of the really high terpene fruit strains that they're not quite as smooth as what i'm getting in this and you know kind of as it's starting to settle in a little bit and i know you know i didn't blow some monster cloud for everyone on the camera but just you know really enjoying you know having a fine vape it you know for me when i consume it it's not always just about flexing on our video it's about really just having an experience with the products itself um yeah it's great i mean honestly this is the closest you're gonna get to a dab in a vape form um no [ __ ] um i don't know if they can say that but no [ __ ] it's um we could square on our youtube channel this is for adults uh and um it's really good and i i this is pretty much all i smoke now honestly on our platform is our rosin line yeah um just because i think the flavor profile is unmatched among vaporizers and um it's always interesting to try something new yeah so well if i could describe you know after taking a couple hits some real small ones some bigger ones i mean it's fruity i get a little taste of pineapple in there there's almost something in there that is a little more savory and i'm having a hard time putting my finger on it but there's there it it's a strain that's got some depth and i like that um and as far as like the actual experience goes of using this it's it's very seamless um i'm a big fan pineapple trunk great choice on this one you guys uh i just want to smoke this all day this is a tough one well i'm glad you like it you know um we'll definitely get you some samples of some other strains to enjoy and um yeah i'm really glad you're experiencing having a good experience this is a great product thank you guys so much for coming in uh you know the review today obviously the sullivan's pax pod but for those of you out there who also really just want to take a dab and that's the experience you want to have we've also got grams here as well and you guys are going to be doing limited drops of those starting soon is that right yeah yeah that's a plan you know it's been a really popular option and so you know we definitely know that the consumers that are most interested in that are looking for those super premium you know product drops and that's what we're planning on doing um this isn't going to be like a widely available product for us unless it goes absolutely amazing which i think it will so we'll eventually start working work up to it

i have to say i'm a big fan of the pineapple chunk it's not super fruity but it's a little sweet it's a little savory it has this quality to it that's a little hard to put my finger on but it's a strain that just has these hash overtones mixed with that pineapple that fruit and that's a stray that's a type that i really like uh just that hashy flavor on the exhale it's a good smoke it's a smooth smooth rip the pax is sweet i hadn't seen that pen before all in all great product and they're 50 in colorado so i believe perhaps the least expensive true 100 solvent-less vape on the market

thumbs down and we're like dude what the [ __ ] anyways right um we come back with some more heat from one plant and more misinformation oh yeah i got plenty of that you can also find instagram.com let's move on um so we got two different versions of their live rosin we got the live ros and live ros and jam both in fish whistle i've never tried to jam and i'm really excited yeah so we're gonna try both of them do a little bit of comparison uh they're both pretty fire but let's get down to it man uh if you guys haven't seen any of the jam uh it's super super saucy has a beautiful consistency it's like little tiny diamonds in terp sauce and yes that is one thing that's stunned stunned stunned stuck out the most was the overbearing like pungentness uh live rosin has it their cold cure smells a little bit better than the fresh press of course but this [ __ ] sauce right here is amazing yeah look at that here's a picture right here he said yeah but anyways man the consistency and the terpenes of this is just so [ __ ] delicious great it's all ready to come back in a little bit sorry technical difficulties we experienced [ __ ] all right let's get this moving but uh i can already put a good number on this but don't ruin it for me i'm excited you guys get to see the first time experience dude i guess try any of the jam i tried to but yeah this is the second type that i've tried i've tried the safety meeting before and that was amazing that's still funny to me when you hit this oh actually when i hit the safety meeting it gave me the safety yeah it gave me like a band of sweat like around my head dude it felt like i don't know i was just sweating my whole head was on fire this thing's hot i better wait i thought this jamie jam needs them low temps yeah i got this many now ready to go whenever man i know that's right rock on you got a minion hill then you're like me and you're [ __ ] around all right i like my torch though man my blades are kicks ass dude yeah awesome man i want to give a big shout out to exotic tools on instagram he has some of the coolest custom dab tools that i've ever seen go check him out he cuts [ __ ] [ __ ] good deals dude and nothing is sweet i want a big shout out to amazon for this 12 pack of like 15 [ __ ] things are great dude i got so many damn damn tools and my skillet cost as much as the whole pack let's get it man terms up turns down baby i mean yeah that was better than the rosin i think see i'm out with been outraged about two days and that's why i really wanted to put them both in one video to do a major comparison oh okay well there we go this live roster is really good but the jam compared to it man what the [ __ ] jam there's no [ __ ] jam it was the jam dude that is some jam there's no [ __ ] to it dude that was really good you look like applesauce i like it i haven't found a quality website to check the um the coas of any of this or any of the terp levels so if you guys do have a link to that please send it to us i didn't try too hard but we tried tried point point okay yeah dude i got highest [ __ ] off that that's amazing oh my god obviously the jam is more intense effects i think because i don't remember fish which will be this that's what i'm saying like this literally makes my eyelids heavy it makes me like this i remember more of a sativa effect from the my fish was rising you know you feel like the top of the head like [ __ ] hot feeling this is similar to the mac one feeling almost yeah from the regular rosin i will still say mac one tastes better yes yes yes but i feel like this one had more taste you know i mean in abundance but you know it's all about the terps bro exactly so all about the charts yeah and i feel like i had more terps yeah man i gotta give a shout out man by the way if you guys want one of these badass terps up tugs down t-shirts we got them for sale man we have them available small medium large and xl all still in stock what size is that one this is large usually i'll wear xl shirt and this large one fits me good so uh what's up shop accordingly yeah twenty dollars plus shipping and handling and it could be yours we'll get them to you man uh put it down in the comments section hit us up with magic equality gmail.com or the dms instagram we'll make sure to contact you man get you the life saving water for sure by the way if you guys don't know what terps up terps down is that is like our refutation to cheers i feel like cheers is for beers man and uh terp subtypes down that's for the dads yeah you raise the turks you drop the turks and you make things happen you know what i'm saying that's how i feel about it that's it that's how we created that yeah man [ __ ] we're stoned dude that [ __ ] was good i feel like i'm just rambling anyways let's get down to the good information [ __ ] gotta promote anyway all right you guys are back for my misinformation there we go chef but i have grandma's eyebrows and not my and i'm kidding anyways guys if you want to see nice the fresh press of the fish whistle here it is that's nice i like the way it looks when it looks like this looks like hot before it's got a little bubble where's always looks this right here i honestly enjoyed it i wish our fresh press looked like that true true there's a lot that's why let's go buy some stairs [ __ ] there anyways i actually preferred the oxidized version of this for when it was nice and cured check this out right here this was like some butter and honestly the smell intensified a lot and i really enjoyed that smell scotch tandy that was nasty [ __ ] i just hit like that with jammie jam dude that jammy jam was a jammy jam it was some jammie jambo that was some really good jam but i really want some definitely try out this fish whistle to top it off the live frosting not the live rose and jam which they are they are still the still the same thing that it says yeah the same strain different you know part of the extract or foreign they let it settle yeah i'm not sure what differentiates that part there's some there's your misinformation for the today we don't understand exactly the difference between misinformation when he finds the word of the day he's like yeah wow and then just peeled off the bottom of it when it's oxidized it really does look like let's get it man shout out to one plant shout out to exotic tools once again shout out to minnie now shout out amazon let's get this [ __ ] rolling shout out to all you [ __ ] up church down yes sir right off the bat i like the jam better i want mac one jam i wouldn't way too much yeah yeah i thought they didn't want you guys to see the cheers in my eyes [ __ ] all right guys now i have solid numbers to tell you this rosin's coming in with a solid eight you know what i'm saying but that brother jam's like a nine yeah the fish whistle more like ross jam eight this morning having all of them because now we're getting into more [ __ ] so we have a wider scope of what we're looking at in my opinion exactly i just thought about that's what i was about to say too the um now that we've actually had a little bit of variety in our life um i definitely have to agree with you there on eight man uh but that jam is definitely a 10 out of 10. jim has a product yes 10 out of 10 but that strange specifically i feel like i feel like back one or like runs will be better yeah oh my god some runs jam dude oh damn and the big thing is it it's the same strain right honestly that's super crumbly i just dumped a little bit of eyebrows into my hand that was frivolous guys i told you it gets like that man oh god look at that i'm a piece of [ __ ] see it turns to crumble and oxidizes i guess putting a cap on this [ __ ] whoa i'm sweating my ass off that was a good hit all right man so anyways the difference is actually a lot wow i didn't know that the live rosin is sitting at 70 but the live browsing jam is sitting at 75 percent that may be the big difference right there and once again we said we don't have a way to check the terp levels so i feel like the gym is way more saucier though most definitely the jam tasted way better um i feel like i got a better hit off of it too i also waited for my finger to cool down like i'm supposed to overall i'm [ __ ] super strong worry about that awesome awesome definitely get that man or just you know if you just prefer just grab blazer either way if you can't afford another one use sizzle pay use quad pay we've talked about that in multiple other episodes they should pay us check out our other reviews man we definitely [ __ ] commercial guys we're gonna hook it up man but it sounds like we got some hell breaking loose in the other rooms we got here man make sure you hit that like make sure

guys well I filmed the part 1 to this video this is actually my second tube the pineapple express fresh frozen run but it's about youtuber I am being this finally third video I didn't realize I was filming vertical not horizontal so video quality in my opinion doesn't cut it so now we're going to pack the tube and be ready for round number 2 you can be played around with the frozen stuff because there's a lot of air gap how it was back so repack the job a little more revealing than dry material that's for sure that your runs come on smaller obviously because it's uh material which takes up more space you all right she's loaded down then I didn't get her on the machine all right so we got number two to the pineapple express fresh frozen installed on the machine and all of our gas lines hooked up the first line obviously that column getting hooked up to the vacuum pump to suck everything down so that's what we're gonna do next it's back everything down to open it back in all right so we're backed all the way down got the gas line hooked up to propane tank nano scale is zeroed out we're ready to dump some Tang in this [ __ ] why would I love the sound of that flow into : you on average it holds nine pounds of it in fresh material when I'm running in private Ariel told me about six never II was saying about that dead space in there let's go ahead and finish filling out up I imagine it'll be like 9.3 year so and we all let it sit and soak for a few minutes before we open that huge dump valve right there at the camera focus there we go yeah just settling out right now see in a few all right well this is where I settle down I do dump it or another eight to ten minutes right now a just drip down into the collection punt and I also freshened up the hot water bath just let me just pressure after the tank a little bit that way every covers a little faster oh my god Dino's flip the propane tank and fire you all right well we're ready to disconnect and since we're only doing two runs today we go ahead and register but first things first well it's still partially frozen easy and of course is where it gets long again so we'll speed this part up again you alright I'll finally make the TV scrape the I personally don't pour my rooms I recovered a night review time as I can because black grade became again early snorting expensive Pacific so we want to cover their absolutely as much as the butane program you there actually is enough there that I am going to pour just because there's not much not because it's that liquid you / little thicker than I know I like to do but a lot thicker than the home enough to do with the rest of my little slick cars are already being used in heaven right now make do with what you got go ahead and pull a hot shelf out of the

you can tell it's super [ __ ] goopy i'm gonna try to keep it as level as i possibly can jesus christ dude the whole room just reeks of garlic trying to do this without spilling any there's literally just like a straight up layer of turp juice on top of it we're gonna mix this up a little bit make sure all those diamonds and terps get mixed together nicely just look how gloopy it is you guys this stuff's so hard to handle on a dabber bloop but it's fire i love the function of this recycler that's the perfect little drain let's get our dab ready i'm not kidding when i say this stuff's running you guys you really want to make sure you have a dabber that has some sort of scoop on it so you can make sure you get a decently sized dab all right let's go you guys [Music] this [ __ ] is crazy you guys i know i talk about garlic cookies a lot on my channel but the aroma and the flavor that you get from this is [ __ ] nuts like that aftertaste just stays for so long the dab is gone i've already taken it but i can still just taste that insane garlicky feeling and these are some great effects too i swear to god that one dab does the job but this is some live resin sauce most people just call it sauce though it's a pretty popular form of concentrate there's a lot of different terms to describe extracts like shatter butter batter crumble sauce diamond sugar the list goes on and on these names are used to describe the consistency and the malleability of the concentrate not the quality everyone has a preference on their favorite consistency but none are just bad off of the consistency so just don't overthink it when it comes to quality of an extract it really just comes to what the quality of the product is going into it and the knowledge and experience of the person who's actually doing the extraction process it's not like chatter means bad sugar means good but sauce is a pretty popular form of concentrate if you've been to a few dispensaries you've probably seen it or if you know a few plugs they probably got it it looks like a million tiny rocks swimming in a pool of like yellowy ambery liquid diamonds are their own form of concentrate typically they're on the bigger side and much less terpy where sauce is usually super tiny diamonds sometimes there's a couple big rocks in there but usually it's so small where you really can't even see them mixed with a crazy amount of terpenes but those little tiny diamonds are where the cannabinoids are so that's where majority of the thc is stored and the liquid portion is live resin terpenes so there's a super high percentage of terpenes in there and a super low percentage of cannabinoids which is why it's perfect to mix the two so the sauce might not get you very high alone but when you mix it with those diamonds it just packs a punch you get pretty [ __ ] lit and the terpenes add an additional entourage effect so it really does add an additional kick to the thc but i say it's time to take another dab [Music] uh oh [ __ ] this drink feels so awkward to hold i'm not gonna lie oh my god that train is [ __ ] crazy oh [ __ ] those terpenes are always super [ __ ] heavy on sauce so i usually try to make sure i get the strains i like when i pick it up i know i said that they're all pretty much the same thing but the main difference between sauce and every other strain is that it has like the most intense terpene profile plenty of other concentrates of high terpene profiles but the most overwhelmingly high is typically sauce and the terpene profile on this one is [ __ ] insane it's five point seven percent mercy and almost five percent carry off i mean four point five percent limiting and that's just the top three it's total terpenes is 18.4 if i did my math right like that's a lot of terps sugar also has a high terpene profile but it's a little bit more easy to work with let me open this jar real quick and show you what it looks like for those who don't know all right this is a fresh gram of bubba kush sugar as you can see it's still terpy but there's more of like a solid consistency to it there's still some sauce in there but there's much bigger diamonds that are a little bit easier to handle and work with these two are made of exactly the same stuff but have a completely different consistency but the main downsides the sauce in my opinion or how liquidy it is like i just said you really can't keep it in a hot environment you can't put it on its side for a long period of time and it's hard to work with on a dabber at least if you like big dabs like using a little needle like this would be so hard even using a scooper like this you really can't get too fat of a dab but looks are deceiving with sauce and sugar in my opinion if you're used to just only dab and shatter and you really haven't experienced sauce or sugar like you really don't realize how fat of a dab you're taking if you just scoop up a giant bit of it but again not all sauce looks exactly like this sometimes sauce looks like a mixture between the two concentrates that just showed you where they have a couple big rocks in there but it's majority that like super small diamond but a lot of companies really aren't that great labeling this stuff i bought some sauce before that was just straight up sugar i've bought some butter before that was sauce there's a little bit of like subjectiveness that comes to it where they're like i mean it's sugar but it's super terpy so let's just call it sauce they do try to label it as accurately as they can so that you can get a good idea for what you're going to consume nobody likes pissed off customers so they try to make it as accurate as they can but i'd be lying if i said i've never had it be a little off but to the people that are new to dabbing and see all these consistencies and get confused and just don't know which one to try i just say try them all it's the best way to find out which one you like and which one you don't and it's like none of these are bad technically so you can try shatter you can try sauce you can try butter and you can see which one you like the best but i say we take one more dab before we head out of here this time i'm not gonna use the diver though personally this is my favorite way to dab sauce hey that's fire now that's the right way to dab sauce a lot of people message me and ask me to like clarify what consistency of concentrate they have it's mostly people that get it from the black market because it's not labeled but i feel like i might start a series where i go from concentrate to concentrate and just kind of show them off let me know if that's something you'd like to see in the comments below but click like if you enjoyed this video if you made it this far you probably did and leave a comment let me know if you want me to make this a series and if so what concentrate should i do next don't say live rosin i already have a whole [ __ ] video on live browsing

there's that little package that comes in it's pretty dope these are a little bit more expensive than your usual sauce these go for like 50 to 60 bucks so i'm just checking it out before you go and purchase it or you may have already purchased it but either way we just want to go ahead and let y'all know what i think about it real quick so uh went ahead and opened it open it up pretty nicely so that you guys can check out the packaging this is the container comes in alien labs gelato 41 look at that look at that color though it almost looks like rosin but it's live resin sugar so um for a treat right here looks very light very light very smelly too very fruity got that mango smell kind of a banana smell too just fruity in particular so uh yeah i'm looking forward to trying out this alien last gelato 41 with you guys real quick here uh this gelato 41 is a cross of sunset sherbert with uh thin mints girl scout cookies so pretty interesting cross um i had it in the fridge just like to be a little stable but it definitely has that sauce consistency it moves around a lot so you may have a little bit of trouble putting it into whatever finger or bowl you're going to put it in i keep it easy and simple in my carta cleaned it nice and fresh just for this review i went ahead and put a good little size uh dab in there a little rice size i'm going to go ahead and put this at the lowest temperature because i noticed it's very consistent with that saucy saucy consistency so put it at a low temp i noticed that's what works better for me so uh there we go alien labs to model 41 let's see what the hype is all about oh man definitely a good flavor on that inhale and that exhale not harsh at all good flavor definitely i'm getting some real good fruity tones that's why it's gelato gelato never goes wrong sick i want to believe their packaging is always dope alien 78 thc pretty high zero percent cbd damn some tasty tasty sauce just with that hit definitely got to my head my body could feel my eyes getting a little lower i know for sure if i took a second dab i'll be on point before now we'll just take one so we can keep it chill like i said 50 to 60 bucks for four grand would i buy it again depends on the situation i'm not saying it's not worth it it is a little bit more expensive than your usual but hey you know to each its own so if you want to try out gelato

[Music] peace", "7jTt35Eu8cE": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another Ursa cartridge you know I'm very very happy although I did spend a little bit more than expected because I went to fee knows and it's not authentic and authentic when they had it it was $40 but at vinos it's 55 but I really wanted a cartridge so I was like [ __ ] it I'll pay $15 extra and you see if I'm not lying right here I mean the tax is killing me it was the one it's $41 without the tax but then it was like 54 with it so yeah definitely one of the the pricier cartridges I'm actually at a park right now I'm actually gonna hit a few in the car just because you know it's easier that way and then I'm gonna walk around and hit the cartridge - just to prove that I'm in a [ __ ] park okay guys [ __ ] Park [ __ ] park brother so let's just open this thing like I mean you guys already know the deal bros like I've opened this not this one but okay okay [Music] I didn't want to [ __ ] pull out the cap you know accidentally Laureus yes dope or battery I do have my dad's mate and do not have the magnetic piece on it so I'm just gonna use the side where it's cruising cheers boys who that wasn't even a blinker right this is a blueberry muffin in oh my god that show taste a pretty [ __ ] [Music] god damn holy moly cracker mode damn [Music] this is probably the the smoothest cartridge I've hit in a while if not the best or the smoothest the taste is there everything is there like I liked when I tried the first person car it was from the homie Chiron and he had ice cream cake which is a strain I didn't really enjoy as much this one has a sweeter taste of more blueberry taste obviously it's blueberry muffins and it's actually quite pleasant what [ __ ] it was just like [ __ ] the stats let's just read this [ __ ] right here so we got THC we're coming in at seventy two point one two percent it was packaged and manufactured on the channel on January 30th 2020 Best Buy same date but 2021 one gram all that good stuff not gonna lie it [ __ ] this [ __ ] hits so what I am going to do now pocket this water you can see right here guys very nice Park it's very nice outside I was actually getting pretty [ __ ] hot in that car I'm not gonna lie I want to go over there and smoke you see that boys that little stairway [ __ ] let's go there no one there and we can take some hits on the way to boys that's the thing about cartridges you could bring that [ __ ] anywhere and take a fat hit and especially with a cart like this that hits like a [ __ ] dab rig like it's a game-changer it really is you know like I honestly can't stress that enough you know cartridges are getting better just like technology with the mores I believe it's Moore's law where technology gets better every six months and technology is in everything when it comes to vapes computer it's anything you know I'm saying like the hits aren't that fat right now what you just take off let me see if I can take you about that the camera turned off let me see if I can take a little a little fatter hit damn well yeah I wanted to do I wanted to get my own orsa you know after Chiron showed me his I was just like damn there's just no way I cannot just try this muhfuckas and not buy my own it did take some a long time I would say about a month or something but it's only because Ursa hasn't been that much available in my area and it's probably something I won't buy that much often you know because $55 for a gram cartridge I know it's a it's average in LA but in Modesto that's not average that's a above average so you know I do enjoy it though I really really do enjoy it very very tasty you get the whole terpene profile of the of the strain which is good you know I wanna take one more hit for you guys I'm probably gonna call it a video hopefully you guys enjoyed it you and also in the car you could actually see the smoke thickened out here it's very spread out it's not a really good visual representation of actually how much I'm hitting but these are fat hits don't get me wrong but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I really enjoyed hitting this to be honest and making this video it's a nice [ __ ] day outside and hopefully you're having a good day so far peace out expecting company but that's ok cos don't try to prove", "5sfu9UO9ZSc": "what - what is up guys we got the Tahoe GTH CA sand and I would say for you to take it off - chill out before you flip it over because if the sand

I smelled the grassroots though that grassroots that was some strong smelling stuff him super strong let's go get the pumpkin try that subscribe button and the like button you guys they're searching around everywhere I don't know where my dabber is I cleaned the puffs caught wiped it all out it's totally clean so we should get a perfectly nice clean good head this is the only Davor I got as a screwdriver but I'll show work I hate I can't do this left-handed I thought you guys seen I haven't even tried this yet you know works pretty good that's only a half gram I mean not stable they hook us up this is a fat half gram that's why I grabbed it again I thought I didn't know it was a different flavor because I had the regular THC ace and so I wasn't sure if it was I thought it was the same the go GOG but I had they handed it to me and it was different I was like aha heck yeah all right it's gonna see the meltdown I guess we'll show it to you see if we miss out there oh that's wrong where she goes eh-eh Sam Wow amazing taste stop mark burns quick it's like it's smooth that makes it caught buck holy crap oh gee it's an OG so it's got in there for sure definitely filled in to come

tonight you guys Rock thanks for subscribing thanks for watching if you see this any anyone the go GOG was good I want to say the go GOG tasted better than this one but it works me my mom's we're gonna rekt one more little little box look and peace", "JAw7QYRpUDE": "so we have our dab station here with Andrew we have three different companies that brought us different sauces and stuff talking trees pink lemonade live resin is what I'm going with first love the live res and protect the whole plant apex has brought us some beautiful things papaya and very Caribbean of us I can't wait to try it I'm excited for that a lotta gelotti's always delicious heck yeah and then nug brought some diamond yeah diamonds strawberry-banana diamonds oh yeah look at that over 80% right now badass yeah diamonds awesome yeah so we're gonna try the talking trees pink like look lemonade live resin can't wait to do a dab because I'm not drinking tonight very exciting excellent thanks Angie yeah so this right now is just a be nails email set up it's called their Trinity series so this is a quartz dish so you're gonna get the best flavor possible nice I always prefer quartz right low temp dabs quartz and then this little recycler pulls it on up through and a little cyclone motion so it's pretty fun really easy on the lungs and not gonna splash in your mouth when you're in your dab so that's what we like to keep it clean fresh and at a low temperature so you're taking a DAB before yes alright just making sure ma'am so you ready yep go ahead I'm gonna pull for you beautiful cranky right oh wow does that taste code goodness yeah pink lemonade live resin from talking trees okay I can have another one of those oh we do okay perfect then I'll wait for the next one we're going to the whole lineup I love this game yes please what we got from apex next apex we have possio possio let's go this guy's looking free from oh my god get the fuel coming off of that yeah it's fantastic let me get you a little fresher on here gonna clean this bad boy out for a second fresh tastier q-tip industries never thought they would good day yeah all right a little basket here cheers my friend let me know when to pull for you so yeah it's the fuel absolutely yeah it's good very different for the pink lemon absolutely oh yeah yeah you can smell that just knows alone something on the diamond love a diamond boys best friends also here we go yeah this one holy [ __ ] yeah that smells like strawberry banana wow this is a strawberry banana turf diamonds from nug I love my job you ready all right Cheers on number three the turf diamonds [Music] smooth goodness Wow so yeah this and a couple other devices alongside with us too we also have the vape exhale here if you haven't seen this device before it is a rig that is all electronic full vapor pattered they the vapor path is all glass all the way up through so you get the cleanest hit possible so you have to come by and try this yeah wait I've run through them all again yeah yeah got all the best devices here tonight all quartz dishes man so you're gonna get the best taste and that's no test for that for sheer cost I mean that terpenes off the nodes match the terpenes and your mouth is amazing how it's all best of the best ready to talk about Turkey and speaking of terpenes actually over here we have the true terpenes these are some of their most expensive terpene combinations that they have available this one on the end is one of my favorites balancing its found in Valencia oranges mainly you get your nose on that man that for that ounce right there is four hundred and thirteen dollars in that little vial Wow one of the more rare and what do you do with this so you would I'm just using this tonight as a nose exercise so we're kind of pairing this with some of the concentrates so you get a nice sensory experience you smell some of the terpenes go to along side with it can really affect what you taste after you smell like that once you trigger that in your brain for sampling but all wine guys yeah or we could take a little dip of the Terps and mix it into your concentrate to give you a little bit of it I am you'll hold out I'll be this first round those works saving the big stuff for later my friend for a big diamond yeah example thanks Ange I appreciate that no problem I can't wait to go back typically this is gonna be the workhorse right so this is gonna be banging out the dabs super quick in and out depending on how long the line is but as far as taste goes I don't really have one that's better than another it's gonna be depending on the experience that you want right so if you want more of a traditional nail and rig experience come to this guy if you want something brand new try the vape exhale I would go this route this one does deliver a much bigger hit with a our amount of concentrate so this one is also good for beginners too so you can just take a tiny tiny little hit off of it and walk away and be okay with that so you don't have to finish all of your your dab out of something like this over here and then this guy we have a nail with a torch so depending on if we are allowed to have open flame in here or not we'll figure that out and that will dictate how this one runs tonight so kind of giving a hodgepodge of different devices and experiences for people in the night at the Groff I can't believe this", "_cBnbmY67EU": "[Music] alright you might have seen the intro already but I wanted to open this because I'm actually outside Blake's house and the lighting in his room isn't the best and he's always playing music so I figure I just opened this right now and the only reason I want to do this right now is begin not at home is because I actually want them to try it as well you know I want to share with them I want them to know what they think of it you know I'm saying so I wanted to do the opening right now and then I will do the review at home by myself later on so if you do see me like you know in a car and then a mouse that's what happened guys we're just gonna be looking at it okay so this was bought at phenols I believe it was $28 and it's white Tahoe cookies and it's live resin butter know what threw me off was filled is usually a lot more expensive but then when they said butter I was like oh you know I'm saying because when it comes to the type of concentrate that actually costs a lot of money because butter is part of like the easiest concentrate to make other than probably rosin you know rosin very simple but you do need expensive gear and stuff the butter is generally pretty easy you know I'm saying so that's why it was only like 25 dollars a gram I noticed that the THC percentage is pretty low but like I said it doesn't really matter about just THC you know there's other things involved and it's live resin so it should be some terpenes up in there to kick it up a notch so let's just open this I don't want to just kind of keep the box nice and Christine for the what I'd a bit or a later I might just rip it cuz [ __ ] it gets a box right care about a box but yeah why Tahoe cookies has been I've talked about it on this channel before oh wow very very nice I've tried some of the fields stuff before as well I have never tried their cartridge though what the hell what off the bat I really like the packaging this is very very easy sheet look at this [ __ ] you could [ __ ] have this on like a shoe design you know and be dope that's pretty [ __ ] dope dice oh wow it looks like wow I'm actually pretty surprised I wasn't expecting this I haven't empty said butter I thought it'd be like a crumble ish but it's like a light color which I really enjoy okay 20 I'm gonna say $28 maybe 27 I don't know around there but Wow okay excu a look at it first let me get the thumbnail get the thumbnails always yeah alright guys back at my house I am going to continue the review of this field extract white Tahoe cookies no I'm saying if I already opened the box and all that before I went to play Xcel's but now that we're at home we're gonna finish this review off drop the bat low very very nice packaging I did not keep the dab tool that it came with I gave it to Blake but this slip is pretty good like yeah they were actually impressed like I gave money a hit and then he was like I'm about to go there right now even though he just went to the club like two hours we'll hope that honestly says a lot filled extracts usually is a pretty expensive to you know very very creamy creamy looking we're just gonna take a hit since they're gaming right now I'm probably just gonna mute them for now I'm saying but that was RJ and Ben on the game you know saying so we're gonna take a hit of this and then we're just gonna tell you a little bit more about the product itself I'm saying not bad I'm like oh I feel the extracts usually they have that sauce that kind of looks like a sugar wax sugar sauce see wax you know I'm saying you know boys [Music] [Music] very very clean taste very smooth - for a hit that I just took like that size I usually would be coughing but very very pleasant not to like chirpy but you can definitely taste like a slight hint of like like some cookies you know some very earthy pungent I don't know how else to describe it but it's a very familiar taste and not bad like first price and I've always wanted to do like a field extracts video or another one after that because I kind of did like it it was just too pricey but yes another thing I like to mention is I mentioned this on most of my videos but the price that I get it it's not the price that you're gonna get out depending on where you are so please be aware of that I don't want to steer you in the wrong way you know just because I get it for 29 doesn't that mean you'll get it for you know what hopefully you do get it for 29 and yeah other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video just another product video hope you guys can understand this is pretty good stuff I'm not gonna lie other than that have a great day [Music]", "74HJydMO_jI": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "QdsvSdeoXbQ": "welcome to the blind taste terp challenge this time i have king's garden wifi cake gelato ice cream cake and purple mama [Music] they are all butters i'm gonna mark them with some stickers and see if i can match the name of the strain with the taste of the terp i'm also gonna rank them which one i prefer best to the least let's crack them out of the case and get the dab and go all right here we go first hit the king's garden i got the yellow or gold i say hello hello [Music] [Music] feel like a mild taste [Music] i'll go gelato [Music] all right we got the blue fatty on there [Music] [Music] uh [Music] i guess why buy cake on that one good taste to it [Music] all right here we go with the green i just took a dab of it and i wasn't recording so double dabbing this one [Music] [Music] it's really tasty a little hotter on that one the head i just took it it was the perfect tent which sucks didn't suck that was a perfect temp except that you're gonna get that perfect note like i had see i do get a little purple taste on this one so i chose purple mama taste wise i still feel like the one before was a little better so i'm gonna put it in between so it's gonna be second place for now all right final hit see this one's got a different case big old plastic with the pink not sure i feel about the plastic please [Music] a little fatty there [Music] [Music] ugh [Music] well i got ice cream cake left [Music] i'm going that i'm gonna put it in third place [Music] stay tuned for the reload okay time for the results so over here with the blue i guess it was wi-fi nope we have gelato so that one was wrong green i guess purple mamba [Music] mamba that one's correct and the pink case i guessed ice cream cake ice cream cake it is so it's too correct [Music] this one's obviously wrong then wi-fi cake [Music] there you have it all right here's the rankings coming in first place i got this one wrong this is gelato [Music] coming in second place that was the close between coming into first purple mamba coming in third place ice cream cake that one's in the big old plastic they're all plastic but these ones have a little white coming in last wi-fi cake it's kind of surprising because this one actually costs five dollars more [Music] [Applause] probably they overcharged me for one five bucks we have it the king's garden two out of four not bad they're all pretty much kind of the same with just a little bit of difference the smells are really good on all of them i'll probably put these in some glass jars especially this one thanks for tuning in see you next time you", "790iHK19SlY": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive kind of think of it every day is a good day to be like alright guys thank you for another video your boy Shaka if you don't know who I am my name is Shaka Zulu if you see my videos you haven't subscribed yet please subscribe subscribe and if you're new to the channel subscribe cos right I'm always coming with a good vibe doesn't love my videos mat now you might not love it you might love it I don't know keep watching and you'll find out but today as you can see from the title I bought I basically bought a live turkey and cart and I bought a live resin cart and I thought the live terpene cart was a live resin cart because when I went into the dispensary I went to a dispensary out and I think my desk I can't remember what the dismiss of his name was but when I went out to the dispensary I asked can I get one of your life resin what kind of life resins you got and she showed me the live it was a live terpenes actually it wasn't my present so I decided to do research on it and find out what's the difference between a live resin car in the live terpene cart so that's what you guys are going to get today but before I get into that this [ __ ] truck is made how [ __ ] I hope you guys can [ __ ] hear me but you already know your plea kind of start this off without bond rip you guys [Applause] [Music] buddy you gotta start to vlog off right with a bomb grip diet but yeah I'm probably gonna get out the car actually cuz I want to show you guys you're not wearing that to park that I'm app so cuz if you guys are on quarantine and you're scared to come outside or you just don't want to come outside you want to be extra safe I want y'all to get to see you know where I'm at so you feel like you're outside you feel me so you feel like you outside get your join get your bongs and go on a little walk with me out here and we're gonna talk about this live resin and live Terps guys but before that let me I got one more thing to tell you guys I'm coming off on 400 subscribers when I hit 500 subs I'm gonna do a Q&A video so if you have any Q&A questions put them down below I'm gonna try not to answer your questions I'm used to just answering people's questions so make it a serious question maybe even say it's a Q&A question if you can but if not I'll like it I'll like it but I won't reply and the reason why I'm not replying is because I want it to be a Q&A question for I want to save up some Q&A questions basically for my video but um let me get out here let me get my wax pan get that live resin I'm smoking on the the nut rot live resin it's berries and cream I forgot to say it in my video last time what the strain name actually was but it's berries and cream [ __ ] way go hi guys all right guys [Music] it's actually a good amount of people out here but I'm still working under a willow tree hopefully you can see I give you a quick overview all right guys the first difference is each stretch it's different than like you know your typical shatter crumble turps because it's two different extractions it's the process it's called a freeze frozen process where they extract and extract the wax before they actually care all right so when you chop down the plan you skip the whole curing process it helps preserve the terms and it also gives it that you know that flavor profile that comes straight from the flower that I roam that days you know I mean preserves all that although they do here the plant when they make terpenes on the other hand I'm gonna talk about terpenes now they the turps cards the live turf cards are usually way more fresh and are cleaner and less harsh on your throat because they take out the fats and the lip nodes the lip node another difference also up to is you can see the layer of terpenes in the jar when they make a so like you can actually take a dab of that term because the THC content is way different in fibrous and I think it's a less THC content so it but it gives you more but if I'm wrong people tell me I'm not I'm just going off of what I've been reading about the live resin and in the Terps the live resin turps because I do have a car a live resin Terp cart I got this car is called freak n abisco I think it's called I'll show you guys later but I haven't tried to get live resin nut cart you fit me snot Benz obviously prefer libraries and more than flavors and herbs but imma try both for both II for you guys but that's all I really know know about my present look at the difference between libraries and in terms I'm not I don't know that much more if you guys have any more information for sure put that [ __ ] down in the comments you guys already know I check out cuz I want to learn more about the libraries in interns honestly and the different methods of extracting because I've been one to make my own some [ __ ] to get like a press and make my own I'll be like next level but we'll see what's up but I'm going to show you guys that cart before I go cart it actually looks alright it looks like fish Jilla to me obviously because dish hill is more lighter and darker but it's the terms I honestly need to look up with this still it is someone comment the difference between dis jillion terms in the comments please I need to know all right guys see I'm gonna show you guys in a man let's help Wendy can't get a good like hit I hope you guys can see me it's kind of dark like cuz it feels like it's gonna rain but might not rain just gorgeous [Music] freak a nabisco freak a nabisco [Music] see the live resin is way way more darker than the live resin turps but it's still cool I mean we won't find out if it's good I'm gonna be honest with you guys if it's not good I'm not will tell you guys [Music] don't forget to Like comment subscribe more videos to come if you guys want me to try I guess I am gonna try it but man shout out to whoever told me I forgot who it was and my comments but you told me to try these now that's the reason why I got it I'm gonna try it out for you also I forgot to tell you guys if you made it to enter this video I'm just asking guys you know cuz 4:20 you can't really do anything you can't really go out anywhere I plan to go house somewhere but but you can't even go out anywhere right now so what do you guys want to see for 4/20 I kind of got some ideas got some edibles the con huh I think that's how you say I'm not sure hon huh no cannabis infused indica pink lemonade and I got freakin strawberry ones put all together this is 400 milligrams and I'm thinking about you need on 420 I'm showing you guys like how high yeah [ __ ] so loaded on that day I'm gonna make a vlog for you guys either way but it'll be cool if you guys give me any ideas of what you want to see and I'll try and work it in there you feel me but um thanks for watching the video guys seriously [Music]", "vlO1jMDzCKg": "yeah it's gonna be a long video all right today we have six courts inserts here all loaded up with different strains some are live resin some are rosin I got one giant diamond here and I even got some sugar wax here and I think that's what I'm gonna start out with this is some Blood Diamond from Agra kind this [ __ ] looks nuts and honestly it has the consistency of like a sponge has an amazing terpene profile it tastes straight-up like grapefruit it feels like it's like a charcuterie board of dads I'm about to have a very good time here I'm sure not everyone knows what quartz inserts are and how they're used but I have an entire youtube video where I break it down super in-depth so if you want to learn more about quartz inserts you can go into the description of this video and watch that first but from here on out in the video I'm going to assume that you know what quartz inserts are and how they're used it's gonna bang your nice and hot alright now that our banger is going down let's get a quick little close up if we can bounce away boys this might overflow not gonna lie one piece breast oh he's so good my god [Music] Piper hush sorry you guys got my dog with me she's away from all the deaths not bad I got a little doggie gate set up here that's oh my god man this should taste so good I'm not kidding my girlfriend even like hates the smell of weed and she smoked this [ __ ] and she was like damn you should get more of that that [ __ ] smells good that definitely raised the temperature in here holy [ __ ] those nice big shout out the cop products for making these courts inserts that fit their bangers perfectly not to mention the tweezers they make so handling them when they're super hot is really like a stress free hassle all right that was a nice way to start the session I like legit sweating a little bit yep that's what what's nice about that inserts is honestly there's not a lot of residue that gets on the banger you even want to overflows it's so much less than one actually gets an insert so it really does provide your banger from getting that like Chaz dusty look to it all right that was nice but next I'm gonna dab some rosin this strain is strong wah but number two from olio this one really impressed me even from olio it smells and tastes amazing the look on it's great honestly even when it smells it's almost [ __ ] clear let me show you all right I have number two get it nice and close time a little bit the smaller Deb but I still think it's a beige decent size with a desert no wait till it really starts to smoke up in here and then I go for it this one's a little hot oh my god Oh oh my god it's like one hit left boom Wow that [ __ ] is nice definitely burnt up though with that on that one oh my god there is nobody left in there even even when it was that hot it tasted [ __ ] good man these inserts really make the dabs last longer I sort of got I mean this time I went a little hot but even if you get a nice low time they [ __ ] Rock here alright threw down four to go [ __ ] alright next I'm dabbing on some good goog live president from Moxie I really like this drain it's a sativa hybrid but honestly it's just a straight sativa in my opinion it gets me so [ __ ] high in that like cracked-out sativa way or you're super chatty and like just want to go out and go do something like this is definitely a constraint for on-the-go I'm not gonna do a close-up on this one [ __ ] it let's see the whole function of the Ring all right let's drop it already Melton Oh Lord dude I'm already so [ __ ] big this is gonna be a long video yep it's gonna be a long video oh my god [ __ ] give me that little nose tickle oh my god I gotta hear at the chit still going Jesus Christ this is what I was talking about [ __ ] oh my god all right tap it out there I swear it man that is a straight sativa it's not considered one but like that rosin that killed me and that one's brought me back to life halfway there only three left alright next I'm gonna dive is a little scary it is like a straight THC a rock but it's actually just like lab rats and diamonds without the live presentation it it's one giant rock so this should be interesting this [ __ ] has no flavor obviously because there's no turfs but it just has this like weird chemi taste like I'm honestly just not a fan I'm kind of dreading this stab out of all of them because this is a giant [ __ ] rock of it but wish me luck this I do want to go in a little bit hopped out because since it's just straight THC a really all it needs is heat to get the full effect alright let's watch this [ __ ] melt so weird has just no flavor [Applause] a little bit left it holy [ __ ] alright it's done it's [ __ ] done oh my god dude I'm not even gonna lie there's so much replaying in here you know what that means cheers [ __ ] [ __ ] me oh this is all hot [ __ ] no bueno just has no flavor so weird the highs crazy on this stuff but it's just so weird now there's no Terps I need the Turks terms all right give me some turps next to reindeer the strong Nana I'd add this a bunch on my last video has like a super great banana terpene profile I love anything that tastes like banana I don't know why it's hard to come by and it always is just like such a nice experience when I get it and this is live rosin by the way so definitely gonna have a good Turkey in profile all right as well doing a close-up let me know if you guys are enjoying these little close-up insert drops actually really enjoy the inserts so I'll keep doing videos like this if you like it so let me know swinging a little hot on that gotta take a little breather there [ __ ] [Applause] [ __ ] me oh my god dude Robin just hit you different really does who love it great experience I'd love rosin rosin for life all right last but not least I'm going to do some only old life present my eyes are feeling heavy so I'm glad those videos under this drain is guava breath ever get what the number is let's go with guava breath to the number really never matters to me when people are like Oh what watermelon skittles is is the 16 or the 48 I don't care to that exact i honestly should but my memory is just not strong enough for that I'm like I know I like that strain or I like the sound of it I'm grown with it like it's talking me to remember what number is better make sure you ask look like you definitely enjoy the video if you made it this far I appreciate every single one of you guys watching let's do the snap I'm doing a low temp I don't care if you judgment boom get in there we're ready [ __ ] dodge like that holy [ __ ] [Music] oh dude I'm so lit goddamn alright that's it we're done it was really just an average life present nothing crazy but I honestly didn't need anything crazier than this sesh I'm already [ __ ] lit this was a lot of fun I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did don't forget to click like subscribe for more videos and got a lot more on the way and if you need more popcorn in your life you can basically follow me everywhere else on the Internet I'm pot underscore porn on snapchat pop porn on Instagram I'm popcorn TV on Twitter but thank you guys so much for watching my name is Jeff peace", "qzeEWxC1UQc": "smoking man growin and watch it fall down [Music] what is up DTC's got it real hanging out super psyched to have a new friend Julian from Bab logic over hey thank you for having me really yes yes hey I appreciate you guys blew it up at the deconcentration celebration yeah yeah yeah no it was a fun time yeah you took home you took home I think was third place in there boys what was this again you brought some with you yeah we can each owns the HT batter it's like really high terpene high potency yeah this is oops this is one to remember right here you brought two of them I like yeah I brought a couple kami I brought a truck Korean or trap cookies and so what's your specialty if you guys were dab logic what are y'all known for um we create high quality you know highly purified high terpene solving with hash oils solvent less overall solvent list so we specialize in ninety micronized soil we also specialize in the different types of bras in all the way from our newest product which is like the HT batter's all the way through like the HT show weight HT what's that mean hide your bathing yeah basically anything you know reaching on the 15% you know mark we consider pretty high tech 15 yeah 15% terpenes just pretty freakin high yeah especially for solving lists you know most concentrates are around six to eight percent on the standard market really a lot even less than that most most standard solvent less concentrates that you'll find on the market are probably about four to five even all right so help me out there help me evaluate concentrates what makes a good concert we're going to the dispensary together what we looking for yeah so when I go in and I look for a good concentrate first thing I do is you know you don't get to smoke the product in the dispensaries know you got to evaluate yeah you have to evaluate it either you know through your nose through sight you know right and then through prior you know prior time smoking either something that like that or but they could think about the colors beautiful on that yeah color colors is that you know is that to live or die by totally a giveaway you know I mean if you're looking at something and it's green or it has like you know a really dark amber to it you know it might be dagger dated it might have had heat stress you know something like that or it could be just the nature of the plant you know something like the truck the truck cookies that's always gonna have at least on the phenotype that's being passed around right a lot of the hash and being created from it right now yes it has that orange you know you cue to it yeah it's almost purple in the hue you know and when you press that and refine it it becomes like this orange almost amber like but that's beautiful orange I got a glowing orange I got no problem yeah yes smoked something that's glowing or it's the earth tones that I have a problem with yeah what does it are that's a sign that chlorophyll it's Asano's beat up too much yeah so when a plants cut if it's cut fresh you know a lot of these plans a lot of people are making fresh frozen and for plants cuts cut fresh it's gonna release Greenleaf volatiles which are different esters Josh aldehydes and you know alcohols that are released by the plant those end up actually soluble eyes in chlorophyll chlorophyll has a few different colors chlorophyll can be anywhere from purple all the way to you know the green that we know about well like purple is that like when plants purple up at the end is that chlorophyll that's so yes there's something to do with the chlorophyll and in the biosynthetic pathway that it actually takes right it's either heated or as it's you know matures or ages but a lot of times that's antioxidants is well produced by the plant such as anthocyanin or something similar to that those antioxidants even have somewhat of a smell to them even they're found in a lot of berries they're found in God and things like that so that's you kind of you know start to realize okay the purple plans have this berry-like or grape-like kind of smell to it it's kind of through that anti oxidant pathway and the enzymes that produce those right so and that's all based on the genetic makeup of the plant I have a very natural next question how the hell did you learn all this stuff man you go to school for this are you just a Googler so there's not much information out there there's a lot of there's a lot of people who are pursuing to find the actual chemistry the actual science behind a lot of this stuff right some of that has been published what has been published you know you can find Ethan Rousseau dr. moosh dr. Musallam alright people like that okay they are pioneering a lot of this stuff and you're just reading their white papers and you read then read their work and then we also you know we work with scientists on our team as well we have a scientist from the University of Boulder who worked in the Caine lab and we're so he's an extra he's a expert in genomics so okay bioinformatics and things like that Wow it's so crazy that in the cannabis company have to have a genomics expert yeah you learn how to hire them I mean yeah it's starting to evolve to the point where now if we want to really you know pursue this we have to understand it more solving this hash is something that's kind of coming back from where it was you know in the past that's all there was there were thousands of years ago if you were to look at you know what cannabis crasher from you know it was charas and you know things on the hands it was the right amount of heat and pressure under pressure that you're able to even remove it from your hand or even able to change the right the chemistry of it because they didn't start smoking it you know it hated to be decarboxylated in order for that to happen it had to be left out in the Sun for a certain amount of time or it had to be heated to a specific temperature for a certain amount of time right you know and through this alchemy that you know has evolved I mean they found plants that were more beneficial for those processes you know that's why what we know of today as the hash varieties come from a very small group of plants because those came out of you know Afghanistan and Grammy Hall and you know places like that that we're actually using hash as a resource for a long time yeah makes sense that's pretty cool I'm just trying to think like everybody's got a different art you know growing can be an art shift photography can be an art what's your what you ought man yeah the art so the art really is involved with just uncovering mechana bees resin you know there's so much there that we don't really know about there's so your the extract artists I don't even know what's your title at that company I don't have one I founded dialogic founder - ice that's a great title because you're gonna have to do anything after what you already did your work no I still I still work with hash you know every day I'm still with the plants and every charge in my fingernail exactly no you just don't think yeah but uh yeah I'm still with the resin every day you know I who I started creating who I created that logic with right was some close friends that also still to this day are are doing different uh different extracts and working with the resin so it's a big industry man yeah so I wait how many people is we just laughing but you came to my studio and saw my work yeah about five guys yeah they all stopped and took a break to take it does take a couple dabs from you totally yeah yeah what's your work scene like what's it like to work at dab logic how many people to start with so I have five people on the the actual extraction team my California team is now expanding I have one guy out there right now but we're in the process of getting expanding that team our lab is just getting the CEO so we're just getting we're just able to move in your building out we had to you know gut the whole place and redo it all for insulation and you guys to talk of something logical you know the whole nine moved in a huge walk-in freezers you know cuz we have to we're taking a lot off you know off these mountains and in Humboldt so yeah can we talk about that for a second just said I was asking about your like I was in Cali for the I don't know can I call it Cali I heard that don't live in California called Cali yeah I mean it's humble it's where it's at right here you know Northern California yeah so you were there we're supposed to hang out last week and you're like dude its I'm out here still harvesting yeah and then I'm like alright so you tell me about what you got a 120,000 square foot indoor there is that right so no no no not that quite that big we got 20,000 square feet makes you like a computer we have hundred acres up off the grid and other 600 acres that's being built built out still isn't fully that 600 acres and fully permitted or license yet I'm not pulling anything off it yet but that's a beautiful property that property goes from the top of a mountain all the way down to the valley there's a river there should be good water oh and I make important water as important mazing water there's huge ponds and the property and streams and so that and that's your your founder that's your baby right there so that I'm partnered with the company Verde Verde natural they're out of they were started here in Denver by guy Chuck and he eventually partnered with who now is the main owner of the company Jeff he has expanded this company you know dramatically he's who took on dialogic and we got and flew it up and I mean you gotta have balls or night ball if you have to know what you're doing to first off do a hundred acres some people have success enough with your 100 acres to do 600 acres yeah yeah service schedule for that has to be amazing totally and I mean you know we don't grow on the whole hundred you know there's a lot that goes into actually running these this big of a farms and you're talking you know huge you know ponds and huge almost irrigation lines that are actually sure culvert it into the into the ground I run a 20 acre bamboo farm yeah yeah purty I was like yeah I was like yeah you need water you need a well you need huge yeah you need a water cleaning system yeah yeah yeah and we're trying to you know be all organic and you know the whole soil all that come on let's get into the growth first off how the hell do you do living I okay I got it you find a place with good soil if you're gonna do living soil on 100 or 600 acres I mean we bring in we do a mixture of local humble Mendocino County dirt and then we bring in some Canadian soil as well yeah yeah that just sound great water that stuff's yeah it's amazing that already is microbial active when it when it gets there you know it already has a nice you know uh humic body to share sure it's not ain't nothing sterile yeah yeah you know if it's and I think they do inoculate that would mycorrhizae don't they I know that they pull out of that out of some plots that they have along the old-growth and that God is definitely as major fungal and bacterial actually seen a peat mine or a peat bog I don't even mind yeah back near uh an old growers to have I Drive by it and it was like whoa what is that thing it's just cutting into the earth yeah I know yeah the pits interesting there that's a finite resource in there you know yeah it is yeah yeah I will say Florida peat not as good as a reason they imported from Canada so that's actually really cool that's alright so as long as we're talking grow how do you give quality and quality outs yeah how do you have first off indoor grows got to be tremendously different than an outdoor grow right yeah completely different different processing then on your end here that your the extract you noticed I mean definitely I was talking to somebody I was talking to it was loving in her eyes yesterday and she was talking about how to be I was asking her how to be a you know a really top quality extract artist she goes get to know your resin I think it was friend she can always that originally said it her for get to know your resin you know everything's different you know your room and your resin is gonna be different absolutely yeah when you move from grow to grow or you're starting a new grow and it's new growers its new people it's a new soil mix it's a new everything sure you know it is scary you know you're coming in with varieties you know it's not like we can really transfer varieties from state to state ads so it's like we're having to find and source varieties in California wait really that we haven't ran yet but I mean you can't or you can't uh so I mean a wedding cake can find its way over an account we have wedding cake we have like all you know I know you would never talk about other people no there is there is ways to definitely get them over they audit and through in through tissue culture and things like that we can actually legally do this stuff if we're sending over callous and undifferentiated cells we can actually send that across state lines and technically it's a gray area sure it's not a cannabis plant so they can't call you out on it you know I'm just sitting here being like oh it's so silly you should be able to smuggle stuff anywhere you want but I think about all I'm from South Florida you've got people from South America and all over the place that are smuggling little plants in because it's tropical these plants from their home they are bringing so many diseases literally Jersey palm decline they have straight-up palm decline there because people are bringing palm seeds and growing palm seeds that were laminated yeah it's a huge deal yeah it's scary I mean you know we truly we want to find varieties that we know are gonna work right but we also want to be able to work with as many things as we can so it's really just finding the lineage and delving into where are these plants coming from can i source plans of that lineage from whoever you know in the area that's mainly what we look into do you have any other growers in your area cannabis or hemp because that would be a freakin nightmare if you had people growing hemp for biomass no it's okay in Humboldt County there is a lot of cannabis growing you know there's tea farm everywhere you look is there pollen I'm in there saying if there's pollen in the air and your she gets pollen there could potentially be pollen there could potentially be molds from other Wright farms and things like that so we have to be very careful you know a with who we let on the property be with you know how we filter and maintain the air quality and our property is this completely outdoor these are greenhouses what are we doing with the the big properties are outdoor they're full season that's just right in the Sun you know exposed to as many you know anything that happens yes there's a greenhouse you see matter space in that even there there will be greenhouses there will be all sorts of stuff that I put on those properties it's still gonna have full Sun and greenhouse or full Sun depending on how you grow depending on you know what varieties you're doing you could have very good full Sun that goes well depending you know how your season is out there really it's seasonal you know you could have a fall that's extremely rainy and damages your whole crop in the six-day period you know you could have a fall season that's sunny amazing and warm and there's no rain in sight all through flower and everything was beautiful she kept your dust down and you maintained your property and you did well enough to be able to like oh yeah I can you know harvest these plants that are gonna be very well do very well for you know some of those extracts yeah I mean you're talking about hmm having some problems you know if the weather is wrong mm-hmm or doesn't cooperate you know that basically catastrophic crop failure totally yeah we're doing all sorts of stuff that we can to mitigate that as the season progresses you know we're watching weather we're watching humidity we're watching as things are moving up the coast and into the mountains it's what you do though well we can prepare you know like if if a heavy rains coming you know that's gonna be very damaging the other show if you if things aren't stake properly your trellis properly not like that it's gonna just destroy your field you know just based on that alone so that's um you can do not even though huge raindrops or hail hitting those bus cream yeah yeah and I mean we we're trying to develop different rain protection systems that we will put up once the plans get more in the flour and it'll just be short little lean-to type frames that basically go over and they'll be big but they're only gonna be able to protect a few of the chosen plans right one it's not gonna be the whole thing you know so we'll start going through the that whole property was done from seed so that is also we're doing Fino hunting there so you need that yeah some special ones over there yes I mean there's we pop 2,000 seeds you know so it's a big female hunt we got the varieties from a guy Jesse his company as bio vortex they do amazing stuff at Humboldt Wow he's in another leaf Trinidad area not actually I think his farm is actually really cool know him I think I have run into him before yeah he's a great guy he I could probably swing it his way too but uh he does so many talks and writing and get a home but sure absolutely in a cannabis and absolutely gonna get your culture you know my beef is with everybody that's that's putting their their lives on the line their livelihoods on the line for cannabis is that in Florida if I were to have you know 600 acres of palm trees and they got a disease or they got wiped out by a hurricane you know what happens I get to buy myself a Mercedes man the government comes in it gives me 50 70 90 percent of what the hell that entire crop was worth and I had a check for three million you know I'm sorry if it's that many acres yeah yeah tens or twenties a million oh yeah I just sold my entire inventory before before it was even mature yeah if we get hit with you know as I guess outdoor cannabis growers there's no catastrophic insurance for us I'm sure there will be once event organization happens but kind of gotta be hard to get people to throw their life savings into you know or I should even say it's just an investor and that's and that's the thing and that's why you know we do what we do you know that logic is like we need the best material we you know that when you're getting something from us it's going to be the best because we can't take some thing that failed you know write anything that failed it's it's it's either has to be compost or its you know if if if it can be you know saved in any way from hydrocarbon extraction but that's you know what's scary about that is right people you know lose a crop or something like that and they pull it to that and it's who knows what mycotoxins heavy metals things like that are contained within that yeah how do you feel about BHO you solvent list newt or what I typically only smoke solving this hash um just because you want to solve this company yeah and I'm you know I'm in the industry I see what happens you know with I do carbon extractions and don't get me wrong there are some amazing right carbon extractions out there and it's important that you know that that side of the industry exists in Georgia they're you know keeping the earth clean and they're you know doing what it takes you know I could see one be one type you know blast rooms and things like that and I think it's fine the exist bad promotion for the cannabis industry for extracts of if they're blowing up with Dirk scanning themselves we don't we don't want that and you know a lot of times people don't know the difference between distillate or solvent lives or something like that you know found someone like us someone like us would know because it's its second nature whatever by now but it's like you know when I talked to somebody from Wisconsin or I talked to someone sharing Oklahoma or Alabama or you know somewhere like it's all good there even people out in California you know northern Northern California you know they're there's so much distillate there's so much hydrocarbon extraction everybody's running to ashes big freakin farms up there okay there's nobody that can press come close to processing that size of farms yet which is you know I mean so it's like look like a factory over there Shh I mean they are a lot of the hydrocarbon facilities around 24/7 and yeah I can take on a thousand pounds a day Jesus mm-hmm Wow what do you think you guys's capacity is gonna be in California I mean you're gonna need to have some see you've got hundreds of acres yeah it's an it's not quite that big in again we're selective for solve unless gotta take the best out of these fields we take only the best so it's it's something that when we're doing and we do about a hundred pounds fresh per per wash is what will got we what we do got um so that only happens two to three times a week typically it's something that takes a lot more effort you know through the whole process it's something that we can't really just throw it in the tube blasts it out throw write purge oven and let it sit for three weeks it's like there's a lot of processing and there's a lot of maintaining and being very careful and being you know quick but also you know taking your time yeah what how do you get the young quality and quality out when it comes to when it comes to you know Roz and I guess how do you get it to where what if you have a problem I guess is what I'm trying to say in the grow yeah soil so it's kind of tough to correct that yeah it's some things off balance if there's you know some something that may have been watered wrong or you know fed improperly yeah that a B word what about bugs bugs I mean bugs are definitely a problem you know if you're if you're dealing with large scale cultivation but you know if you're maintaining cleanliness you're maintaining rigorous integrated pest management systems leaving meaning predatory insects very cool in vegetative state never in flower it's also using you know specific essential oil sprays or oil sprays that could be used in vegetative state never in flower beautiful you know one thing that we do is we make sure that our products aren't sprayed if it's coming to me cannot even come close to being sprayed it can't and that's why if a farmer that's why we have to be so selective that's why we have to grow and we have to inspect product you know even if like our own farmers are out there there they might be doing something to save their own crop so we have to go out there and inspect that and make sure that's either not happening or if it is happening we need to move on and get to the plants that you know or part of the crop or even move through the crop altogether you know and only take you know something from yang on their farm I had tasted and by no means a connoisseur I like extracts don't get me wrong but I'm not a connoisseur and I tasted something that I was like this tastes like sulfur like it looks good he's like sulfur like obey me use the sulfur burner and you know a little bit too late that could be you know there's especially you know if you're an old-school farmer right and you're doing things you're trying to be organic you know you could use a sulfur burn you know but that nowadays most people are aware that that comes through a in the cannabis smoke would be way more in the concentrates you know so but there are varieties you can lineage you know coach lineage that could the diesel lineage that could lean towards like that skunky sulfuric almost type smell got a stir so you know if it's important that know your grower it's important to know you're know where your weeds coming from grow your own most importantly I mean that's why we you know it's why we do what we do is so that we can grow something that you can be certain is going to actually be something that you would drove you ain't smoke you know we don't we would never put something something in our products that you wouldn't I wouldn't personally use myself there's so many people that I just let like b-grade stuff pass through just because they're like oh nobody will know what he can tell showing in extracts it's this or that or it's going to this dispensary they'll buy I've been dispensaries and I'm like oh you buy the shift exactly yeah so it's important for us you know to sharing you know relationship with the growers and maintain the relationship with people that were selling to you know yeah what's up with the dispensaries on the other end because you kind of middleman as far you can't go in and actually rep your product during no I mean some dispensaries allow us to come in and you know frame help market help train route kind of create awareness yeah if you come in you don't know what's sitting on the Shelf right why are you gonna buy it you know well like you got this pen people are in the cartridges it's kind of going away from that you know putting your extract in a pen and having to reload it these things are super low-profile super convenient what's the first off go into a dispensary you know be like hey what kind of good cartridges do you have and sometimes they'll go none don't buy them here they're all mix of propylene glycol and stuff like that what's the secret first just cuz I'm in the cartridges because I'm picked this one up so cuz I'm gonna hit it so something like this out what's the secret to make them something a good cart what's the difference in a good part of a shitty cart this has no cut this has none of the propylene glycol MCT oil any bogus food grade this or that else is 100% from cannabis and it's also and lessly made so it's it's a high terpene extract put into a vape cart is what it is it's not something that somebody made to get rich quick it's yeah this is real hash I remember they made more convenient yes something you could melt your hash into and then you could put it in your vape pens yeah and I mean it's terrible there's a little bit of post-process like you you if you just stick show into a cart it's gonna crystallize it's gonna kind of coagulate and it'll be hard to smoke lawyers you know so creating the proper terpene ratio and things like that is very important you know and that's is that strain dependent or that's very strained dependent with us it's a hundred percent strain depending because we can't really manipulate the terpenes too much or the constant we can somewhat manipulate concentration right can't we can't change what's there you know it's like if what's there is there so we're just kind of working with what we have to kind of make this yeah makes sense if you guys make carts you guys make it what does he cause batters yeah the the carts something we've been doing for the past two years year and a half something to make it more convenient sitting so that also somebody who doesn't have a rig and doesn't typically dab right can actually use our product this is super this never really happened before the vape car it was not quality was yeah yeah so it's like being able to formulate you know the get it from this to that was huge yeah it was the game for us and really has made it so that my mom my grandma my aunts and uncle rate of have able to have been able to try my product whereas before they can I get a really good order yeah even though what it was you know couldn't couldn't even wrap their head around it yeah but we we you know what with most hash makers you know the the goal isn't I need my car nice oil you know a lot of times we're taking now because so many people love the rosin and things like that we're taking our ninety micron pressing that right having specified batches that are ninety might come or 90 120 mixtures sure like that the higher grade microns and that's what's getting some that's more often than not that's what we're pressing now because it's just what people are after and water hash is also good side of the market but it's it probably accounts for twenty twenty percent of the actual solving with sales and those riding the whole grand scheme of things seems to go quick do no otter hash yeah it's expensive yeah you know the high grades there's unless you're doing you know extremely large batches there's not a crazy amount of it you know maybe a couple hundred grams you know something like that so it's something that's very limited something that's not you can't take something low grade and make it into ninety micron ISIL it has to be grown perfectly it has to be done perfectly actually washed perfectly so we presented and given you the consumer perfectly as well you know so we have to keep it maintained you know from start to finish you know a cold environment on it you know we have to make sure the people who are selling our product right the consumer are also keeping in the right environment and then we have to let our consumer know and they have to have the education to be able to know to put this in the fridge or to keep it cold they asked something that maintains that you know environment we have a kegerator and we never use it having a kegerator in the house is actually a bad idea so why I started hiding my dad's in there man they you just don't have enough refrigerators once people know you keep them in the fridge yeah they figure it out me yeah every fridge in the house yeah bad hey we're talking about these cartridges you obviously if you were in for a year and a half ago you were getting in the days you were a little bit ahead of the trend ahead look her how they how do you keep a head into curve and what's coming up next around the next curve for cannabis yeah we're always trying to keep ahead next big curb you know we're looking at I see a lot of people are like pushing for you know really like colored high flavor hi hi flavor profile resins like 710 it's white yeah yep yep so it's really it's shooting for that shooting for the holler proper color high terpene me but also still maintaining you know the right you know potency you know because if you're pulling too early on some of this stuff you're just getting something that tastes like cucumbers and like wait up just doesn't even get you that high it's like if you want something that has the full body flavor like you have to take it to its prime maturity you know we we have to get out of the kind of mentality that ambered trichomes like when it starts to amber that's starting to show my maturity cuz that's like that's already overly matured you know like yes we're trying to pull a little bit before that ever even happens before the first amber trichome happens like the day before that would be the perfect you know yeah I'm just saying and this is I mean cuz you're trying to bring something great to your customer something extraordinary so when they try all of them they like to dab logic that's that's the one I like yeah how educated is the customer did they get it a shopping price do you have to it's just like cmed you're gonna we can educate them on that stuff or they end up buying hemp seed oil for you know eight dollars on Amazon and thinking oh everything is good ya know I mean education is huge most people they don't know the difference between like quality organic solvent list and some low-grade hydrocarbon I straight up they don't eighteen dollar shadow yeah and with CRC tech like the color mediation for like hydrocarbons and things like that I heard something about what the hell is color remediation they're pulling chlorophyll and you know oxidants out of out of the hash you know which is great because that leads to a higher grade hash but it's also like discern or both from like something that is high grade you know it's like okay this this just is high grade because I grew it right I maintain it I took care of it I processed it right you know this came from any run of a mill place with who-knows-who doing them whatever and it's coming out looking the same you know that's the that's the thing yeah plastic surgeries you know a couple yeah so it's gonna be then you know now going back through the customer finding you know the nose the trained eye things like that being able to actually understand what what you're getting you know yeah and that's hard you know if we're we're still in the phases of trying to teach people what good genetics are you know and you more if they're not even understanding the Terp why those genetics are good the terpenes that they're producing the cannabinoid profiles that they're producing them we're gonna be like then they're gonna just be sitting there clueless when anybody can call anything whatever they were you know I mean most of the country thinks independence atiba there's two varieties of cannabis one gets you up let me get you down exactly yeah and it's who's that well who's your I've heard I was actually at the dispensary one time it must be right after Social Security checks were issued hmm to what everybody was 55 60 years old so you know I mean they were older yeah I was just kind of wondering like where the growth is I actually was talking to somebody and they were telling me look the people that are smoking weed are already smoking weed you know what we're really after now is the people that aren't smoking weed the other 85% of population we're looking for you guys say you know ever think in that that way or is that why you got stuff like these pens yeah they really make it I think what the vape is designed for its to give it to anyone who can basically take a hit you know if you can take a hit you can try this pen there isn't even a button on it right it's magnetic it's just you know it just slides right in yeah it's so easy to use it's nothing like heating up a nail and take your day about measuring a dose all that kind of stuff this you just measure with the pup knows how hard you're drawing you know so it's it's per a buddy of mine called me I've been talking about this guy because I feel terrible about it a guy knew back in Florida had a stroke and you just case just told me he goes my body's hanging off me you know it's my hair and my leg of my arm and he's like it starts hurting and I was met recommended that he grabbed one of these pens and check him out it's not a cannabis user and magically he got one and he's like dude I like it and it's really cool cuz in the beginning you could take like a couple of one hit and you're like wow yeah I have a friend that has psoriatic arthritis shoutout to Paul and yeah it's really bad man where sometimes he just can't move his hands and it sucks cuz he's uh has like a technical job as well he will take one hit of the right strain and he just goes like immediately he goes I'm all better I'm all better mm-hmm David it's amazing and I was absolutely I don't know if you got any medical cannabis stories or not I mean like that is so inspirational to me totally my yellow rooftops you know my grandma actually has went through cancer twice she has you know used cannabis to help her right through different chemo treatments and things like that she's fully off chemo now and she's only using cannabis and CBD you try to help and you know so that's kind of where she's at sure the whole world would change their mind on cannabis if somebody handed them a joint when they had a stomachache okay know what I mean that's all they would have to do is when he had a snowman somebody joint they got I instantly feel better I can actually empathize with the psoriatic arthritis guy cuz think about having a horrible stomach game taking one hit of weed and being like I can get up off the floor I can get out of bed you know terrible state your intestines I've never been ashamed of cannabis always been me Oh doing what I can to let people know that this legit shouldn't be considered deal with all the other drugs while the other armful drugs know it's a medicine I agree 100% yeah and that's kind of what we do - it's a logic is the reason we're organic the reason we choose solvent less is because we want to give you the purest truest medicine you know we don't want anything getting in the way between you and nature in this plant you know we're just presenting you with as close as you can get to it you know so it's it's then up to you you know to use this medicine however you choose you know whether it's dope and your consciousness or whether it's to heal your ailments or just a plain old you know relax you know like all of those things are so important you know to de-stress and to unwind like it's part of why we all use cannabis and it's so so important you know and that's why I think cannabis users as a whole have that mentality in that mindset of for lack of a better word we're chill you know sure it affects you I think I think it affects your brain you smoke enough weed it shows you out of it that's actually a generalization know some crazy [ __ ] just smoke weed all day they're not the least bit chill oh well yeah no I mean thinking of one that was a pink shirt you know just knows how much weed they use but let me ask you a question so we're talking about the expansion we're talking - everyone should smoke weed all right they everyone should consider it a medicine anyhow so do you want federal legalization that's a super double-edged sword they're super sharp one I mean I don't look at medicine as pharmaceutical in any way you know I hate do it yeah they do they do they think you know put it into a pill or make it something that's completely controllable something that we can maintain and control reacts down to the milligrams same way oxycontin is a molecule that they can control exactly you know and by doing that they take away the whole plan the full spectrum you know aspect of it and using THC on its own I mean all the studies show that it's way way way less beneficial than using in conjunction with Kurt beanies and other cannabinoids that are found actually within those plants so no to federal legalization just cuz just gonna commoditize I mean federal legalization I think will be the last thing that happens what I think will end up happening is states will end up partnering with one another we'll be like we'll see California Oregon Washington State interstate they'll partner what's going in there yeah all of a sudden you know it'll open up other other avenues for other states and it'll be able to follow a trail through our country one way or another you know and as long as that money files which follows a trail the federal government somehow will probably be ok yeah exactly I mean it's everybody knew it was coming you know it was like the Jack Herer initiative of 2012 it was his whole thing you know it's prophecy it's good there's no way you're super you can't win an election by saying that you're against cannabis there's no way yeah once cuz we've been fighting for so long brother kids yelling it yeah I love it I love it worriers boom and we're back and magically we're taking - yo so where can people get this stuff anyway so you can grab it at vert and verts and Fort Collins if you're in this area otherwise if you're in Denver you can always get it at Verde if you're in Boulder you can get it at Verde nice that Verde carries the largest selection of dialogic products overall so deal deal I appreciate it man yeah there you go there you go thanks for bringing such thanks for bringing samples absolutely it is gorgeous this is absolutely growing always glad to be over there [Music] [Music] [Music]", "9AQGHKdrlr4": "hey guys we are back with the god 135 watt LED system in the 2x4 tent with um - gotta grow fixtures and what you're looking at right now is basically the pineapple chunk actually we'll say frosty little mugs [Applause] so great smell again everyone got to understand that this is basically for personal use [Music] office obviously this is not for creating commercial weight but just you know just um for that individual that needs their medicine and technically can grow it without spending too much money on electricity this is a great resource of why a fixture like this not only consumes 60 watts and I had two of them in a two by four tent so total 120 watts to get this grade you know I think it's well worth it so that's pineapple chump so we did all the pineapple chunks and then now we are actually looking what's the thing I cut next was Cinderella 99 which is right here which just dried out so needs to get trimmed and these were bigger nubs remember there's only two plants and scale-wise puts it on there here goes a pair of clippers so the next are pretty decent size wise till I trim it obviously I can't tell you what it is but um just wanted to give you the update with a pineapple chunk still disappointed with Barney farms um amount of weeks needed for this particular strain which they said was eight weeks and I was um kind of perplexed when I was seeing other people's journals and they're saying ten weeks so eight compared to ten weeks it's [ __ ] huge difference so am I gonna contact winding farms in regards to that mm-hmm pretty much I just feel that's not necessary especially um when I paid for femini seeds and you know took the time even with feminized seeds wanted to make sure that they didn't hermaphrodite or anything else and you know and this is what I was yielded with so we'll see but anyways just want to give you guys an update that I did cut the Cinderella 99 and they just did dry I'll talk to them later night and I still do have the bubble of 76 which is in the tent still and that's gonna be cut soon one of the plants did well and the other plant that was shaded was puny but I am happy with the quality of this pineapple chunk i will weigh out everything and tell you what was yielded a lot of individuals been asking but they gotta grow LED fixtures and I will be putting up a link soon where you can see the cost of the fixtures in itself and again kind of oh no I'm enticed to do one more girl with the fixtures itself and just basically max out the unit's inside a 2x4 tent so either I'm gonna do one 400 or I'm gonna do three 120 s in there and I'm probably gonna lean to the three 120 s because it's gonna cover everything evenly again you guys have any questions or any comments please let me know and I'll get back to guys soon take care", "ai4YIZQKX3k": "what's up guys today we're doing a review on uh this is orange skittles from uh sticky frog this is a terp sugar live resin looks like we got 73.16 on total cannabinoids and 6.66 on terps that can't be good definitely smell some orange definitely some gas smells like orange gas um real crystally looking too real sparkly that stuff sparkle to it yeah it's pretty hard there's some uh flat pieces in here which is nice very orange too in color all right let's fire it up this is a cross between agent orange and was it agent orange and skittles orange skittles it's real dry it's not wet it's real dry all righty it's a real dry product like that i move the banger around like that it kind of hops around it doesn't really stay in the middle some of the other products like gems and juice or the cake icing it stays right where you put it me wow really nice flavor let me taste the orange mostly gas though this is a very chronic chronic flavor very tasty very smooth too very nice i'm actually kind of impressed usually when the products dry like that it can be a little bit harsher so very nice all cleaned up in the banger very nice nice product that was my first rip of the day too oh my heart racing a little bit so it's a hybrid it's probably a sativa leaning hybrid though cool eyes getting heavy yes sir all right loving it sunday morning dabs that was sticky frog orange skittles give it a 8 out of 10. nice product", "u8uSrTw1Di8": "hey guys what's up my name is Matty and this is recreational 4/20 and today we're gonna check out pineapple chunk by Virginia Company or Virginia Co the harvest day are the THC on this is 33.6 I actually had to do the math because I wasn't sure if this was the THC total or if that was the total cannabinoids but either way that's spot-on this is what it looks like when you go to the store this is just a pre-roll it says drone with high-pressure aeroponics and it just has a little it doesn't have a whole lot of other information because cool little pineapple teen this is an indica as you can tell about the purple label so I'm gonna go ahead and open it and I like these things because you just kind of squeeze them and they pop right open so first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to smell it ooh that smells really like that's like skunky sweet pineapple ewwww yeah I would definitely say that this is like a you can definitely smell the pineapple in there and it's got some like I don't know some undertones of some like the sour more sour like smell to it this is what the J looks like coming right out of the thing it's not too loose not too fat just ready to go so with that I'm gonna go check it out and I'll be back tomorrow morning to let you guys know how this went hey guys what's up so I'm back and we tried this pineapple chunk the way I typically do we typically smoked our J's is we cut them off like we could have open and then like pour that into the bowl especially with like especially if you're not sure if it's gonna taste very good it makes it easier to control if if you just pour it into the bowl or whatnot the other thing that happens is I don't really like pre rolls or J's because when you're wrong or when the roll like this you like them sometimes they have a tendency to kind of like what do you call canoe where just like one side burns and then you lose all this other side so you end up having to smoke that stuff in a bowl anyway so I avoid the hassle of dealing with that by just going straight to the ball outside of that this was really good the flavor itself was a nice skunky flavor that's like it was real smooth typically they're not pre-rolls aren't very smooth because they tend to be made with like a bunch of shake and then it hits like it it's real smooth and then on the inhale and on the exhale has like a pepperiness to it it's been a cotton like a pretty consistent theme with most pre-rolls if they're not like completely horrible they taste they they have a nice lake and they have a weird like peppery aftertaste to him that could just be I have no idea why I'm not even gonna try to like come up with a weird reason I was about to and then I was like I have no idea anyway so then the hi itself is actually it's it starts off smooth mellow it's all body and then about a half-hour in you just get hit and you're this is a definitely of good indica I I was kind of skeptical about the the the THC being like 33.6 but then you take a hit of this and you stop being a skeptic it's most really well so if you guys get a chance to check these guys out again that was Virginia Co pineapple chunk pre-roll I'm just asked your local bug tender my name is Mandy this has been recreational 420 and I hope you guys enjoyed it", "hKpgMdb_TxQ": "[Applause] welcome to the blind taste terp challenge this time we have absolute extracts live resin gelato forbidden fruit and cherry pie i've never had absolute extracts my first time i haven't had these strains before so i'm gonna mark them with some stickers here so i don't know which one is which and i'm gonna try to see if i can match the name of the strain with what i'm tasting and then rank them which i like from top to least on the terp scale let's get this going all right here we go for the very first one of absolute extracts this one was the messier of i'm kind of on the top so start with that one really smell it already i already have an idea what i think it is they all kind of have their own little distinct smell [Music] [Music] oh yeah [Music] [Music] that one's definitely gelato that's my guess gelato all right here we go the next one it's got the white bottom on it [Music] [Music] so [Music] got a nice taste to it too with slight reheating i'm gonna get cherry pie on that one i'm gonna put that just behind the other one on the taste scale [Music] all right third head we got the blue sticker [Music] [Music] yes [Music] that's definitely forbidden proof [Music] uh [Music] yeah i'm guessing forbidden fruit i can tell by the smell that it's gonna be forbidden fruit i got the taste fat hit if you know when you watch my videos you know forbidden fruit is my favorite so that's easily going number one in the rankin let's see if i got him right stay tuned for the results all right time for the results here so we got the inlet here let's see gelato is pink this is a pink one matches with green so that's one correct we have cherry pie with the white i said cherry pie was white that one is also correct which means forbidden fruit was the blue which means that one is also correct so three for three on those ones it's pretty easy the smell of them you can kind of tell by that which one was which and the taste was right on them all too so let's see okay here's the results of the ranking of which i preferred and taste coming in first place forbidden fruit [Music] always a winner in my book easily i almost didn't buy it because i knew i'd win but how can i not buy forbidden fruit when they have it second place is gelato it was kind of messy a little bit on the lid a little on the side but really good terps had enchilada taste and terp third place is cherry pie this one's really good too it's just more mild it's almost like a forbidden fruit a mild forbidden fruit if i'm not mistaken cherry pie is in forbidden fruit so comment below if i'm right on that there you have it absolute extracts [Music] all tasty [Music] thanks for watching please comment subscribe click that bell all that good stuff until next time you", "mBTrL9feblE": "[Music] alright it stops at me back again today ah I say today but tonight we've got pineapple chunk to review so it's a World Cup winner so he's a nice really really nice drink there's some nice beautiful crystals on it I don't know if you guys can see that through to cover but there is something awfully crystals on this thing it's been curing in there for about three to four days again that's roughly how much that through all my budget so I got a bit closer it is to post although I did if not yeah it's beautiful bud pineapple chunk smell and that's definitely really sweet pineapple smell soon as you open it you get a cheesy smile yeah definitely of cheese and not skunk is its hidden but is that so sweet pineapple smile it's such a strong smell you can taste a little bit just like that like a pineapple punch it's nice and that's just from the smoke ashes from the smell so like I said it's a world cup enough they'll be a description I can't remember exactly when it was World Cup winner elevador a bit today already that's in panel Express crystals earlier made some hash so well if you're watching this video make sure to check up they have a video is how to do a review and basically I'll show you how to make some hush of my Keith trichomes and what have you classic pollen it's a nice little thing but this one okay here's a nice little way no go it's been trimmed very nice very nice no guys been trimmed perfect so yeah fine a chunk that's watching my skills just dead on them they're not a crumb slowly I Spit this because it's for my girlfriend him me if it's night inovative is freaky little bird or a little bit tacky yes I'll say what I normally do is break up but often it's talking Wow there's equal amounts and you feel a little bit attacking us young fingers so it's not fully cured nice crystal from there you can see it I don't know if you guys can but you can one of the best crystals I forget all the base really tacky when you put it park still slapped a bit but it's tacky you snap my fingers you get a really sweet smell don't really get much of a point upon osnome kimchi smoke but which go sweetie really sweet like I'd say Cundy eye candy smell like cotton candy today we are gonna be riding it up so I bought a couple of finders dollar coins the says on the front Liberty 1977 yes in a good we trust so so we're going down the back you've got a picture of the bird American bird with an American stars says United States of America one dollar on the back and it says can't really pronounce that myself look if you guys can see it up there's a decimal point so that's why I can't really see it because they like somewhere is so hard for me to focus myself I slit this no it's really nice really skunky cheesy smoke but then you've got up like I said really sweet pineapple straight away perfect but it's in the lid I just gave my girlfriend her five what we're going to do now I showed you the grinder it is a metal spike takunda it's a free piece under I will be selling these on my page on my Facebook page it's a free piece but there's no match to the mesh out I'll show you guys basically we've got B coming in you've got the grinder down and you've got the old ring that comes with a metal o-ring with the mesh so you can put the mesh back in if you really want it they'll be gone eight pound piece so I'm not selling them straightaway I'll be selling them up on the channel so on my Facebook page on this channel so the only way to do it is if you want to do it from the channel have to go onto the Facebook page join the Facebook group because off the page all I could do is just post I can't actually put stuff up for sale but yeah once you join the group you couldn't buy stuff from there let's grab my email got my address contact details it's all on the group so she do want to contact me instead like I send stuff to you posters and packaging will be in the course so I will have a website about up eventually hopefully in the next like six to eight months on our app and a website so I put this quite about together when I I will say when you put they're going to back together make sure you slide it aren't clockwise and in clockwise here just so sloppy doesn't you don't across photo you got the binder back together what we do we're just grind see no got down for now and when you're grinding it if there's no mesh in it you want to put it in the top piece so you should most slot them into the the little spikes I will do a proper review on these and then basically when I do sell them I've got another youtube channel I know I've got quite a few at the moment I've got my G free TV Moroccan channel but I've got another one and it's called vapors third lung and it links to everything and it's

the kind of miss upside down if you've got no mesh in there cuz it's not gonna hold it so coin upside down first off and then you switch it over you just rock it back and forth quite fast nice and quick Aquos see the spikes gone mostly automated free-thinking the things happen the stalk so I spoke on the top underneath now we've got a nice ground up kind of this the ground smell nice I don't

makes you check out the description and I'll save for the end of this video make sure you like to subscribe toxic me stolen area and catch you guys later you", "ylc16phLqDE": "i mean this right here is some live rosin bro this is really what you want to do what's good everyone it's haikai as you can see we're at the dispo right now pick up some fire and i'll show you guys what we get when we get back all right we just got back from the dispensary we picked up some real nice stuff for sure she was expensive but um definitely like i'm just gonna say now this is honestly worth it to me um we picked up some rosin and rosin right now is going pretty crazy it's a solving this extract it's like the top-tier extracts in my opinion like because it's solventless and there's no butane or anything extra added into it it's just literally using heat to get the extract from flash flooding flower or regular cured flower it's some fire bro i've only tried it once before and that was literally last night that's why i wanted to make a video about it i picked up and i want to go back today and get some more and bro that [ __ ] was i did one dab of it i only take i only took one down because i wanted to save more for the video but dude just one like it just hit so much different like i can't even describe how like how much different it hits your chest and like your head it just like feels because the the high doesn't even feel like groggy like you would from a distal high like when you get high from just slit you just get like i guess high and then you just like want to go lay down and just like i don't know want to [ __ ] off for a bit but if you take a dab of some like real live browsing bro that should just like i don't know it just makes you feel so much more uplifted and good like it gives you the actual like i don't know feeling of high like it re it really gave me like flash faster like when i first started smoking because like right now my tolerance is pretty high since i've been smoking like every day for like a while now so dab of rosin is just like up here compared to like some shatters just like all the way down here this is completely different experience in my opinion at least solving this is definitely the way to go we picked up three different types of roses actually and we're going to get into like the different types of rosins you can get we got some aged cured rosin we have some live rosin and then we also have a full spectrum rosin yeah it's going to be dope video for sure because like this [ __ ] smacks bro uh we're gonna get some cool we'll get some cool milk shots and everything you know the vibes but yeah first let's get into the aged cured rosin from the well it's a hybrid one gram of solventless cannabis extracts that's what you like seeing um get a little shot of the back as well and as you can see it says whoops it's age cured rosin as you can see um which train is it uh melon rings and yeah on the inside it gives like a little uh biography of why i like solving this extracts are really the way to go so we at lowell love concentrates but we don't love the chemical solvents used to create low quality extracts we also know that cannabis is far more than complex in thc alone and that's stripping out the rich and complex variety of cannabinoids and terpenes found in the plant undermines the whole plant cannabis experience our artisans worked tirelessly to perfect an extraction method encompassing the whole plant using pressure and time instead of solvents and volatile extraction we knew with the cold pressing of cannabis which preserves all the natural properties we can finally create concentrates worthy of the well named alaskan fire bro um this is just some regular age cured rosin it's a bit different from regular live rosin this can be full spectrum anything can be full spectrum uh it can either be full spectrum or live i'm not sure if it's live or full spectrum because age cured is referred to um the process after that and the carrying process usually involves rosin being collected in a suitable jar heated and then treated with some variation of hot or cold temperatures and then stored in a stored in the jar for a few weeks or longer and then if done well can result result in some jam that can be like some of the most flavorful important and potent uh concentrates imaginable and that's what this is exactly and yeah dude this should definitely smacks like no other bro like i can't wait to get some more of this because it really isn't that expensive like i was saying um hq rosin is from the well i think that's like one of their it's like specialties i guess because i don't really see any other age gear rather for anywhere else but yeah there's just gonna be some fire bro we'll take a globber of this um let's get this shop set up [ __ ] globber boys [Music] smoke down smoked out positive squad protect dj smokey at all costs [Music] [Music] all right bro that [ __ ] just smacks so different i i can't even describe it like i'm i'm just like so much [ __ ] iron than i was before i i i like i didn't i've been all right yeah i haven't smoked like at all really today i've like to rip the card maybe once or twice but bro this [ __ ] just smacks me so differently than just like a regular like live resin dab or something like that like this [ __ ] just makes my whole body feel so different but in a good way just you could really taste the full flavor profiling and all the chirps in them and that dab it just tastes so good dude whoa i forgot which string that was i think it was like melon rings like you could really just taste that [ __ ] it tasted so amazing i can't wait to take some more uh take some more [ __ ] globs of that bro it's some fire like seriously this it was really worth it and i think the melon rings honestly wasn't even that expensive either like that for a gram was i think i think 45 or something and that's really like that's pretty cheap in my opinion for some rosin and it was it's still pretty good quality and like you can get some live resin or diamonds for about the same amount and this is solventless and i would honestly rather prefer this and it hits like so much so much better dude i can't even like i'm not over exaggerating or anything because like i'd be smoking every day and like and i'll be smoking some like like i think in the last video like it was like some purple punch like it'll give me high and it made me feel pretty good but it doesn't give me that like full body high like this is giving me right now and this is like it's just smacking for real but um yeah let's get into the next thing the which is this full spectrum hashtag so what basically what a full spectrum extract is is about preserving the natural ratios of compounds within cannabis while removing the impurities that can compromise the full experience and then full spectrum exercise can also be called whole plant extract just because it keeps all the properties of the flower it doesn't remove any of it but however because heat is involved in this uh solvent extraction method compared to like a regular um full spectrum extract with uh like bho or co2 however since this is a salt in this extract and the only extraction method is like through heat basically um it is a concern that full spectrum extracts going solventless um can lose some terpenes if it isn't done right and some other profiles of cannabis but if it's a well-known company not some like boof they know what they're doing for the most part and like have it down to its science really but yeah that's basically the difference between full spectrum and live ones originally coming from a dry flower and then the other one's coming from a flash flowers and flower which is live resin we just dabbed on with some cured aid frozen i accidentally got that mixed up with uh with this the full spectrum live rosin so everything i just talked about i was referring to this which is a full spectrum like i was saying like you get the full profiling of the flower and everything from full spectrum compared to my bras and you get my rods and you only get like parts of it because it does remove some um profiles we'll get into this full spectrum now i pretty much explained everything about the difference between full spectrum and uh live resin but yeah this [ __ ] looks fire as [ __ ] as well um i'll read the little things they have um this is from honey butter this is their brand uh the last brand was the wells like it's cool how like you can tell the difference about the brands that really care and i feel like these like saltiness extract brands because like there's so much more work goes into it i feel like um they really care about their products and stuff and you can tell like they have like a whole last thing it shows you like what temperatures you should be taking your dabs out of stuff and like if you have a puffco or i think the other thing is the aura or email it even says with temperatures to take it out and that's really [ __ ] helpful like no other thing does that and like it says you should be taking them at low temps and like low temps is definitely the way dude you can really taste the chirps at low temp and it's the move and then mainly it says thank you for choosing to support craft cannabis our family business small farmers of uh meniscento county from the soil to oil every step of our process performed with love and intent of delivering the best experience for you down to the last dab we are incredibly grateful to share our patient we are incredibly grateful to share our passion for this amazing plan with you thank you kindly the honey butter team and then message us anytime we're always here to chat honey butter rosin dot co so yeah this is that honey runner rosin this shit's fire bro i haven't even tried it i can't even say it's fire but it sounds fire it's peanut butter cup bro it's crazy i'm allergic to peanut butter so uh bro imagine this like gives me an allergic reaction i've never even like had peanut butter so i wonder it's gonna give me the taste but yeah this is that um this is that full spectrum rosin and like i was saying full spectrum rosin does come from dried plants not um fresh frozen plants so that's why it does look a bit different it also could be different press as well from the live resin but yeah it still looks fire as [ __ ] and smells it smells like it's gonna be super tasty um like dude the other the melanie smelled super good too but yeah we'll take a nice uh nice glob of this too i'm already [ __ ] hiding and i'm working like an hour so hopefully i can get this video finished [Music] check [Music] so that peanut butter cup um that was pretty fire too as well and that was the cheapest out of all of them there's only like 38 dollars before tax that's really not too bad for grandma rosin um but i can understand why it is the cheapest it definitely felt like the quality it wasn't as like refined as maybe the cured age rosin and i just felt like like i said i mean like in the name said this just feels more cured and like they like the feeling of that one more i feel but this definitely gave me a good uh full body high more in the head i felt like yeah but this for sure with some fire bro and again it's solving this and if you can get some cell phones the same price as um some bho or um other [ __ ] like that i don't understand why you wouldn't cop some solvent list because it's like honestly like better for you in the long run i felt like personally and yeah it's honestly it's just really some fire it's worth the extra couple bucks in my opinion and then right now we'll get into like the most expensive one which is the live rosin that i got bro that's just some fire i i can't even describe it that's definitely my favorite one i think it's just some um banana korean premium live rosin it's a banana oj um mixed with a creme brulee so it's a hybrid this is definitely the most expensive one at 85 before tax and which isn't even like too expensive for rosin because there's there's jams there that are like 110 120. i mean that might be a little taxed just because of the hype i feel like right now but like 80 80 to 90 is what you're usually going to pay for raws and like i feel like no matter what unless it's like i don't know for at least for some live rosin and like bro this just smacks differently so any products that are like immediately frozen like after they're harvested or called like live so that's why this is called live rosin it's referring to the flower that was immediately frozen once it was harvested and basically what live resin is is a solventless hash oil made with full milk bubble hash that was made with freshly frozen materials and as you guys saw in like my other video i was um smoking some full melt bubble hash it was no it wasn't full mount bubble hatch because i wasn't able to dab it if it says full melt you are able to dab it but if it's bubble hash um just regular bubble hatch you can't dab that it will like it just won't burn correct but you can put it on top of bullets or inside joints but yeah that's basically just like all trichomes and then you go from that to uh you basically take the water hash and that gets pressed and then that's what becomes a live rosin and that's basically what this is bro i'm gonna open this up now no time to waste bro just some fire um yeah it doesn't even have like a long description like the other boxes though all it says on the top is flavor as nature intended in a smaller batches let's fire around i mean this right here is some live rosin bro this is really what you want to be smoking if you can some fire bro um just take a bobber of this [Music] [Music] like i was saying that should just hit way different than like all of them honestly don't get me wrong it's not like the most insane high ever i just feel like it's like maybe the cleanest high that i've ever gotten from at least the the papa select this is the most expensive rosin that um that i picked up it was the live rosin and like it tastes great and everything but i feel like the chirps like aren't really there compared to the aged cured rosin and then the i think this was the full spectrum rosin this is definitely worth it and it gives you the i felt like it gave me the cleanest high it was 85 before tax which is pretty expensive for one gram if you want to know you're smoking like the best [ __ ] possible you can definitely be getting this um these two as well any type of solvent this extract is honestly gonna be so much better than any bho or a co2 extract which is like um like shatters and stuff you can for sure always still get good batters and i'm like still going to get that of course because they're always going to be cheap and everything but like that means solving this is just honestly like superior just like it's just a step above it's honestly really worth the money i don't understand the hype now but like out of all three of these i'd say that the cured age rosin was my favorite and it was only 45 dollars for the gram and like this should super tasty bro like you could really taste the chirps on it i'm gonna take another glove of this before i go and yeah that's gonna pretty much be the end of the video uh thanks guys for watching if you can try out some solving this extracts bro definitely try if you can uh definitely worth the money if you've ever been thinking about it like comment subscribe i'll see you guys next week", "6MF_Gblrkdg": "what is up YouTube Alex here back again with another quick review on this Friday here in Erie PA it's coming in a little bit late I usually get these reviews in that in the afternoon

bad boy open we're gonna do a couple dabs of this got me a new banger brand-new clean banger so it's gonna taste a fabulous no I didn't have skittles before but I never had Private Reserve I don't believe I can't remember ever having Private Reserve but I did have skittles something I can remember what it was shatter something but I have some skittles so we're gonna do a couple of dabs let's get it open here let's pick this bad boy open it's got this little seal right here but you got a break break this little seal and get a little car it's like a little perforated seal there to make sure

Reserve X skittles by Moxie before in any form live resin dabs or whatever let me know you guys tried it and what you thought Cheers I'll tell you what that one I did that way too hot taste it burnt see that's why I like to time it because like I said if I know that if I get this red-hot and then I dab it with wait 40 or 50 seconds to dab it it'll be a good tasting dad that one was way too hot so you lose all the flavor yeah I do it too high you do it too hot and shitty if you're too cold waistlock you know it's that happy medium I keep talking about you gotta have that happy medium sweat dab sweat going on here [Music] I've set my timer real quick I want to do a good dab I don't want it to be too hot I don't want to be too cold so I had to set the timer yeah it's my anal tendencies I have what is it called so I'm a little bit anal when it comes to timers and [ __ ] like that like I'm on point I'm always timing when I put something in the oven I set a timer I [ __ ] you not my wife is like are you timing the 15 minutes to bake those pizza rolls yeah I'll be like yeah I'll set a 15 minute timer no [ __ ] all right let me hit this dab okay it's ready timer goes off boom dab is ready

delicious nice lemony flavor like a lemony Flores flavor that's what I'm tasting the very strong tasting you know a lot of flavor to it moxie always does have lots of flavor all right I will wrap this video up it's already at 10 minutes private reserve X skittles live resin batter textures like that of a real like kinda reminds me of wax after it just dried after being hot you know it's kind of gooey a little bit like that I guess this depends on the temperature if I keep it in a cool dry place it'll probably stay a better consistency supposed to keep it in a cool dry place alright guys that's enough I'm feeling it the hits are coming on the THC was 82% THC a is 82% even the THC is 0.23 percent it's got a little bit of a CBG it's got CVG a 1.8 6% so yeah there are some stats for that you guys have a good weekend like I said I know I'm beating it over the head but let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comments section have a great weekend boom Private Reserve X

please later guys", "4zvJQ78c4SM": "hey guys welcome to the CCC 4:20 my name is chase and this is trippy Tuesday episode 48 today I'm reviewing some sauce this is the second I guess technical sauce review I've been on the channel the first one I did was the terpene Preservation Society of Humboldt this one is the Moxie and this is their go GOG just as a live resin on the container as per but then on the bottom it says songs and this stuff really has a funky consistency to it the the trippy Preservation Society stuff I got was more like a super soupy sugar whereas this stuff had a little bit more like a almost like a weird gelatinous like jelly I don't know it was almost kind of like uh I want to say snot but that's not right it's not like slimy this stuff has like a I don't know it had comes like a cottage cheese eNOS to it or something I mean the the crystals inside of it were very formed and you could definitely see in the macro close-ups that it's it's definitely a soup of a really really bright yellow Moxie pho and then the THC ate crystals in there kind of floating they almost look like bubbles and there are kind of tiny little bubbles in there but a majority of those what you think are bubbles are actually little THC crystals and this this Moxie sauce and yeah I'm really really liking this go GOG I haven't really had too much of a chance to try this stuff as far as a hard-hitting flavor for me I look for more indica flavors this one's one of their classic hybrids they definitely rep this one really hard I think this is a signature genetic from their garden I want to say to go Gog is their their creation yeah the sauce the the the Terps on the sauce are definitely a little bit more pronounced I think that uh again I don't know exactly a hundred percent but I feel like leaving vho and in a sauce form really lets it retain the most terpene percentage sauces I see a lab test done on typically are not as high of a THC percentage as something like a shatter and that leads me to believe that kind of the more stable pho gets that not necessarily the higher THC but the more focus on THC it is so shatters can be a little bit more THC focus whereas stuff like this like your your sugars and your sauces or more of a a flavor experience and make sure you're getting your THC in there but really make sure you're trained flavors and finding flavors that work for you this one is not necessarily a personal favorite for me but it has a really nice nose on it Moxie grows their flavors for for concentrates I mean they don't grow you don't really see Moxie flower I've seen it a little bit in a bear woods that the backwoods backwoods whatever there's Moxie flower in those but other than that um yeah you won't you won't find Moxie on a shelf in flower form ya always always concentrates and seeds yeah for a sauce this stuff's actually pretty easy to get a DAB together it's got a it's got some density to it for for something that's labeled sauce I'd like it to be like runny like almost completely just absolute turps yeah and and again this is a really flavorful live resin from Moxie killer I wouldn't put it on the show otherwise yeah I just felt obligated to review this stuff cuz it just came out I know Moxie just released their other sauces to the public so wanted to get some of this stuff the show give you guys my opinion of it going in on my first step of the go GOG sauce from Moxie here in uh in California brought to me by Left Coast collective here in downtown San Diego cheers guys I'm sorry mocks he's actually based in Michigan but yeah they have a basic course of operations out here in California so cheers moxie on this sauce yes [Music] [Applause] the Terps of the sauce mmm I definitely grab you stuff is that yeah it is a treat like I mentioned this in the last episode but hey if I could have it my way pretty much all ba Joe would come in the form of like a sugar or a sauce and for a while this consistency was really like not popular okay I remember for for a really long time chatter was the [ __ ] and having like a really really transparent really clear shatter but uh yeah now it's all about just having like this sludgy super stinky chirpy sauce like what would what would have been considered visually appealing two years ago is that completely flipped coin compared to what we're looking at today and it's really interesting I personally love how sauce hooks compete all I see on Instagram right now is all your big name extractors and they just have use mason jars come they're just rotating the you know the clear terpene liquid and you can see the crystals underneath and it's just like oh my god all I want is just one of those jars in my life and I just want to just scoop that liquid off the top and just scoop it in this [ __ ] like her yeah a flavor that that this kind of reminds me of a little bit as far as the effect and the flavor goes is Yoda oh gee if you've ever tried that one that one has a little bit I guess I could say like almost a Hindu yeah just kind of a funky really really counting Eastern coach kind of feel the og is is definitely like like I've said a couple of times hybrid this one still has I mean it is doji og so you can't expect it to have some of the og characteristics I do feel a body buzz from this but it's a it's got a really nice fast-acting effect with its hybrid nature and the flavor of it is really like if you like or have never tried a snow cap kind of flavor huh it has a very distinct nose this kind of has that vibe going on it's uh yeah it's really really nice it's very fresh I guess it's out if there's one word I could use to describe the taste of the go GOG is that it's a fresh tasting og and yeah that being said I'm gonna go in on another dab here of the go GOG sauce from Moxie 7-1 own our Moxie seeds and extracts all of the above brought to me by Left Coast collective here in downtown San Diego cheers guys [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] a very balanced hybrid yeah very fresh tasting yeah light fresh sweet so GOG so I almost wasn't gonna film this because I have a little bit of a scratchy throat still from being sick but I didn't want to leave you guys hanging I'm I definitely wanted to get a review in on this uh let's go GOG sauce as you guys can see right now probably by the puffiness of my face and just oh man I'm like just fried by that last dab that one Helen put me on my ass yeah these sauces they are they're absolutely bomb and yeah I would absurd and sauce well it's a time if I could so that's gonna wrap up this review guys this has been the go GOG sauce from Moxie seeds and extracts brought to me by left coast collective here in downtown San Diego and this has been turfy Tuesday episode 48 here on the CCC 420 guys thank you so much for tuning in I will talk to you next week please [Music] [Applause]", "6qLSRbw7of4": "what to do YouTube Jail is sovereign all coming at you again with an update of a plant that you guys have never seen on my channel as yet this plant that you see in front of me is the pineapple chunk from forget what held I see where I got it from I got it from long as you can tell she is frosty as well to the smell on this one was very very very very very fruity yeah but she's doing really nice it's really nice yes and see I will give you guys that dates of the other plants as well just wanted to throw this one in there as well show you guys how frosty she is how good she looks you know she is very very very chunky except those were over I mean there's like a at least a nine inch but yeah so they're they're pretty good you know they're all nice and frosty these are also on week 8 as well but yeah she's in the process of flushing as well so I usually only grow this one out about eight weeks the end of the ninth the beginning of the ninth week you know if you guys want to count the days behind all my days start on a Sunday a slip to flower on September first for all these plants so if you guys want to count the days to figure out what day they're on they're all all my plants that I'm going to be showing are all on the same day a flower and they're basically all in the same growth channel so yeah just a little update for this one pineapple chunk just in case you guys didn't know what it looked like are you guys are trying to you know find us cut like this are you guys are willing to buy whatever you know just a little straighter view grow update for it yeah alright guys how about you guys later peace out and she's a big-ass plant as well too just so you guys know face", "mg0m05RDLV8": "hey guys what's up it's in here bringing to you guys today another [ __ ] smoking video and we got a new piece in this video we got a jade bowl i don't know if you guys have smoked out of these stone pieces before but they smack [ __ ] so before we get into the video and everything else we're gonna go ahead and take a hit today we are smoking on black dog it's coming in at how much percent 22 22 sorry about that we definitely just lost the camera so um but before anything else we're going to go ahead and take a hit so grab your bongs your pipes your bowls your blunts your joints whatever you're smoking and cheers yeah a little bull shouldn't be able to rip like that i swear to god oh man oh wow okay so today we are talking about a little bit of a grimmer topic um and that is a fake shatter now this is kind of dirty so don't it looks usually a little bit more like shatter but um i've had this for a minute mostly because i've been waiting to do this video actually but um these are known as the dabs of death otherwise known as fake dabs aka pine rosin um there's like tons of adverse effects to smoking this [ __ ] but the problem is with it is it looks exactly like dabs i mean at least like shatter um it looks just like shatter it snaps breaks just like shatter it even i mean it even smokes and it gets you high which is questionable but um some of the definitive like the defining factors that you can use to like discover that it's pine rosin is that it will taste like black licorice and it leaves like a waxy uh feeling on like your lips and inside your mouth it'll also leave like white residue on the outside of like a nectar collector or like start to accumulate in the water uh if you're using a bong or like not a bong a rig um and then there's a couple other things too like uh what's it called it burns up in black smoke and then also it's see this is this has not been in the freezer if if you know anything about shatter typically you got to throw your shatter up in the freezer for it to snap like that but this is just snap and pull like even if you don't put it in the freezer so it'll snap like this at room temperature and uh and then all those previous things you can use to kind of determine if it's pine rosin it can still be hard because there is some uh there is some terpenes that kind of taste similar to black licorice um but this is like straight black licorice i mean like if it's terps there will be like underlying flavors with that black licorice kind of flavor or that pine flavor this is just straight this is like completely like you just bit into some black licorice um which i hate black black legler one eternity later anyways now that i'm done with that little stutter fest i hate the taste of black licorice so the second i touched these dabs the second i smoked these dabs like i was super stoked too i got like an eighth for eighty man that's like a [ __ ] steal and the [ __ ] and the [ __ ] the second that i smoked these dabs i i get this overwhelming flavor of just complete bad black licorice i mean like i just ate a jelly bean like that black jelly bean that nobody eats and everybody throws away yeah that and um like it just seemed off right off the bat but i couldn't really get any clear answers when i was googling it and um that's that's honestly one of the main motivations for me doing this video is because it's something that not a lot of people know about and i didn't even i had no idea about this before this happened to me and then like not even like a couple months later i ended up like i ended up going to my buddy's house and like he literally had a [ __ ] ton of this but didn't know it and we were smoking it and everything and and i was like yo i think that this might be pine rosin and it turns out it was um which it's really shitty that like that this type of stuff is entered the like weed game you know because before like yeah you could get ripped off like oregano or like catnip or some [ __ ] but like you're not gonna die like this [ __ ] like in this [ __ ] won't kill you per se but it can cause like irreversible effects like this can like i personally suffer from asthma which i know i smoke cigarettes and i smoke weed it's stupid but anyways i have asthma and um this can cause asthma these pine these pine resin dabs they can cause asthma uh asthma like symptoms just after smoking them they're extremely harsh so when i hit them i mean i was coughing up a lung and i mean i don't even wrong dabs already kind of kill me but like this was just like over the [ __ ] top and i mean it it it honestly hurt like and i i had a hard time like breathing for a few days after i was after i did i just probably smoked like a point five of this stuff before i ended up re like finding answers to what it was because at first i found like stuff online pointing towards the terpenes which i'm not saying that those i was saying earlier in the video there is terpenes that do taste similar but the difference is that you're gonna get like the the dab citrusy flavor as well if that was in your dabs um whereas like this is nothing but that um and everything was pointing towards that until like i came across this this reddit forum that said pine rose in the dabs of death and that's how we ended up here so before we get to the rest of the video we're gonna go ahead and take another hit actually we'll take two if you can hear my girlfriend in the background hitting it she's joining i didn't get the cough the first time so i had i had to milk a little bit and get the call you know what i'm saying oh god damn this black dog some [ __ ] some [ __ ] bro [ __ ] god damn but anyways um as far as the pine resin goes you know i just want to put out this video out there because i don't know if any of you guys have encountered it if you have let me know down below in the comments um but i'm concerned you know in general i have asthma and i would not wish anybody like getting asthma like it's kind of the worst so you know i mean i i wouldn't want anybody to just like smoke these in their 20s and then all of a sudden have asthma for the rest of their life like i was born with asthma and i just never outgrew it you know i mean that's kind of that's pretty shitty and i'm sure there's more effects i i didn't do like a bunch of research into it but i i mean i this is all the stuff that i learned through trying to figure out what the [ __ ] i got sold and um uh what's it called i would just generally say if you can avoid buying street dabs or not street dabs street shatter specifically it's much harder for them to fake crumble or live rosin or butter another thing to note about pine rosin is that uh that i forgot to mention a little bit earlier in the video is that it can also be mixed like into regular shatters so you can get shatter like when i was talking about the terps how there's like some terps that like kind of taste like pine or like black licorice but you'd still get the underlying taste of dabs there's also the possibility that it's it's this mixed into regular dabs into like shatter so like i said before my general rule of thumb at least for me now and what i would suggest to you guys if you're gonna buy it off the street don't get street shattered don't do it again that it's just there's a fat chance i've i've ran into it like a couple times now and um in general shatters just the one that they can fake so i mean you might as well just stick to the crumble live ros and butter all that stuff i mean if you're gonna go that route and if you go to the if you go to the dispensary by all means i mean i my first video back i was smoking that sunrock shatter because i personally my favorite kind like my favorite kind probably other than live rosin is shatter i like shatter um then i've had very very good shatter so it makes me really sad honestly that that now i have to avoid chatter because i mean it every other drug has its thing like that get that's used to fake it but like i mean dabs really the only way that anybody could really do stuff like that is like sell you a an amber rock that and you just don't notice like or some [ __ ] i don't know [ __ ] that's like the only thing i could think of or like i don't know but i don't think there's really anything that matched up to dabs and now now there is and hopefully they don't like find something that works like as a as a live rosin or as a butter or anything else so that you don't have to be wary all together but for now those seem to be safe so we're going to go ahead and get to the end of this video but before we get done we're going to go ahead and hit this bowl couple more times so if you guys want to grab your pieces once joints and everything you know the deal cheers i got tons of content getting ready to come out for you guys um over the next like week to two

friend and he's got plenty of stuff he used to work at the smoke shop and he's just got like all the best dabs and uh just weed pieces in general i'm probably going to do like the puffco carter versus a rig um and see if it's worth your guys money and if you guys want to go forward with that type [ __ ] i'm planning on doing tons of reviews and like a vlog as well um there's there's tons of stuff

this is iced out images coming at you with another product review this one is once again I haven't got the kid to respond to me yet about the discipline came from them so just like my last product review that I did yesterday I'm going to put that in the description below so this is Tropicana cookies is the name that I was told on the top the person just wrote traffic honor and I know I pronounced that weird but I'm from England so that's just the way it comes out of my mouth smells so [ __ ] good live better so pick this up 45 of G so I got this and then I got the mother's milk which is in the other video if you don't mind going to watch that one if you enjoy these videos just [ __ ] cold out today house how blonde leaves whoa [ __ ] freezing so I'm still in my work gear but so 45 of G got the mother's milk and got this mother's milk previous video blah blah blah blah blah so this one I don't have my other phone with me much kids on it right now but the the stuff that I can remember that I looked up is that it is peppery citrus hoppy flavor it is cross between Girl Scout cookie and tan G so I've had to Angie before and I've had Girl Scout cookie I've liked both so we're just gonna jump right into this we're gonna be rocking it off of my sci-fi glass piece so anyone new to this channel sci-fi glass shout out to these guys I like a lot of their [ __ ] so far like off-the-wall and cool-looking start heating up the Bangor and get this damn and after work did that I busted my ass in the freezing weather kind of dead you know well hopefully everyone else had a fantastic and warm day I froze my dick off pretty much any time they took my hand and my gloves off and my hands were exposed to the air from the moment I pumped up a tire this morning time I got to work time I got home just cold it's going to be like 17 degrees tonight here in Michigan maybe even less I forget it might be 10 degrees I don't remember get my days mixed up a little bit yeah what's that hopefully you guys had a great day sad I just worked came home my girls about to leave for work so I'm gonna take this and then go inside and spend the rest of set time with my son I'm supposed to pick up my mother car today it didn't start been sitting for months so we're certain it's gonna be the battery we tried to jump it that didn't work we changed the battery out that ended up not working come to find out that on Lexuses there's like if you do something a certain way the security system won't let the car start or recognize that the key fobs inside the car I don't know it's pushed the start though this shit's all new to me it'll be the newest car is over owned 2010 which happens to be almost 10 years old the last war I had was a 92 Toyota for sale before that was a 99 stable 99 contour prior to that the newest car I owned was a 2002 or what if there was a 2002 that I got in O five it was a Saturn SC 2 coupe and I loved it that car so from my other video I'm gonna let this cool down just a little bit longer than I did last night because that [ __ ] must have still been too hot because it's just instant and I was baked but you know I didn't I didn't taste as much of the chirps and stuff as I wanted especially coming from something like this quality ooh Oh fat daddy tasty damn there's that peppery / hoppy taste the citrusy part is almost like bitter you know like it hits hard yeah very tasty well as I said I'll find out what this bow these are from and I'll put it in the description below in case anyone wants to try to get their hands on it I understand it was 45 a gram from the kid I get it from I'm not sure what deals they're running for you know it says five g's on it so so I know the guy picked up 10 grams of live batter five in this one five in the other I got a gram of each very very tasty strong strong high and pretty sure this is a hybrid I don't know I'll put it in the description below I'll copy the ship from Leafly and just I will put it right in there and any other information that I need to put in so yeah strongly recommend it Tropicana cookies if you can get your hands on it it's probably pretty good in just normal wax but if you can afford to spend the extra money and get the you know the live batter I'd recommend it the quality is better taste is better and the potency definitely seems higher just seems like a better product all the way around compared to say a lot of these you know FPR ones that I've been getting from healing tree Wellness Center that's not talking [ __ ] about healing tree Wellness Center that's just saying that the quality of this is better than that and the proofs didn't pudding you know that's like a dark almost goldish color almost like a like an amber type color almost and this [ __ ] like crystal white almost not quite egg yellow but man that smell I wish you guys could smell this [ __ ] you guys wouldn't be like a throw me add a beam right now and uh you know for some of you some of you live close enough to where we could arrange [ __ ] like that you know stop in at the shed and come being a video just chitchat [ __ ] [ __ ] take a DAB and we can you know have like guest spots like hey that is specifically towards you Jim Becker obviously and anybody else we can figure some [ __ ] out like a little meet-and-greet kind of thing little smoke sesh but chances are I'm

chunk feminized um you know it's great we are just cutting it off you know what is very beautiful um if I would go this is a big plant you guys I mean in terms of like [ __ ] thick dense growing and [ __ ] that that's pretty big like I don't want anybody commenting only this is cheaper one time no [ __ ] okay maybe you did have it but that doesn't matter you know let's start what this is about this is about me having a great time this is my first plant every guys growing marijuana well you know if you visited urban growers channel you can obviously see I've been girl first words actually I do that I'm even going to point out the channel to them if you just point right down to the bottom sucks down animal look that's the channel guys so click on that at the tip of the cola click at that and um you know that check out the other grow um we did BIGBANG automatic which was great autoflowering um came out great got about an ounce off of that this is around like three times the size of that I'm guessing so or hopefully hopefully around you know my wishful thinking colleagues over there or you know over to keep you this without my mom no QP would be nice so I'm definitely looking possible like if you look at these nubs and stuff they're huge but yeah anyways we're just going to trim all these extra little leave those video and we will cutting them into this terrarium type deal this like forty gallon it's about a baby ok Genuity gallon uh terrarium and we're just cutting that in there so if you want to turn that lay on and get going a little bit stronger right it will hurry the [ __ ] up okay just cut I'm just going to film a little bit of it so you can film the whole process although these urban grower fans would love to see that you don't even have any fans oh yes if you disagree with my colleague like this video it's why we brewed my [ __ ] wheat does Matt we argue some more but yeah this is great I mean as you can tell that's a [ __ ] huge nug of marijuana and obviously yes it is gonna dry it is going to get lighter currently I would say Lawson is out and so it's like that other [ __ ] the low rider that we grew two years ago once like when the buds are like this dense and like it doesn't really lose too much I mean it we had its waterway I know dense dense wheat well obviously it'll compact and it stays pretty heavy yeah it stays pretty heavy this is about a two pound plant and so I'm you know this is obviously gonna like my [ __ ] hand is getting sore just holding it up like this but yeah anyways this is obviously going to dry to road a quarter turn to hopefully about a quarter pound 4 ounces um so yeah go ahead and subscribe if you haven't you get updates for my new videos coming out which will include the second part or third part this is the second part this is the second part to the harvest alright so it will include you know you'll get a update about to lie to you for the other go um and you know obviously stay tuned because

a live stream we're gonna go ahead and do uh the rest of the presses from yesterday that i didn't finish it up got uh six bucks here we're gonna go ahead and start pressing these um i'm thinking at 200. yesterday we did a range of temperatures the lower temperatures were not cutting it so we're going to go back to our our higher tip that i like to do that 202 we're gonna go ahead and uh we'll see how that does got some more parchment so i got the uh pucks properly wrapped up now and prepped in the appropriate size parchment sleeves so we should be able to get a decent flow and we'll just have to see what we get and we'll adjust the temperature as needed i don't imagine we'll be going down below 190 so excuse me one minute while i go ahead and finish straightening some [ __ ] up it is [ __ ] chilly chilly really really really [ __ ] is cold in the [ __ ] whoa i honestly i'm about to put on my [ __ ] key hold on yeah burr yeah we bout to take a dab right now hell yeah seeking something i'm glad to hear that man that's dope get your press on so here's the jar that we started last night this stuff was super turpy so we got all these crazy dark terps in here and we've got this lighter area and we're going to go ahead and we're going to mix all of it together today trim run gelato cake and white runs it's a little darker but oh my god i am in love with the taste already the taste on it is like a mint chocolate chip coffee it's bananas not the flavor but just it's crazy i haven't done any like stirring whipping i haven't done anything to it since last night i'm curious to see what it's going to do over the next couple days oh man and it melts so clean like you wouldn't even believe with how dark it is how clean it melts i'm gonna show you guys [Music] oh

led fromage that's uh yeah that's about as good as we're gonna get on that one [Music] [Music] i gotta now i gotta google this [ __ ] i don't know what you're saying but i gotta find out i gotta find out he said okay goodbye [Music] [Music] the power what pleasure strength i'm sorry is that being is that being culturally insensitive am i being stereotypical am i stereotyping i'm sorry let's get this press started i'm banked already [Music] um [Music] excuse me excuse me hold on the tripod get you guys set up and then um we'll go from there [Music] hey [Music] dabbing gloves big force the team oh the team sounds like he's trying to say like uh the team is strong like big up to the team [Music] am i am i right we just started working at amazon working overnights that means you're packing [ __ ] women's dildo orders and [ __ ] huh doing all the freaky [ __ ] overnight i got you on that [ __ ] [ __ ] it's okay boy what else could they use the overnight [ __ ] for at amazon that's gotta be it that's gotta be so [Music] [Music] [Music] my man said he's part of the ginyu force that's what he said until we figure out what he's saying we're just gonna assume that he's saying he's part of the ginyu force [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign oh this one gets loud oh so good return puck feels uh pretty well emptied and got off the plates pretty quick and was the same color or lighter than yesterday a slightly better return feels like so i dropped the temperature a little bit but not much because this stuff does just come out darker because in the terps [Music] so i still want to keep the flow high [Music] myself [Music] uh wow i'm allowed to give you guys information soon but i can't give you information on pricing yet i was told i have to wait until science led makes the official announcement and gets them on their site and then by then they'll have like um shipping times and you'll be able to pre-order and [ __ ] they don't want to put out the information too soon so they told me to wait trust me i'm i'm so ready to tell you guys [Music] you know [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm at uh 190 right now it's just looking off because the lighting is [ __ ] and this is a trim run bro here maybe this will help you guys with the color issue i know it's hard to tell but you'll see you'll see get this in the jar and then we're going to go ahead and start the next puck that was a good temperature and we're gonna run it at that time yeah i don't really have a good spot you guys where you're not gonna be in the [ __ ] way i'll try and move you over a little bit i think my laptop could be [ __ ] maybe let me see food grade month okay you guys if you say so you know what determines whether it's food grade or not how clean it melts when i show you how clean it melts you're gonna be like oh okay yeah that's not food grade the trichomes that come off of trim is usually going to be more mature because it's exposed to more direct light than the rest of the trichomes that are covered in the plant matter right so when you process trim it's going to come out slightly more amber too all right and then if you're dealing with a strain that's really really terpy and depending on what those terpenes are can also make it darker right so never judge judge it by the color alone and be quick to say oh that's food grade or that's not good like it's really really hard to judge it based off of color alone especially fresh off the press so oh yeah definitely people judge with their eyes first for sure you eat with your eyes first you judge off of appearance first but again this is fresh off the plates and you got to give me a couple days and work my magic on it telling you guys i'm telling you huh i want to mention just my lighting is [ __ ] probably back you guys the [ __ ] up huh um the plan is going to be to whip this all up and heat mat it and then burp it at um at a certain point [Music] so good extraction on that one too this is going to turn out just like the los altos did it's gonna turn into that like jam with chunks in it and i'm gonna love it we'll love every minute of it there's not good light over here where's the best light for me let's go in here oh no [ __ ] that room goes crazy let's try right here man the light [ __ ] right now there we go how's that color looking it looks like [ __ ] when you look at it from the top because the camera can't perceive the light the same way but it's just terpius [ __ ] so and you would think oh the lower temperature you go the lighter it'll be no because it just takes too long to get off the plates and we already tried 200 that was too hot then 190 is is the sweet spot it's the best it's gonna get for uh for this i mean i can go like 155 160 and press like five grams at a time maybe get a different result but i'm not pressing five [ __ ] grams at a time that's not what's gonna happen today i wonder if it would help so this is gonna get real silly if i don't put you guys down soon oh this is between 16 to 22 grams in every one of these bags how did you already know right my man saw the board behind me and added it up already my press is feminine thank you her name is bertha so yes she is feminine it's not the craziest smell actually because i'm not running it too hot but it's like a minty coffee lag oh there's some fat ass chunks in this hmm two more oh my goodness we always gotta get one or two huh you know actually i think that you've been on this channel being done before you are the weakest link bye [Music] [Music] i don't know yet my yield on this run yet because we're in the middle of doing it right now i'm not trying to be a smart ass but open your eyes [Music] how old is the material it was a couple weeks old when it was given to me about two weeks old i want to say sat in the freezer for a couple weeks i don't know if uh what the yield has been i haven't really been weighing anything yet so i'll just wait and see i'll wait and find out at the end and i get a veggie burger with uh grilled onions no tomato with fries with uh spread i mean i put my own beyond meat burger patty on it when i get home still enjoy in and out but do it the vegan way yeah buddy but also whoever did mention edibles for food grade i am going to turn a good portion of my cut into edibles or at least caps really potent caps rosin gaps no i didn't do anything today i'm working working working working working and uh somebody else says one more and then collection and then we're going to stir it all up and get it going on the heat map i'm gonna heat mat it at least overnight i'll show you guys i have no secrets no secrets whatsoever i don't time anything i don't look at the gauge anything if i don't know who you are on the gram or if you don't follow or like somebody i know doesn't follow you then i don't accept you you got to tell me what your name is so that i can go and accept you and maybe maybe if i've seen your name around here enough i'll accept it otherwise you gotta know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody so yeah there i'm gonna start doing a lot more live sessions that are gonna be more interactive i'm gonna set up uh a streaming session in the new hash set so it'll be a good stable connection and we'll be able to have some proper lighting in there our windows uh vented sunlight and we'll be able to have some real good sessions okay so so yo i watched this uh hugh hefner docu-series with my wife and it was actually pretty interesting i didn't know that he was so involved in social issues it was really interesting to see that and how he went against the grain with racism and segregation and he would invite um all these black stars to come onto his show right and he had aretha franklin and um brain farting on the other person and but he had like a bunch of different up and coming artists and he wasn't afraid to have them come and perform at his club because he didn't care he didn't see color he just saw talent and he wanted to make it known what his company stood for and didn't stand for and so he interviewed like he did really really in-depth interviews with a lot of celebrities and at one point he did an in-depth interview with malcolm x and malcolm x was you know saying his typical stuff very radical extremist stuff and mind you majority of the readers of playboy back at this time are white and he published it against the advice of all the other people that were working for and he published it unedited and well not unedited like they edited it but they didn't like edit his answers or change his wording they left it all exactly how he said it you know um and i'm like yo that that's [ __ ] ballsy and he got a lot of support for it actually afterwards and a lot of readers wrote in and said that was awesome thanks for sharing that interview blah blah blah so yeah man that was that was really interesting to watch that and obviously to watch his back and forth with struggling to be um you know married and father and all these different things that he just couldn't [ __ ] do living in the [ __ ] mansion i think any normal man would succumb to that [ __ ] after a while especially after being away from your wife the man was surrounded by titties and ass 24 7. like i think he had so much titties and ass i would get tired of it i would be like [ __ ] put some clothes on like it's not even exciting anymore to see your titties they're just always out like put some clothes on surprise me i want to come around the corner and just be like ah titties surprise it's been three days then i'm gonna be like oh titties but if i see titties every time i walk around the [ __ ] house i'm titties like what like it's like looking at an elbow it's just not gonna matter anymore you know just doesn't [ __ ] matter anymore i don't know how that man stayed excited by i guess maybe there was just so many different kinds of titties i don't know i think i would get over it titty climbing wall bro you know how much i just pictured that [ __ ] on my head like a rock climbing wall but instead of rocks his titties yo oh my god you are creative you are creative that is funny he says my friend has a thing for elbows i mean i'm a classic i'm a classy man i i like exposed shoulders if my wife ever has like a shirt that is like has one of those wide neck collars and you know her shoulder starts to show a little bit i'm like oh that's classy sexy i'm an old man i guess but hey can we get a quick vote while i take this dab a quick vote side boob is 2003 but it's okay quick vote he said yes yo kristoff i wish i knew what you were saying somebody tell me what he's saying titty

description for you guys hey until next time peace", "w0Bti-7LscE": "hey guys Trevor he was ready to leave and we're gonna add this little bit of a clip to the beginning of our chem dog og full melt concentrate review so good buds put out a little bit of information on this then I didn't get the chance to read through all the way and now that I have it's definitely changed a little bit on how this product did in the review and I just wanted to give you guys a little bit of an update and give you the full information set I'm not giving out any sort of poor information so we've got this chem dog og full melt here I'm gonna throw on my email so I can take a DAB with you guys at the end of this but while that's heating up I'm gonna rattle off what good buds put on here and I'm just gonna read it word for word for you guys that we're not mixing anything up and we're getting exactly what good buds is trying to get across so this is off of the Instagram post that they have on there and it starts out with a big attention dabbers on there so good buds company we have to apologize for labeling our live resin hash as live resin we recognize now that labeling it this way is overly vague and that has met led many to think our white glue keys chem dog OG and lord of the Apes were pho products which they are not they're solving the solvent list products you guys so we have we called it live resin hash because it was extracted using fresh frozen input similar to that of live resin BHO products while a description on a gel see all indicate these products are solvent --let's hash we weren't able to fit the full three words live resin hash on our products on our packages so are you guessing our team decided to drop the word hash and call it live resin thinking that this would help differentiate it from other hashes made with dry trim leaves we recognize now that that has made it confusion for those that are used to the BHO live resin so the butane extraction library while alive resin hashes can be dabbed there not optimally suited for it they require higher heat than a normal dab 700 or 650 to 700 degrees a smaller portion grain of rice and will typically leave some residue when dab for something truly devilry recommend our hash rosin and upcoming mango taffy rod going forward we are labeling all future releases our live resin hash as live hash on the label to avoid confusions the good buds - before we go into this review I'm gonna give you guys a head up we did dab our way through this review and I did enjoy it on the dabs it definitely had an interesting flavor and a unique experience but by no means did it take my breath away was the top of the line of anything I've ever smoked but I do have a little bit of it left here we've had it in the fridge I've got my email actually set for 650 is what we ended up dabbing it on here so we did get to dab it at the optimal temperature I'm gonna do one more dab with you guys since they said a grain of rice we're gonna do a little bit more than that since why not let's dab this you guys and hope you guys have a great day and I hope you guys enjoy this review all I'm gonna say now is I will have to bump this up one point just because we did get a little bit more breakdown a little bit more information so you guys this is gonna get an 8 out of 10 hope you guys enjoy and yeah smoke up while you watch this review all Cheers [Music] absolutely tasty see you guys at the other side I don't even know why I say on the other side I'll see you guys in this review cheers oh hey guys trevor here with ready to leave and today this beautiful Tuesday we're gonna be tap it into a little gem dog oh gee full mouth good I'm really looking forward to tapping into this you guys it's gonna be the first concentrate that we're getting into from the legal market and I cannot wait let's tap into this and start pushing our way through the rigs and finishing it off with the email you guys we got four dabs scheduled for today let's get to welcome back you guys so we've got the chem dog og full melt bubble hash hash from good buds so this full melt is actually rated as a six star hash rosin so the difference between a five and a six star is gonna be the full melt and that's why these guys have full mouth right there on the container so this is apparently supposed to leave zero residue in the bangers or any any sort of nail that you use to dab it or vaporize it so that's supposed to be the difference between this one and any of the other hash Roslin's that good buds puts out so the definitely intrigued me and you guys voted to see that this one was reviewed first so let's get into it and start reviewing this one you guys so now that we've covered a little bit of a difference from this one to the rest room let's get into the THC and CBD and then we'll start actually dabbing this you guys so the THC total on this is going to be sixty six point five percent and the CBD is gonna be a big fat whomping zero and it would it was packaged on the 20th of February 2020 so it is a little bit older on the package date you guys but we've got lots of fun to get going on this and to tap into it so right here it tells you how to open it it says to open use both palms and turn that way so both palms and rotate there we go got that off and then we've got the actual container here with the concentrate on the inside think they're just glued it's actually in there pretty snugly so I don't think we're gonna get that out but we're gonna crack this open and wow it actually pushes through is a really decent flavor you've got a really really strong almost kind of a lime flavor in there and there you go you get that half Grammer right yeah you've got a lot of really crystal coated passion here which is not something I was expecting oh that works out to our advantage ladies and gentlemen the whole thing just popped right off so there we go you've got the half gram of the chem dog OD full melt it's actually got a really nice looking consistent seats through it see what happens when we split it up it actually breaks off into some pretty decent chunks you guys I'm really looking forward to trying this out we've got our first little chunk here we're going to take that we're going to drop that in right there put a little bit extra in there too I will take our first dab of this full milk in and see how it does so we're gonna start out through three different rigs within the bangers we're gonna do a cold start dab right here through this rig and we'll put this carb cap on here we're just gonna do a nice cold start then we're gonna take to heat a cool dabs letting the second of one of those heat down cool down just a little bit less we can see how it tastes through a little bit of a higher flavor but see if I give you guys know I won't be able to give you a very good melt shot with this banger just a little bit too well used and well worn so I'm curious to see how this is gonna do for a cold start you've actually got a really good vapor building on there looks like it's ready guys let's try it out cheese shop [Music] okay yes so I didn't really get that much flavor through that cold start there honestly just was not that much there so we've got the the banger here warmed up and we're just waiting for it to cool down but we'll pull out a nice big chunk this time and really give it a shot to try and show off here and that last one didn't really get that full melt capability so I'm really curious to see if if we'll see that this time because I'm a really new experiencing with this full melt - that good buds putting out but I'm I'm enjoying a little bit of a high that I got from that first one so it's definitely dive into this one you guys and see if we'll get a little bit more flavor than we did through the first down so we've got that minute cooldown let's drop the sucker in here and try it out y'all Cheers oh there you go now it's bubbling hey guys so we're letting the Evan Shore banger cool down a little bit but honestly this full melts isn't really fun oh I'm not getting that at all you guys I'm getting partial melt at best like the flavor the flavor and the high that I got from the last one was really mild but it was enjoyable but the amount of work I'm having to put in to clean the bangers were bangers afterwards you guys I don't know if it's I don't know if it's really worthwhile for this but we're gonna keep on dabbing we're gonna hit this one at a little bit of a hot attempt so let's drop the sucker in and see if we get more of a full mouth on the oven Shore [Music] OKs so honestly I'm getting a pretty reasonable flavor through there and the high is hitting actually quite nice I'm finding it is that very much chem dog high it's got a lot of that cerebral energy kind of boost definitely has got kind of a mental drift to it I'm I'm enjoying the high quite a bit you guys from this concentrate the big thing that I'm not enjoying is how much work I'm having to do to take and clean my bangers up sit there back to the way I like them I like keeping this banger crystal clear for for the optimal turf flavor and this one this one's just old and chaste and very well used but this is about as clean as it's gonna get I still got a little bit of work in there a little bit but I'm really just like Cleve might keep my rigs clean I want to taste what I'm smoking so I keep them so cleans that I can and this is just not having that full melt like they described and it's a little bit disappointing like this is definitely more of that partial melt bubble hash and it's there's nothing wrong with it and for the price point being right around the 30 dollars for a half gram it's not unreasonable either for for the flavors and the high that you're getting but for you to classify this full melt and charge a little bit more and then not actually be a full melts and it could be the temperature change that's causing that issue and a little bit of the the digression of it because these guys can like seal all their stuff and everything's in a frozen state and coming over to Alberta they don't maintain that frozen state so until they can do that I don't think we're gonna be seeing the best of this just because it's gonna be heating up and then you've got you don't know how the stores take care of it you don't know how the transport there so there's so many variables and I'm learning a lot through the concentrates that if you're not taking care of them the way that they're meant to and a lot of them need to be cooller you're gonna lose a lot of the quality from there and I think that's definitely what's happening with this right now we're gonna go through a little tougher period with the concentrates until we can get them kind of tuned in to where we want but they're not doing too bad you guys so we're gonna take one more fat dab with you before we head out and we're gonna talk about it after we do this but I hope you guys enjoyed this video I definitely have enjoyed making it so far we've got a really fat stack here you got the clean crab cap let's get to it you guys let's see if we get a full melt on email Cheers [Music] [Music] yes so that that full melt from the chem dog full melts from good buds um I can't give it an 8 gonna be straight-up honest with you just because it didn't have the full mount quality that I was expecting so that right there is gonna knock a knock it down to at least a seven I think I can keep it out right around that 7 out of a 10 the high honestly is what's taking it away it had a really nice strong and I like I really really like live resin and rosin and stuff along the lines where it's full flower composition particularly because it has the full flower effects and I find that it lasts longer than just dabs do like concentrates and diamonds any anything that's processed and stripped I find that I lose the high relatively quickly where full flower spectrum like full spectrum rosin stuff along those lines definitely hit and hold the high a lot longer and I really do enjoy them because they give you the heavy head of the concentrate but the carry that's it more similar to flower and it's huge reason why I love pressing my own draws and when I have the flower to do it that's the other side of that battle but today I definitely think I'm gonna give this one a 7 out of 10 I'm definitely interested in smoking some more out of it I think it might be more of an email or a little bit of older Banger concentrate to smoke it out of but it's definitely got its place and I'm enjoying it quite a bit you guys but we're gonna wrap that video up I hope you guys enjoyed a little bit you know what I'm gonna take a ripoff of this Florida lemons babe cartridge here got it on the red setting so we're gonna kick over to the YouTube end card that way but the rest of you that aren't on YouTube I really

"[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys it's cliff with peer pressure here thanks for tuning in to are solving this review series we've got Roz and Ryan from olio here today we're gonna be checking out his papaya punch number four let's get to it [Music] the papaya punch number four from olio is a cross between purple punch and papaya both heavily indica dominant strains the purple punch was giving me hints of grape candy and a sweet blueberry muffin fresh out of the oven while the papaya was was on the sweet candy side of things papaya candy maybe a little hint of mango in there and it's very surprising that it was an indica dominant strain because most of the effects I was getting were what you would attribute to a sativa dominant strain and I was getting a very energetic productive and uplifting high I tribute this to the high concentration of limonene found in the string and the limonene is really what was giving me that mood elevation in euphoria the second most concentrated terpene present and this strain was Lin Ahlul and I tribute that to the relaxation and stress relief that I was getting from this hey guys it's clip peer-pressure here welcome to the solvent ice review series this is episode number two we've got rosin ryan here with olio and we're gonna be reviewing the papaya punch number four this is our jam product this is been heat cured this is pretty much the most separated of all our consistencies as far as THC a and terpene content within the rosin and we believe it's probably the most shelf-stable even if you don't put it in the fridge or anything like that it keeps flavor for a long time and it's honestly my favorite consistency that I'm smoking right now so you can leave this out and it doesn't it doesn't you know decrease in terpene value it won't dry up which some people do like but this here let me show you here sure so what's this little dab tool here so every gram of ours has kind of comes with a personal dabber it's just a little extra thing we do just select emergency dabber in case of situations for sure very nice nice touch so what can you tell me about the the strain here so this is our papaya punch number four this is we have a few different fee knows we always Fino test a few different seeds that we get it's like the most exotic fruity and most punchy almost phyno it's got an exotic note it's um it's got a little bit of that artificial grape in it from the purple punch it's probably one of my favorite strains at the moment and this is from pony seeds papaya times purple punch very nice yep this is perfect for during the day I'll run some errands after dabbing some of this stuff it's very relaxing but its clear-headed yes it's a hybrid like most things are nowadays and for me personally I know it's different for everybody but I could dab some of this and still get a lot of stuff done during the day I don't feel too body locked or anything like that I still I'm ready to go you know do my stuff for the day so got that clarity stay exactly exactly and it's so flavorful that I almost don't expect to relax feeling I'm expecting some type of anxiety yes achieve a high but it's honestly perfect mellow high for the middle of the day definitely so how do you typically go about finding a good hash string it is many different steps so first of all to grow which ones grow nice we can't get any males obviously we take out the males whatever females are left it really is dependent on how well they grow their yield in the garden then once we wash them it's gonna be based on water hash yields it's gonna be the thing that plays the most role and if we keep it or not if it does yield well a nice hash and it presses well usually we'll keep it it all depends on flavors yields we all come together smoked them we all you know put in our opinions of you know which one do you think is a little bit tastier versus if the yield if it's really worth it sometimes we'll take a tastier one even if it yields a little bit lower just because it's got that little extra that we know people will will enjoy it so for sure so what do you thoughts on fresh frozen verse washing dried and cured flour so you can wash cured I've seen it done stuff 99% of our stuff is fresh frozen almost almost all we have our own in-house garden everything is harvested fresh frozen washed within usually one to two weeks so we try to wash it as quickly as possible really keeps that terpene profile just like it was when you were smelling the plant so when you're going around you got your fingers on the nose I want that to be what the rosin tastes like yeah I went down I really do think fresh frozen you know produces that a little bit better of a quality in the end for sure yeah so yeah you talked about doing BHO extraction in the past and you know when BHO first came out people were always looking for a light golden color but it seems now that things are kind of moving more towards an almost white color and I've even heard of people pulling their plants early to even get that color do you have any comment on like that is a huge trend right now in the in the grow world as people know you can pull your plants a little bit early but you're gonna sacrifice what I believe is a little bit taste and your potency the effects from you pulling early I believe are gonna be felt people really go for that visual yeah so when people see white hash they really they get excited yeah I think people really need to try the hash more side-by-sides sometimes a darker hash will blow the lighter hash out of the water with taste with potency affect how it makes you feel so I really think people should try stuff before you know everybody eats with their eyes so to speak but but uh you really gotta get smoking yeah so what can you tell us about the terpene profiles some of the flavors that you're getting up the papaya punch number four so this number four is probably our most like exotic fruity vino of this papaya punch it's mostly papaya notes it's that exotic fruit in there and it's got a little bit of artificial grape in there from that purple punch that's definitely that's it in there I think it's probably the most well balanced of our papaya punch he knows as far as flavor goes and that consistency is honestly my favorite I like when I see large chunks and they're swimming in Terps so definitely that Jam was just it's something else that is beautiful I seriously could smell it earlier just sitting back here when it was sitting over there so I liked what you did with it for sure well what about terpenes in general their medicinal benefits I mean how do you think that plays a role into the medicinal benefits the high and whether you classify it as an indica sativa I think everybody you know takes terpenes in a little bit differently obviously some of the ones like limonene stuff like that are just known to generally give people a little bit more uplifting effects like that but as far as terpenes go it's really about finding a flavor that you enjoy in an effect that doesn't hinder your day really yeah if you smoked something that you really like but it's giving you anxiety obviously that might not be the strain for you you should find something you know with similar profiles that don't actually have that same terpene you know within the plant so if you like something fruity but you're getting horrible anxiety from lemon let's maybe try like a citrus yeah or another a strawberry banana or something like that where you know hey this tastes really good but it's not gonna cause me to freak out yeah strawberry banana is one of my favorites - it's super relaxing probably the heaviest indica of the fruity stuff that I've tried so I know a lot of people that love it definitely definitely so one thing I love about following you on instagram is that you're just always dropping knowledge helping push the community further for those of you who aren't following him on Instagram he's at a troz and Ryan check him out lots of great content out there so I feel like the first time I ever heard the term rosin jam it was from following you on Instagram can you comment did did you coin that phrase is there anything there it was kind of more of the people speaking we did a little survey and stuff we just wanted a different our selves a little bit um there was a huge craze going on at the time of people putting rosin in jars and this whole new tech that's going on and I really wanted to create a name that people think Jam they think olio but honestly it's kind of taken off we've noticed other people you know using the rosin Jam name and we really don't seem to mind we've had people in Spain posting rosin jam so I think there's a really awesome to see and it's just it's just our version of rosin sauce or you know just a just a new just a new consistency we're just trying to cone so definitely yeah consistency is everything when I'm looking for a product if typically I lean more towards the jams you know if I see something that's a little more buttery that's just not usually my flavor lots of people like the butter does it is all of reference a lot of people love the butter just for ease of dabbing people like to just dig in some people grab it with their hands and just drop a bomb right in there and just its ease of dabbing it's a preference some people don't want the rosin heat it up some people want it straight off the press and put in the fridge so we like to offer a product for everybody yeah if you want your Ross and put in the fridge we have classic coins um if you want butter we have butter if you want your stuff lightly heated we have a batter and if you want a true separation and you want your rasam to look like BHO a live resin consistency and you don't want to leave it in the fridge then the jam is for you no down so I've got a bunch of homies they nerd out on temperatures as far as pressing goes dabbing goes do you have like a perfect temperature range usually fall in when it comes to pressing and dabbing yes I do if you know if something is pretty melty I use usually stick around 180 degrees that's a nice low temp of times and stuff really vary between how much you put in the bag and what you're squishing and all that but I like 180 degrees it just really is like a nice golden you know point for me for sure yeah so what about the your actual rig or the nail have you ever played around with temperatures I have and stuff it's been a while I'm usually just a time kind of guy kind of figure out what my new nail you know Davin is I'll heat it up and kind of do a test or at 45 seconds you know on minute 30 kind of see what my nails I like a low time dab it uh I'm gonna be dabbing I like a little bit extra on the bottom I'll leave a little puddle sometimes I don't mind you're sure we'll be sure to keep it on the blue setting oh yeah yeah so when you typically take a dab how long does it take for you to feel the effects usually I'm and this is just me I usually feel the effects pretty instantly honestly me too I uh I'll take a dab of this stuff and be ready to go yeah you know it's it's pretty instant behind the eyes yeah yep do you get that with other extracts or do you think rosin high gloss hooker I think rosin in general and solvent listen general I feel throughout my body a little bit more I noticed when I dabbed BHO it's it's more of a head high uhm BHO always you know it feels a little more floaty to me uh rosin solvent list is always a little bit more body I feel a little bit more relaxation from it instantly definite so tell me a little bit about the the bubble hash side of things how are you guys washing what's the trick to getting this so it all starts in the grow so most of our stuff is it's very well taken care of throughout all of its life the veg has to be very clean the early flowering stages at the environment is a huge factor so that's all before the wash is really the plant when we take when we're harvesting no no trimmers even touch the nose they're all hold it you know by the stem cut off the nose and take little golf ball sized pieces really trying to not disrupt any trike formation that we've you know work so hard to grow so washing we use our all RO water it's all hand washed pretty much as gentle as you can wash bud they do it multiple times will wash four or five times just to ensure that all the heads are taken off it's done in a cold room it's all ROI sorrow water it's as clean as can be in there so yeah that's how you make clean Rossum's clean hash and a clean girl so you mentioned washing by hand why do you prefer that over say and automate it where I can just hit the button and it's just uh really control over you know your whole process you can stir as gently as you want you can have a machine that stirs pretty gently but just having that control that hand on it and really seeing how much you're taking off each plant and stuff like that it's that extra care that really goes into it that really just makes it that much better for sure well let's let's get to it yes you want to about here guess we'll switch on over to the blue temp there it's the lowest temperature we've got I've got a little new little guide tool too they do come in handy [Music] man that's just what I was looking for you can definitely get that sweep of pile on the front and then on the backend you've got that like earthy grape soda candy like it was it's definitely what I'm looking for I'm glad you enjoyed it man yeah I always um I always enjoy papaya but that uh that little extra little grape really adds something to it it's got like a little almost a spiciness almost to it it's just really good for sure so what are you feeling like effects wise right now what do you think I I love the relaxed feeling I get from this the clear-headedness good vibe to some music right now to there so I just love the effects just great for chilling yeah you know I've got a real calm my body's real relaxed but in my brain I've got that little tingle to it but it's still real clear yep perfect biking it's quick behind the eyes and stuff quick acting I still feel like I could you know get up and go do some stuff right now so it's perfect and it is some strong stuff dum papaya punch generally tests around 80% for us so I mean that's a pretty high THC content so sure yep the rest of it's pretty much chirps we've been getting regularly 20% turps with the jam it's probably a 5 to 8 percent increase over just having it out you know just fresh press so wow it's quite a significant difference yeah so if somebody was looking to get some of this sweet papaya grape soda candy where could they find that so yeah you can find our product pretty much all over Colorado it's in recreational and medical shops dispensaries we have a flagship dispo it's higher grade they offer recreational and medical at two different locations you're probably gonna have our your best bet you know finding some jam there but we also you know post drops all over our Instagram page at dabble leo 7:10 you can give us a follow I also have my personal page at Ross and Ryan so I usually post the flavors as soon as I make them people get a little anxious and always ask me where it's at it's gonna be about a week or two before testing and all the packaging gets ready usually about a week and usually the olio page is where you can find all the information the drops what you know pretty much where everything's going that you're looking for thanks for stopping by man really enjoy the papaya punch number four it's definitely gonna be one of my goat cheese for this summer for anybody out there is not following them on Instagram be sure to check out at Roz and Ryan always dropping knowledge about solving this extraction trying to push the industry forward and dab olio 710 that's where we got the papaya punch number four from highly recommend it I really appreciate you guys having me I always love talking hash and thanks again so much come down so after sitting on the high for a while you know I really found it interesting that I was getting a lot of sativa dominant effects or what you would think would be sativa dominant effects because they're both in economists trains that we're working with here you know we've got the papaya on one side we've got the purple punch on the other like I said both indica dominant so you would expect a sedative effect but what I found was something really uplifting and that's why I think it's the perfect Brosnan for summertime vacation because it was relaxing mentally but still energetic got a little euphoria from that so an all-around great summertime high and perfect for like I said any vacation any trip to the beach or the lake definitely be my go-to and thanks for tuning in guys be sure to like and subscribe below follow us on our IG Facebook at go peer

when I got the real [ __ ] I noticed something too sometimes when you heat up the real [ __ ] there'll be like little [ __ ] strands of something it's like you know pulled the dabs apart right and sometimes when you when the point where it breaks off and I'd like these little strands you could pull apart and [ __ ] you know there's some there's some strands like that I'd rather just do dabs I'd rather just do the [ __ ] that comes in the whole [ __ ] jar and you take my little dab tool and [ __ ] scoop it up and it's like uh I don't know how to say I don't I'm talking about but it's like a cream or something you just scoop it up put it up there it's like a sticky thing too it's just a it's like a very thick liquid then you scoop it up and and then you heat up the think and any and then you smoke you smoke it that way and it gets you high like a me get this this [ __ ] has the same consistency as it the you know pull departments like these threads I don't know pathology you know what

"0RssrxrB2sQ": "what's up party people we are back for the second concentrate review for you guys and this one was going to be pineapple express this is the other sativa concentrate I picked up from La Brea collective in Los Angeles god I don't know if I told you guys but we got five grand mates and [ __ ] I'm sure I made a video earlier on it but in case you guys forgot these are this is a split between two and a half grams this one was a 1 gram on the other or this one was one and a half grams the other one was a gram Chiwetel these are very hooked up my girl just always does this right because we make sure every tipper very very well so she knows she knows when we come in that we're gonna be getting a good amount and she always does this right so this time being the pineapple Express this one is like I said a bit more purged and stable than the other one it's a little bit cleaner by a just a very little bit you can tell the texture isn't gritty at all it's just very it's very chunky it's got that same kind of colour to it it's very golden orange it's a bit less amber than the other one it's got a bit more gold orange hue to it as you guys can can see in the light it's not as dark as the other one and it has definitely a bit better perch on it it's more dry by a good bit than the other one and it's much more stable coming on in a bit just really nice golden butter oh I got a piece of [ __ ] on it back there from one of the probes that's not black so that's actually I'm boil in the butter it's just a little black spot from one of my dental probes but you guys can see really nice butter and the light hits it right there you can see how gold it is but it's just got that very orange slightly amber hue to it much less than the other one and just very very good smelling it smells just as citrusy as the other one like I said it's in flavor and smell it's got the same orange citrus Ness to it but it has this one has a bit less hashey essence to it but I don't know I kind of like that stuff that's just me though I like I like certain flavors I like the orange hash to kind of flavor this one's just more orange citrus pure it's got that sharper kind of flavor almost like a really really sour kind of an OG it's got just like that really sharp citrus essence and combined with an orange flavor it's really funky and really unique a lot of people have been liking this one I've been letting try it out talked to Eddie really liked this one a lot I mean it's really unique concentrated you don't really find this kind of flavor very often it's just extremely unique and I have a bit on this poker here again so I can show you guys really nice dried butter needs to see how much less waxy it is and how much more stable you can tell bit more ole orange on it with the light pass through it there it goes very golden you can see slight orange in the center because it does have that very orange hue but it is a very high-quality kind of butter put my hand back stop the light passing it turns very orange I'll kind of let some light pass through you can see how it comes together yeah you like in my camera tricks now hot people yeah eat it up eat it up eat this butter porno so let's toke it up you can see how in that shot it was slightly gritty it has that same kind of gritty texture as the other one it's just a much better purge you guys see what I'm talking about I can you can only really tell when you get in real close on that one the subtle difference is I mean I've had them for a few days which is the reason why I know a little bit more than probably what if this is an initial review but that's what I do and another thing I've never ever used this skillet on the Toro because the Toro sits flat and this thing sits at an angle so you can see it's got a you know it's a little slanted but I've a feeling for this chokes this is not too big if I started up at the pad it should vape it all the way pretty well if not I'll just have to you know yeah but you know the sir sterk still perks all the way if it's as long as it's covered by water it still works pretty well yes even with that pretty good tilt so maybe I'll tilt it a little bit I didn't realize how well it'll burn you know you know me I like to do the flat I think I'm table because it keeps the perks even the best diffusion in my opinion but especially for the reviews I try to make everything as perfect as possible so there's no variables and [ __ ] for people to [ __ ] abut everyone find some [ __ ] to [ __ ] at eventually I tried to use my map torch at full blast when I'm using this skillet to just because it's a really nice skillet no when I heat have any heat cracks and [ __ ] but you know just in case anyone's wondering why I'm using my torch a little weaker than don't know cheers guys this is the papal Express from La Brea [Music] and really really good very good it's got it after smoking in both in a row I can say this one's definitely got slightly more musky kind of an orange essence sharper in smell it's got that really like sour kind of smell but in all honesty when you smoke it the flavor that sourness kind of comes into like a an expansion sting has what I call it's like when your lungs feel so from Annette sour kind of essence is so strong it almost stings your lungs you can feel it's almost like pins and needles inside your lungs that that sour you kind of smell I think is more of that expansion definitely I mean getting really faded off these a lot and I haven't really been doing serious review thinking about serious reviews on yet but now I smoke it I'm it's just very surprising I was like just not expecting this one to taste that way I think just you know looking at him smoking them I've been enjoying them but now that I've been really looking closely at them these ones have been really surprising they've been a little opposite of what they the smell and flavor is kind of been you know and this one's definitely a bit more little musky compared I think that sourness is definitely disappear expansion and this guy has just a really musky kind of orange peel flavor definitely very very good it's just to like ends of the orange peel destruction spectrum you got the lemon amnesia and this one I mean yeah flavor that really doesn't come around too too much it's mostly just all lemons and [ __ ] from although G concentrates and stuff you don't really get too many of these really good citrus sativa flavors too much but when they come in they're really good and I try to pick them up when I can and these ones were suggestions by Nikki baby I believe is his username it's got a lot of letters in it and a number at the end I'm sorry I brother I can't remember it I thought my head I just got real study but all the butters I picked up were on his suggestion so thanks for those suggestions man I'm really really enjoying them and they're really getting stony this one is a little bit more sedated than the other one it's definitely sativa it's definitely Steve Adama it's got a good strong effect and but it's just it's a bit more a little bit more heavy than the than the uplifting ness of the lemon so the lemon is definitely more of a morning starter and I guess when you're chilling out on that for noon or something like that pineapple Express would be a good one to go for so very good concentrates again from La Brea thanks for picking the quality back up guys I will be back to see my gorgeous beauty and your wonderful prices as soon as I can piece of bad guys [Music]", "c4SZOLT_ccc": "yo hey

boy sub eg backhanded with another banger video for the eyes man for today's video guys as you guys can see by that little intro man I got a bunch of goodies right here man and I thought I was just gonna smoke this by myself this weekend but why not make a video for you guys and let you guys know I think it's gonna be a review slash smoke sesh that's just vibing out man so right here guys I got some 710 labs live rosin some bootylicious number one it's tier two I just picked this up as you guys can see right here mint fresh super super super fresh might have already been taking add a bit too out of it but that doesn't matter because we got something else right here guys 710 lives of their 8th right here this is called oh gee KB and man I have heard nothing but good things from like their products man they the fact that 710 labs takes so much pride into the products that they all they do is just put in hard work and the results speak for themselves man they got people talking all over Instagram YouTube Twitter like I'm talking about like everywhere that I go everyone asked me as I have you tried seven ten have you tried seven ten and I've tried their hash rasen but I have not tried their what their Weed Man so I'm very very excited to get into this but for before we get into this man I have to give a big shout-out to today's sponsor man gothic comm where they sell bracelets pendants and rings super sick ass rings man well you can go buy some for your friends girlfriend whatever the case is man and you could use my own personal code savvy G to get a discount percentage of well I'll put everything down in the description below man go show them some support because a support of today's video guys alright honestly we're like I said I was ready to be smoking on both of these guys they both cost me around this one right here was $80 this one right here with $70 so a total of 150 it is a pretty hefty price to paint but you know if you want to smoke it you got to pay the price so we're gonna save this for the second part of the video we're gonna roll up a nice joint with that but first since I do have my rig right here MJ Arsenal and my torch all the goodies right here I think the only thing we can do is take it out all right so I'm already have been dabbing it so I'm bushed shut you guys in there it might be missing some so this right here guys is what I have currently right now and it's honestly some of the turkeys like 710 miles has to be some of the turkeys but I mean wax that I have ever smelled man like the the Terps in this thing is just so amazing and I kid you not man stabbing on Psalm endless like wax is just so freakin good man thinking about doing is heating this up for 30 about 30 to 35 seconds and then waiting about 45 seconds to 50 seconds I feel like that gives it the best the taste and it's not very harsh smoke yet you get very very milky clouds so let's go ahead and torch this thing up boys cheers i heated it up to 35 seconds I'm gonna go ahead and let it go till 45 just because I had you have the window open man and I'm gonna go ahead and meanwhile though let's go ahead and choose a nice little chunky one just to start things off boys because honestly I have I've only dabbed it once today and I feel like man this one's gonna catch me because I'm telling you the hatch frozen is so smooth that you only really feel it when it starts building up in your chest man so we're about during your second day and still got another ten and yeah let me know in the comments below if you've ever tried 7-10 labs man if you have make sure to hit that like button on this video and if you haven't we'll hit that like button anyways cheers boys oh dude that tastes so freakin good I already look at the depths what's already coming in that was the perfect dab I kid you not watch this I love waiting all right the reason I love waiting that much time it's because you just get the smoothest hits the milk is hits and then the Terps now I'm tick I'm talking about I can taste everything in this I can taste everything man it's phenomenal and after you're done your your nail should look like this man you should still see oil in there and man there's seven ten laps definitely definitely worth that's the $80 that I paid man I would I want to buy the Percy that one right there is $100 I believe or $90 so if you guys want to see a video on the percy live rosin let me know in the comments below like this video and subscribe so auntie dad dad got me super high and I just remember that we also have to smoke another joint so I'm probably gonna step aside from the dabbing and we're gonna go ahead and crack this open man this oh gee Kb your see you guys see how fresh it is man I have not opened it brand new look well you can see the seal right there man this is gonna be the first time guys that I have ever seen this flower in person and I'm kind of excited already it's like a little glimpse right there so let me go ahead and pop this sucker out oh dude oh now just follow my computer oh dude it's as beautiful as the oh oh my goodness dude yo I know my camera is not gonna you know pick up every single watch I'm gonna have to use my phone for this guy's but this but right here you guys know the phone camera picks up every single trichome everything that's why we use the phone and look look at this guy's just look at this you guys are gonna be in all all right so this is the og KB right here look at this dude the beautiful orange hairs I'm talking about look at the trichomes look at the purple little stems think you know oh my gosh the curation on this dude is just so phenomenal I haven't even smelt it what does it smell like I have never saw anything like this smells like me but it's just a different type of legal officer dude this is like literally one of the most aya peeling pieces of bud that I have ever seen and now it's just a fact so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna roll this up I don't know how much help I roll it up but dude this thing is just so phenomenal looking I don't even know if I want to break it apart but I just want to just put this in a casing and just put it in a corner of my room do you never touch it so this thing looks so phenomenal I'm gonna like I said I'm a roll up a joint and I'll see you guys in a little bit right here we got the joint right here man it's honestly I rolled there I've been getting so much better at rolling these freaking joints so all we got to do now man is pretty much just burn off the paperboys and basically here you go here you have it your perfect little or joint now I want to say there's like 1.5 in here man but does it really matter though because I just want to know how good this is man I want to know if it's worth the money because this this 8 was more expensive than a cookie so he hasn't gonna be the first one to find out boys choose only through the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal statement choose wood hmm after that personation I did get a little bit of some a little bit of paper tape so [Music] whoo it's actually pretty freakin smooth man so far so far I do i I did roll these in some raw hemp papers organic hemp so there might be another reason why but honestly so far it's burning a really really smooth I am getting a lot of earthiness from this plant itself and it's giving off a little bit of a sweet tone but honestly it tastes very very very good like it's something like I know we did we'd look I know we do sweet guys but you can tell the difference from something that is properly cultivated to some [ __ ] that you know that that is make that is being made in mass amounts and things like that like these guys they take so much pride because it's small batch all the time they never they never overdo the batches man because they want to make sure that every single planet that they grow is growing to a hundred percent perfection on their own terms you know but so far man I haven't I'll any clips of this this it's burning very very smooth like I'm telling you let me give you guys a little close-up of pilots burning right I rolled it really really good it's burning even all the way through you got the little tip right there if you ask them to see that and it's an enjoyable smoke man it's currently 10 o'clock in the morning and usually whenever this is the first time I'm smoking also unusually whenever I smoke first my eye like I started coffee or [ __ ] to him whenever it's the first work of a bit but this is smooth like I was saying and it tastes very piney earthy but it's enjoyable as heck I don't taste any really fruitiness flavors of it no I taste a little bit of sweetness but it's not overpowering this thing is chiefing though it's obviously getting me super super baby I ended up waiting a little bit after taking the dabs and then just I mean I rolled out the joint while I was high a [ __ ] and then I roll I waited a little bit more that way I could get the full effects because I didn't want to go from being a super stone because that was a super fat that that I just took I don't want to go from being super stoned to you know getting even more stunning I even being able to differentiate the type of high that I'm getting in the flavor because my mouth was dry as heck I kid you not that dad got me so tight but I was brick and faded for it for a minute I'm not gonna lie I have not been that faded in such a long time and it's such a good feeling now and then they finished chugging milk for sure all boys that looks like we're at had a lighter fluid on our centers [Music] this thing is McEnroe I hope you guys like the new location I mean I'm just in my garage and I hope you guys not like the current location man I was gonna do it in my car but I was like man for a special day like this my mind let's just do it somewhere where you know you guys can see all the smoke around me not the same setting give you guys some a little something different I just in used to Macanese well I'm about to finish this whole joint to the face but not on camera because that would literally turn my videos so freakin long all right guys so my review for this ogk be it's about its max I'm high right now like super faded and it's such a different height such a soothing high but usually with wheat it's either I don't get high or I get like you know too high to the point where I don't even enjoy the high because my head's hurting but this right here yeah but this one right here is honestly just hitting like every single aspect bro like I'm sure I know I know for a fact after I'm done with this I'm probably I'm probably gonna have a better good morning you know I'm already have me good morning gonna go better and EMA like like I would say though I would definitely would not mind dropping another 150 hundred 60 on some 17 laps again like because there I'm telling you they're rosin smack nice it was just the perfect gap the turf through there the taste is there that I was there everything about it was so good and I feel like usually I don't get that feeling with other concentrates you know with other flower so yeah man I would definitely purchase this again time though I do want to try the Persie rosin you know want to try I'm not even sure what kind of strain this was it was like an indica or sativa guessing it's either hinder guard hybrid so next time I want to try just a straight-up indica and see how much that smacks me because I feel like if this give this is smack at me right now I can only imagine what a straight up in meter with you so yeah guys I'm gonna go ahead and hand out the video here because I'm high as a hack right now I just want to enjoy the rest of this man hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video and you know and if you did go ahead and leave a like comment and most importantly hit your boat with that subscribe button and reach so let's try to get 400 K subs I mean 40 K subs boys that's the next call right and you guys are gonna help me do that guys so I hope you guys have a blessed day and we're out", "AXOPH7HkjBY": "how's it going guys good morning it's Teva got right here and I'm coming to you guys quickly with a new review about the Moxie Dart the reason why I will be reviewing this is because they are a really great system I had a chance to try it out before you know giving you guys a video about it a review and this will be my honest opinion about the Moxie dart so the one I happen to pick up is the Moxie Pineapple Express let me get a better shot at this yeah it's the pineapple express it is testing ah let me see and a little more information at 81 percent THC so I mean 80 point 1 THC that's really awesome and in spite it's you know testing its smacks and CBD 0.2 percent for all my CBD heads out there yeah so you know it comes with that weird packaging that I love is you just press you know and it's like a deck of cards there you go and that would be the Moxie TARDIS you guys could tell this is a very shitty camera with my nose being shitty as hell it's the Moxie dart and you can see it's that bright yellow color okay and I happen to pick up the battery which is the golden one no Maxie guard C cell it's made by C cell and it's also for 180 milliamp hours you know or yeah Milland hours so yeah we'll be getting to it you know it's a nice sleek design you know and the opening guys the opening is the best they know just let me try to hold it for you guys there you go see they're nice packaging and they give you that that really nice packaging that's all I could say okay the battery though the colors guys come on I seen the black one too but I didn't want it I'm more of a you know two color guy get two sides get to taste everything just like indica and sativa but unfortunately right now I just picked up this pot it's a team apart so yeah this easily pops in people behind me so I gotta be careful you know surrounding person behind me it's my block oh the shop that I picked this up from it is the pottery guys the pottery is the best shop in LA taxes are gonna be charged everywhere but it's the best pop cheapest prices hey there you go look in this doesn't blink like any other batteries just put it in and the way you know it's hitting its for years but this definitely giving it something like expansion of just small hey no this is a really good battery I've been trying it can we go pick up more you know flavors but yeah guys the Moxie dark no water comes like in the mess really nice product that Moxie door hit stronger than us dizzy what else did he hit stronger than they hit stronger than a select um what else guys um let me tell you what is a little bit past right now surprisingly it's past delta 9 in their prime 40 that would be that would be a scary part they're just more potent now than delta 9 and anybody who's from l.a knows how potent delta nine ones was when it first came out um oh yeah guys this would be my first video i hope you guys liked it please like subscribe and follow for more you know my instagram i will be linking it down in the description which would be sativa God and I'll be posting you guys up for a next video", "PwwxFh01X-U": "what up YouTube we are gonna be doing that rosin press video today this must set up some what we're looking like when we charge all my product in there what we have right here is about 2 grams of some outdoor pineapple Thai what I've been doing lately because I've been using these right here instead of parchment paper I've been getting a little better return and also [ __ ] hell of a lot easier to to collect it off of these the natural parchment paper so this is just what I've been doing baby I'll get it over it up like this talk about that you can see I'm trying to do all this show one hand cover it up like this and I'll set it on the heat pad for a minute close them like uh that these get a little warm for about 10 seconds but I've been doing then just give it a press let it do its thing for a little bit and get my get my product in return about in I don't get none of that crazy using [ __ ] out of the sides I don't press that much so I'm not gonna give you guys like a little run like that the most I do in this little setup right here this is a half ton it's a thousand pounds a thousand psi is right here so pretty much half ton so long only do about two grams sometimes I'll do four if I'm being lazy I'll throw two sets of pucks like how you just seen in that one I'll throw two sets in there and smash it if I'm being lazy and but other than that I just do about two grams out of time and seem to be getting a fairly good return well I guess the puck felt already nice but that's what we got nice is a fairly good return I just liked it it was immoral over there but that's decently I'll give you guys a scrape and then show you what we're looking like I'll be back what up we're back I'll show you the next step that I do um I'll give one of these ice packs out the freezer and I'll just set this thing on here for about two three minutes let it get cold just cold enough so that that'll oil is nice and hard and then we'll move it to the table and we'll get the screen I'll see you in a couple minutes we're back it's been a few minutes since this thing has been sitting on the ice so uh let's peel it off and see what we get you know just a little bit stuck to that so we'll collect a little bit first and we'll move on to the better yield and get a better better - look at this and then when we're done we'll get a I give you guys actual close-up on the clarity and all that other good [ __ ] stuff that you know matters more but yeah I found this way right here to be the so far that for me the best way easier for some reason this particular strain no matter what temperature I ran it at when I ran it imparts me it was just [ __ ] soul oily that didn't want to collect and we'll just drive me [ __ ] crazy just having to go back and forth back and forth to try to get something that it's just always doing this smearing so I try to figure out easier and better method and figured might as well give these ago he compares on them so I don't know I don't see why you can't smash with him we're gonna do this bigger one now I'm getting nice little collections he will be got going in there get all this little [ __ ] on the outside first just so that I know I don't gotta keep [ __ ] witty I just like to click my [ __ ] so I can get at the dabit I got more in the backroom of this actual strange who that for some reason so I'm [ __ ] reason that [ __ ] turns it turned green when it's in parchment when it some parchment paper that's another thing this oil right here will turn green it wouldn't get this clear wouldn't you nothing it was just straight green so it's another reason why I'm trying to try not new things with my prayers you know I just dyed it so I'm learning regardless so all I gotta say it's a lot better than my first few runs I was [ __ ] up when I was first learning wasting product smashing that to higher temperatures I'm getting it out in it's getting there but uh let me get this all finished raped up and then I'll get back to you guys when it's all collected and I'll show you the finished result all right we're back do you with the final product see if I can get it to come up real quick another reason why I like these I could get this whole little hold it all opinion nothing too big but you can see ladies they're gonna use any filters when I do never ends on time I use filters and when I'm smashing [ __ ] I'm smashing hash only time I use a filter but what we're looking like what I'm dabbing on pineapple tiny outdoor stood that about maybe like an ounce live for this I'm trying to just dab dab slowly what what we're looking like I just wanted to show you guys a little clarity video thanks for watching rate comment subscribe and get your little close-up view

[ Indistinct conversations ] -There we go.\n-I'll be right here. Tonight, we're gonna\ntake you on a journey. So, we want\nto destigmatize cannabis through the universal\nlanguage of food. The whole meal is gonna be\nabout 20 milligrams, so you'll be able\nto pull back or consume. It's all up to you\nhow you wanna, you know, go on this journey. So, here we go, guys. It's a take on a fried oyster. This is about 3 milligrams. It's gonna be a little bit\non the saltier side, but I wanted to play with\nthe flavors of the Insane OG that we infused this with. It's piney.\nIt's mineral-y. I wanted to bring out the salt. Enjoy the first course. Harrington:\nSo, what are some of -- of everyone's funniest\nedible experiences? -Mm.\n-Who got funny ones? I met a girl, and she --\nand she -- and she came to go\non a first date with me. She didn't know that\nI would be on that edible.\nRight. Thought it was a first date, so I'm like, \"I'm broke, baby.\nWe're going to Denny's. We finna to chop it up. At Denny's\nis when the edible hit. I said,\n\"I ate all this weed cake. I need help.\" And she told me\nto drink milk. Right. I don't know why I didn't\nget it from Denny's. I said, \"Let's --\"\n'Cause they serve milk. \"Let's go to my house...\" [ Laughter ] -I mean, yeah.\n-\"...'cause my pop's got milk.\" [ Laughter ] I don't live with my pops. He was in jail. There was no milk! I'm from New York, right?\nAnd it's not legal in New York. So basically, anybody who's\nfucking around with edibles, they're just doing whatever\nthey think is what it is. -They do --\n-At least here -- yeah. At least here, you know,\nyou can dose it properly, and, you know,\nyou can take it in a way that you can measure\nwhat you're taking. Alcohol is so regulated.\nAlcohol is cool. Like, you can wake up\nand drink at 11:00 a.m., and it's called Sunday brunch. You know what I'm sayin'? We're in Prohibition\nright now. -Right.\n-Yeah, this is a Prohibition. Again, the whole alcohol of it\nwas about taxes. Once they could find\na system to -- to tax it and make money off of it,\nthen it was legal. See, but with edibles, for so long,\nit wasn't regulated, and I've seen a lot of -- yeah, I've seen it take\nsome of the best people out. -Yeah.\n-And I just -- so I'd never -- I never fuck with it, ever. I don't have no stories for you.\nI can't lie to you. I'll sit there and laugh at the\npeople and get high with my -- but I'm not gonna do the --\n'cause it -- You got no stories.\nYou have no control\nover that shit. Nina9: I'm not mad.\nI was high for like a week. It -- It felt good. Like, you go to sleep,\nyou wake up --\nWhoop-dee-do! [ Laughter ]\nI was good. [Laughs] \u266a\u266a When we think of\nan edible experience, we're always thinking of that\ntime when we got too high. -Mm-hmm.\n-And then with legalization, that's what it will help\nto prevent because there will be\nregulations on the edibles. Barnes:\nI think that's one thing, too, where, you know,\nmyself and Al are working with UCLA on this\ncannabis research program, and we really feel like -- I think, our goal is to remove\nthe word \"high...\" -Mm-hmm.\n...from it and explain\nthe educational -- educational side\nand the beneficial side of it 'cause I think people who don't know enough about it\nare afr-- \"I don't want to be high.\nNo, I don't want to be high.\" I think that they steer clear\nof the word \"high.\" So I think if you can really, you know, obviously,\neducate them and let them know\nthe beneficial side, especially being an athlete -- and we can speak\nfrom experience. Um, this is what it does\nfor our bodies. It hits everyone different,\nyou know. You may take to something\ndifferent, but there's a part on that --\non that plant that can help everybody.\n-Yeah. Harrington:\nYou know, if we left it to a vote of the -- the nation,\nyou know what I'm saying, I think that cannabis\nwould be legal, right? So, we all know that right now,\nthe issue is the politics. You know, they're trying\nto figure out how to tax it. They're trying to figure out\nhow to include big pharma. A lot of these states, they're always trying\nto create environments for the smaller people\nto fail. The one thing is, like,\nwe do know, like, the -- the community that's most\nnegatively affected by cannabis was the black community. -Yeah.\n-Absolutely. So, now we have this industry\nwhere, obviously, you know, our brothers and sisters\nare still locked up, but there's now\nan opportunity. And these black caucuses\nare in this mind-set of, like, \"No, we don't\nwant cannabis.\" And I'm telling them --\nI'm like, \"Look, we cannot miss\nthis opportunity 'cause there's billions\nof dollars at stake, not -- for -- for our communities.\" It -- I'm very aware\nof the fact, like, I'm on television\ncooking with cannabis while people are in jail\nfor much less. -Yeah, facts.\n-Right? -Yeah.\n-So... But what I think\nthat the show does and other\ncannabis content does is push the narrative forward so it's not this thing that, like,\nhas this bad stigma. I think about this\nevery single time I go into a dispensary. How many of my cousins\nare sitting in jail for the same weed? And the truth is --\nis that the only difference\nbetween them and me is state and time. But this is all politics, so it's -- it's --\nit's more than just the money\nthat's out there. It's also access\nto the healing that's out there. It's also being able to\nparticipate in something that makes you better rather than\nsitting behind bars because you got to it\nfirst. B Real: Like they said for years\nbefore it was legal, this is the number-one\ncash crop, right? So it's about convincing\nconservative and religious voters. -Money talks.\n-Yeah. -Right.\n-Lobbyists. -Lobbyists...\n-Lobbyists. ...because realistically, a senator in the South or a congressman\nor a governor -- he might not want\nto risk his seat. The game plan is,\nhow do we convince them? The conservatives\nsee the money behind it, so that's a easy --\nthat's a easy win right there. -But once --\n-I think it's, uh,\nedu-- education. Yeah, and it's all\nabout education. It's ab-- It's about having\nthose conversations you're talking about. But I think, you know,\nwe're in a time where people are open-minded, and they're hungry\nfor information. \u266a\u266a Lavorato: You get curious. Like, when it starts\nto be more around, you're like, \"Huh.\nOkay, well, maybe I could -- oh, it works\nfor my back pain? Oh, I have arthritis.\nI can take a bath in it. I don't have to get high.\"\n-Yeah. That's what I'm saying. Everybody thinks of weed,\nand they're thinking about... -High.\n-...are they getting high, but there's CBD that has\nnon-psychoactive properties, and it's -- like, I put my mom\non to, like, the CBD cream, and now she's always like,\n\"Oh, my God. My neck hurts.\" Like, \"Can you bring me\nthat thing?\" And it's like, there are\nso many properties to this plant that is so stigmatized,\nand it's like -- There are so many things\nthat you can do. But if you don't want\nto get high -- not everyone takes\nto being high. Like, some people\njust can't deal with it. -Right.\n-You know what I'm saying? But there are so many\nbenefits to the plant, and you can do it\nwithout having to be altered. For me, weed was always\nthat thing that made me not feel like\njumping out of my skin. -Mm.\n-You know? And now I know that\nthat feeling of feeling like you're\njumping out of your skin is what anxiety is. A part of the high is, like,\nbefore you actually smoke, like, breaking the weed up,\nyou know, rolling up.\nIt's a ritual. So if you have anxiety\nand you're doing that, that helps you --\nyour mind relax... -The process.\n...calm down. -Mm-hmm.\n-And then you smoke. I died off of edibles\none night, though.\nI came back, though. [ Laughter ]\nI didn't realize\nyou came back? Yeah, I came back.\nYou came back. -How? Explain. Elaborate.\n-I-I was up, and then I was down. [ Laughter ] It's that simple. Dee Nasty: My God,\nthat smells really good. What's up with\nthe second course? Trinidad:\nIt's called a salad. It's called a salad? Well, I can smell it\nfrom over here. That's for the third course,\nbaby. We got some garlic\nand some ginger slowly browning. Bring that salad over here. [ Speaks Spanish ] Alright. So, you know,\nwe are in California. There's a lot of fresh produce. And the the strains\nthat we're using -- there's not only the Insane OG, but we also got some stuff\nfrom Viola, from Al's company. And this shit is fire. I mean, it's strong as fuck.\nAlright? Because it has coconut oil, it's gonna absorb into your\nsystem a whole lot faster, so this is gonna hit you,\nlike, in 15 minutes. What's the funniest shit somebody sent to y'all\non social media? I have a -- I had a guy who --\nhe was like, \"I want you\nto humiliate me on 'Live' with, like,\nthree of your girlfriends.\" And I just was like,\n\"I don't know, son.\" Like, \"I don't know\nif I could do that.\" He's like, \"Yeah, like,\nI'll wear your panties.\" -Oh, wow.\n-Oh, word? Yeah, he wanted me to --\nYeah. He wanted\nto wear my panties. He wanted them to be\nspecifically pink. I s-- I turned it down. That was the craziest thing\nthat I had gotten in my DMs, you know, other\nthan the occasional\ndick pic and shit. -Who's gonna follow that?\n-Which are the worst. Yeah, I hate 'em, even though I did see one\nthe other day that I was like, \"Oh. Okay.\"\n-You get surprised. Nina9: You see it, and you be\nlike, \"Okay, now delete.\" No, no,\nbut that's very rare. Guapdad 4000:\nYeah. That shit is cool, but imagine being a dude\nwho gotta deal with that who don't want to\n'cause that's --\nI mean, look -- [ Laughter ] My whole thing is\nif you get a dick pic, send them one back. -No!\n-Whoa. [ Laughs ] If you're a girl --\nIf you're a girl, they'll be thrown\noff guard. B Real:\nI get the occasional -- the occasional, you know,\nbig weed stunt -- somebody smoking through,\nlike, a turkey or a, you know, cantaloupe\nor this or that, you know. They plague my shit\nwith that. But you know, I re-post it.\n-Right. Yeah. I like that. Like you found it. Some of it's good,\nyou know. You were basically\none of the first people who started\npromoting weed. When you came out, like, you\nwere one of the first rappers, and everybody thought\nthat if you were smoking weed, you was, like, on heroin\nand crack, as well, you know? So, you were\none of the first to kind of break through\nand open that up.\nRight. So, tell us about\nyour journey into that. We for sure rolled up\nand smoked weed, but we also, you know,\nwere fucking with \"High Times\" and getting information\nfrom \"High Times.\" We were constantly\neducating ourselves about the -- the --\nthe cannabis movement, going under the tutelage\nof -- of, uh, Jack Herer, rest in peace. -Which is a great strain.\n-Great strain. -Right, yes.\n-Dude, great strain. But he's also a great man because he educated a lot of us\nthrough a book called \"The Emperor\nWears No Clothes.\" -Mm-hmm.\n-And we started seeing, like, from the -- you know,\nin the '20s and '30s, the propaganda starts shifting\nagainst cannabis. Throughout our career, we had obstacles and blocks,\nyou know, because we were\nthe cannabis group. That's why people\nlook at weed the way they do, because they're looking at\nall these other drugs that kids are\nreally dying off of... Right.\n...and they're putting\nall of these drugs in one lane. I think\nit's also stereotyped as a minority thing. -Yeah.\n-Absolutely. You know what I mean?\nTo keep it real, you know. I mean, people -- first,\nthey want to get their -- th-their foot in a- a-and get their position\nwith the taxes and everything, but it's -- it's stigma as, uh, you know,\nyou see rappers doing it... -Mm-hmm.\n-...or people who are lazy or, like you said,\nit gets clumped in with the lean\nand the other shit...\nYeah. ...'cause you always\nsee people smoking when they're drinking --\nyou know what I mean? So it -- it all gets\nclumped into one. So, like --\n-Is it legal now in New York? -No.\n-No, not yet. It's legal in Jersey,\nright? They just postponed\nthe vote that was supposed\nto happen last month. And even though like 60%\nof the residents and the governor is, like,\ninto it, like, the Senate was, like,\nalso, like, \"nah.\" Harrington: Throughout\nthe licensing process, there wasn't no diversity. And that's a huge issue\nin the industry...\nMm-hmm. ...because there's not enough\nblack representation -- black, brown, women\nrepresentation in this space. So that's what it was about. They didn't want\nto monop--\nIn Jersey? They didn't want to monopolize\nthis process. They wanted\nto make sure that -- you know, that social equity\nwould be addressed before\nthey went recreational. \u266a\u266a Mal: I think Miguel\nwants to give intro. What are we eating? Uh, this is, uh,\npescado con coco, also known as... It's local rockfish, so it's very similar\nto red snapper. Uh, the coconut sauce\nthat you see under it is infused with the Insane OG and the Viola strain\nthat you guys gave us. A little bit of spice,\nlittle bit of ginger, some brightness, coconut,\nall smoothed out -- 5 milligrams. -12 milligrams.\n-Yeah, 12 milligrams. -What about the drink?\n-Yeah, what's the drinks? -The drink was 4 to 5.\n-Hey! Enjoy, you guys. -Thank you, Miguel.\n-Thank you. Harrington:\nI just feel like the only way\nwe gonna affect change is, like,\nwe gotta create jobs. You got-- You gotta\ncreate financial freedom. Like, without money,\nyou're gonna be miserable. Lavorato: Would there be\nsome way to do that with, like,\na co-op system? So, like, everybody could\nhave a piece of -- like, say you did\na manufacturing --\nA co-op in the projects? Well, I mean, like, if you did,\nlike, a manufacturing facility where all of the workers\nwere invested in the facility, you know what I mean?\nWaters: You gotta back up\nfor a second, though, because what\nyou're talking about is the poverty\nof low expectation. So, if I'm\non the street corner, and I'm slinging or I'm doing\nwhatever I'm doing, at the end of the day, my -- I have chronic headaches. I don't know what's --\nwhat's wrong, but I know that I don't\nfeel well most days. I'm also desensitized to\nthe idea of losing someone. So if I'm being told my life doesn't\nactually matter, a co-op does nothing. Um, until you stop,\nlike, surviving, you\ncan't really live. -Yeah.\n-You know what I mean? Like -- like --\nand that's basically what you were saying\nin a nutshell -- Yes, it's desperation.\nLike, just everybody\ndesperate... Yes.\n...needy,\nyou know what I mean? It's like, dead serious,\na crab in a barrel, everybody just trying\nto get to the top or just trying to live. -Yeah.\n-You know what I mean? And you can't --\nyou can't see a hum-- you know, a humorous side\nwhen you -- when your ribs\nis touching.\nNo. You know what I mean?\nAnd you hungry or you're cold. You ain't got no --\nyou ain't got no heat. We all know what it's like. We -- We think it's\nabout raising the bar,\nand it's not. It's raising the ceiling.\nRight. And it's something that --\nthat you take for granted. And, also, in a lot of ways --\nI grew up in the suburbs. I take it for granted.\nLavorato: Right. In that you never --\nyou weren't in a situation where you had\nto actually, like, fight to just be considered\na human being. And now you're talking\nabout black men in low-income\nsituations...\nRight. ...who aren't even\nallowed to cry... -Right.\n-...or to even talk about what's happening\nto them.\nYeah. And then you want to tell them,\n\"Put your guns down.\" Well, \"put it down, why?\nWhy do I even matter? -So someone else can shoot me?\n-Right. Exactly. So, I think you have to --\nyou have to start a long way before you do a co-op\nor any sort of job opportunity. It's -- It's giving people\nhumanity. \u266a\u266a Trinidad: In front of you,\nyou have an olive-oil cake, which we do\nwith the Butter Baby. Okay, the panna cotta, we put some of\nthe Insane OG in that and some orange zest. Uh, the berry coulis\non the bottom are fresh berries\nthat we picked up on Melrose market\nthis Sunday and just, you know,\ncooked them down and made a nice sauce with it. This right here is about\n6 1/2 milligrams. But this is where\nwe give you the choice. If you feel it's too much,\ndon't eat all of the cake. Take a small bite.\n-Well, how do you do that? -Have some of the panna cotta.\n-Right. You gotta -- That's the dangerous\npart 'cause it's too\ndelicious to pass up. If we're gonna\nwalk on ice, we might as well dance,\nbaby.\nYou might as well. Let's do it. [Laughs] -Damn!\n-Damn! Harrington: You've gotta eat\nthe whole thing. Oh, my God. I'm ready to wrap this up and put it\nin my pocket, man. -This is so good.\n-So, check this out. She had --\nShe had a good question while we were on --\non the break for a second. It's a -- It's a trailer\nout right now for 4/20 for \"How High\" part two. -Oh.\n-Oh, shit. The worst part is, Meth and Red\nare not a part of it. They replaced them\nwith Lil Yachty and, um, D.C. Young Fly. Dee Nasty: I think a lot of\npeople do remakes of movies. I think the -- I think it's okay\nto pass the torch. I think that the best way\nwould be... But not -- not that collab.\nLike, that's a -- See, like, you got\ntwo smokers that are like -- Mal: I think they need\nto incorporate them\nin the movie somehow, whether they're uncles now,\nwhether they're -- It's the equivalent --\nIt's not gonna be the same,\nthough. It's -- It's the equivalent of\nhaving a Cheech and Chong movie with other guys\nplaying Cheech and Chong. Cheech and Chong.\nExactly. You put Wiz in it, you put, like,\nsome other guys that are cooler that really are associated with the cannabis,\nlike, culture, and we gonna go see that.\nBut I think -- I think -- -I think they should've just --\n-I'm not gonna go see that just 'cause I don't think\nthat D.C. Young Fly's gonna captivate my...\nBut they could've did it. But they should've just\nrenamed the -- the movie. They shouldn't have used\nthat \"How High\" title. It should've just been\na different name. Even if they -- if they went\nwith another title, nobody was gonna\nsee that. Yo, get this cake\naway from me. -Yeah, please.\n-It tastes mad good. Yo, seriously.\nHey, Miguel, get this -- come get this cake.\n-Come get these cakes, man. -Hey, don't we get servers?\n-We're tapping out. The servers came and picked up\neverything else quick. They ain't gonna --\nthey gonna leave these\nsitting in front of us. Nah, come get this shit, man.\n-This shit is wild good, B. Mal: Y'all not gonna trick me\nat dessert. Nina9:\nI want to eat the whole --\noh, you ate the whole thing. I'm not even gonna\nhold you all. Like, dead serious,\nafter this, I'm probably just gonna,\nlike, lay down and, like, listen to, like,\nTeddy Pendergrass and vibe out. Like, word up. Like, I gotta have\na whole moment. [ Laughter ] B Real:\nHey, we want to thank everybody\nfor participating. We want to thank Chef Miguel\nfor knocking this out. [ Cheers and applause ] I've been thinking\nabout squirrels for like 30 minutes. You ever seen\na black squirrel?\nWaters: Yes. How you feel when you seen\nthat black squirrel? Represented. Exactly. [ Indistinct conversations ] Way higher than I thought\nI was gonna be.", "mKrqfPOIWSU": "yeah you guys go out there up your pre-roll game if you get it in a cardboard box and it's uh they're dry grab yourself a pack case throw above it in there let it sit for 24 hours your experience will be completely different than smoking a dry pre-roll nobody wants to do that anymore so let's let's change that welcome everybody this is anthony with boveda joined today by cody ziering with pac case how the hell are you buddy i'm good i'm good i'm coming off vacation so i'm still uh still a little bit of vacation mode um which is always a fun little area to be in no doubt uh best part about vacation is on the way their worst part of vacation is coming back to the office and seeing 18 000 emails waiting for you it happens all the time i know yeah so it's just been pitchforking out of that but um things are good yeah there's a lot going on here a lot of things to talk about today absolutely industry's booming boveda is booming pack cases booming let's get to it where do you want to start i mean you want to start with i guess how we kind of ran into each other years ago yeah absolutely this has been a long time coming no doubt um where was that i think mj biz vegas 2017 maybe yeah okay um yeah you guys what launched in 2016. just about yeah we uh we we came up with the idea very very early on like january 2nd 2016 we were still working for a vertically integrated cannabis company right near aspen colorado great experience gave us great insight into the industry and really what the cannabis market kind of demands uh and everything has come from there it was like it was one of my first very first trade shows i think when i walked over and saw you guys um it was a funny story we we bumped into you uh quite literally um saw your shirt and were like oh we know bobito we love that and we just started talking with you brett and i actually got invited brett's my business partner everybody in case uh nobody nobody knew that uh brettgelfan shout out to you buddy um brett and i actually went to that convention for free the cannabis company had purchased tickets for us and we had left before the show happened so we got to go on their dime and you know that's kind of when our world turned around and how did you how did you guys get into the space again um what was your background before pack case funny funny story uh i was working tech i was uh working for apple at the time i was an engineer um doing some annoying stuff on the phones with in between customers and engineering kind of realized that uh corporate life wasn't for me i needed a change and i was helping brett work on some website for some cannabis company uh two weeks later he said hey we need a director of marketing are you interested i jumped on the opportunities like all right we'll pack your stuff and get to colorado next month uh time to start so went out there a little bit of nepotism uh brett's uh brett's dad my dad and the guy that hired us have all been friends for 30 35 years i guess he wanted some smart cheap labor at the time and that's uh kind of how we got our invitation but a few months later unfortunately he got sick and it put brett and i in a position where we were running the show uh in our young 20s which is absurd to put 20 year olds in charge of a 15 million cannabis company but hey you know you got to do what you got to do in business it sure is yeah we have a similar story too um you know i want to hear it how did you get started please yeah no i was i was in tech as well like straight out of college um under the fluorescent lights in a cube sea of cubes and i was like oh yes i'm getting out of school i'm gonna you know work and sell stuff and pay off my loans and you know it's a big fortune 500 company and uh after about a year and a half you know i was going through started out as like uh you know basically a quote guy you know early on learning the sales process and then moved through quickly but i know i wanted to to sell and to really own accounts and quarterback stuff and i talked to my boss and he's like well that's probably eight to ten years away for you and so i'm like oh i can be patient but uh not that patient [Laughter] and uh yeah luckily family friends um one of my family friends lived down the street from my cousin again nepotism here lucky right place right time but um kate holstein who's in charge of our international business she's been uh she actually got me to sidetrack even more she got me my first job um working like as a banquet server at weddings and so i've just i've known her since i was a kid basically and she's like hey i worked this company boveda and um now we make these humidity control packs we're in the cannabis space we're in the tobacco market and we're in the music industry and i heard those three things i said cool i mean yeah i'm in so i interviewed with them long story short um you know as employee number 12 and i think we're over 65 now and that was just four and a half years ago so um really fun fun place to work similar stories here we're basically um very similar in what we do our products and our services are very complementary to the things we're trying to address here to the cannabis industry 100 peanut butter and jelly uh especially for for pre-rolls we make something that's uh great for protecting them and you guys make sure that they stay fresh and tasty for as long as absolutely possible longer than most thought would be possible exactly so anthony i mean we've been talking we've known each other for a long time but really i don't know the the story behind boveda how how did that come about what is it like tell everybody what bovita is yeah so um it's a really simple product and that's that's what uh that's what we like most about it but it's very effective and it works pretty well um it started 25 years ago a couple of guys in the tobacco business they were cigar smokers saw a problem with uh humidification one-way humidification for regulators for cigar humidors um they said there's got to be a better way to do this so they worked um with a couple of engineers from general mills here in minnesota on coming up with a product that's able to basically self-control it's not you you don't have to add anything to it um and it's a two-way controller so in a deficit environment it'll add humidity and then when there's not enough it'll or when there's too much it'll it'll absorb some too so it's it's really getting rid of those peaks and hills and valleys of humidity um and so that that technology started for the like i said for the the cigars and tobacco business and then over time and we i'm sure this has been talked about on many of our other podcasts but um you know we started seeing these tobacco stores uh selling a lot of products in northern california um to the traditional market and um there's like wow there's there's a demand for this on the cannabis space too and that was probably 10 12 years ago now um and so we came up with our our 62 formula and um you know from there the the technology has really stayed the same but we've been finding out more about how this technology can um you know not just protect weight and help you know manage the moisture content or water activity but to also preserve terpenes and trichome integrity so it's been fun to to watch how it's how it's grown and what we've learned um that's that's really fun there's a huge feast of thought culture here feast of learning love of learning um that's that's something that's at our very core um and we have a lab down in um the basement of our hq here where a lot of these tests are being ran we have a lot of partners um different labs across the states and even internationally that help run tests and it's it's really cool uh so yeah that's you know it's a bit of a ramble there but that's uh no it it it sounds super cool i mean we did we've we've been doing r d on our products for four years you know always trying to come up with new stuff but we just have to make a really interesting design and make sure it's structurally integral you guys you have to do some chemical engineering which i can only imagine just ups the level of difficulty by you know to the umpteenth degree so good for you guys it's great that you guys can do everything downstairs and run humidity tests and i know that's a great segue into what we'll we'll talk about next because you can't really run a humidity test without measuring what you're trying to contain the humidity within uh which kind of leads me on to what we do over a pack case and we make these really amazing joint cases this is one of our awesome hemp clients father obsidian but check this out we call this product a jpeg it's our flagship so you'll notice inside this is what's amazing to bovida and everyone who uses it there's a gasket seal that lines the actual case to hold five payrolls um so when you close it you can actually hear the click that's how you know it's sealed and then our favorite part not so boveda is central but we have a extra little place that you can store roaches so you can't finish a joint you don't want to stink up the rest of uh the fresh ones inside the pack that was a really cool idea um so as we were developing this the whole reason we put a gasket in there was to make sure that pre-rolls stayed fresh unfortunately in this industry the pre-roll has been an underutilized product skew for so long such an easy product to produce it's something that from a beginner to an intermediate to a super heady everyone loves smoking joints everyone loves smoking bloods and when we first got in the industry back in 2016 everyone was just taking trim that shitty extra leftover whatever stuffing in a pre-roll and saying okay good enough today now it's totally different story people use only flower premium everything sometimes they're even caviar which means that they may have a core with some hash or are wrapped with some keef and some extra little bits on the outside and can exceed retail values of over 50 bucks in fact last time i was in vegas at the show we went to a dispensary planet 13 and they were selling a can of cigar for a thousand dollars uh so the pre-roll game has totally evolved now think about this anthony what would what would you do if you went out you bought a blood that was a thousand dollars and it was dry i would immediately want to return it right and can you probably not probably not so products like that have to be in something that's airtight and gasket sealed and if you're doing it the right way you have a bill vita pack in there as well yeah no doubt um you you brought up some really interesting stuff cody um do you mind expanding a little bit on how you've seen um you know we're we're more on the you know we certainly work with a lot of companies that manufacture pre-rolls um but also you know people that are just packaging grams or eighths or quarters or ounces or pounds um but it seems you know i mean you guys have a focus on pre-rolls do you want to elaborate on how that's changed throughout like the last four or five years um you know going into this more premium stuff versus just the consumable hey you know the dispensary is running a deal and you get a free pre-roll and it's kind of just like everyone expects oh it's it's probably gonna be dry it's probably not gonna taste very good but i mean how is it where is it changed and where is it changing where is it going yeah absolutely like i had said before when we first got into it no one really cared they just took a pre-roll they were sometimes even making them in the dispensary with leftover whatever after bagging out you know an eighth for a customer there's maybe another gram or two in the jar so the manager said screw it let's grind it up throw it in some pre-rolls and now we can sell it today the pre-roll is a main sku in the industry i think it accounts for maybe 10 15 20 somewhere in there depending on the month of total cannabis sales in the entire country so clearly they're here to stay and it's a product that people love so very quickly back in 2016 and 17 when we were starting pack case we realized that the pre-roll was super underutilized it wasn't really given the appreciation that it should have i mean it's a top level sku it's a real money maker and it doesn't take a lot of money to actually start producing them so we created our product because there wasn't any premium offerings like i said everyone was just throwing [ __ ] in a tube and or a bag and that was it there really wasn't like a uh a big demand for people asking for quality pre-rolls and we didn't understand that because as pre-roll enthusiasts someone who we smoke joints all the time especially when we went skiing or out for hikes or whatever joints are the way to go um no one really had anything that was nice or worth talking about bringing home so instead we just buy flour and roll our own but it left a huge amount of market opportunity for all these cannabis companies who weren't doing something to make a premium sku that addresses a huge market need so there was an incredible amount of demand and no supply whatsoever and that's where pac case came in to fill the gap and give opportunities to companies like this to be able to sell a premium pre-roll so was pac case kind of born on the mountain per se it's funny uh we quickly came up with the idea late at night uh the second night that brett and i had ever met um just because we were talking about going skiing and taking joints before we ever had a prototype uh i had actually uh three or four joints like in my chest pocket um took a little kicker while i was skiing and totally yard sale ate [ __ ] skis went flying worst part though uh i was kind of hurt and the joints were all broken so not only was i like in pain i couldn't smoke so it was it was rough so brett and i very quickly jumped on finding someone to help us out with the design and we quite literally used our prototype our very first one which i have right here super basic shitty design but uh this i used for an entire winter to hold pre-rolls and make sure that they wouldn't break so connor was uh was born out of uh two things a we needed a person we had a personal need we needed to be able to carry joints on the mountain or going for hikes or wherever uh and at the same time we knew that the cannabis market needed it too so it was a little bit of a selfish uh build it was kind of doing it for us and then realized there was a business behind it too that's that's exactly it though i mean that's how great products and ideas are born what's what's uh what's a problem i'm facing in my world today like some broken pre-rolls and then you know there's gonna be thousands of other people that have the same problem so cool stuff i've always loved your guys products um and you guys um you have your your five pack obviously what's what's more of your consumer facing um your duo right do you have you don't have a single though because who's gonna smoke a single joint i mean you're always gonna have one for a buddy so you would think that we uh we do have a we may or may not i cannot confirm or deny that we have a single in the works um but it won't be ready for a while if in fact we're working on something uh really though like one is never enough right like two is always better than one three is better than two and [ __ ] if you can have five will have five um so it's it's what's most amazing and what i find most interesting about our product and why it it works so well on both sides of the aisle um it's a packaging product it was always developed to be a packaging product and whole allow cannabis companies to sell pre-rolls but over the course of a year or two as we were our social media was growing and people were starting to find out about what we were doing people started asking for these just like hey i don't live in a cannabis state how do i get one um so we put them up on amazon and let it ride and uh two years later we've sold you know more than 50 000 units and are absolutely crushing a thousand reviews which blows my mind and we have over four and a half stars which on a product intended for packaging that gets sold as an accessory yeah blows my mind every time 100 and um one thing that i've always loved about your guys product is that um you know you can you can customize it um you know the the business can go put their branding on it and customize it however they want um that's a huge thing especially up in canada and some other markets that um you know they can't necessarily advertise or brand do you have any experience there um helping companies really market their brand with your guys packaging technology i'm glad that you asked that anthony pack case technically is a packaging company right that's the product that we sell but really when you get down to things we consider ourselves a marketing company we give our clients an ability to brand and promote products in ways that they wouldn't be able to before our packaging may be slightly more expensive than everyone else on the market but that's obviously because it's a premium feel what other packaging can go out and say hey i sell for 20 on amazon but instead you can come to my dispensary take five of my best highest quality joints with delicious flour have my brand on it and then now go and walk around with it so we give these companies not just an opportunity to create beautiful packaging that's going to create an amazing customer experience but we also allow their customers to then become a walking advertisement for their company think about it you buy a jpack from somebody that means you have five joints so you take one joint out to smoke with a friend well you're obviously gonna close the pack put it back in your pocket again you still have four left so you're gonna hold on to the packaging for a long time which means anytime you smoke with somebody and you take that out your brand as a company gets exposed to their friend who's now likely to become a customer their self themselves yeah well and let's let's back up to a second so let's talk about um the premium aspect so and what that value can can mean not only to a business but to the consumer so your guys you go i mean let's and we can even back up to that leap down study that we helped you guys do so that by let's explain this to the the people so yeah boba can take uh packaging and put it into a um a dry chamber put above the pack in there and then we can basically estimate the shelf life or stability how long the boba packs can last how long the product is going to stay fresh um versus no active humidity control versus having a boat pack in there and then we can compare that um against the control and give you hey this is going gonna you know add an extra week two weeks a month some cases um let's should we chat about uh how that went and what that kind of means for brands and consumers as far as you know brands are gonna be able to go into more inventory and that's something that we've seen on on the boveda side is um you know a big concern or a big problem facing a lot of these operators was hey we're just trying to get product on the shelf because the supply and demand chart is totally kitty wampus and you know we've had cultivators operators say we're we're trying to like they're torn especially these commercial ones because they want to have a longer cure on their their flower and they wanna couldn't really control that quality um but then they have um people in the supply chain saying hey this dispensary's been out of said strain this amount of flour for x amount of days and like we just we need to get on the shelf it's just flying off the shelf that we have seen as i have seen personally that's kind of slowing down and people are able to go into more inventory and carry more um but our products together can help assure that that shelf life is there and so product isn't sitting for two three months and then it's sold dry that's one of the benefits of being able to use pack case and boveda together um these operators who you know think about it if you have a production team of 10 well you don't necessarily want to have two people doing pre-rolls and two people doing edibles and spread out your labor force a lot of the times it's more efficient and our clients have told us this that you know i want to put my entire production team have them do an entire run start to finish bang it out and then move on to the next project now when you do that with flour with pre-roll with something that's not necessarily super shelf stable like a concentrate or an edible you have to have velocity so not only do you have to package it up quickly you have to get it out the door you have to get it to the dispensary they have to shelve it and then they have to get it out to the consumer now that process can take a lot longer than it would take a cannabis to dehumidify and then dry out lose terpenes lose flavor lose potency and mess with um with effects right like if uh some thc converts into cbd that flower that you smoke once it's converted is gonna make you feel totally different than if it didn't exactly so with boveda and pack case because they're such a tremendous seal these producers have the ability to make an entire run of pre-rolls leave them in their factory if they have to and as long as it's properly sealed and the boveda pack is fresh these pre-rolls are going to last a lot longer which means that their production problems that come along with having to do massive runs and then making it like sit on it as opposed to doing smaller runs and moving them quicker and making a regular process makes life a lot easier for them they can sit down bang out all of their pre-rolls that they need for a month and two days and then not have to worry about the quality at all because of the protection that pacquiao boveda provides yeah and a term that comes to mind that i hear a lot is consistency um and that's that's what a lot these brands want to deliver because they know in a lot of these markets especially on the east coast where i've been working predominantly it's medicine so uh you know it's if you can the cannabis plant in the flower is not a it's not a pill and it's very volatile and so like you said um you start getting that trichome degradation and you're gonna lose medicinal benefits um and it's like you know going to get your prescription and your short your short two pills and there's an extra one magical pill tossed in there you know it's like you you want to make sure that the product is consistent and delivered same same smell same taste same flavor same effect every time and uh yeah i think i think our our two products definitely can help um in that in that regard absolutely cannabis obviously is a product that affects headspace and if you find something that works for you and you find something that you like you want to make sure that if you buy it again it's going to have the same exact effect uh there's only one way to do that in terms of flour and pre-rolls and that's control the humidity making sure that the product stays the same on day one as it is on day 30 and potentially even out to day 60s so it's important i know that a lot of people that consume cannabis for medical reasons um which there are many that's how this whole industry really started right um they need that they need consistency of dose they need consistency of effect and you can only do that by controlling terpene and humidity content right yup yup there's no doubt about that and then um you know let's another thing that i've been seeing um and sorry this is so salesy just because that's the world that i live in every day is just sales but um you know competition between brands um i i like to think of the cannabis industry as a more friendly um competition uh than any than any other industry that i've been in or or seen where it's you know really we're we're all in this together with one common goal and that's to bring uh relief to a lot of people and liberty to a lot of people um to do what they want with their lives consume what they want and um just not step on anyone else's toes but competition on shelf space um is the pack case boveda combo is that something that people can use to set their their brands apart from others is that can you take these these two common value adds and educate the consumer to say hey i'm gonna my pre-rolls are gonna probably be better in here by the time i get them depending on when they were packaged and you know i'm gonna have an extra two three weeks to go through these um with the boveda pack and then you know i have the pack case forever um these are these are things that consumers care about and are gonna want is that messaging from the consumer is that getting driven to these brands that are making these decisions on packaging yet it's a good question some of the brands who really have a premium focus and a premium attention absolutely they understand that their customers keep coming back to them because their products are so good some of the there's a lot of a lot unfortunate but there's a lot of cannabis companies out there that really don't cater to a premium market um and don't really care about the quality of their products um you know like i said a lot of them are still back in the model of 2016. let's take any leftover [ __ ] that we have let's toss it in a pre-roll put it in the doob tube and just send it whatever happens happens i don't know about you but whenever i consume something that affects headspace uh alcohol cannabis whatever else it may be i always want to make sure that i'm getting something that's quality and consistent um price isn't so much uh a concern of mine right i would much rather pay an extra 20 or 30 bucks to know that uh the quality that i'm getting is there versus having to deal with some [ __ ] for a much cheaper cost i believe that if you're gonna intake something it should only be the the best quality you know it's affecting you like you as yourself not a car not a house you and your health so for me as a consumer i always want to make sure i'm getting high quality and i think that there's a lot of companies that value my sentiment and cater towards a client like me when you have a customer that doesn't you end up with shitty product and that creates a negative loop sure you're going to get the sale once or twice because it's a cheap product but i doubt that person's coming back to you there's no consistency there's no flavor it's all dry harsh smoke it's no good no one likes that yeah and that's i think that's changing too i think as more people get introduced to cannabis i mean we talk about all these people taking baby steps i mean i was down in in florida i had a dispensary doing a visit and i i witnessed what i always knew was going on down there but never had witness for myself which was a woman that looked just like my grandma going into a dispensary for the first time and she has all of her paperwork and she looks at the the person at the front desk and she's kind of you know pretty coy and her her husband's behind her um you know they're just kind of looking around and she goes i'm here to um purchase some marijuana it's so cool to see that but there's so many people that need to be become educated on you know multiple different aspects of cannabis um but it's there's so many new people coming into it and uh that's that's a that's a big piece of the education piece and you know knowing what you're consuming how it's gonna make you feel um you know what you like essentially there are a lot of people figuring out what they like and um you know here in minnesota it's tough for me uh because we don't have um you know like we don't have adult use here so i can't just go in and say hey you know i'm wanting this today and that's uh that's something that a lot of new states are having which is is great um and uh sorry i kind of lost my train of thought here it's all good those are those were always my fate when when i was back at the cannabis company those are always my favorite people you know there were times and days where you know as just a higher level employee at the company uh the dispensary was short-handed so i'd have to go in there and maybe put a quick shift in and just talk to cool people about wheat all day it was honestly not a bad way to uh spend a couple hours outside of my normal role my favorite customers were always the older folks who really had never id any idea they'd walk in they'd always be like hey can i like can i buy some weed yeah and it's like you don't have to whisper it's legal welcome to the cannabis store let me show you what what are you what are you interested in what would you like to try are you interested in smoking something would you like to vape something would you like to try an edible it's always great introducing those people to the entire world something that as an enthusiast we've been living for decades right but i don't want to date myself but [ __ ] it's been a long time um yeah it's it's it's remarkable the clearly the direction of the country the world is totally changing our neighbors up to the north were a lot smarter than we were legalized a lot quicker and look what happened now they have five or six companies in cannabis worth over a billion dollars you ever think that there'd be a unicorn in cannabis now there's five it's insane yep ellen what do you think is i mean comparing the canada to the u.s right now um especially these last couple weeks um just these these larger operators and what what is that what does this mean for cannabis in 2021 um as far as these these bigger companies you know that and you know four or five years ago in the grassroots cannabis movement semi grassroots cannabis movement um you know a lot of it was the the buzz around trade shows in the industry was all these you know these big companies are gonna come in and they're gonna start getting swooped up and the commercialization does cannabis in your opinion cody does it kind of model what happened uh recently this last decade with beer craft beer and you know your big domestic beer is there gonna be a commercial side of cannabis and then also room for the craft cultivator um that's really focused on small quality good stuff um that's gonna be competing against you know price and volume from some of these giants that's a great question the beer model is one that is perfect to use as an analogy um i think myself a lot of these major cannabis companies are swooping up a lot of the smaller ones there's a lot of conglomeration that's going on in the industry obviously when you kind of grow as a company or you want to expand you either need additional growth space which requires additional licensing so a lot of the small guys or the guys that were in quickly did some decent growing started as a startup and made it to mid-sized company those are ideal acquisition targets for the big boys so i think what's going to happen at least the next three four years is that all the big boys are going to start to swoop up a lot of the smaller guys that's where you emerge the budweiser the coors light all the the general high volume lower quality lower price type products from that will come the grassroots movement again so i think everything is going to kind of go underground for a little while and all these craft companies in maybe three four years will start to emerge when people really care about quality and it's not so much about bottom dollar anymore yeah we have a huge canadian client that we love working with when we first started with them they had a huge huge initiative and focus on innovation it was 2018 they had an opportunity to really try and control the market with an innovative awesome product uh cost was no object they said [ __ ] it we want the coolest best highest quality product that we can provide and it worked out great for them they quickly jumped into one of the leaders positions in the industry in canada and everything was was great it towards the end of 2019 and then with uh early covid uh early 2020 uh their share price fell dramatically they were you know their balance sheets showed that they were just outlaying cash left and right for the innovation without necessarily realizing that when you spend so much on innovation it takes a long time for it to come back right roi on innovation is a year year and a half process minimum for us for example you know we started designing jpeg trio in 2018 it didn't get launched until you know mid 2019 it took 12 16 months 18 months to get the product out there so with this cannabis company even though they were so amazingly focused on innovation for the first part once legalization happened now they realize that it's all about bottom dollar and how do we reduce cost of goods so now instead of trying to produce flowers that may be tastier but take an extra two weeks now they're producing lower quality genetics that harvest faster that they can just turn around and sell and cheaper packaging and i think that's now the start of where you see the the budweiser and the the coors lights versus like uh you know a small batch brewing company really focused on delivering a delicious tasty product i mean one has consistency one has flavor yup but you know which would you prefer to drink budweiser or the the local craft beer pretty easy decision in my opinion yeah well for me too it's a time and place thing sometimes uh you know being from minnesota and uh going up to the cabin a busch light just kind of brings you back you know i love those you mean can't hate on that i'm a big coors guy i went to school in colorado spent a few years in co i love course especially like any tailgate absolutely but then you know you're trying to drink 16 18 beers potentially and really have yourself an afternoon that's not so much the case when you're drinking something that's a little bit tastier and perhaps next to a steak and maybe you're gonna have one or two very different days though the pairing is everything bingo and the season two i'm a big seasoned guy when it comes to those things absolutely you brought up uh i don't know how much time we have here ramsay um but you brought up uh kovid um how do you think that's been um impacting i guess pros and cons um your guys customers people you've been working with um you know if i can touch briefly i can just say what i've noticed is um i think a lot of these quality things sops standard practices best practices a lot of these procedural things are starting to really get drilled into um on paper and people are starting to like really figure their their [ __ ] out um and that's i think making a little bit extra room for products and services that focus on true value-add and um you know roi that you know we can bovada specifically too can can really tell you hey your flower your inventory your entire inventory weighs this today um and here's the percent moisture content um if you added two percent moisture content to that entire inventory here's the literal change in fair market value of your inventory i think those things now it's not it's not everything's not moving so fast where it's hey package it get it you know it doesn't matter if it cures on the shelf whatever we just we got to get it in stores because we don't have any and people are buying it anyway um i think covid kind of or the lockdown specifically um kind of help people really look at their what they're doing their day-to-day operations and where they can make changes have you guys noticed that too absolutely it gave you know business operators a chance to sit back and not be surrounded by the buzz of a hopping office and they actually had a few moments to think about like hey what can we do better what can we do to improve like our everything our process is top to bottom from growing the production of packaging to sales yeah um what's interesting is that you know this is what makes me happy is that a lot of the country deemed cannabis in a central industry um okay would you ever have been able to imagine that 10 years ago probably not i mean even back in 2014 but government said hey people need cannabis especially in california and all the cannabis companies stayed open so i think having those cannabis restrictions that got imposed on everybody required all these business operators to really sit back and understand how can we do things more efficiently because [ __ ] i used to run my growing operation with 40 people well now i can only have 15 in the building so how are we still going to manage the same output but with less than half of the labor staff forces you to sit back and really think about what you're doing and if you guys are cutting short you know corners trying to take a shortcut when that's not necessarily the best thing to do or neces or even necessary you know small little changes in process like adding a movita pack into your curing box can potentially generate an extra 300 000 a year for a mid-sized cannabis company it's substantial and that tiny little you know how much could that really end up costing you a couple thousand dollars over the course of a year when you can end up you know that can let you back a couple hundred thousand so a lot of these guys with cannabis you just you've been running and like you you ever try and get on a treadmill when it's set at 10 you there's no warm-up time you just have to get down and start sprinting yeah college a couple times yeah i'm not sure if those ended well but that's that's what working in a cannabis company is like the moment that your product goes out the door for the first time it's off to the races you have now an endless uh endless demand for your product and you have to continuously handle that that with good supply um and they don't haven't had a lot of time to think about it as soon as they got on that treadmill it's just off to the races full sprint covent gave them a chance to sit back take a second step off the treadmill and try and figure out what they should actually be doing yeah i completely agree um definitely notice that as well on our end um all right cody uh what's next for paccase great question we have a couple cool new packaging products coming out but that's not really what what tickles me i get very excited about the consumer market i love bringing products to people that will actually use it so we have a really awesome new case that should be launching the next five six months uh think jpac an iphone had a baby that's about all i can touch on it yeah well that's uh that's intriguing um because i think i think i know where that's going um don't wanna don't want to speculate too much but um and where can you pick these up so i know you said amazon um i know you guys have uh point of purchase displays too so i'm assuming that it's this is getting into more mass retail absolutely yeah we uh we sell in a couple different places you can go out and check uh jpac products out on amazon number one uh our shopping website packcase.com i'm sorry packcase.shop you can get there from packcase.com as well um and now they're we're starting to be available in retailers so there's a whole bunch of distributors starting to pick these up so you should start seeing them in retail stores over the next few months and if you're a retailer and interested in picking up our products we have a wonderful wholesale section on paccase.shop so make sure to stop there put in a little vendor request and we'll make sure to get to you so you guys can start selling pack cases yourself cool cool yeah same thing for boveda um we're on amazon we're in the retail stores uh we have a direct site businesses we have a wholesale site too um yeah you guys go out there up your pre-roll game if you get it in a cardboard box and it's uh they're dry grab yourself a pack case throw above it in there let it sit for 24 hours your experience will be completely different than smoking a dry pre-roll nobody wants to do that anymore so let's change that [Music] you", "1Ob3TRrkqc0": "hey guys Cory Manuel here with Orkut essentials today we're gonna talk about the orchid battery and what makes it unique so at first glance will notice that the battery is a lot bigger and heavier than most of products out there on the market the battery is a 5-10 thread meaning it will work on other cartridges although we don't recommend it because the power settings are in our battery are much different than a lot of the products out there and can easily burn other cartridges and you know give a bad experience so we do recommend they use it together with an orchid cartridge as there is a marriage between the battery in the cartridge here the battery also comes with a one-year warranty and is rated at over 250 charge cycles meaning the life the battery should last over 250 charges and on a single charge you should get through at least one sometimes to full one gram cartridges another thing to note here very easy to use micro USB charger on the side simply plug it into any USB port that you have and it will charge the battery you'll know the battery's running low when the light flashes red when you're using it or when you're depressing the button and when you plug it in on the charger you know it's charging by the light shining red and you'll know it's fully charged once the light shines myrin the battery also has three power settings a high medium and low and you just click it three times to change between high medium and low low is yellow light medium or factory default is a purple light and the high setting is a red light [Music]", "BmJZPhk9Y5s": "if you're not a canvas patient or of age please fight off of this video yo guys what's going on ethan here today we are going to be reviewing the dank tank battery so they did send me a couple of them so i have the blue one here unopened i have the black one here unopened and then i did open the red one for myself i already put my battery in and all that but here's pretty much what comes with it it comes with like a little lanyard a charger and then this one gram cartridge unopened obviously so i went ahead and put in my true leaf cartridge so it also does come with a magnet so since this is a half gram it does look kind of weird in here but it's not a big deal if you really want to keep it portable this is super super small so i'm going to go ahead and read off the back of it so i'm going to show you guys this and i'm going to read off the back of the other one so 650 milliamp battery i'm just going to read them the important things 3.2 volts to 4.2 the ceramic atomizer that's the ones that comes with it and then the charger and all the basic stuff nothing nothing too special but the lanyard does go on this piece right here and since this is the red battery came with the red lanyard i'm assuming this one is going to be blue and this one is going to be black but here is the cartridge itself the tree leaf cartridge i forgot the strain exactly but if you guys are looking at this battery i'm gonna have the link down below so you guys can go ahead and check it out it does help me out if you guys go ahead and use that link but let's go ahead and take a hit [Music] so you guys didn't see that this was lighting up but this is going to be the medium setting so it's going to be like purple and i don't know what the other one is let's see blue okay so it's like red purple and then like blue so this is the medium so it should be like 3.6 volts something around there and go ahead and hit it again this way you guys can actually see the color [Music] one second so if you guys are wondering why there was a cut i got a phone call so i was just answering that but yeah this little battery does hit well the good thing is that it's small and that's also a bad thing so it's kind of annoying if you like having a full grip on the battery but you can also palm this battery so you can't even see it if you really want to conceal it but i'm going to go ahead and take another rib i've taken like two or three already i'm gonna go ahead and take another one jeez all right it's like the third rip i'm going to take like one or two more i can see if they can take a blinker i don't know if this battery does but we'll see [Music] i don't know how many seconds i was but that was enough that i could take before i just coughed it all out so it would have been kind of useless of a hit because i wouldn't have been able to inhale it but yeah this is a nice battery i do have these other two maybe i'll give one away on my instagram and give one to my friend but you guys can go ahead and look out for that my instagram is at i'm ethan smokes you guys can go ahead and check that out but this is the battery like i said you guys can't go ahead and look at the link down below and if it's not there look at the comments because youtube is kind of annoying with the links and stuff like that so you guys can check that if not it might be on my instagram or my twitter it's the same handle so you guys can go ahead and check that out i can take one more hit and then end off the video [Music] thank you guys for watching make sure you guys

give you a quick look and the old flower tent here we're gonna switch gears out here and man whoa here she is dog we got about four point nine ounces out of our first run we had a 4x4 flower 10 2000 watt LED and 4 plants left to right we had a photo period here and then our 3 Auto flowers bambam that's King Kong over there let's take a look at Big Mama man this thing is actually quite delicious smells a little bit mango maybe sometimes a little cookies or something not really sure whatever I'd like to keep trying it to figure out all the flavors still check out this one here it's got some really nice red red hairs in there man really not not too bad it's kind of weird drying it like like when I first put it in the jar didn't smell like anything but like after a couple hours you get a whiff and then come back the next time so like you kind of you know open it back up cuz you want to smell it and smells weird and then you're like alright what the [ __ ] so anyway I let them girls go man they're starting to mature a little bit they only been in there for a few days I'm sure after like weeks man they're gonna be delicious just got a bunch of [ __ ] in the back we're gonna make a ton of edibles they're out of that not too bad guys I mean really I'm overall I'm not impressed with the OTO flowers definitely want to do more photo period plants so really like the way that she grew and see if you take a look at those nugs man pretty nice dude not bad for my first time eh so we're gonna also do an update man here on this check out this little girl does she she didn't survive when some type of items all off top shelf blasted that little flower right there I've been trying to mane mainline her it's cool that it broke because I'm actually gonna make clones out of those but check her out man she's doing really good she was actually shorter than these outposts when I first started so it's getting there I'm about ready to do that we're just messing around man like I said we're gonna try some new stuff it's what I want to do on this channel is like spearmint with some training techniques dude let's take a look at this veg tent man yeah I got my setup like kind of dialed in now man this little two by four thousand watt LED carbon filter man got these seeds just there about a month month and a half old they're gonna veg for two months boom there these are my necks running flour guys so as you can see I'm trying to stay on top of [ __ ] trying to always stay ahead of my next grow I could see it's gonna be a kind of a continuous thing let's talk about a little bit what we got growing in here these tall ones right here are night terror og from rare daintiness seed company I keep talking about them I hope they're pretty fire man when you read all the descriptions and all the seeds and like trying to figure out all the [ __ ] you want to grow and like dude that one was like the one I was like yes I just love the way that frickin sound so anyway I got about four of those babies in there we've got a couple cookie dough some Girl Scout cookie stuff we'll be growing there's a bubble gum in there and OG Kush and a was at Barney's farm pineapple chunk dude so that one's growing pretty good I think it's that gets that one right there with the stake in her so if you could see she's a little finicky she likes her water man some of these plants dude can just pretty putt around with water you know whenever you can you know every other day someone man you just touch them right or move a mirror fan they like they freak out they want water and they [ __ ] it's kind of crazy man it's like you got temperamental kids man there's temperamental plants they're sorry for that time or keep getting in there guys so anyway see I got a little clone down in there that's a Northern Lights I'll show you her in a minute really started getting my clone game stepped up let me show you this other part of my garden here dude doing a lot better got the heat Matt got a light on it for sure dude got some clones in there told you I was popping seeds I don't for you guys but I popped that one seed that you can see right here in this Cup thuggin last night it's less than 24 hours it's almost an inch tall I [ __ ] you not up I'll show it whatever man we'll get to that one in a little bit but let's get to this flower tent dude whoo all right we made some improvements we did the poles we've done fabric bags we've done all kinds of [ __ ] man we are just really trying to maximize this annex 1000 here Oh sounds in here cleaning this girl off dude this thing is kind of special man I think we're gonna have little better buds on this one it's the jack herer and she is probably two weeks now here as you can see man she's just growing some big big knobs man I put her in a week early than the rest of the girls because it's a sativa but um dude I these nugs are something else man I mean I don't even know how to describe that like definitely like sides of your thumb man I'm a dirty thumb there your gardener man your nails are always dirty you're always fricking washing your hands whatever bro that's what we do here on this channel man we'll get our hands dirty guys so anyway this place stuff's holding up pretty well as you could see dude check out this Northern Lights man I've topped it a million times dude I actually broke a big-ass branch off but it was in a spot that helped me it was like right there fighting for spot so I was able to open up all this [ __ ] and now I'll be able to uh maybe super crops and clones so clones are things that I want to get going right now man so hopefully I and get a few more clones of that going dude I've been that good mama smoke is delicious you can see I got four clones of her in the back so we got six here still total been trying to open those up they're stretching right now they've only been in here a week week and a half so they got another week and I have to go so they get done with their stretching starting to see some pistols here on some of this stuff guys we're getting really excited I kind of remember just kind of the excitement I had you know when your flowers are first starting to come out and you're putting them in there and now I'm past my first harvest and what every man it's been super cool I'm getting rewarded with this thing dude this we're gonna have to watch this one girl [ __ ] definitely guys so anyway I also wanted to say man I had to pick up another light so now I got 3,200 watts in this closet that's the whatever 2000 watt and then I got the 1200 watt version of the same one man this light here isn't big enough for a 4x4 it's just shy I want to say it's 3.5 by 3.5 and that's pushing it I would say maybe a 3x3 but it's a good light but it just doesn't have that square footage do when you're growing in those tents it's coming down the square footage guys you got to have the right stuff and your lights got to be able to cast at that optimal power level or looks or whatever you go by I mean there's two or three different ratings so I basically just choose one and go with it you can see real quick I haven't done any defoliation we just let them go for three weeks guys and we keep them opening up and open them up I've been watching your other guys videos dude this is how everybody's doing it keep open a month three weeks hit then we're gonna do a big major family defoliation and we're gonna spread them out we're gonna readjust the poles we're gonna get we're gonna make sure there all the nutrient stuffs you know everything's going good dude this is no organic soil man all I've done is add water you could see it it has a few discolored leaves every once in a while dude but so far so good man these ladies look healthy they're straight-up organic so let me know what you think guys man we're just a lot in this video but it is definitely something I was excited to show you guys what we were able to do here and dude thanks for the comments man you guys are like definitely as you're posting and people are leaving comments it's like actually stuff you could do you know what I mean you watch video you read it you come back you try stuff so I really appreciate it keep dropping those dude I'll keep watching your guys videos and let me know what you think this is Richie Rich later", "a_Y8loBehR4": "[Music] [Music] guys welcome the CCC I'm Shane I'm Danny and we are back for another concentrate review today we are checking out some rosin from 7-10 lives 710 labs they reformed their Colorado company and now they came out to California here we go got a shovel a because it's hard to get on the Denver yeah we actually took the close-ups for this stuff yesterday when we left it in the fridge it was a little cakey but still have a little bit still have a little bit of you know greasiness to it gooeyness left it out overnight after you know basically destroying it [Music] Turkey I'm not usually a huge rosin pin mm-hmm I was just gonna say is it flavorful for rosin or is it flavorful for just an extract in general honestly it's flavorful just for extract in general I guess we should talk about what it is we're smoking we are smoking on some z-cube today now Z cubed is apparently a I guess there's a little bit of a debate on it it's either a three-way crowd like basically skittles back crosses itself a couple times or it's skittles across with OG then cross the skills again either way some skittles taste the rainbow type [ __ ] it is very flavorful and ethylene packs a little bit of a punch it's a little sativa T definitely made me feel a little more like alert who's this barking this is by a dying breed seeds yeah originally third-gen fam [ __ ] i mean i think they probably won 40 50 cups buy this [ __ ] at this one how much every cup this is placed at some point or another multiple times the thing about the skittles is it doesn't look that good when you look at the flowers of it it has about zero bag PB on it does not look good in flower form but goddamn does it taste good I mean I can still taste it on my palate it definitely gave me that opening vibe you know what I'm saying one of those strings that has a super-high terpene content and a relatively low THC content right everybody gets so hung up on the THC numbers and they forget that like without the terpenes and the cannabinoids the THC does out basically nothing for it it all acts together people it all packed together so you know as a result this is one of those strings in my opinion now we're talking about the skittles this is our first time smoking thank you but just the regular old skittles not really my favorite strange smoke if you're talking about flour no not at all but it does make some good concentrates it is a very short flowering plant which on the production side is great you know seven weeks right seven weeks our times so and that's that's amazing I mean eight weeks she's fully done yeah right right so I would love to throw that in my garden strictly for concentrates because you know the flowers trash yeah it is one of those streams though that you know can kind of surprise you as far as when you look at you like oh this right this you look sweet this is some [ __ ] meds but when you smoke it it's one of those sleepers that kind of does pack more of a pleasant you would think right right especially you know it's not the strongest when you talk about dabs but it's right up there with some of the most flavorful [ __ ] the lemon geez a lot of those like orange lemon Terps that just like come through really well on oil for some reason this kind of falls in that same class of church yeah I mean honestly the flour it smokes really good and like a joint or a backward - like I'm not gonna lie but it just doesn't look good you know I'm saying but that concentrates great alright I'm gonna go in and see what to do with the taste you see were to do it with the taste it is hard to get on the batter though that's the one downfall got it the one downfall hard to get on the diver that's the most rosin though we forgot to keep it in the fridge and then you know boom it just waxed out you know I've got the little pocket on it's not a pocket purge because it's not a little but they you know it kicked up in the pocket and that was that now you gotta use shovel to break cover on this stuff I'm gonna discover super blonde yeah how's it taste [ __ ] yeah that was a dabba doo honestly though on the flavor I wasn't very scary to me really no here's the thing about rosin for me especially bubble hash for us and I'm like 95% sure this is Posche rosin is a lot of the stuff you see that looks like this now right yes you know it always kind of just tastes like bubble hash and I don't mean that in a bad way you guys know obviously we used to do it's one of the full-mouth Friday videos like we will have good water to Michael but I like good bubble hash more than I like good rosin that tastes like bubble hash you can bubble there's only those few strings that are really good for you know making bubble hash like sours and all the really greasy strains like that that really make like a bubble hash that actually tastes as true as possible to the natural product one good thing there's GDP in it no there's great babe I got you guys so I wish there was GDP a really original skittles right is wasn't like a grapefruit and a great finish great free really it's a grapefruit and a great page supposedly River and great buddy it should have an eagle everybody knows great babe it's got some peanuts the effect of the shooters pigment it's definitely more of like a head for head as far as the body feeling goes yeah it's pretty much immediate too we had already taken a few dabs or some oil today and feeling it a little bit but this stuff I do Efes is hitting me harder this stuff grab me hot I'm not gonna lie like I think you can tell the baby packaging I'm just gonna say what you think about this packaging this packaging pretty sweet it's pretty slick I do like it I'm not gonna hate on looks like it's got all the regulatory standards on there open up the top here and these flaps right here have a couple little sayings on it this one says oh jeez make better oh gee that's cool I like that and then this one says preserve your Terps keep refrigerated yeah that's one over here to quality drives every decision we make from the garden to the lab to the jar that holds your cash happy beautiful that's beautiful beautiful words from 7-10 labs I'm diggin it packaging 907 as far as overall concentrator I think we shall give this ready yeah I mean this is really good Rosen its fire like I said I just haven't we're not about the rosin yet that gets me to fully commit right you know we're not rousing people we're just gonna wear em I'd rather say that rosin is not the first thing I picked out of the lineup to smoke to some of y'all that might be the first thing you picked out and that's fine by me I'll pick some here BHS it's almost like it's sort of like you know if you looked at it on a spectrum it's like that spot right in between bubble hush you know full mouth and boy right you know right it's just he has never really been a friend to the extracting process when it goes like keeping your terpenes intact and everything and yeah I think the best rosin that I've smoked are at least the turbo is another smoke doesn't in Flour mm-hmm every time I smoked some rosin that's made from bubble like this it kind of just always tastes like a slightly different version of just right so back to the rating I think what your regular right yeah that's great okay overall concentrate rating I think I'm gonna probably have to give the effect on this like a fart like a heat you know I'm not too loaded up but I definitely did get a head change as far as smell targeted in a Tazewell and looks looks our popular tonight because it's really really really Blanc got great looks so I'm gonna go eat 58.5 for Rossum I'm gonna go higher on the effect right now the effect of this is like a nine or ten for me well like from one day yeah I'm taking one dab of that the heck change is really nice cool so I'm gonna go with the night on that smell it was pretty good I'll probably go with a seven their appearance I'm gonna give them a plus one for the packaging so I'm gonna go probably eight so somewhere flavor that's why where I go lower probably six and a half seven something like that yeah so overall I'd say probably a seven or an eight whatever that method is some probably seven or eight eight five I'm being generous today I like it it's a great concentrate 7/10 labs skittles cubed thanks for watching I'm Danny I'm Shane these [Music] you", "4CV3GBFtda8": "all right so here we are in the 3x3 shorty looking at everything from afar it's a little overgrown we got 12 plants in here definitely a little overgrown each plant has about three of these branches maybe four or five as you can see just gonna pull this one climb up looks like that if you were to tie it all down it'll cover it'll cover a healthy a healthy amount of space and all the nugs it on the branch would be exposed which is of course the ideal plan here of course moving from there we've got everything going along perfectly everything has got a nice healthy green going across there is no issues just a little bit under watering as we had brought it down to about 1.5 nutrients 1.5 milliliters it started to get a little yellow so if we're just bringing that back up and that's about it for her I'm just gonna feed her one more time today and that'll be about it we've got a lot of humidity damage not only game it's just immunities on the wall we're gonna dry that out that's just from the all the airflow being drawn now that both flowering tens of going so I've popped this vent over it's just going right through so any air in this tent is just being drawn into that air it's just cycling through this is mostly just to collect any of humidity down here in the bottom now since there there has been zero defoliation there's been a purpose for that as these plants are have no intention of being actually flowered in this tent here we're gonna take them out and bring them into the 4x4 essentially tomorrow we're just gonna flower everything out quite nicely and go from there and that'll be about it we're just gonna have all these girls stay in here for about two or three more days and then following that we'll be able to tie her out completely down and see if we can get a good exposure to the bottom part of the plants this time around for its growth and final six weeks roughly six weeks yeah maybe six or seven in the 4x4 going from there topping that off at nine weeks total so going from there it should be okay we're not really experiencing too many problems with this part it is what it is we're just growing and that's about it I will do a small bit of clean-up on the bottom in regards to any of the growth down there I mean regards to this stuff like this stuff right here is to be a clone that's a nice clone you know what I mean we'll just grab a few those across the board and make sure we have enough for the next season and go from there moving forward everything should be okay the uploads thank you guys so much for tuning in and I really appreciate you guys sticking around it's been a blast growing these plants and being able to share that with you so I I'm very grateful and appreciate it that you guys are even able to see them so thank you guys so much for watching that's about it for the 3x3 gorilla grow tent we're not really doing anything too crazy here we're just going along with the flow it's currently at 600 watts I'm gonna have to lower this branch this is kind of why we also need to move her out of the 3x3 because there is no real tie downs everything is kind of just shot itself right up so we're just going to again actually get that done so yeah thank you guys so much for watching peace", "BlvyA6tMP8c": "this video is for adults 18 plus only this is not by any means a promotion or persuasive video that I created to recommend smoking medical marijuana it is for informational and medical purposes only I'm Connor and thanks for coming to Bab with me it was a pretty exciting day you know I received my medical marijuana card and I had decided to go to a dispensary and check it out and it was a pretty fun experience and the product turned out to be very great and I'm feeling very medicated so if you want to see the process and just come along with me about with me all right so we're in the car on our way to that I hope this isn't frozen - oh my gosh why would I leave it in the corner alright so we're gonna get ready to head to the dispensary and I would take you along with me for maybe some car karaoke idea in Pittsburgh I'll be right back so I'm at the healing center that's actually the dispensary that I'm gonna try out today this is my first time ever going into a dispensary I literally just got my car with the noise however was waiting for it in the mail and now I'm kind of ready I'm very excited I'm not getting some strains today I'm definitely gonna check it out because I'm super excited I don't think I can record in there so I'm not gonna promise any footage from inside but I definitely will update you with what I did purchase today when I get out right guys I'm finally out of the dispensary it was too quiet and we're in there so I couldn't really record but I will show you the packaging this is how they packaged it up for me I'm not gonna open it here I feel like this might be to wear and they're really serious it seems like about you know still packages with marijuana in them so how open it up when I get home [Music] there's my watching Elvis so awkward yeah hey guys so we're back ready okay so in streaming a couple stops everything I'm finally here and ready to embark so quick this flame right on there which is is on that bag it's something dusty think it's like either hear that alright just let my want lit I love it alright so basically I want to just put that out put this out there um for this video today but I'm not gonna like smoke on here on one I'm not really ready for that I'm new to the channel and everything and really I just got this car and I'm not too comfortable just smoking on camera and personal laughs I will do is show you all what it looks like and I'm actually gonna talk about you know the process to get in the car and how it was for me and like certain things that people kind of wonder and what I was kind of wondering from the time I applied got certified was waiting for Mac hordes coming to mail so we'll check it out they packages up pretty nice the con was playing with on my way home but I didn't officially open it so now I'm gonna do that now so my brains reason with all the excitement [Applause] though I got two strains to bread and a sativa cuz I kind of want to try it out they look like this they come in this nice little silver package they're not playing about suing it like it's crazy sabotage oh gee that's this dream one gram through and this one that I have is grapefruit Durbin no I don't even like grapefruit this one's the sativa this is the hybrid I wanted something that was uplifting I don't want something that's gonna put me to sleep I don't want something that's gonna you know make me hungry and like just put me to sleep let's make me be like why am i cleaning this [ __ ] floor at two o'clock in the morning you know something like that's me uh the first time I open up the grapefruit do this I'm like so excited that I I just can't do anything right now basically this is for medical purpose and use and purposes only and informational purposes only this is not super silly any kids or anybody to purchase or smoke marijuana leave see it's this focus I have bad luck with it this smells amazing I can smell the grapefruit in it like that's crazy um I didn't realize so I actually deleted my last my second video and I have put it back up the reason why I deleted it was I actually think I was pretty certain but I deleted it because basically I felt like it was you know low-quality and kind of ratchet and I just didn't like it and you know it but 50% might be the case with that video but I'm starting from the bottom and I want to see my growth later on down the road if this channel does rocket like I planned for it to I want to see the growth I want to see where I started so I say you know I'm gonna upload that [ __ ] back up because I'm Oakley now I've started this program with everything and I want every way that I want to and that's the point of growth so upload it back up but I do apologize when I edit it the second time around I the sound is like off or at certain points so the sounds like not working and I didn't plan for that to be for that to happen so I do apologize for that if you have another video coming soon that's when we based around sound to make out for alright so this is the sabotage og it's more calmly and we tell you the real camera so this were like focus but it's cool um the process for me was like this I basically was at my doctor's office you know just getting my little checkup beginning of the year checkup and he was asking me like kinda stressful like family things that happen recently and you know just little things I was kind of stressed and I do suffer from like anxiety and depression a little bit last year I actually had went to treatment for a problem addiction that I have I'm not gonna talk about it yet I'll talk about it later on on this channel but not today description like medication for depression and anxiety but after about you know you might talk about six months I was kinda like I don't wanna keep taking these I kinda wanna be able to deal with the problems on my own or in another way more healthy way that's not like medicine he basically got when he asked like okay well you know anything I can help you with to help with that I was just saying I just stand basically oh man give me a medical marijuana card then little refers you to that like he informed me about going on the website to apply because basically what you have to do is you have to apply first and what you do is I have fear in PA you'll go to the there's a PA health department actually going to pull it up on my computer so I can show you all like actually Google P Medical Corps it will come up your medical marijuana card so it's little for you can't really see but yeah if there if you look at it I think that's it it says like how to get your medical marijuana card then there's like other way so you gotta click that and then you have to like apply all that then after you apply what you do is you have to next step is to find a certified physician and actually on this website they have a list of physicians in like your area or around wherever you're living at that looks like that can certify because not every doctor can certify you for medical marijuana so you have to find a certified doctor and for me it was scheduled like within Nick's like three days after we had talked about it so it was like I was moving pretty fast so then eventually I get some my certification and it was pretty simple you know he sat me down and he's just like asking me basically like why I would like what I was going through this one how it basically Wow why I want a medical marijuana card like way it could be how it could benefit me and if I understood it like you know certain things about like you just basically just informed me about the use the process and everything well I'm not gonna smoke on here but I'm gonna roll that while I talk about this I really wanted a more healthy safe method advice to anybody who's thinking about this apply on the website before your certification because that way it could be like how I was after I got certified he literally went to the computer and he sent it through he didn't have to wait for me to like apply because then that makes the process way longer if you're already a plan online when you go to get your certification all I gotta do is go into computer pull you right up and blue and then that way you're set after that you basically will get an email that email will say that you have to pay for your car the car here in PA is $50 there are some qualifying programs that if you're in you'll be eligible for your discount which I've had it like writing I'm sorry so if you are it's $50 if you aren't a part of any of these programs pace net chip snap and WIC programs you can actually get the car for a discounted price and I believe it's $25 don't quote me but I think it gets reduced like AFR for the $50 price so can't really beat that but I think when you do have to put that in they actually got to freeze your account and then wait to approve that you are a part of that program and then you go from there but yeah soon as you pay once you you pay that's when everything's kind of moving you know know when you're certified it's like a basically you have to wait until your doctor puts in the certification once they put in the certification you'll get the email you go on the website you pay once you pay it's really just waiting for the car for me they took the picture that I took home that took from my new ID when new drivers like they use this picture and I'm gonna actually pull the card so you can come so stupid right here in the wall I'm the type of person where I'm so used to hiding things and putting the word doesn't belong that when I actually do put it where it belongs I feel like I lost it because I don't even look there but this is my core is medical marijuana and all that I paid the money literally after my certification tonight because I like I said I was already applied onto the website so once you put in certification I got that email to pay I paid and that was on Tuesday it is now Bradley Friday morning so it's in about four days and the funny part is I was actually researching and watching videos because this is what you want to do if you actually apply I don't know if it's just me but I think a lot of people do this you start researching them like the process and everything out of that that excitement and everything gets tuned you're like I want to figure out then you want to know what times when your car's going to come man took four days it varies for other people and really honestly what I think it is is it depends on when they pay depending on when you pay it depends on how long you get your car so people will say like two weeks and stuff but the question is did you pay right when you got that email after you were certified that you could pay or did you wait a couple weeks and then pay and now that's why I talk that way those two weeks so as soon as you get that email pay and it'll be on its way so you have a great high day because basically if that was the process for me so apply get certified pay for the car get the car go get treated is about all I have for this video today guys you know what my process was like anyway I can help because I know people like to research videos and got to figure out the things while they're going through the process so that was my process and the agents and I know people aren't a fan fan of marijuana and there's a lot of stigma with it the drug and everything but to each its own you need to judge and this is a non-judgmental trial so if you're against me one everything the doors right there that's it for today's video you guys thanks for coming to vaping me again don't forget to Like subscribe and comment if you like on this video

actually just recorded this video and I'm going to go edit it realize the microphone wasn't working correctly for whatever reason hands aren't on I was super annoying it's not the rerecord this video so if n any parts in this video it seems like I'm kind of like rushing through ports because I kinda already know my like my final review you know what I mean so I apologize about that it's just really annoying having to record a video I just recorded you know what I mean so this is some pretty far [ __ ] wax in that video that I just said I'd recorded and there was no audio on it I took some pretty fat dabs in there so I might throw those clips in that in this video somewhere but there's gonna be no audio in it so I'll probably just put music or something over it so you'll see those fat I mean they weren't fat fat but there was some pretty decent sized abs you know what I mean so I've been wanted to do these like concentrate reviews like watch reviewer videos like challenges or dad's you know it means fat dad challenges or I don't know videos like that you know the mean stuff want to see some more videos like that just tell me down below in the comments I don't know why this is on my finger oh I'll show you that in a second but this is um item 9 lab so if you guys see my review on the Apollo 710 this is by the same company this is just actual on the Apollo 710 is like their pod system anatomy like the pods this is like their actual concentrate so much are you guys are actual concentrates now I believe this is just like an Arizona that local Arizona brand baked like it a brand based in Arizona but um I'm not sure if they branched out to other states through not yet but if they have let me know down below in the comments and if you tried them before let me know down below in the comments what you think of them I think they're [ __ ] far definitely one of my favorite brands out here in Arizona especially with the deals they have constantly [ __ ] fire well I picked up is some rubber glue number four and it's actually some THC a so THC a and if you guys know anything about THC a um when you get up to like the high potencies like tested at 90 99.1 percent THC I'll say the [ __ ] looks like [ __ ] almost straight crystal meth like it's crazy I can find the picture I'll poke a picture of it right here but this is only tested by 85 so it has like a slider golden tint to it but it's still like crystals you know what I mean so it's [ __ ] fires so yeah again it's called Gorilla Glue number four that's the strain and then it's a THC a diamonds so here's the front of it I had a nice lab well this is a little sticker this isn't this was it on the front of it I forget what the [ __ ] what was it but now I put it on the front so you see it's tested to 85% okay with number four and this is something that I really like that they just started doing recently so it tells you the terpenes that use so if you know anything about that and your interest there you go and it also gives you like a brief description of how you're gonna feel so this is us listen Teva obviously so you're gonna feel relaxed happy in your with your fork I'm the bad just has the Arizona Department of Health warning all that good you know what I mean I don't know I think he's focused don't know yeah there you go and I hopefully you guys can see that but not it says I'm one gram THC a diamonds real agreed number four so yeah item nine loves and then I don't know the packaging pretty simple self-explanatory you know what I'm saying so that's the packaging so you open it up and again like I said I already opened it up so it's already been to open but I kind of repackage that the best of my abilities so I'm the packaging is pretty sick you open it up and only me and then you're greeted with this you take this out the top is gonna depend like the color is gonna depend if you about a sativa indica or a hybrid and that guys are gonna be like a purple top hybrids are gonna be a green top of them correct and then sativa is obviously looking orange so take this out of the package in I'll give you guys a quick look at the wax real quick and also got some close-up shots I'll show you guys but here's the wires real quick I can even see it's like diamonds you know I mean straight diamonds alright so yeah there's those close-up shots [Music] so hopefully you guys enjoyed those let's just hop into this now I'm gonna do I'm gonna give this like a um there's five ways I'm going to rate this I'm gonna go over the packaging which I already did the looks and the quality of the concentrates with five you showed you guys the taste the high and then the price point so the second to five factors I'm going to rate and then from those five factors I'm gonna give it like overall rate in the Ottoman so I already won over the packaging a little bit and this that except it so I'll get that a four out of five is it was pretty it's packed it's pretty [ __ ] dope I mean like it's pretty sick but there's definitely like companies up there's definitely companies out there that like having a lot better or like cooler more funner I guess how does it like you know what I mean like more unique packaging you know I mean so it's not like the fancy is the coolest packaging I've seen but it's still really [ __ ] to open like professional I guess I mean it gets the job done there I mean the looks in the corporate the quality of their wife's four point five out of five this [ __ ] is [ __ ] fired like I said like I say in almost all my reviewing videos even though this is my review video I'm always interested I think I want to know what you guys think of it so leave a comment down below what you guys think of it um even though you guys like don't get this smokey I mean maybe you have tried it in the past so if you have coming what you thought of it but if you guys have any you guys are just watching the video just off the lokes or with whatever just tell me what you guys think of it what I mean but what will happen now so I'll give you guys a taste test like I said I wanted with a high test and then the price prior so what I'm gonna be that bad at this little just generic fun the recycler rigged nothing too crazy you know I mean just basic but it gets the job done you got a man like shirt rips low key so since we're doing that taste test first I'm gonna get like that like the size that I was not gonna be crazy um and if you guys never had THCA it's like really hard like kind of get on a Davidge so what I'm doing is plus my carb cat bro I'm a [ __ ] 80 and I dropped it somehow so I just been using this as a carb cap like an empty little wax container but I just put a little bit of the thta in here and then I'm just gonna like dump it in there and then use this as the carb cap you know anything this is a little dab I got right here it's not the biggest of but like I said this is the taste edge so kind of smoking along to you guys smoking something dang and [Music] let's just [ __ ] off into this alright so like I said if you guys are smoking alone Cheers [Music] [Music] [Music] yes I said this in the previous video like the one um that had a lot the audio messed up in you and I mean doesn't really have like much flavor to it but again th th da is like it's like super [ __ ] peer it's like in the 90% you know I mean so theoretically well you shouldn't have too much flavor and crap you know what I mean but it's definitely taste like [ __ ] like like I mean it has a flavor to it like doesn't really taste like they like the growler glue strings that kind of love referring to on it so um definitely taste like wax your this lit though so long like that's pretty much like you just get a strong like wax this Latisse you don't really take I mean like you get like a hint at the Gorilla Glue but baby you can just tell us there but definitely fire and it definitely rips as you see so but I think I gave the the taste like at three and a half or I don't know this because this is where it's really hard that's kind of the panel where you want to go with it because it doesn't taste the best like I said it doesn't have a lot of flavor that's because it's really good [ __ ] the wax and peer so I mean I could give it like a [ __ ] 5 or like a four point something out of five because it's like so like it's pure and it doesn't really taste like much like it's just pure you know what I mean or I could give it like a little bit of a lower rating because it doesn't taste like that 35 degrees you know I mean a lot of people like with wax so it's really like a personal preference I guess but I guess I'll just go in the middle I'll give you like a four out of five in the taste but no it's definitely [ __ ] fire so well don't get me wrong on that that's just kinda a personal preference you know I mean it's s kinda hard to give a rating the high so yeah I'm gonna take a fat dad real quick and then I'll show you guys a couple of those um dads that attack in the last video there's gonna be no audio so I'm just gonna put music over them or something and then um just cuz I don't want those clips go to waste song and do something with those so then after I show you those clips I'll give you guys my heart I'll give you guys the high rating and then I'll go over the price point and then I guess we'll just wrap this video up so let me get a little jab going here oh and real quick I picked up these to fire your cards right here by Delta eight I believe that's the brand name I never tried this brand before but they had a sale going on them so you know me with the sales I had to pick them up and I just look at this package in this [ __ ] package it looks fired I got pineapple Express and Clementine I said alright Clementine but you you know I mean and just look at that oil that [ __ ] looks fire so be on the lookout for these reviews but I've got put a little bit more in here that I meant to but [ __ ] it we'll take this little big chunk so this is gonna be a fat dab right here so I'm gonna take the staff show you guys those other clips like I just said and then I'm look do the final ratings [Music] that's a little bit hot again like his dad would be fat so if you guys are smoking along cheers I hope you guys always poking along hope you guys are smoking something dank and [Music] let's get this [ __ ] probably about to kill myself with this just kidding this is [ __ ] lightweight to me when I saw those dad challenges how long I have a video of me taking a [ __ ] seven grab dab on my Instagram if you guys want to see that go check it out but it's like a old video it does research for there yeah let's get this [Music] like super clean super smooth definitely gives you that lung expansion like if you don't that too often you're definitely gonna call like that like it they go you so I got iron lungs yeah I mean but fullness is Deb yes I want to sit his dad challenges I was talking about like Brown challenge videos like me taking a granddad or some [ __ ] like that down below in the comments so I'll do some [ __ ] like that too but that was a fat dab um I got these bright lights and they make it hard for the camera pick up the spokes in time so sometimes all the smoke shows up in the camera which kind of sucks both lucky um um let me show you those clips I was talking about so I can go that no audio that's fed into those [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and then we bummer that audio got messed up the taste I already gave it taste the rating so the hi I'm gonna give the high like a 4.7 out of five because it's a [ __ ] that stupid fire you know I mean like but there's just sex and THC out there that's like 99.1 percent so it was like compared to that it's not as good but for the price point that aside it's only 50 dollars a gram and when I got it it was a fall one get one free so I think we got a $25.00 a ground which is [ __ ] crazy like you can't beat that you'll if you ever see I'll do on the area you pick it up ready so the price point I give it a 4.5 out of 5 just cuz 50 bucks is a little bit pricey or ground liming for this this quality I don't know that's kind of like you maybe even like I'm gonna give it like a 4.8 4.9 out of 5 that's actually that's really not a bad price with teachers like this quality wife's you know what I mean so somewhere between like a 4.8 yeah see ya thought like a 4.8 out of 5 on the price point but the overall score for this way well it's like super close to a five honestly this is like my favorite like laughs I've had bottom so far I don't know this [ __ ] is just stupid [ __ ] fire if you ever tried it if I rich tried item nine lab just let me know down below in the comments what you thought of them if you haven't just be on the lookout for them definitely try them if you ever had the opportunity you won't regret it I promise besides for that there's a final reading like a four point seven four point eight or five shit's [ __ ] fired yeah if you want to see more videos like this I mean down below in the comments besides for that yep give the video a big thumbs up comment like subscribe do it that good [ __ ] you're do you know what to do you're on your peace", "-FJ5KryxThg": "octopod is revolutionizing plant growing by combining soil and hydroponic

for your grow room to get the\nbest growth and maximum yield so plants of course need adequate water and\nnutrients to grow healthily but photosynthesis which is the driver of\nthe plant growth it would be largely determined by the amount of light the\nplant receives the amount of co2 the plant receives and also the temperature\nof the environment which will determine the rate that the photosynthesis occurs\nthe data and the references that we're using in this guide are taken from a\nUniversity study published in 2008 by scientist Suman Chandra which are\nlaboratory studies carried out on a high potency strain of cannabis sativa where\nthey looked at the influence of different temperatures light intensity\nlevels in par and co2 levels and the effect on plant growth so let's look at\neach of these in turn so first we look at the level of light intensity that the\nplant is receiving and we're talking about photosynthesis of course we're\ngoing to be talking about light in terms of the horticultural reference which is\npar photosynthetically active radiation and at par levels up to 1500 micro moles\nper meter square per second you can increase growth rates however it's also\nshown that once you get past around seven or eight hundred micro moles per\nmeter square per second the rate of growth that you get is not really worth\nthe amount of extra light energy that you're having to input into the plant so\nit's generally accepted that around seven or eight hundred micro moles per\nmeter square per second is the best trade-off between getting maximum growth\nand not having to use too much energy to get that growth and all the heat and\neverything else that comes with it of course in this is for the flowering\nstage in the vegging stage you would aim to get about 50\nto those levels so somewhere in the region of about 300 350 micromoles per\nmeter square per second you can achieve this by getting your light fixture\nreducing the output from your light fixture using a dimmer if you're using a\nnumber of fixtures by having the number of fixtures you are using or by just\nraising it about one and a half to two times higher than its optimal hanging\nheight and this will reduce the intensity directly underneath the light\nand reduce the light intensity for the vegging stage the optimum temperature\nfor plant growth was tested at two different light levels and sort of a\nmedium of medium and power intensity level of 500 micro moles per second and\nthen a very high level of attires and micro moles per second in both instances\nthe maximum plant growth rate occurred at 30 degrees Celsius and fall off\nfalls off quite significantly where five degrees above or below this temperature\nof course all different strains are going to have have different\nrequirements and needs in terms of temperature our suggestion would be that\na safe band of temperature to operate in would be between 25 and 30 degrees\nCelsius and you should get optimum growth and minimize the risk of\nstressing your plants through to higher temperature finally we look at the\nimpact of different levels of co2 on Plank Road you can see the normal\natmospheric level of co2 is about 370 parts for a million this would be air\nthat you'd be taking into your grow room from the external environment ie fresh\nair if you are replacing that fresh air regularly the general guidance for\ncirculating air range of grow room would be about 60 changes per error and if\nyou're achieving this it's highly likely that you're maintaining that atmospheric\nlevel of co2 in your grow room difficulty with using this system so\ndrawing fresh air in and expelling it out into\nthe atmosphere is it's very hard to increase the co2 level because if you if\nyou input more co2 into the grow area it's only gonna get drawn out just as\nquickly and so it's almost impossible to artificially raise co2 levels there are\na couple of ways of doing it you can enclose the environment so that the air\nrecirculates back into the grow room or is recirculated around the grow room and\nyou use a co2 sensor and some form of adding co2 some technologies such as co2\nbags or burners or co2 tanks and you can use this to artificially elevate the co2\nlevel in your grow room another method you could use is to use effectively\nnatural and free sources so we all expel out co2 when we're breathing and\ntherefore in occupied buildings the co2 level is often raised as much as twice\nthe level of from the external atmosphere that this would be normal and\nso if you can take air into your grow room from an occupied building so a\nhouse or workplace you will most likely be bringing in elevated levels of co2\ninto your grow room which will increase the growth rate so I hope you have got\nsome useful information out of this guide if you have any questions or\nqueries please leave them in the comments below\nplease subscribe and take care", "sLC9bTjzzLY": "what's up what's up guys matt the mad botanist here thank you for joining me on mad botany tv so good to see you today we got a quick uh rosin press we're gonna do here because we're already down in the 36 chambers of the smash so we're gonna get right into it first though let's put some cannabinoids into our lungs shall we cheers i got some uh just the end of this um dulato cartridge the hybrid all j rhythm vape pure oil do lotto it's delicious toasty dough by gelato cheers guys wow much better much much better whoa good stuff falling over here anyways guys so as i said we're going to get right into it today we are pressing up some into calls see and you know what that is that's the banana og baby never fails so last time i pressed this same batch up we're riding at 28.53 which is about 29 we can round it up so i press the same batch up and it just dumped for us so uh usually we get a good yield i don't want to you know jinx it or whatever but i'm thinking we might have a good deal today so it'd probably be worth filming so first off we have our 37 micron bag prepared for bottle textile and that's just popping in those corners and i got my little business card so i can load her up so i'm gonna pack her up full this bud here let's take her out actually see what we got see what we're working with huh just some beautiful stuff nice big chunker right there so um i'm gonna break this down to basically its smallest segments pack it into the bag get it into a nice cylinder and uh cut the top off and then we'll get it ready and have it going into the press so i'm gonna prep them got my parchment paper all set to go right here bottom folded how i like it just to make a little trough is what i do so we'll be back with you in a minute thanks guys thanks for joining me so happy to be here with you guys and i got a little surprise surprise to show you at the end so stay tuned okay guys we got our parchment paper set up we got our rosin ink 37 micron bag packed up and ready to go to a little cylinder all right i'm gonna put it right in the center just like we always do and get ready to squash this [ __ ] top fold is going in first so your top fold goes right in that way you don't unfold the top of your bag when you're inserting it into your plates there we go make sure there's no bee bumps very good give yourself some room for the material to expand you don't want to be right at the edge guys you want to give it about a quarter inch or so to uh expand and make sure that there's room for the material to move and flatten out i want to make sure i get any little specks off the parchment paper got it there was a little speck of weed every once in a while you might have a little crumb of bud stuck to your the outside of your bag and you want to make sure you get that off of there all right so we're about ready to do our pre-swish make sure your material is centered right with the arm of your bottle jack we're ready to go all right gonna go in really slow give it a release this is our pre-squish i like to do this give the bag us a chance to reset itself stay centered and i also like to get the trichomes nice and liquidy and get the heat through all the material do it release it one more time here it's a nice slow release slowly put the pressure back in adding a little more each time this will prevent blowouts while also getting the heat through all the material there's our final release now we're going to go all the way in and start our timer add a little pressure here not quite closed but we're just about closed right now add just a little bit of pressure slowly i think we're completely closed captioning not hopefully we'll available a little more i'll bring you in close real quick see if you can see anything yep right there as you can see we're starting to seep out of the front there with some golden nectar i'm going to add a little bit of pressure because we're through our first minute all right some beautiful material banana og always results in some gorgeous very light colored rosin and it's one of my all-time favorite strains let's bring it back here got a little less than two minutes pressing at 180 degrees as usual that's my sweet spot guys i always pretty much most of the time we'll press there because that's where i like the texture that's why i like everything about it it's how i have it dialed in i know how long to press at that temperature if you're pressing at a higher temperature you're gonna probably shorten well not probably you're definitely gonna shorten up your press about a minute and a half left and uh guys i'll count down at the end when our press alarm is about to go off so just be leery i'll get it off quickly but it's going to be coming there'll be a loud beep check if we need to add anything we're at our last minute just add a little bit of pressure here bring in close for your last close up here some gorgeous stuff pressing a little less than an eighth today about three grams or so so hopefully we get a nice yield 20 seconds guys probably gonna let it go a little bit longer all right nine five seconds guys four three two one alarm i'm gonna let it go for just a little bit longer but we're going to take the magnet down get ready to bring this over to our cold plates so i'm going to open up the plates take this out put it right to our cold plates and then we'll show you guys what we got here we go open it up put it on our cold plates and then we'll flip you guys around guys here we go let's see what we got look at that beautiful yield we're gonna get this in the freezer for a few minutes and then we'll collect it see you guys in a few all right babies we're gonna collect this stuff up let's do it sometimes you're just gonna have to scrape a little bit but i suggest stick and pull method when you're collecting this if you can help it like this kind of just mess it together by sometimes sometimes you just have no choice but to scrape a little bit but if you can get bigger chunks you can kind of get it to clump to itself like that right there a nice big chunk came off oh yeah we're gonna collect this into one big pile um i'm gonna have to collect it into section like i'm gonna have to get a section put it on this piece of paper here that i have and um just mask it into a pile and then we'll press it into a coin so uh we'll be back with you in a second and we'll show you our uh pressing of the coin so uh i'm gonna keep collecting just like you see me doing here and i'll get back with you all right guys got my trusty eye dab rosin stamp shaped like what an erlenmeyer flask all right so we're gonna stomp this down into a coin you can see i got my rosin gathered into a pile i'm gonna put this clean sheet over the top and just go around and into the center lightly and slowly doing this to homogenize it to make it into a workable coin where we can dab and cut pieces off of it and just to get into the jar a lot easier too but the biggest thing is to homogenize your product at the end of it there's a few ways to do it but like i said when you're only dealing with a small amount pressing into a coin is a good way to go about it and get a decent result other ways to uh do your uh taffy pull method where you twist it up and back into itself over and over again another way is to whip it which is uh put it in the jar and stir it around but when you only have a small amount it's kind of hard to do those methods draw my circle twist it back and forth and we should have a nice little patty right here of rosin all right so now i'm gonna take this as you can see there's a patty in there we're going to fold the edges up and put this in the freezer this is going to start the cold cure but after we had in the have it in the freezer for about 10 minutes we're gonna take it out put it into a jar and then officially start the cold cure in the refrigerator inside a with the jar slipped inside of a micron screen bag all right guys i'm gonna put this in the freezer we'll see in a second all right guys so you can see i got my jar filled up with a micron screen bag slipped over the top to protect it keep any debris from getting into it we're going to bring it over to the fridge and start this cold pure career process and then we'll have a nice little smoke sesh so i'll get back with you in a few what up what up we're back guys we're ready for a freaking smoke session sorry i had to go to sleep last night this is the next day so i'm wearing different clothes but let's give you a peek at the rosin that we're about to dig into i've already done quite a number but as you can see i've been uh digging around in this jar already quite a bit but it's some gorgeous stuff it smells unbelievable guys this banana og just always presses out into the finest rosin so let's get a dab going shall we i got something really special to show you let me get my my shades off here we're watching a little of one of my favorite shows from back when i was a kid eerie indiana i don't know if you guys ever heard of it it's pretty old school but this show is like the x-files of it's like the chat uh my childhood x-files but really x-files is from my childhood as well they're from the same era but i love your indiana i'll show you the case again first off oh i want to show you this too check this out at that pop i don't know if he it's not showing up as well on camera as it does when i'm what i'm looking at but look at that glow is just gorgeous [Music] so yeah that's nova for you guys really pops awesome in the in the black light aguazole is the shaft color of this pencil let's get to the dab and here is eerie indiana [Music] i don't know if you guys remember this show he's wearing his giant sweatshirt right there you're indiana classic from the 90s all right guys you ready for this we're going to start our heating heater up let's see what setting she's on she's on the peak setting i don't know if you guys can even see down in there it's too dark sorry guys let's heat her up and then i'm going to show you something real special right now drumroll please [Music] here she is guys from windstar glass blue cheese carb cap with hieroglyphics it's got the ankh the eye of raw let's dab she's just starting to melt i'm gonna wait for it to vibrate i usually hit it right before perfect function this carb cap is [ __ ] incredible guys look at it absolutely amazing and i don't know if you guys be able to see it but well you can you can kind of see it she signed it right there w star 2020 that's how she signs her stuff one star she really killed it guys she actually like cosmically read my mind and put these stripes in of agua azul which matches this pencil perfectly see that she added those in without even knowing and i wanted them in there i didn't even tell her that she just did it without even knowing and she had just a little bit of blue cheese left to match this kj custom attachment perfectly i made a perfectly clean beautiful carb cap from my peak with just gorgeous drawing on it she is the master of stringer tech i mean i i love i love her work she's just amazing she's an amazing artist if you guys haven't checked her out yet go check her out at windstar glass you'll see your name up on the screen shayla shayla thank you so much babe you are amazing your talent is just out of this world and i will always admire it so thanks girl prime function guys you saw here so glad to be here and having a smoke session with you i gotta q-tip this [ __ ] out she hangs right off perfectly doesn't hit the ground at all it's the perfect um size for this for the peak so see that doesn't hit the ground or anything you're setting it on it's perfect she killed

each other you", "0UoqqZe8GJA": "[Music] hey guys how's it going today we're going to be starting a new video series I'm gonna be inoculating three pounds of rye berries that I'm eventually going to be spawning into a bulk mono tub I'll be coming out with videos probably weekly just giving you updates and showing you different things that I'm doing along the way and this will be a nice series that you can just follow along too from start to finish all right just to show you I'm actually not going to be showing you how i sterilize and prep grains I'm gonna be using these pre-sterilized one-pound rye berry bags that I purchased online these were from outgrow calm I think they're like six dollars apiece so it's actually not that expensive and they're really good for new growers that don't have a pressure cooker or anything like that yet so let's get to it [Music] alright guys getting started you just want to make sure that you have a very clean work environment so just take some rubbing alcohol some paper towels wipe down your counters I've done your bottles your lighter everything that you're going to be using make sure that you scrub your hands and arms with antibacterial soap always Perel and put some gloves on I have my gloves on I'm just gonna put a little Purell and talk [Music] and I'm gonna take a paper towel and just get a little bit of rubbing alcohol on it and just wipe down some of our tools and surfaces so for these bags you just want to make sure that you're gonna break up your grains or you broke these up a little bit they're gonna have a little micropore tape right here and that's where we're gonna be sticking our needle and then it has our guest is change up here so just take your rubbing alcohol you just kind of clean all around the bag especially where we're gonna bring the needle and I just gonna wipe it all down and for our spores we're gonna be using some Danny DeVito penis envy this is actually a liquid culture syringe instead of a multi-sports syringe so we should be able to get a little faster colonization you're gonna see it in there I'll go ahead and just kind of shake that up get all that stuff moving around in there [Music] I'm just gonna wipe down our syringe [Music] I'm going to put about one and a half cc's inside of this bag and I'm going to try to spread it out a little bit all right I'm going to remove our tip all right take your lighter and we're just gonna get it nice and hot try to keep it towards the blue flame just to keep the soot off [Music] all right just let that cool for a second [Music] one thing with these bags that are a little trickier than the jars just going to make sure that you go in really easy is you don't want to push it all the way through and then stab a hole in the back of the bag so we're just gonna take napkin wipe off our tip with some rubbing alcohol and we're gonna go in really easy and make sure before you do this I have some just clear packing tape handy because as soon as we get done we're gonna put clear tape just right over that hole so it's closed up so just go just gonna spread it around there there [Music] okay I'm just gonna take the napkin with a little rubbing alcohol on it I'm gonna hold it at the tip and pull the needle out I'm gonna take tape just back cover up that hole and then micropore tape okay and I'm just going to jostle it around a little bit with spores mix up I'm gonna label it I'm gonna put it on the shelf I just leave these normal colonizing temperatures I usually keep them around 68 74 degrees I don't keep them super warm some people do I just don't want to run a heater or anything separate so I'll do the other two bags in them I'll show you when we're all done all right guys all three bags are done I have um dated labeled and what I do is I taped the top of the bag to the wall so they get gas exchange coming out of their little vents so for the next videos I'll keep showing you guys updates autumn whenever they start to colonize and I still need to make my mono tub and I need to bake some bolts up straight and I'll show you guys everything that I do along the way for more daily updates you can always see that on Instagram I'll keep posting photos of this stuff as well also subscribe if you haven't already but thanks guys till next time", "3NtJ0qAyDhQ": "you are still in my mind the truth is so hard to find with all the things that's going on i lost track i felt so strong [Music] i've got you on my mind but something's been done [Music] sometimes i've been thinking of memory [Music] it's [Music] you better hold me down sometimes i've been thinking i'm dreaming [Music] is you", "M4HruXh5kyc": "all right chuck finley here another edition of fresh nuggets i'm gonna call these videos so you know we talked about earlier uh blueberry muffin strain jam sequoia uh grown by me truck finley you know very good strain i showed it to you as well um covered in trichomes pretty good starting with your overall now some people use a dab tool to collect it i find sometimes the best way with fresh consistency buttery rosin is a knife and again i got my chilling plate here as well and then dabs really want to stick on to themselves you know that's another good quality they have as you see here and you really want to make sure your chilling plate is cold you know that's super important as you can see here the tip of the the tip of the knife comes super in handy i'm collecting it and also the flat edge in my opinion it's similar to like when you used to shave or get a shave back in the day the olden days of the fresh night it really helps you collect it almost like how you're shaving over the hair you're shaving away the dabs off of that parchment paper you gotta keep spinning it as well you want to be careful not to rip the paper you know as you see i ripped the paper earlier but i wanted to you know do that to show you i didn't do it on purpose i wanted to leave it in the video um show you that mistakes happen you know not everyone's perfect you want to do the best job you can um so again that goes back to patience as a virtue um patience is not usually a thing that i'm too good at but uh you know it helps with that all you smokers out there know what i'm talking about but the idea is to get it out of here and um 95 off and you know the hotter you do your temperature the more it's going to be like a shadowy consistency you'll have a much easier time getting it off as well this here is more like a buttery consistency you know and i'm going to move on to the next one again you'll keep turning it be careful not to rip it [Music] so still working here you know again rosin is not an easy job but uh you know overall it's some of the best quality of smoke period on to the next side here on this one still going you know i apologize for the view but uh one man show and rip that purposely now so i can get a good layout and make sure it's cold i'm gonna put this in the freezer real quick this is another technique you can use um i'll be back for another video later", "6U4Rt4DJb4w": "i don't bro this up production we were cuz right now bro hey we're about to smoke uh like the the wax inside of the blind right now real [ __ ] y'all just stay tuned bro y'all just kicking you on the background smoke some let's get it yeah yeah cuz like on the outskirts or some [ __ ]

__ ] cause of my brother's [ __ ] tent and he has [ __ ] oh no i'm talking about behind us guys hey this one just wish i was smoking hey cause we're smoking i still like the strain bro yeah you can't even see it oh flesh lighter hold on it's called uh california orange that's the wax bro and it's like yeah yeah all right matter of fact let's get this [ __ ] started right now but like what is your thoughts bro on that [ __ ] because like all right they started off like the the meeting as in like they were telling like the us were like why chose tone and watch what y'all saying what [ __ ] they started off like that cuz like it's on live tv bro but like them [ __ ] bro they you know how oh we're like right now they're trying to take um over taiwan you know like taiwan so like a lot of [ __ ] bro like in taiwan it's like another [Music] it's not i'm not racist but like you know how like there's chinese brothers chinese japans you know what i mean they're like different kinds of chinese people taiwan is a whole nother type of chinese people you know asians yeah asians so like right now brother trying to take um they're trying to invade that that little city thing real [ __ ] and the thing is brother if they if they invade um taiwan the u.s it's by law that they need to like go and um take care of them hey that's it bro look these hoes y'all let me know down below right now yeah hell yeah shall i be chipping this [ __ ] below key we're gonna do the world is crazy that's all i'm saying but like y'all see these right here bro them hoes it's like because barely got them ones right now comment down below if you have ever seen them if you're in california if what are the kinds of like skeetu edibles they are over there where you get that at so like honestly bro i think these hoes came from a possum or some [ __ ] yeah but like the thing about it is the um they said they're coming cali you know i mean like the original place they're coming from is california but them hoes yeah they're from apostle but yeah hell yeah girls like this [ __ ] like and what i noticed brother them [ __ ] since the it caught like you know how we lost a lot of money and [ __ ] like that like the economy it went like broke them [ __ ] took advantage of that [ __ ] and started buying companies bro a lot of china yeah a lot of the companies that when i bailed well you owe them a shitload of money [ __ ] in the u.s is your procedure charging no it's on 12. but yeah like as soon as that [ __ ] happened bro they took advantage and i started buying a lot of different companies bro you know tick tocks from uh i think and the craziest [ __ ] is bro that like there is not a lot of [ __ ] that uh americans did you know as in like products i was in phones bro like i think samsung samsung is like american right you know but i know that iphones ain't because they want to know china on the bank they'll probably [ __ ] uh agree with this bill gates is trying to earn humanity what like he's trying to end humanity yeah well not in humanity but like in the ones that like trying to control public population um that's what china's doing because i swear to god bro but bill gates is trying to do it here they say that the supposedly the snowstorm that texas had was uh created by bill gates or like the government supposedly i don't know and you're saying that like why you saying that like what are the little reasons you know because uh bill gates put it on twitter that like he had put something on twitter about humanity and controlling me or something like that back in like 2012 or 2011 i think it was yeah i'm not sure what it was they had already built a climate control machine learning where they can make clouds that can rain they can snow they can cause tomatoes [ __ ] hurricanes all kinds of [ __ ] have you been like you know how the chemtrails you know like chemtrails and [ __ ] so the things on the sky bro like the white smoke that the airplanes leave so like a lot of people say that but like why is he okay i seen someone some of them are black bro some leave a black mark that's the ones i believe is the castle you know i don't know because i'll be seeing the white one bro like they leave a white mark and then over time they expand explained it you know i think it takes up her it was a video he said that they they release gas so they can land safely because they take off with so much weight and then whenever they're gonna land they can't land with that much weight because the plane will like they'll just go straight down like nose nose first so is that too much light you think i mean i'm not i mean yeah we they can see our place for sure like that oh here's some [ __ ] what do y'all think about bill gates yeah bro could look you know like um davinci bro what's his name the dude that um created the mona lisa you know can you search up his democracy so i can set out correctly well like him bro he made the mona lisa bro and that was one of them right but if you look in the mona lisa it's the mona lisa in the middle and it's the water going like this and then the other side is higher da vinci thank you bro thank you to francisco thank you but yeah bro like leonardo da vinci bro so like not just he didn't just make that one that's a very famous artwork right so like that's famous because of that [ __ ] because of what is on there bro like dude i just seen that badass not bad i'm always interrupting and then like oh so there's that one bro and there's also like hey we just uh shut off the license [ __ ] this is like there's people around here but like what's it called um there's another picture bro and this other picture is um matter of fact it's a book bro is that the davinci code bro yes the da vinci codes because that's gonna be on the book in the book you know who bought the book bro in 1995 bill gates for 30 30 million dollars bro go search that [ __ ] up 30 million dollars or 35 million dollars cuz

it was like now that i have seen like different strains bro that strain it was like what how what would you rate that like shelf wise because i don't know i have a high tolerance so i tell you the one i liked was the kim jong kim dog oh i had like three different kim dogs bro they all been gasps bro man the one right here that one and then it was the one um what's it called after that in colorado
